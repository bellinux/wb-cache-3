5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> the case.|$|E
5|$|Guttate {{psoriasis}} {{is characterized}} by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous spots of psoriasis appear over {{large areas of the}} body, primarily the trunk, but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is often triggered by a streptococcal infection, typically streptococcal pharyngitis. The <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> not true.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, a {{separate}} <b>reverse</b> <b>was</b> {{created for the}} Ulster Special Constabulary. [...] The only difference was in the inscription which read in seven lines: FOR / FAITHFUL / SERVICE / IN THE / ULSTER / SPECIAL / CONSTABULARY. In 1982, the <b>reverse</b> <b>was</b> modified again to recognize service in the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve.|$|R
5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> true of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|The Callistoan {{surface is}} asymmetric: the leading {{hemisphere}} is {{darker than the}} trailing one. This is different from other Galilean satellites, where the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> true. The trailing hemisphere of Callisto appears to be enriched in carbon dioxide, whereas the leading hemisphere has more sulfur dioxide. and SO2 on the Surface of Callisto|year=1998|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/1908.pdf|page=1908|format=PDF}} Many fresh impact craters like Lofn also show enrichment in carbon dioxide. Overall, the chemical composition of the surface, especially in the dark areas, may be close to that seen on D-type asteroids, whose surfaces are made of carbonaceous material.|$|E
5|$|The Turin {{panel has}} {{suffered}} heavy overpainting and cracking along the vertical join. The marbleized reddish-brown paint on its <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> heavily worn. In the 20th century the panel underwent three restorations and extensive technical analyses. The earliest, in 1952, removed overpainting and repaired pigment loss to Francis's tonsure, Leo's cowl {{and areas of}} vegetation between the two figures. Restorers discovered an irretrievably lost inscription on a rock adjacent to the seraph-Christ, and evidence of earlier overpainting of one of Leo's feet. Continued paint loss and cracking along the join required further restoration in 1970, when a fixing agent was applied to prevent cracking, and Francis's tonsure was repainted.|$|E

5|$|The badges for inductees are of {{a similar}} design to the sovereign's badge, though without {{precious}} stones, and slight differences for each grade. For Companions, the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the central disk; for Officers, it is gilt with a gold maple leaf; and for Members, both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver. All are topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign, and the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> plain except for the word CANADA.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of the committees are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> {{the case for the}} references committees. Because the chair has a casting vote {{in the event of a}} committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E
5|$|The pennies of King William IV (18301837) {{are similar}} to those of his predecessor, also being {{engraved}} by William Wyon, based on a model by Sir Francis Chantrey. King William's head faces right, with the obverse inscribed GULIELMUS IIII DEI GRATIA, while the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> identical to the George IV penny. Pennies were minted in 1831, 1834 and 1837. An 1836 penny has been reported but not confirmed.|$|E

5|$|The reverse has at centre equestrian figures {{meant to}} be Wellington and Blücher, with Victory between them, guiding them to battle. They are in the Grecian style, similar to Pistrucci's earlier St George and the Dragon design for the {{sovereign}} coin. At {{the top of the}} <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> Jupiter. Taking {{up the rest of the}} circumference of the medal are 19 figures of giants whom Jupiter has struck down; they are the defeated enemy and number one for every year of the war.|$|E
5|$|The wreath on the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> also derivative, {{having been}} {{previously}} used on Longacre's Type II gold dollar of 1854, and the three-dollar {{piece of the}} same year. It is composed of leaves of wheat, corn, cotton and tobacco, thus including produce associated with both the North and the South. The cotton leaves are sometimes said to be maple leaves; the two types are not dissimilar, and maple leaves are more widely known than cotton leaves. An ear of corn is also visible.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, {{but in the case}} of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E

5|$|The typical contact {{call of the}} {{goldcrest}} is a thin, high-pitched zee {{given at}} intervals of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough {{than that of the}} firecrest. The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee. The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
5|$|Lions tend to {{dominate}} smaller felids such as African cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah {{in particular has}} a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, accounting for up to 78.2% of predator-killed juveniles in one study. Cheetahs avoid their competitors using different temporal (time) and spatial (habitat) niches. Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills. Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs, not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, {{there are a few}} reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. African lions may also conflict with Nile crocodiles. Depending {{on the size of the}} crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, while the <b>reverse</b> <b>is</b> true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.|$|E
