5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had <b>read</b> <b>into</b> his enemy’s intentions and directed powerful forces to support Marmont.|$|E

But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to <b>read</b> <b>into</b> the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact that incorporating <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> writing can have on University paragraph level EFL writing of 54 second-year English major students at Naresuan University, Thailand, and what these EFL learners think about being taught by a <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> writing method. Intensive reading tasks are incorporated into a paragraph-writing classroom. The changes in students' written performance in terms of grammatical accuracy, grammatical complexity, and coherence and cohesion are examined. The study compared two groups of learners in which one instruction for one group was taught by an incorporated <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> writing activities (i. e. the "experimental" group), and the other group was taught without these activities (i. e. the "control" group). The research comprises both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The written texts produced by both groups obtained from a pre-test and post-test are analyzed and compared {{to see whether or}} not there is any significant difference between these two groups in changes in grammatical accuracy, grammatical complexity, and coherence and cohesion. Questionnaire responses and interview data are analyzed and compared to elicit these EFL writers' opinions about being taught by this <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> writing method in comparison to a group taught without this approach. Analysis of the data indicates the positive impact that reading can have on paragraph- writing development, particularly in the area of grammatical complexity. In addition, these EFL learners reported that they found this <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> writing approach helpful in improving their paragraph writing ability. These findings highlight the benefits of paragraph-writing instruction in such a context and may help writing teachers to recognize the importance of reading tasks for EFL writing classrooms in university contexts.

25|$|In the composition, Metzinger depicts motion, not of {{the subject}} matter as the Futurists {{relative}} to the observer, but by successive superimposed images captured by the artist in motion relative to (or around) the subject matter.

25|$|George {{was opposed}} to tariffs, which were at the time both the major method of {{protectionist}} trade policy and {{an important source of}} federal revenue (the federal income tax having not yet been introduced). He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power. Later in his life, free trade became a major issue in federal politics and his book Protection or Free Trade was <b>read</b> <b>into</b> the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Charter {{has little}} to say, {{explicitly}} at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be <b>read</b> <b>into</b> section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant. The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment. Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|Taner Edis, {{author of}} An Illusion of Harmony: Science and Religion in Islam, {{describes}} this point. He argues that Muslims {{are more likely}} to view the Quran as the direct word of God, and so it must be reconciled with their growing respect for science and technology. Edis suggests that Muslims often {{have a vested interest in}} finding passages whose interpretation can be stretched to describe modern understanding. He warns that <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> books like this can be misleading, since the method can be used to support any number of contradictory facts. Russel Glasser (a Skeptic from The Atheist Experience TV show with Matt Dillahunty and Jeff Dee) likewise suggests that <b>reading</b> <b>into</b> the Quran like this amounts to cherry picking and risks simply confirming the biases of the investigator.|$|R

25|$|The Chronophotography of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey had a {{profound}} influence on the beginnings of Cubism and Futurism.

25|$|Gorrell was {{immediately}} {{assigned by the}} Army to assist Director of War Plans and Menoher Board member Maj. Gen. William G.

Gorrell's appearance in August 1919 with Patrick before the Frear Committee while still a member of the advisory board, to refute erroneous and polemic allegations made during earlier testimony, was well-remarked, but his second round of testimony on October 27, 1919, in which he returned to <b>read</b> <b>into</b> the record the just-issued report of the Menoher Board, is largely overlooked.

25|$|So {{prominent}} was Hill on the issue, that in 1969 President Lyndon B. Johnson {{appointed him}} to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Father Hill and another clergyman on the Commission, Dr. Winfrey C.

The majority report was widely criticized and rejected by Congress. The Senate rejected the Commission's findings and recommendations by a 60–5 vote, with 34 abstentions. President Nixon, who had succeeded Johnson in 1969, also emphatically rejected the majority report. The Hill-Link Minority Report, on the other hand, which recommended maintaining anti-obscenity statutes, was <b>read</b> <b>into</b> the record of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.
