The four F 1 hybrid combinations generated using Daba, Jata and Raily tasar ecoraces of seed crop rearing season (July-August) were evaluated during commercial crop season of 2007 and 2008 for the influence of hybridization as positive heterosis in the traits of economically important <b>silk</b> productivity and <b>filament</b> denier. The F 1 hybrid, Daba x Jata has recorded positive heterosis in single shell weight (+ 25. 6 %), total silk yield (+ 79. 0 %) and <b>silk</b> <b>filament</b> length (+ 68. 1 %), but for <b>silk</b> <b>filament</b> of high denier (11. 98 d) followed by its reciprocal hybrid, JataxDaba in shell weight (+ 18. 8 %), silk yield (+ 68. 1 %), filament length (+ 63. 8 %) and filament of highest denier (12. 32 d).

40|$|Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> {{was never}} {{renowned for its}} high quality, yet it {{attracted}} {{the interest of the}} European trading companies from the seventeenth century. This thesis explores the English East India Company’s silk manufacturing activities in Bengal and the Company’s trade in Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. The Company’s interest in Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was driven both by economic and political factors – profit maximization and mercantilist ideas about governance. The English East India Company considered Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> to be an item with potential high returns as the British silk weaving industry required supplies of raw material unavailable domestically. However, the quality of the Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was low and it could not be easily used in British weaving. Britain thus relied on the importation of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> from Italy, Turkey and the Mediterranean region. The English East India Company saw an opportunity to replace these supplies with silk imported from Bengal. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> produced in Bengal, the Company decided to adopt the Piedmontese system of silk reeling – the most advanced reeling system in Europe. The thesis shows that this new system of reeling was profitable. Yet, the quality of the Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> did not improve as much as expected: a large part of the silk produced was of substandard quality. My thesis argues that the primary reason why substandard <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was produced was the inadequate institutional framework of production which facilitated principal-agent problems...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} black-colored silks from southeastern Asia {{that are}} {{often referred to as}} “gummed” silks. These silks are treated with iron-rich mud that coats the <b>silk</b> <b>filaments</b> and creates a deep black color (often in conjunction with a previous coloration). The report covers three areas. Firstly, I review various names used for black mud-treated silks and begin to contextualize the production and use region. Two mud-treated silk samples from early- 1930 s Southeast Asia are introduced in this discussion. Secondly, I initiate investigation into the role of mud-treated black silks in Chinese fashion history during the transition from the late-imperial era to twentieth-century modernity. Thirdly, the use of mud-treated silks in twenty-first-century fashion is highlighted. Context of Mud-Treated Silks “Gummed silk” is apparently a common euphemism for a variety of mud-treated or mud-coated silks. In the context of Asian black silks, gummed is not a reference to the <b>raw</b> state of <b>silk</b> <b>filaments,</b> but rather a general name for shiny black silk fabrics coated with tannin-rich mud. Jiāo-chou and xiang-yun-shā are the names most often employed in China to refer to slightly stiff bi-colored silks that are brownish-orange on one side and black on the other. Fashion designers, manufacturers, retailers, and authorities on textiles employ several other names for these bi-colored and other solid black mud-treated silks. For example, contemporary fashion designer Luiang Zi calls the bi-colored silks Liangchou. Other names for mud-treated silks include Canton silk, gambiered silk, Guangdong silk, lacquered silk, liang silk, Tang silk, and tea silk. The array of names suggests both a variety of southeastern Chinese and Southeast Asian ethnic groups making and using various mud-treated silk fabrics, and the imprecision in translating the names into English. To further confound clarity in researching or discussing these fabrics, codification of particular mud-treated silk textiles and their specific techniques and characteristics remains to be accomplished. Thus, to simplify terminology at this time, I employ the descriptive adjectives gummed (already widely applied) or mud-treated, as noted above) when referring to textiles from this broad category. For the bi-colored mud-treated silks from southeast China, I use jiāo-chou and xiang-yun-shā for plain and crepe weaves, and leno-weave, respectively...|$|R
