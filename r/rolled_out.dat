5000|$|The {{cartridge}} and {{elastic rubber}} protrusion type detents are primarily used for open bolt markers, or on closed bolt markers to prevent double feeding (feeding {{more than one}} ball when the bolt is open for loading). Closed bolt markers generally use the constriction method to prevent [...] "roll outs". A <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> is a frustrating malfunction where the ball completely <b>rolls</b> <b>out</b> of the barrel, causing no paintball to be fired when the trigger is pulled. A partial <b>roll</b> <b>out</b> is when the ball rolls partially through the barrel, causing reduced velocity.|$|R

5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball <b>rolled</b> <b>out</b> of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

The scheme began with a trial on a single tram – number 3054 – connected to the FreeBeeMcr broadband network {{with the intention of}} rolling it out across the whole Metrolink network by Spring 2015.

5|$|The Arrow was the {{culmination}} of a series of design studies begun in 1953 examining improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. I, RL-201, was <b>rolled</b> <b>out</b> to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.|$|E
