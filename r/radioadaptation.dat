40|$|Most {{administered}} pharmaceuticals are metabolized by the liver. The {{health of}} the liver, especially the rate of its metabolic enzymes, determines the concentration of circulating drugs {{as well as the}} duration of their efficacy. Most pharmaceuticals are metabolized by the liver, and clinically-used medication doses are given with normal liver function in mind. A drug overdose can result {{in the case of a}} liver that is damaged and removing pharmaceuticals from the circulation at a rate slower than normal. Alternatively, if liver function is elevated and removing drugs from the system more quickly than usual, it would be as if too little drug had been given for effective treatment. Because of the importance of the liver in drug metabolism, we want to understand the effects of spaceflight on the enzymes of the liver and exposure to cosmic radiation is one aspect of spaceflight that can be modeled in ground experiments. Additionally, it has been previous noted that pre-exposure to small radiation doses seems to confer protection against later and larger radiation doses. This protective power of pre-exposure has been called a priming effect or <b>radioadaptation.</b> This study is an effort to examine the drug metabolizing effects of <b>radioadaptation</b> mechanisms that may be triggered by early exposure to low radiation doses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Results of radioecological {{investigations}} of rodents having different ecological specialization – wood and field mice, northern red-backed voles and mole-voles to acute (laboratory experiment) and chronic (long-term inhabiting the East Ural Radioactive Trace – EURT) irradiation are summarized. These species are greatly distinguished by {{a way of}} life, a migratory activity, an average life span etc. Numerous immunological, hematological and cytogenetical disturbances were found in more radioresistant wood and field mice and northern red-backed voles inhabiting the EURT zone (density of soil pollution by 90 Sr − 18. 5 MBq/m 2 = 500 Ci/km 2) {{as compared with the}} reference samples. On the contrary there were no pathological shifts in more radiosensitive mole-voles from the more radioactively contaminated site (90 Sr − 37 MBq/m 2 = 1000 Ci/km 2). The absorbed dozes during the life for the mole-voles from the EURT zone were significantly higher (in 30 times) than these ones for mice and voles. These data testify about the possibility of <b>radioadaptation</b> in a series of generations in mole-voles that developed due to their ecophysiological features and isolation of settlement in the radiocontaminated zone. Mice and voles form a flowing population and slip off the prolonged influence of a damaging factor, this circumstance prevents the development of <b>radioadaptation.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The term ‘‘bystander effect’ ’ {{is used to}} {{describe}} an effect in which cells {{that have not been}} exposed to radiation are affected by irradiated cells though various intracellular signaling mechanisms. In this study we analyzed the kinetics and mechanisms of bystander effect and <b>radioadaptation</b> in embryonic zebrafish cells (ZF 4) exposed to chronic low dose of gamma rays. ZF 4 cells were irradiated for 4 hours with total doses of gamma irradiation ranging from 0. 01 – 0. 1 Gy. In two experimental conditions, the transfer of irradiated cells or culture medium from irradiated cells results in the occurrence of DNA double strand breaks in non-irradiated cells (assessed by the number of c-H 2 AX foci) that are repaired at 24 hours post-irradiation whatever the dose. At low total irradiation doses the bystander effect observed does not affect DNA repair mechanisms in targeted and bystander cells. An increase in global methylation of ZF 4 cells was observed in irradiated cells and bystander cells compared to control cells. We observed that pre-irradiated cells which are then irradiated for a second time with the same doses contained significantly less c-H 2 AX foci than in 24 h gamma-irradiated control cells. We also showed that bystander cells that have been in contact with the pre-irradiated cells and then irradiated alone present less c-H 2 AX foci compared to the control cells. This <b>radioadaptation</b> effect is significantly more pronounced at the highest doses. To determine the factors involved in the early events of the bystander effect, we performed an extensive comparative proteomic study of the ZF 4 secretomes upon irradiation.

40|$|The radioadaptive {{response}} {{is a phenomenon}} where exposure to a prior low dose of radiation reduces the level of damage induced by a subsequent high radiation dose. The molecular mechanism behind this is still not well understood. Learning more about the radioadaptive {{response is}} critical for long duration spaceflight since astronauts are exposed to low levels of cosmic radiation. The micronucleus assay {{was used to measure}} the level of damage caused by radiation. Although cells which were not washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after a low priming dose of 5 cGy did not show adaptation to the challenge dose, washing the cells with PBS and giving the cells fresh media after the low dose did allow <b>radioadaptation</b> to occur. This is consistent with the results of a previous publication by another research group. In the present study, genes involved in DNA damage signaling and the oxidative stress response were studied using RT PCR techniques in order to look at changes in expression level after the low dose with or without washing. Our preliminary results indicate that upregulation of oxidative stress response genes ANGPTL 7, NCF 2, TTN, and SRXN 1 may be involved in the radioadaptive response. The low dose of radiation alone was found to activate the oxidative stress response genes GPR 156 and MTL 5, whereas, washing the cells alone caused relatively robust upregulation of the oxidative stress response genes DUSP 1 and PTGS 2. Washing after the priming dose showed some changes in the expression level of several DNA damage signaling genes. In addition, we studied whether washing the cells after the priming dose has an effect on the level of nitric oxide in both the media and cells, since nitric oxide levels are known to increase in the media of the cells after a high dose of radiation only if the cells were already exposed to a low priming dose. Based on this preliminary study, we propose that washing the cells after priming exposure actually eliminates some factor secreted by the cells that inhibits <b>radioadaptation</b> leading to the upregulation of some genes which initiates the response...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a computational stochastic model of virtual cells irradiation, based on Quasi-Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and using biophysical input. The model {{is based on}} a stochastic tree of probabilities for each cell of the entire colony. Biophysics of the cells is described by probabilities and probability distributions provided as the input. The adaptation of nucleation and catastrophe theories, well known in physics, yields sigmoidal relationships for carcinogenic risk {{as a function of the}} irradiation. Adaptive response and bystander effect, incorporated into the model, improves its application. The results show that behavior of virtual cells can be successfully modeled, e. g. cancer transformation, creation of mutations, <b>radioadaptation</b> or radiotherapy. The used methodology makes the model universal and practical for simulations of general processes. Potential biophysical curves and relationships are also widely discussed in the paper. However, the presented theoretical model does not describe the real cells and tissues. Also the exposure geometry (e. g., uniform or non-uniform exposure), type of radiation (e. g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, heavy ions, etc.) as well as microdosimetry are not presently addressed. The model is focused mainly on creation of general and maximal wide mathematical description of irradiated hypothetical cells treated as complex physical systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of studies it was shown that 1, 4 -dihydropyridine {{derivatives}} (1, 4 -DHP) show antimutagenic and anticlastogenic properties and accelerate repair of oxidant and ionising radiation generated DNA damage. Here, effects of one of 1, 4 -DHP compounds (sodium 3, 5 -bis-ethoxycarbonyl- 2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -dihydropyridine- 4 -carboxylate denoted as DHP) in X-irradiated L 5178 Y cells (murine lymphoma sublines, LY-R and LY-S) are reported. DHP treatment 1 h before, during and after X-irradiation gave a radioprotective effect in double strand break (DSB) repair competent LY-R cells: there was an increase in post-irradiation proliferation and cell viability as well as a slight acceleration of break rejoining as measured by the neutral comet assay. In the radiosensitive LY-S cells with impaired non-homologous end-joining system, the radioprotective effect was seen as enhanced growth and viability. There was, however, no effect on the DSB repair rate. Notably, there was no dependence of the biological effects on DHP concentration in the range of concentrations studied (1 nM − 100 µM), suggesting an all-or-none effect, as in cellular signaling induction observed in <b>radioadaptation</b> or bystander effect. We assume that DHP acts by decreasing fixation of radiation inflicted DNA damage, among others, by increasing the rate of DNA repair and enhancing the efficiency of checkpoint control. Direct confirmation of this assumption is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide/Radiosensitivity/Cell cycle/Clonogenic cell survival/Chromosome aberrations. The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{biological}} effects of nitric oxide (NO) on radiosensitivity and chromosome aberrations in different phases of the cell cycle in human cancer cells with a wild-type p 53 (wtp 53) genotype. H 1299 /wtp 53 cells were pre-treated with isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) at different con-centrations or pre-irradiated with a low dose of X-rays, and then exposed to a high dose of X-rays. Cell synchronization was achieved with serum starvation. Cellular radiosensitivity, cell cycle distributions, and chromosome aberrations were assayed with colony-forming assays, flow cytometry and chromosome banding techniques, respectively. After treatment with ISDN at a low concentration or after an exposure to 0. 02 Gy of X-rays, radioresistance and a reduction in the number of chromosome aberrations were observed mainly 17. 5 h after plating mitotic cells. This <b>radioadaptation</b> effect was observed during a clearly shortened G 2 /M phase and a slightly prolonged S phase. In contrast, in the presence of a high con-centration of ISDN, radiosensitization and the enhancement of chromosome aberrations were detected principally 17. 5 h after plating mitotic cells, and this radiosensitization was observed during a significantly prolonged G 2 /M phase and a slightly shortened S phase. A range of concentrations of NO induced oppos-ing effects on radiosensitivity and chromosome aberrations in human non-small cell lung cancer cells bearing wtp 53 gene status, and these different effects produced by NO depended on the cell cycle phase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Crew {{members on}} space {{missions}} inevitably {{are exposed to}} low background radiation and can receive much higher doses during solar particle events (SPE) that consist primarily of protons. Ionizing radiation could cause lung pathologies. Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) are believed to participate in fibrogenesis. Interactions between CAM and extracellular matrix (ECM) affect epithelial repair mechanisms in the lung. However, there are very limited data on biological effects of protons on normal lung tissue. Numerous reports have shown that exposure to low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) radiation can result in <b>radioadaptation</b> that renders cells more resistant to subsequent acute radiation. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare expression of genes associated with ECM and CAM, as well as critical profibrotic mediators, in mouse lungs after acute irradiation with photons and protons, and also determine whether pre-exposure to LDR γ-rays induces an adaptive effect. Results Overall, a marked difference was present in the proton vs. photon groups in gene expression. When compared to 0 Gy, more genes were affected by protons than by photons at both time points (11 vs. 6 on day 21 and 14 vs. 8 on day 56), and all genes affected by protons were upregulated. Many genes were modulated by LDR γ-rays when combined with photons or protons. Col 1 a 1, mmp 14, and mmp 15 were significantly upregulated by all radiation regimens on day 21. Similarly, the change in expression of profibrotic proteins was also detected after acute and combination irradiation. Conclusion These data show that marked differences were present between acutely delivered protons and photons in modulating genes, and the effect of protons was more profound than that of photons. Pre-exposure to LDR γ-rays ‘normalized’ some genes that were modified by acute irradiation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although {{radiation}} carcinogenesis {{has been shown}} both experimentally and epidemiologically, the use of ionizing radiation {{is also one of}} the major modalities in cancer treatment. Various known cellular and molecular events are involved in carcinogenesis. Apart from the known phenomena, there could be implications for carcinogenesis and cancer prevention due to other biological processes such as the bystander effect, the abscopal effect, intrinsic radiosensitivity and <b>radioadaptation.</b> Bystander effects have consequences for mutation initiated cancer paradigms of {{radiation carcinogenesis}}, which provide the mechanistic justification for low-dose risk estimates. The abscopal effect is potentially important for tumor control and is mediated through cytokines and/or the immune system (mainly cell-mediated immunity). It results from loss of growth and stimulatory and/or immunosuppressive factors from the tumor. Intrinsic radiosensitivity is a feature of some cancer prone chromosomal breakage syndromes such as ataxia telangectiasia. Radiosensitivity is manifested as higher chromosomal aberrations and DNA repair impairment is now known as a good biomarker for breast cancer screening and prediction of prognosis. However, it is not yet known whether this effect is good or bad for those receiving radiation or radiomimetic agents for treatment. Radiation hormesis is another major concern for carcinogenesis. This process which protects cells from higher doses of radiation or radio mimic chemicals, may lead to the escape of cells from mitotic death or apoptosis and put cells with a lower amount of damage into the process of cancer induction. Therefore, any of these biological phenomena could have impact on another process giving rise to genome instability of cells which are not in the field of radiation but still receiving a lower amount of radiation. For prevention of radiation induced carcinogenesis or risk assessment as well as for successful radiation therapy, all these phenomena should be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Backgroud/Objective: Ramsar in {{northern}} Iran {{is among the}} world’s well-known areas with highest levels of natural radiation. Annual exposure levels in areas with elevated levels of natural radiation in Ramsar are up to 260 mGy y- 1 and average exposure rates are about 10 mGy y- 1 for {{a population of about}} 2000 residents. Due to the local geological features, which includes high levels of radium in rocks, soils, and groundwater, Ramsar residents are also exposed to high levels of alpha activity in the form of ingested radium and radium decay progeny as well as very high radon levels (over 1000 MBq m- 3) in their dwellings. In some cases, the inhabitants of these areas receive doses much higher than the current ICRP- 60 dose limit of 20 mSv y- 1 set for radiation workers. The extraordinary levels of natural radiation in Ramsar prompted us to assess the radiation susceptibility of the residents. Material and methods: Venous blood samples were taken from 7 healthy blood donors of both sexes who lived in some areas of Ramsar with highest levels of natural radiation (dose rates were up to 155 µSv h- 1) and 5 healthy persons from a nearby control area. Standard condition for cell cultivation, irradiation and analysis of chromosome aberrations was used. The cells were exposed to the challenge dose of 1. 5 Gy of Co- 60 gamma ray 48 hours after PHA stimulation. Using mean chromosomal aberration per cell (MCAPC), the expected numbers of aberrations were calculated. Results:Lymphocytes of Ramsar residents when subjected to 1. 5 Gy of Gamma rays, showed fewer chromosome aberrations compared to residents in a nearby control area. These findings clearly show that high levels of natural radiation may induce radioadaptive response. Interestingly, Conclusion: this <b>radioadaptation</b> phenomenon was found in individuals who received doses as much as a few hundred times more than the inhabitants of a nearby control area. More research is needed to precisely clarify if it is possible to relax the radiation protection guidelines for inhabitants who live in such areas...|$|E
