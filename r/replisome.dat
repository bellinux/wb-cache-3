5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the <b>replisome</b> that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{initiation}} complex is formed and the cells {{pass into the}} S phase, the complex then becomes a <b>replisome.</b> The eukaryotic <b>replisome</b> complex is responsible for coordinating DNA replication. Replication on the leading and lagging strands is performed by DNA polymerase ε and DNA polymerase δ. Many <b>replisome</b> factors including Claspin, And1, replication factor C clamp loader and the fork protection complex are responsible for regulating polymerase functions and coordinating DNA synthesis with the unwinding of the template strand by Cdc45-Mcm-GINS complex. As the DNA is unwound the twist number decreases. To compensate for this the writhe number increases, introducing positive supercoils in the DNA. These supercoils would cause DNA replication to halt {{if they were not}} removed. Topoisomerases are responsible for removing these supercoils ahead of the replication fork.|$|E
25|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{termination of}} replication usually occurs through {{the collision of}} the two replicative forks between two active replication origins. The location of the collision varies on the timing of origin firing. In this way, if a replication fork becomes stalled or collapses at a certain site, replication of the site can be rescued when a <b>replisome</b> traveling {{in the opposite direction}} completes copying the region. There are programmed replication fork barriers (RFBs) bound by RFB proteins in various locations, throughout the genome, which are able to terminate or pause replication forks, stopping progression of the <b>replisome.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{duplication}} of eukaryotic genomes involves the replication of DNA from multiple origins of replication. In S phase, two sister <b>replisomes</b> assemble at each active origin, and they replicate DNA in opposite directions. Little {{is known about}} the functional relationship between sister <b>replisomes.</b> Some data imply that they travel away from one another and thus function independently. Alternatively, sister <b>replisomes</b> may form a stationary, functional unit that draws parental DNA toward itself. If this "double replisome" model is correct, a constrained DNA molecule should not undergo replication. To test this prediction, lambda DNA was stretched and immobilized at both ends within a microfluidic flow cell. Upon exposure to Xenopus egg extracts, this DNA underwent extensive replication by a single pair of diverging <b>replisomes.</b> The data show that there is no obligatory coupling between sister <b>replisomes</b> and, together with other studies, imply that genome duplication involves autonomously functioning <b>replisomes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Katherine Lemon and Alan Grossman showed using Bacillus subtilis that <b>replisomes</b> do {{not move}} like trains along a track but DNA is {{actually}} fed through a stationary pair of <b>replisomes</b> located at the cell membrane. In their experiment, the <b>replisomes</b> in B. subtilis were each tagged with green fluorescent protein, {{and the location of}} the complex was monitored in replicating cells using fluorescence microscopy. If the <b>replisomes</b> moved like a train on a track, the polymerase-GFP protein would be found at different positions in each cell. Instead, however, in every replicating cell, <b>replisomes</b> were observed as distinct fluorescent foci located at or near midcell. Cellular DNA stained with a blue fluorescent dye (DAPI) clearly occupied most of the cytoplasmic space.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of the DNA replication-associated {{proteins}} of hyperthermophilic archaea {{have yielded}} considerable {{insight into the}} structure and biochemical function of these evolutionarily conserved factors. However, {{little is known about}} the regulation and progression of DNA replication in the context of archaeal cells. In the current work, we describe the generation of strains of Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that allow the incorporation of nucleoside analogues during DNA replication. We employ this technology, in conjunction with immunolocalization analyses of <b>replisomes,</b> to investigate the sub-cellular localization of nascent DNA and <b>replisomes.</b> Our data reveal a peripheral localization of <b>replisomes</b> in the cell. Furthermore, while the two replication forks emerging from any one of the three replication origins in the Sulfolobus chromosome remain in close proximity, the three origin loci are separated...|$|R
25|$|The CMG complex {{interacts with}} the <b>replisome</b> through the {{interaction}} with Ctf4 and And1 proteins. Ctf4/And1 proteins interact with both the CMG complex and DNA polymerase α. Ctf4 is a polymerase α accessory factor, which {{is required for the}} recruitment of polymerase α to replication origins.|$|E
25|$|The <b>replisome</b> is {{responsible}} for copying the entirety of genomic DNA in each proliferative cell. This process allows for the high-fidelity passage of hereditary/genetic information from parental cell to daughter cell and is thus essential to all organisms. Much of the cell cycle is built around ensuring that DNA replication occurs without errors.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondrial DNA is {{replicated}} by the DNA polymerase gamma complex {{which is}} composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the POLG gene and two 55 kDa accessory subunits encoded by the POLG2 gene. The <b>replisome</b> machinery is formed by DNA polymerase, TWINKLE and mitochondrial SSB proteins. TWINKLE is a helicase, which unwinds short stretches of dsDNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction.|$|E
25|$|Replication {{machineries}} {{consist of}} factors involved in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In {{most of the}} bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called <b>replisomes</b> or DNA replicase systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the <b>replisomes</b> are not formed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe oriC DNA {{replication}} {{origin in}} bacterial chromosomes, {{the location of}} {{which appears to be}} physically identified, is genetically regulated by relevant molecular machinery. In contrast, the location of the terminus remains obscure for many bacterial replicons, except for terC, the proposed and well-studied chromosome termination site in certain bacteria. The terC locus, which is composed of specific sequences for its binding protein, is located at a site opposite from oriC, exhibiting a symmetric structure around the oriC–terC axis. Here, we investigated Bacillus subtilis 168 strains whose axes were hindered and found that the native terC function was robust. However, eradication of terminus region specific binding protein resulted in the natural terC sites not being used for termination; instead, new termini were selected at a location exactly opposite to oriC. We concluded that replication generally terminates at the loci where the two approaching <b>replisomes</b> meet. This site was automatically selected, and two <b>replisomes</b> moving at the same rate supported symmetrical chromosome structures relative to oriC. The rule, which was even validated by artificial chromosomes irrespective of oriC, should be general for replicons administered by two <b>replisomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in single-molecule methodology {{have made it}} possible to study the dynamic behavior of individual enzymes and their interactions with other proteins in multiprotein complexes. Here, we describe newly developed methods to study the coordination of DNA unwinding, priming, and synthesis at the DNA-replication fork. The length of individual DNA molecules is used to measure the activity of single <b>replisomes</b> engaged in coordinated DNA replication. First, a tethered-particle technique is used to visualize the formation and release of replication loops. Second, a fluorescence imaging method provides a direct readout of replication rates and processivities from individual <b>replisomes.</b> The ability to directly observe transient reaction intermediates and characterize heterogeneous behavior makes these single-molecule approaches important new additions to the tools available to study DNA replication. ...|$|R
25|$|During DNA replication, the <b>replisome</b> will unwind {{the parental}} duplex DNA into a two {{single-stranded}} DNA template replication fork in a 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is the template strand {{that is being}} replicated {{in the same direction}} as the movement of the replication fork. This allows the newly synthesized strand complementary to the original strand to be synthesized 5' to 3' {{in the same direction as}} the movement of the replication fork.|$|E
25|$|Another histone {{chaperone}} that {{associates with}} the <b>replisome</b> is Asf1, which {{interacts with the}} Mcm complex dependent on histone dimers H3-H4. Asf1 is able to pass newly synthesized H3-H4 dimer to deposition factors behind the replication fork and this activity makes the H3-H4 histone dimers available {{at the site of}} histone deposition just after replication. Asf1 (and its partner Rtt109) has also been implicated in inhibiting gene expression from replicated genes during S-phase.|$|E
25|$|The heterotrimeric {{chaperone}} chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is a chromatin formation {{protein that}} {{is involved in}} depositing histones onto both newly replicated DNA strands to form chromatin. CAF-1 contains a PCNA-binding motif, called a PIP-box, that allows CAF-1 to associate with the <b>replisome</b> through PCNA {{and is able to}} deposit histone H3-H4 dimers onto newly synthesized DNA. The Rtt106 chaperone is also involved in this process, and associated with CAF-1 and H3-H4 dimers during chromatin formation. These processes load newly synthesized histones onto DNA.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{division}} {{is a complex}} process that requires precise duplication of genetic material. Duplication is concerted by <b>replisomes.</b> The Minichromosome Maintenance (MCM) replicative helicase is a crucial component of <b>replisomes.</b> Eukaryotic and archaeal MCM proteins are highly conserved. In fact, archaeal MCMs are powerful tools for elucidating essential features of MCM function. However, while eukaryotic MCM 2 - 7 is a heterocomplex made of different polypeptide chains, the MCM complexes of many Archaea form homohexamers from a single gene product. Moreover, some archaeal MCMs are polymorphic, and both hexameric and heptameric architectures have been reported for the same polypeptide. Here, we present {{the structure of the}} archaeal MCM helicase from Pyrococcus abyssi in its single octameric ring assembly. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a full-length octameric MCM helicase...|$|R
50|$|The E. coli {{bacterial}} replication origin, called oriC {{consists of}} DNA sequences that are recognised by the DnaA protein, which is highly conserved amongst different bacterial species. DnaA binding to the origin initiates the regulated recruitment of other enzymes and proteins {{that will eventually}} lead {{to the establishment of}} two complete <b>replisomes</b> for bidirectional replication.|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Colloquium on {{the roles}} of {{homologous}} recombination in DNA replication are summarized. Current findings in experimental systems ranging from bacteriophages to mammalian cell lines substantiate the idea that homologous recombination is a system supporting DNA replication when either the template DNA is damaged or the replication machinery malfunctions. There are several lines of supporting evidence: (i) DNA replication aggravates preexisting DNA damage, which then blocks subsequent replication; (ii) replication forks abandoned by malfunctioning <b>replisomes</b> become prone to breakage; (iii) mutants with malfunctioning <b>replisomes</b> or with elevated levels of DNA damage depend on homologous recombination; and (iv) homologous recombination primes DNA replication in vivo and can restore replication fork structures in vitro. The mechanisms of recombinational repair in bacteriophage T 4, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are compared. In vitro properties of the eukaryotic recombinases suggest a bigger role for single-strand annealing in the eukaryotic recombinational repair...|$|R
25|$|The {{isolated}} CMG helicase and <b>Replisome</b> Progression Complex {{contain a}} single Mcm protein ring complex {{suggesting that the}} loaded double hexamer of the Mcm proteins at origins might be broken into two single hexameric rings {{as part of the}} initiation process, with each Mcm protein complex ring forming the core of a CMG helicase at the two replication forks established from each origin. The full CMG complex is required for DNA unwinding, and the complex of CDC45-Mcm-GINS is the functional DNA helicase in eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|The six {{minichromosome}} maintenance {{proteins and}} Cdc45 are essential during initiation and elongation {{for the movement}} of replication forks and for unwinding of the DNA. GINS are essential for the interaction of Mcm and Cdc45 at the origins of replication during initiation and then at DNA replication forks as the <b>replisome</b> progresses. The GINS complex is composed of four small proteins Sld5 (Cdc105), Psf1 (Cdc101), Psf2 (Cdc102) and Psf3 (Cdc103), GINS represents 'go, ichi, ni, san' which means '5, 1, 2, 3' in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|The DNA helicases and polymerases {{must remain}} {{in close contact}} at the {{replication}} fork. If unwinding occurs too far in advance of synthesis, large tracts of single-stranded DNA are exposed. This can activate DNA damage signaling or induce DNA repair processes. To thwart these problems, the eukaryotic <b>replisome</b> contains specialized proteins {{that are designed to}} regulate the helicase activity ahead of the replication fork. These proteins also provide docking sites for physical interaction between helicases and polymerases, thereby ensuring that duplex unwinding is coupled with DNA synthesis.|$|E
50|$|For eukaryotes, {{numerous}} replication bubbles form at {{origins of}} replication throughout the chromosome. As with prokaryotes, two <b>replisomes</b> are required, one at each replication fork {{located at the}} terminus of the replication bubble. Because of significant differences in chromosome size, and the associated complexities of highly condensed chromosomes, {{various aspects of the}} DNA replication process in eukaryotes, including the terminal phases, are less well-characterised than for prokaryotes.|$|R
40|$|In all {{domains of}} life, DNA {{synthesis}} occurs bidirectionally from replication origins. Despite variable rates of replication fork progression, fork convergence often occurs at specific sites. Escherichia coli sets a 'replication fork trap' {{that allows the}} first arriving fork to enter but not to leave the terminus region. The trap is set by oppositely oriented Tus-bound Ter sites that block forks on approach from only one direction. However, the efficiency of fork blockage by Tus-Ter does not exceed 50 % in vivo despite its apparent ability to almost permanently arrest replication forks in vitro. Here we use data from single-molecule DNA replication assays and structural studies to show that both polarity and fork-arrest efficiency are determined by a competition between rates of Tus displacement and rearrangement of Tus-Ter interactions that leads to blockage of slower moving <b>replisomes</b> by two distinct mechanisms. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} example where intrinsic differences in rates of individual <b>replisomes</b> have different biological outcomes. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} for visualizing replication of individual DNA molecules in real time. By attaching a rolling-circle substrate to a TIRF microscope-mounted flow chamber, {{we are able}} to monitor the progression of single-DNA synthesis events and accurately measure rates and processivities of single T 7 and Escherichia coli <b>replisomes</b> as they replicate DNA. This method allows for rapid and precise characterization of the kinetics of DNA synthesis and the effects of replication inhibitors. ...|$|R
25|$|Eukaryotic DNA {{replication}} is bidirectional; {{within a}} replicative origin, <b>replisome</b> complexes are created {{at each end}} of the replication origin and replisomes move away from each other from the initial starting point. In prokaryotes, bidirectional replication initiates at one replicative origin on the circular chromosome and terminates at a site opposed from the initial start of the origin. These termination regions have DNA sequences known as Ter sites. These Ter sites are bound by the Tus protein. The Ter-Tus complex is able to stop helicase activity, terminating replication.|$|E
25|$|Loading of Mcm {{proteins}} {{can only}} occur during the G1 {{of the cell}} cycle, and the loaded complex is then activated during S phase by recruitment of the Cdc45 protein and the GINS complex to form the active Cdc45–Mcm–GINS (CMG) helicase at DNA replication forks. Mcm activity is required throughout the S phase for DNA replication. A variety of regulatory factors assemble around the CMG helicase to produce the ‘Replisome Progression Complex’ which associates with DNA polymerases to form the eukaryotic <b>replisome,</b> the structure of which is still quite poorly defined in comparison with its bacterial counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic DNA must be tightly {{compacted}} {{in order}} to fit within the confined space of the nucleus. Chromosomes are packaged by wrapping 147 nucleotides around an octamer of histone proteins, forming a nucleosome. The nucleosome octamer includes two copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Due to the tight association of histone proteins to DNA, eukaryotic cells have proteins {{that are designed to}} remodel histones ahead of the replication fork, {{in order to}} allow smooth progression of the <b>replisome.</b> There are also proteins involved in reassembling histones behind the replication fork to reestablish the nucleosome conformation.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} an ASEP-like {{model to}} describe the effects of RNA polymerase (RNAP) traffic on DNA replication. It contains two particle species representing RNAP and replication forks (<b>replisomes),</b> respectively, that can interact leading e. g. to the detachment of RNAPs. An interesting aspect is that the RNAP motion is performed on a lattice that is effectively decreasing in length. Using Monte Carlo simulation and an heuristic analytical approach based on exact results for the ASEP we make predictions for the RNAP traffic that might be tested in future experiments. Comment: 7 pages, including 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|DNA replicases stall at lesions during replication, {{potentially}} {{leading to}} genome instability. However, cells use specialized lesion bypass polymerases to restart stalled <b>replisomes.</b> Although most organisms possess these damage tolerance polymerases, capable of traversing blocking DNA lesions, many appear to lack these enzymes. We {{have discovered that}} replicative primases from archaea, previously considered to be solely involved in priming replication, are also capable of performing translesion DNA synthesis. This discovery has major implications for our understanding of additional roles of DNA primases during replication and the subsequent evolution of related lesion bypass pathways in eukaryotic organisms...|$|R
50|$|The {{translation}} machinery works relatively slowly {{compared to}} the enzyme systems that catalyze DNA replication. Proteins in prokaryotes are synthesized {{at a rate of}} only 18 amino acid residues per second, whereas bacterial <b>replisomes</b> synthesize DNA at a rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. This difference in rate reflects, in part, the difference between polymerizing four types of nucleotides to make nucleic acids and polymerizing 20 types of amino acids to make proteins. Testing and rejecting incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA molecules takes time and slows protein synthesis. In bacteria, translation initiation occurs as soon as the 5' end of an mRNA is synthesized, and translation and transcription are coupled. This is not possible in eukaryotes because transcription and translation are carried out in separate compartments of the cell (the nucleus and cytoplasm).|$|R
25|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{the action}} of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand. To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a replication fork containing two single-stranded templates. Replication processes permit the copying of a single DNA double helix into two DNA helices, which are divided into the daughter cells at mitosis. The major enzymatic functions carried out at the replication fork are well conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, but the replication machinery in eukaryotic DNA replication is a much larger complex, coordinating many proteins {{at the site of}} replication, forming the <b>replisome.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{strengthen}} {{the interaction between}} the polymerase and the template DNA, DNA sliding clamps associate with the polymerase to promote the processivity of the replicative polymerase. In eukaryotes, the sliding clamp is a homotrimer ring structure known as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The PCNA ring has polarity with surfaces that interact with DNA polymerases and tethers them securely to the DNA template. PCNA-dependent stabilization of DNA polymerases has a significant effect on DNA replication because PCNAs are able to enhance the polymerase processivity up to 1,000-fold. PCNA is an essential cofactor and has the distinction of being {{one of the most common}} interaction platforms in the <b>replisome</b> to accommodate multiple processes at the replication fork, and so PCNA is also viewed as a regulatory cofactor for DNA polymerases.|$|E
500|$|In {{the sense}} that DNA {{replication}} must occur if genetic material is {{to be provided for}} the progeny of any cell, whether somatic or reproductive, the copying from DNA to DNA arguably is the fundamental step in the central dogma. [...] A complex group of proteins called the <b>replisome</b> performs the replication of the information from the parent strand to the complementary daughter strand.|$|E
40|$|Nucleoprotein {{complexes}} present {{challenges to}} genome stability by acting as potent blocks to replication. One attractive model of how such conflicts are resolved is direct targeting of blocked forks by helicases {{with the ability}} to displace the blocking protein-DNA complex. We show that Rep and UvrD each promote movement of E. coli <b>replisomes</b> blocked by nucleoprotein complexes in vitro, that such an activity is required to clear protein blocks (primarily transcription complexes) in vivo, and that a polarity of translocation opposite that of the replicative helicase is critical for this activity. However, these two helicases are not equivalent. Rep but not UvrD interacts physically and functionally with the replicative helicase. In contrast, UvrD likely provides a general means of protein-DNA complex turnover during replication, repair, and recombination. Rep and UvrD therefore provide two contrasting solutions as to how organisms may promote replication of protein-bound DNA...|$|R
5000|$|Termination is {{the process}} of fusion of {{replication}} forks and disassembly of the <b>replisomes</b> to yield two separate and complete DNA molecules. It occurs in the terminus region, approximately opposite oriC on the chromosome (Fig 5). The terminus region contains several DNA replication terminator sites, or [...] "Ter" [...] sites. A special [...] "replication terminator" [...] protein must be bound at the Ter site for it to pause replication. Each Ter site has polarity of action, that is, it will arrest a replication fork approaching the Ter site from one direction, but will allow unimpeded fork movement through the Ter site from the other direction. The arrangement of the Ter sites forms two opposed groups that forces the two forks to meet each other within the region they span. This arrangement is called the [...] "replication fork trap." ...|$|R
40|$|All cells contain {{specialized}} translesion DNA polymerases that replicate past {{sites of}} DNA damage. We find that Escherichia coli translesion DNA polymerase II (Pol II) and polymerase IV (Pol IV) function with DnaB helicase and regulate its rate of unwinding, slowing it to {{as little as}} 1 bp/s. Furthermore, Pol II and Pol IV freely exchange with the polymerase III (Pol III) replicase on the β-clamp and function with DnaB helicase to form alternative <b>replisomes,</b> even before Pol III stalls at a lesion. DNA damage-induced levels of Pol II and Pol IV dominate the clamp, slowing the helicase and stably maintaining {{the architecture of the}} replication machinery while keeping the fork moving. We propose that these dynamic actions provide additional time for normal excision repair of lesions before the replication fork reaches them and also enable the appropriate translesion polymerase to sample each lesion as it is encountered...|$|R
