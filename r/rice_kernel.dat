This study investigates factors that affect iron transfer into the kernel endosperm via parboiling by evaluating the impact of varied milling durations, iron concentrations in the soaking water, and parboiling conditions upon iron penetration into the <b>rice</b> <b>kernel.</b> Long-grain rice grown in Arkansas was parboiled as rough, brown, and milled rice under various soaking and steaming temperature conditions. Visual quality of the milled parboiled rice was evaluated using a colorimeter utilizing the L* a* b* color scale. Compositional analyses quantified the impact of parboiling conditions upon the iron content of various <b>rice</b> <b>kernel</b> components.
