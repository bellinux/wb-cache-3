30|$|Optical {{techniques}} such as luminescent labeling are widely used in biomedicine today. They are noninvasive and can be employed for in vitro and in vivo diagnostics. One example is in vitro tests on infectious diseases based on a photoluminescence (PL) response, e.g., Gram staining [1]. Another example is the optical coherent tomography, which is successfully employed to detect malignant tumors in vivo[2]. In this case {{the cost of a}} single analysis is several times lower than that of <b>radiology</b> <b>treatment.</b> The next field of optical diagnostics is the fluorescent labeling of antibodies in order to estimate efficiency of targeted chemotherapy in vivo[3]. The dendrite cells were tracked by combining the fluorescent labeling with magnetic resonant imaging [4]. In the latter work, fluorescent indocyanine green and magnetic iron oxides embedded into polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles were used for high resolution diagnostics of lymph nodes. The employed PLGA is a well-known biocompatible polymer for drug delivery applications [5].|$|E
30|$|A precise {{knowledge}} of vertebrae location, shape, and orientation is however essential. Hence, an imaging follow-up of spine lesions requires a precise {{identification of the}} affected levels and consequent reliable vertebrae identification. The same considerations are relevant in case of multi-modality imaging, {{that is to say}} supplementary spinal imaging procedures (e.g., bone scan with SPECT/CT, 18 F-fluoride PET/CT) performed so as to allow a better characterization of lesions or tumor burden. This is even more crucial for preoperative planning and for interventional <b>radiology</b> <b>treatments.</b> Vertebra segmentation and identification is therefore a key issue for many medical applications.|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{pseudarthrosis}} of the clavicle (CPC) {{is a rare}} malformation of uncertain aetiopathogenesis, usually unilateral. Physical examination reveals swelling {{over the}} midportion of the clavicle, often asymptomatic; the diagnosis is confirmed by <b>radiology.</b> <b>Treatment</b> is controversial : for many authors the surgical indications are the presence of symptoms, functional impairment or cosmetic deformities. We present a retrospective analysis of 17 children with CPC treated in our institutions : 9 were treated with plate (P) and 8 with Kirschner wire (KW) fixation; a bone graft was used in 12 cases only. Five patients (4 P and I KW) needed a second surgical procedure. The surgical treatment led to a very good result in 7 cases, good in 4 cases, fair in 3 cases and poor in 3 other cases.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{retrospectively}} {{analyze the}} outcomes of interventional <b>radiology</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients with hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after liver transplantation at our Institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hepatic artery stenosis was diagnosed and treated by endovascular technique in 8 (2. 8 %) patients, who underwent liver transplantation between July 2007 and July 2011. Patients entered the follow-up period, during which we analyzed hepatic artery patency with Doppler ultrasound at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after percutaneous endovascular treatment (PTA), and every six months thereafter. RESULTS: During the 12 -month follow-up period, 6 out of 8 patients (75 %) were asymptomatic with patent hepatic artery, which was confirmed by multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography, or color Doppler (CD) ultrasound. One patient had a fatal outcome of unknown cause, and one patient underwent orthotopic liver retransplantation (re-OLT) procedure due to graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HAS angioplasty and stenting are minimally invasive and safe endovascular procedures that represent a good alternative to open surgery, with good 12 -month follow-up patency results comparable to surgery...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{clinical}} case of renovascular disease, probably linked to fibromuscular dysplasia, in a 12 months old boy with severe arterial hypertension with target-organ damage, highlighting the radiological approach. Initial investigation included renal ultrasound that showed normal sized kidneys, with normal cortical echogenicity {{on the right}} and focally increased echogenicity of the posterior aspect of the left kidney, forming a mass-like lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging excluded renal tumor, which was confirmed by ultrasound guided biopsy. A doppler ultrasonography was also performed suggesting a right renal artery stenosis and decreased flow to the posterior aspect of the left kidney. Angiography with diagnostic and therapeutic intention was performed: right renal artery stenosis was detected and transluminal ballon dilation was performed; the left renal artery bifurcated precociously and the branch that irrigated the posterior part of the kidney had a stenosis which was also successfully dilated. After the intervention good blood pressure control with antihypertensive drugs was achieved, which was not possible before the angiographic procedure.

40|$|In this thesis, {{individual}} {{steps of}} a pipeline for processing of the peripheral Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) datasets are addressed. The peripheral CTA datasets are volumetric datasets representing pathologies in vascularity of the lower extremities in the human body. These pathologies result from various atherosclerotic diseases as e. g. the Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (PAOD) and their early and precise diagnostics significantly contributes to planning of a later interventional <b>radiology</b> <b>treatment.</b> The diagnostics is based on visualization of the imaged vascular tree, where individual pathologic changes, as plaque, calcifications, stenoses of the vessel lumen and occluded parts of the vessels are visible. CTA has evolved within the recent years into a robust, accurate and cost effective imaging technique for patients with both coronary and arterial diseases. As {{a result of the}} CTA scanning, a set of 1200 – 2000 transverse slices is acquired, depicting vessels enhanced by means of an intravenously injected contrast medium. The number of slices is high and therefore their manual examination is laborious and lengthy. As a remedy, post-processing methods were developed to allow faster and more intuitive visualization of the imaged vascularity. However, simple visualization by means of the traditional techniques as maximum-intensity projection (MIP) or direct volume rendering (DVR) is hampered due to the presence of bones in the dataset, which occlude the vessels...|$|E
40|$|The term "complicated" diverticulitis is {{reserved}} for inflamed diverticular disease complicated by bleeding, abscess, peritonitis, fistula or bowel obstruction. Hemorrhage is best treated by angioembolization (interventional <b>radiology).</b> <b>Treatment</b> of infected diverticulitis has evolved enormously thanks to: 1) laparoscopic colonic resection followed or not (Hartmann's procedure) by restoration of intestinal continuity, 2) simple laparoscopic lavage (for peritonitis +/- resection). Diverticulitis (inflammation) may be treated with antibiotics alone, anti-inflammatory drugs, combined with bed rest and hygienic measures. Diverticular abscesses (Hinchey Grades I, II) may be initially treated by antibiotics alone and/or percutaneous drainage, {{depending on the size}} of the abscess. Generalized purulent peritonitis (Hinchey III) may be treated by the classic Hartmann procedure, or exteriorization of the perforation as a stoma, primary resection with or without anastomosis, with or without diversion, and last, simple laparoscopic lavage, usually even without drainage. Feculent peritonitis (Hinchey IV), a traditional indication for Hartmann's procedure, may also benefit from primary resection followed by anastomosis, with or without diversion, and even laparoscopic lavage. Acute obstruction (nearby inflammation, or adhesions, pseudotumoral formation, chronic strictures) and fistula are most often treated by resection, ideally laparoscopic. Minimal invasive therapeutic algorithms that, combined with less strict indications for radical surgery before a definite recurrence pattern is established, has definitely lead to fewer resections and/or stomas, reducing their attendant morbidity and mortality, improved post-interventional quality of life, and less costly therapeutic policies...|$|E
40|$|A {{long time}} use of {{radiation}} during IVR (intervention <b>radiology)</b> <b>treatment</b> leads {{up to an}} increased exposure on IVR operator. In order to prepare good environment for the operator to work without worry about exposure, the authors examined exposure reduction with the shields attached to the angiography instrument, i. e. lead curtain and lead glass. In this study, the lumber spine phantom was radiated using the instrument and the radiation leaked outside with and without shields {{was measured by the}} ionization chamber type survey meter. The meter was placed at the position which was considered to be that for IVR operator, and changed vertically 20 - 100 cm above X-ray focus by 10 cm interval. The radiation at the position of 80 cm above X-ray focus was maximum without shield and was hardly reduced with lead curtain. However, it was reduced with lead curtain plus lead glass. Similar reduction effects were observed at the position of 90 - 100 cm above X-ray focus. On the other hand, the radiation at the position of 70 cm above X-ray focus was not reduced with either shield, because that position corresponded to the gap between lead curtain and lead glass. The radiation at the position of 20 - 60 cm above X-ray focus was reduced with lead curtain, even if without lead glass. These results show that lead curtain and lead glass attached to the instrument can reduce the radiation exposure on IVR operator. Using these shields is considered to be one of good means for IVR operator to work safely. Ｘ線透視（IVR）治療における長時間の放射線使用は，術者の被曝増大につながる。本研究では，IVR術者が被曝の心配なく検査に集中できる環境を整えるため，装置付属の鉛カーテンおよび鉛ガラスなどの遮蔽体を用いることによる術者の被曝低減効果を調べた。実際には，腰椎ファントムに対して放射線照射を行い，遮蔽体の有無による放射線量の変化を電離箱サーベイメータによって調べた。サーベイメータの位置は，IVRで術者が立つ位置で上下に変化させた。その変化は，X線焦点を基準にして上方 20 - 100 cmで 10 cm間隔とした。X線焦点より上方 80 cmの位置は，遮蔽体なしでは最も高い線量であったが，鉛カーテンのみでは殆ど線量減少効果が認められず，鉛ガラスを加えることで減少効果が認められた。さらに上方 90 - 100 cmでも，同様の効果が得られた。一方，X線焦点より上方 70 cmは鉛カーテンと鉛ガラスの隙間に当たり，これら遮蔽体の減少効果は認められなかった。また，X線焦点より上方 20 - 60 cmは，鉛カーテンのみでも被曝減少効果が認められた。これらの結果から，鉛カーテンと鉛ガラスの併用はIVR術者の被曝を低減し，術者が治療に専念出来る環境を整える手段の１つと考えられる...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{significance}} of hospitals as point sources for emission of organic micropollutants into the aquatic environment. A mass flow analysis of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics used in hospitals was performed on the site of a representative Swiss cantonal hospital. Specifically, we analyzed the consumption of iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and cytostatics in their corresponding medical applications of radiology and oncology, respectively, and their discharge into hospital wastewater and eventually into the wastewater of the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Emission levels within one day and over several days were found to correlate with the pharmacokinetic excretion pattern and the consumed amounts in the hospital during these days. ICM total emissions vary substantially from day to day from 255 to 1259 g/d, with a maximum on the day when the highest <b>radiology</b> <b>treatment</b> occurred. Parent cytostatic compounds reach maximal emissions of 8 − 10 mg/d. A total of 1. 1 %, 1. 4 %, and 3. 7 % of the excreted amounts of the cytostatics 5 -fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and 2 ′, 2 ′-difluorodeoxyuridine (main metabolite of gemcitabine), respectively, were found in the hospital wastewater, whereas 49 % of the total ICM was detected, showing a high variability among the compounds. These recoveries can essentially be explained by the high amount administered to out-patients (70 % for cytostatics and 50 % for ICM); therefore, only part of this dose is expected to be excreted on-site. In addition, this study emphasizes critical issues to consider when sampling in hospital sewer systems. Flow proportional sampling over a longer period is crucial to compute robust hospital mass flows...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{treatment}} of portal hypertension {{is complex and}} the the best strategy depends on the underlying disease (cirrhosis vs. schistosomiasis), patient's clinical condition and time on it is performed (during an acute episode of variceal bleeding or electively, as pre-primary, primary or secondary prophylaxis). With the advent of new pharmacological options and technical development of endoscopy and interventional <b>radiology</b> <b>treatment</b> of portal hypertension has changed in recent decades. AIM: To review the strategies employed in elective and emergency {{treatment of}} variceal bleeding in cirrhotic and schistosomotic patients. METHODS: Survey of publications in PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, SciELO and Cochrane databases through June 2013, using the headings: portal hypertension, esophageal and gastric varices, variceal bleeding, liver cirrhosis, schistosomiasis mansoni, surgical treatment, pharmacological treatment, secondary prophylaxis, primary prophylaxis, pre-primary prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Pre-primary prophylaxis doesn't have specific treatment strategies; the best recommendation is treatment of the underlying disease. Primary prophylaxis should be performed in cirrhotic patients with beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation. There is controversy regarding the effectiveness of primary prophylaxis in patients with schistosomiasis; when indicated, it is done with beta-blockers or endoscopic therapy in high-risk varices. Treatment of acute variceal bleeding is systematized in the literature, combination of vasoconstrictor drugs and endoscopic therapy, provided significant decline in mortality over the last decades. TIPS and surgical treatment are options as rescue therapy. Secondary prophylaxis plays {{a fundamental role in}} the reduction of recurrent bleeding, the best option in cirrhotic patients is the combination of pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers and endoscopic band ligation. TIPS or surgical treatment, are options for controlling rebleeding on failure of secondary prophylaxis. Despite the increasing evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacological and endoscopic treatment in schistosomotic patients, surgical therapy still {{plays an important role in}} secondary prophylaxis...|$|E
40|$|The {{cholinergic}} anti-inflammatory pathway can downregulate inflammation via {{the release}} of acetylcholine (ACh) by the vagus nerve. This neurotransmitter binds to the α 7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α 7 nAChR), expressed on macrophages and other immune cells. We tested the pharmacological and functional profile of two novel compounds, PMP- 311 and PMP- 072 and investigated their role in modulating collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Both compounds were characterized with binding, electrophysiological, and pharmacokinetic studies. For in vivo efficacy studies in the CIA model the compounds were administered daily by oral gavage from day 20 till sacrifice at day 34. Disease progression was monitored by visual clinical scoring and measurement of paw swelling. Inflammation and joint destruction were examined by histology and <b>radiology.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with PMP- 311 was effective in preventing disease onset, reducing clinical signs of arthritis, and reducing synovial inflammation and bone destruction. PMP- 072 also showed a trend in arthritis reduction at all concentrations tested. The data showed that while both compounds bind to α 7 nAChR with high affinity, PMP- 311 acts like a classical agonist of ion channel activity, and PMP- 072 can actually act as an ion channel antagonist. Moreover, PMP- 072 was clearly distinct from typical competitive antagonists, since {{it was able to}} act as a silent agonist. It synergizes with the allosteric modulator PNU- 120596, and subsequently activates desensitized α 7 nAChR. However, PMP- 072 was less efficacious than PMP- 311 at both channel activation and desensitization, suggesting that both conducting and non-conducting states maybe of importance in driving an anti-inflammatory response. Finally, we found that the anti-arthritic effect can be observed despite limited penetration of the central nervous system. These data provide direct evidence that the α 7 nAChR in immune cells does not require typical ion channel activation to exert its antiinflammatory effect...|$|E
40|$|Gliomas are morbid {{brain tumors}} that are {{extremely}} resistant to available chemotherapy and <b>radiology</b> <b>treatments.</b> Some {{studies have suggested}} that calcium-activated potassium channels contribute to the high proliferative potential of tumor cells, including gliomas. However, other publications demonstrated no role for these channels or even assigned them antitumorogenic properties. In this work we characterized the expression and functional contribution to proliferation of Ca 2 +-activated K + channels in human glioblastoma cells. Quantitative RT-PCR detected transcripts for the big conductance (BK), intermediate conductance (IK 1), and small conductance (SK 2) K + channels in two glioblastoma-derived cell lines and a surgical sample of glioblastoma multiforme. Functional expression of BK and IK 1 in U 251 and U 87 glioma cell lines and primary glioma cultures was verified using whole-cell electrophysiological recordings. Inhibitors of BK (paxilline and penitrem A) and IK 1 channels (clotrimazole and TRAM- 34) reduced U 251 and U 87 proliferation in an additive fashion, while the selective blocker of SK channels UCL 1848 had no effect. However, the antiproliferative properties of BK and IK 1 inhibitors were seen at concentrations that were higher than those necessary to inhibit channel activity. To verify specificity of pharmacological agents, we downregulated BK and IK 1 channels in U 251 cells using gene-specific siRNAs. Although siRNA knockdowns caused strong reductions in the BK and IK 1 current densities, neither single nor double gene silencing significantly affected rates of proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that Ca 2 +-activated K + channels do not pla...|$|R

40|$|Vascular malformations {{arise from}} {{errors in the}} {{morphological}} processes that shape the embryonic vascular system during fetal development. These developmental errors result in abnormal clusters of blood vessels. Although these lesions are present at birth, they might not become visible until weeks or even years after birth. Typically, the lesions grow {{in proportion to the}} growth of the child. A vascular malformation will not disappear without treatment. Vascular malformations occur in 1. 5 % of the population and the male to female ratio is 1 : 1. The symptoms can vary, and they include cosmetic complaints, tissue ulceration, pain, swelling, and functional limitations. In some patients the symptoms are mild, in which case conservative measures might be sufficient. In contrast, patients with severe symptoms might require more invasive <b>treatment.</b> Surgery, interventional <b>radiology,</b> laser therapy or a combination of techniques are used in the treatment of vascular malformations. However, {{as a result of their}} rarity, the correct diagnosis and treatment of vascular malformations is difficult, because most physicians do not see these problems often enough to become knowledgeable about their management. For the purpose of this review we performed a literature search to outline the classification, pathogenesis and histological findings, clinical presentation, and treatment of peripheral vascular malformations. We used the PubMed and MeSH databases for the literature search. The following MeSH terms were used: vascular malformations, haemangioma, and arteriovenous malformations, with the subheadings: classification, aetiology, genetics, surgery, and therapy. A specific time interval, 1960 to 2010, was used. In addition, we included in the search the names of groups of investigators who are known to be associated with the different topics and reference lists from other review articles on the same topics.

The recurrence of haemorrhage {{and the development of}} haemorrhagic shock significantly increase morbidity and mortality, and depend on the extent of the lesion and on patient co-morbidities. Until recently, recurrent or refractory haemorrhage required urgent surgical therapy, which was associated with significant mortality. In the last years, the development of interventional radiology techniques has offered to clinicians an alternative, effective and less invasive therapeutic approach for the treatment of acute blood loss. In this article, we will show the outstanding role of interventional <b>radiology</b> in the <b>treatment</b> of acute {{gastro-intestinal bleeding}}...|$|R
5000|$|A $64 million {{redevelopment}} of the Whakatane Hospital {{complex in}} currently under way. The project includes refurbishment {{of some of}} the existing buildings and {{the construction of a new}} hospital building. Planned works include the relocation of the helipad, refurbishing the current Outpatient Department facility, the relocation of the Mental Health Unit, the construction of a Maori Health Unit, the relocation of the conference centre and the demolition of several buildings. The new building will house the Emergency Department (15 cubicles, 2 resuscitation bays), In-patient beds (69 medical and surgical, 10 paediatric), an Acute Patients Unit, Coronary Care Unit, High Dependency Unit, <b>Radiology</b> Theatres and <b>Treatment</b> and Rehabilitation Assessment (9 beds, 2 operating rooms, 1 procedure room). The project also has plans for a central courtyard with gardens, a cafe and a children's playground.|$|R
30|$|Duodenal varices are a low-frequency {{cause of}} {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding; however, greater than 40  % mortality {{has been reported}} after the initial bleeding episode [1, 2]. Several treatments exist to control bleeding including interventional radiology, endoscopic therapy, and surgical modalities (e.g., variceal ligation, duodenal resection, and extrahepatic portosystemic shunts) [3]. Endoscopic therapy is often the first choice for bleeding duodenal varices and can include endoscopic injection sclerotherapy {{and the use of}} N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate [4, 5]. However, these procedures are specialized and performed in few institutions in Japan. Endoscopic band ligation is easy and useful for temporary hemostasis; however, the frequency of variceal re-bleeding is high and additional therapy including interventional <b>radiology</b> and/or surgical <b>treatment</b> is necessary [5, 6]. We present a novel surgical technique for bleeding duodenal varices after failure of balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO).|$|R
