40|$|In {{introduction}} thesis {{deals with}} the approximation of problems <b>of</b> cycling wheel <b>rims</b> production and describes problems which come to producers. Next part analyses technological options <b>of</b> joining <b>rounded</b> profiles <b>of</b> <b>rims</b> and consider {{advantages and disadvantages of}} single usable methods. The main part aims at proposal of automatical connecting facility for rims pin joining. The component of the thesis is also mechanical drawing of arrangement of suggested facility...|$|R

60|$|After groping, on his knees, with {{extraordinary}} perseverance all <b>round</b> the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> his bed-room candlestick, which stood {{on one of}} the hall chairs, he succeeded--not in finding the box of matches--but in knocking it off the chair, and sending it rolling over the stone floor, until it was stopped by the opposite wall. With some difficulty he captured it, and struck a light. Never, in all Zack's experience, had any former matches caught flame with such a shrill report, as was produced from the one disastrous match which he happened to select to light his candle with.|$|R
60|$|So Peter had to {{find out}} many things for himself. He often played ships at the Round Pond, but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass. Of course, he had never seen a hoop, and he {{wondered}} what you play at with them, and decided that you play at pretending they are boats. This hoop always sank at once, but he waded in for it, and sometimes he dragged it gleefully <b>round</b> the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the pond, and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops.|$|R
40|$|The structure, {{physical}} properties of ejecta, ballistics, {{and growth of}} Northeast crater, a young pyroclastic cone that originated in 1911 near the summit of Mount Etna, Sicily, were studied in order to form a model of volcano cinder cone growth. Four stages of growth were discerned: (1) a simple cone; (2) a cone with an outward-dipping talus slope; (3) destruction <b>of</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>rim</b> by the inward migration of the upper edge of the talus pile; and (4) extension of limits of talus pile beyond the ballistic limit of ejecta trajectories. The model is used to predict the features of lunar and Martian cones, assuming that they erupted under conditions qualitatively similar to Etna's Northeast crater...|$|R
60|$|It is lamentable, too, that at {{the very}} same moment when the Irish {{question}} was extinguished, the Naval Question which had lasted for nearly fifty years was absolutely obliterated by disarmament.

Beyond keeping a fleet in the North Sea and one on the Mediterranean, and maintaining a patrol all <b>round</b> the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific Ocean, Britain will cease to be a naval power. A mere annual expenditure of fifty million pounds sterling will suffice for such thin pretence of naval preparedness as a disarmed nation will have to maintain.|$|R
5000|$|Scutellastra longicosta is a {{territorial}} limpet {{occupying a}} permanent position and cultivating the brown alga Ralfsia verrucosa in a [...] "garden" [...] which it defends from other herbivores. The productivity of the cultivated algae is about 30% higher than it is when the algae grow elsewhere. It {{has been shown that}} Scutellastra cochlear, a closely related limpet, fertilises its algal garden with urea that accumulates <b>round</b> the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> its shell when the limpet is exposed to the air at low tide and this may also be the case with Scutellastra longicosta. The cultivation of the garden is a form of mutualism as both limpet and alga derive benefit from the arrangement.|$|R

5|$|<b>Round</b> the <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> deserts, {{where more}} {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops.

The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|R

60|$|About half-past {{seven o'clock}} in the evening, some ten days or a {{fortnight}} after Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London, there hurried {{into one of these}} offices, an individual in a brown coat and brass buttons, whose long hair was scrupulously twisted <b>round</b> the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> his napless hat, and whose soiled drab trousers were so tightly strapped over his Blucher boots, that his knees threatened every moment to start from their concealment. He produced from his coat pockets a long and narrow strip of parchment, on which the presiding functionary impressed an illegible black stamp. He then drew forth four scraps of paper, of similar dimensions, each containing a printed copy of the strip of parchment with blanks for a name; and having filled up the blanks, put all the five documents in his pocket, and hurried away.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PAS kinase Rim 15 is {{proposed}} to integrate signals from different nutrient-sensing pathways and to control transcriptional reprogramming of Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon nutrient depletion. Despite th{{is proposed}} role, previous transcriptome analyses <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 mutants solely focused on growing cultures. In the present work, retentostat cultivation enabled {{analysis of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 under severely calorie-restricted, virtually non-growing conditions. Under these conditions, deletion <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 affected transcription of over 10 -fold more genes than in growing cultures. Transcriptional responses, metabolic rates and cellular morphology indicated a key role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 in controlled cell-cycle arrest upon nutrient depletion. Moreover, deletion <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 reduced heat-shock tolerance in non-growing, but not in growing cultures. The failure <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 cells to adapt to calorie restriction by entering a robust post-mitotic state resembles cancer cell physiology and shows that retentostat cultivation of yeast strains can provide relevant models for healthy post-mitotic and transformed human cells...|$|R

An involvement <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> in insulin exocytosis was indicated by transfection experiments of INS- 1 E cells with the Rab 3 binding domain <b>of</b> <b>RIM.</b> This domain enhanced glucose-stimulated secretion in intact cells and Ca 2 +-stimulated exocytosis in permeabilized cells.

40|$|Yeast cells contain two Bro 1 domain proteins: Bro 1, {{which is}} {{required}} for endosomal trafficking, and Rim 20, which {{is required for}} the response to the external pH via the Rim 101 pathway. Rim 20 associates with endosomal structures under alkaline growth conditions, when it promotes activation <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 101 through proteolytic cleavage. We report here that the pH-dependent localization <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 is contingent on the amount of Bro 1 in the cell. Cells that lack Bro 1 have increased endosomal Rim 20 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) under acidic conditions; cells that overexpress Bro 1 have reduced endosomal Rim 20 -GFP under acidic or alkaline conditions. The novel endosomal association <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 -GFP in the absence of Bro 1 requires ESCRT components including Vps 27 but not specific Rim 101 pathway components such as Dfg 16. Vps 27 influences the localization of Bro 1 but is not required for RIM 101 pathway activation in wild-type cells, thus suggesting that Rim 20 enters the Bro 1 localization pathway when a vacancy exists. Despite altered localization <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20, the lack of Bro 1 does not bypass the need for signaling protein Dfg 16 to activate Rim 101, as evidenced by the expression levels <b>of</b> the <b>Rim</b> 101 target genes RIM 8 and SMP 1. Therefore, endosomal association <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 is not sufficient to promote Rim 101 activation...|$|R

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{protein kinase}} Rim 15 p was {{identified}} previously as a stimulator of meiotic gene expression. Here, {{we show that}} loss <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 p causes an additional pleiotropic phenotype in cells grown to stationary phase on rich medium; this phenotype includes defects in trehalose and glycogen accumulation, in transcriptional derepression of HSP 12, HSP 26, and SSA 3, in induction of thermotolerance and starvation resistance, and in proper G 1 arrest. These phenotypes are commonly associated with hyperactivity of the Ras/cAMP pathway. Tests of epistasis suggest that Rim 15 p may act in this pathway downstream of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). Accordingly, deletion <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 suppresses the growth defect of a temperature-sensitive adenylate-cyclase mutant and, most importantly, renders cells independent of cAPK activity. Conversely, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 suppresses phenotypes associated with a mutation in the regulatory subunit of cAPK, exacerbates the growth defect of strains compromised for cAPK activity, and partially induces a starvation response in logarithmically growing wild-type cells. Biochemical analyses reveal that cAPK-mediated in vitro phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 p strongly inhibits its kinase activity. Taken together, these results place Rim 15 p immediately downstream and under negative control of cAPK and define a positive regulatory role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 p for entry into both meiosis and stationary phase...|$|R

In contrast with the blue livery was the vermilion in which the buffer beam and coupling rods were painted. Another feature of great distinction, begun by James Holden with the Claud Hamiltons, was the broad steel ring, polished bright, that encircled the smokebox door, and made it possible to dispense with the usual straps across the door. Before very long, the painted representation of the GER coat-of-arms on the driving splashers was replaced by a replica cast in relief and picked out in colour. The tenders were replaced with standard GER ones when oil firing came to an end. The cab windows were round.|$|R
