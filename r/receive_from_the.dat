As soon as {{the first group of}} soldiers left Gonzales, Ponton sent a messenger to the closest town, Mina, to request help. Word quickly spread that up to 300 soldiers were expected to march on Gonzales. Stephen F. Austin, {{one of the most respected}} men in Texas and the de facto leader of the settlers, sent messengers to inform surrounding communities of the situation. Austin cautioned Texians to remain on the defensive, as any unprovoked attacks against Mexican forces could limit the support Texians might <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States if war officially began.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a decline of hunting {{partially}} {{due to the fact}} that young people lack the skills to survive off the land.

25|$|In 2003, California {{suffered}} from an extended drought, {{and there was}} considerable discussion and debate about how much water each water district was entitled to <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Colorado River and its tributaries. As a result, several organizations negotiated an agreement for water rights for their associated districts: the San Diego County Water Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The agreement was a compromise that divided available water resources between the environmentally fragile Imperial Valley and the more heavily populated areas of Southern California.|$|E
25|$|When Gray Davis was {{recalled}} and Arnold Schwarzenegger {{was elected}} governor in October 2003, Schwarzenegger vowed {{that his first}} act as governor would be to revoke the vehicle license fee increase. On November 17, just after his inauguration, Gov.

Analysts predicted that this would add more than $4 billion to the state deficit.

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.|$|E
25|$|Title {{insurance}} {{is available in}} many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, China, Korea and throughout Europe. However, while {{a substantial number of}} properties located in these countries are insured by U.S. title insurers, they do not constitute a significant share of the real estate transactions in those countries. They also do not constitute a large share of U.S. title insurers' revenues. In many cases these are properties to be used for commercial purposes by U.S. companies doing business abroad, or properties financed by U.S lenders. The U.S. companies involved buy title insurance to obtain the security of a U.S. insurer backing up the evidence of title that they <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other country's land registration system, and payment of legal defense costs if the title is challenged.|$|E
