40|$|Purpose: For {{patients}} with stage III (N 2) non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with surgical resection, postoperative chemotherapy improves overall survival (OS), but {{the role of}} postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is controversial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate risk factors for local-regional recurrence and to evaluate the impact of PORT on local-regional control (LRC) and OS in a modern series of {{patients with}} surgically resected stage III (N 2) NSCLC. Methods and materials: A retrospective review was performed of patients with Stage III (N 2) NSCLC who underwent curative intent resection at our institution between February 1999 and January 2012. OS, LRC, and metastasis-free survival were estimated from the date of surgery using the Kaplan Meier method. Results: A total of 71 patients were included in the study. Patient median age was 63 years. Histology was adenocarcinoma in 69 % of patients. Pretreatment positron emission tomography/computed tomography staging was performed for 90 % of patients, and preoperative chemotherapy was administered in 23 %. The rate of R 0 resection was 96 %. Forty-one patients (58 %) <b>received</b> <b>PORT</b> and the median PORT dose was 50 Gy (range, 41. 4 - 60 Gy). The median follow-up time for living patients was 5. 0 years. Five-year OS for all patients was 66 %. OS at 5 years for patients who <b>received</b> <b>PORT</b> compared with patients who did not <b>receive</b> <b>PORT</b> was 71 % versus 60 %, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 61; 95 % CI, 0. 30 - 1. 44; P =. 28). LRC at 5 years for patients who <b>received</b> <b>PORT</b> compared with patients who did not <b>receive</b> <b>PORT</b> was 89 % versus 76 %, respectively (HR, 0. 44; 95 % CI, 0. 13 - 1. 45; P =. 17). Factors associated with decreased LRC were male sex (P =. 011) and primary tumor (pT) stage (pT 3 / 4 vs. pT 1 / 2, P =. 006). Metastasis-free survival at 5 years for patients who <b>received</b> <b>PORT</b> compared with those who did not <b>receive</b> <b>PORT</b> was 62 % versus 63 %, respectively (HR, 1. 07; 95 % CI, 0. 51 - 2. 40; P =. 86).

40|$|The US Army and Team Crusader (United Defense, Lockheed Martin Armament Systems, etc.) are {{developing}} {{the next generation}} howitzer, the Crusader. The development program includes an advanced, self-propelled liquid propellant howitzer and a companion resupply vehicle. The resupply vehicle is intended to rendezvous with the howitzer near the battlefront and replenish ammunition, fuel, and other material. The Army has recommended that Crusader incorporate new and innovative technologies to improve performance and safety. One conceptual design proposes a robotic resupply boom on the resupply vehicle to upload supplies to the howitzer. The resupply boom would normally be retracted inside the resupply vehicle during transit. When the two vehicles are within range of the resupply boom, the boom would be extended to a <b>receiving</b> <b>port</b> on the howitzer. In order to reduce exposure to small arms fire or nuclear, biological, and chemical hazards, the crew would remain inside the resupply vehicle during the resupply operation. The process of extending the boom and linking with the <b>receiving</b> <b>port</b> is called docking. A boom operator would be designated to maneuver the boom {{into contact with the}} <b>receiving</b> <b>port</b> using a mechanical joystick. The docking operation depends greatly upon the skill of the boom operator to manipulate the boom into docking position.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master’s {{thesis is}} to develop a {{solution}} for combining speed and performance of switched Ethernet with the real time capability and determinism of sophisticated in- vehicle networks.

To validate the developed media access algorithm several examples with different traffic assumptions and architectures were generated and investigated based on their sending and receiving utilization.

40|$|Purpose: Merkel cell {{carcinoma}} (MCC) {{is a rare}} and often aggressive skin cancer. Typically, surgery is the primary treatment. Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is often recommended to improve local control. It is unclear whether PORT is indicated in patients with favorable Stage IA head and neck (HN) MCC. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 46 low-risk HN MCC cases treated between 2006 and 2015. Inclusion criteria were defined as a primary tumor size of ≤ 2 cm, negative pathological margins, negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, and no immunosuppression. Local recurrence (LR) was defined as tumor recurrence within 2 cm of the primary surgical bed and estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Omission of PORT was offered to all 46 patients, of which 23 patients <b>received</b> <b>PORT</b> and 23 did not. No patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. There {{were no significant differences}} in surgical margins, tumor size, depth, lympho-vascular invasion status, or demographics between the two patient groups.

Conclusions: For patients with HN MCC, omission of PORT was associated with a significantly higher risk of local recurrence even among those patients with the lowest-risk tumors (i. e., Stage IA without immune suppression).
