5|$|Mike was in {{character}} the entire time. He and Madonna <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a great chemistry together. This video shows her absolutely hysterical sense of humour, and it's great {{for everyone to}} see that side of her. This was by far the most fun I've ever had making a video.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|Evra {{developed}} {{an interest in}} football {{at a young age}} and was fascinated by the play of former Brazilian international Romário, though he never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> an idol. He also earned good grades in school. Evra is married to Sandra with whom he has a son, Lenny and a daughter, Maona. He speaks five languages: his native French, English, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. He also attempted to learn Korean in order to better communicate with Park Ji-sung, his former South Korean teammate at Manchester United.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott <b>really</b> <b>had,</b> in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|Ste {{comes out}} to ex-girlfriend Amy first.

Ste is very relieved by Amy's good reaction. Amy {{is the one who}} discovers that Brendan is hitting Ste and she tells Ste to break it off, reminding him of how it was when he was hitting her.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he <b>really</b> <b>had</b> any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E

5|$|On the April 5 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hardy was {{introduced}} {{as a member}} of Team Hogan for the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would face Team Flair. One week later, however, Hardy was injured when James Storm spewed a volatile liquid against a flame from his lighter, forming a fireball that singed most of Hardy's face. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Hardy, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm). At Sacrifice, Hardy defeated Mr. Anderson. After the event, Anderson turned face and eventually managed to convince the skeptical Hardy that he <b>really</b> <b>had</b> changed, after which the two went on to form a tag team. At Slammiversary VIII, Hardy and Anderson, now known as Enigmatic Assholes, defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentation}} of the various phrases of the construction {{makes no mention of}} anyone other than Bernardino delle Croci, {{but it is not clear}} if he <b>really</b> <b>had</b> the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners <b>really</b> <b>had</b> no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E

25|$|In New York and Pennsylvania, anti-Mormonism dealt {{mainly with}} issues {{including}} {{whether or not}} Smith actually had the gold plates; whether those plates belonged to the people rather than Smith; whether or not Smith ever <b>really</b> <b>had</b> had visions (at least ones of theological import); Smith's treasure-digging episodes; and alleged occult practices by Smith.|$|E

25|$|Historians of European {{witchcraft}} {{have found}} the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European and British witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, {{as well as some}} who <b>really</b> <b>had</b> attempted to cause harm by thought alone. European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an ideology for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.|$|E
25|$|Many testified falsely against Jesus, {{but their}} {{statements}} did not agree.

Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.|$|E

25|$|Related activities, {{just after}} WWII, {{included}} a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), first in Greece. Another MAAG went to French Indochina in 1950. The U.S. <b>really</b> <b>had</b> no formal organization for providing foreign internal defense (FID) assistance, before {{the creation of}} the United States special operations forces. MAAG activities were intended to be largely advisory (i.e., noncombat), while the Special Forces was designed from the beginning for training and leading guerrillas of the host nation against an occupier.|$|E
