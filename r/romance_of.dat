5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love.

5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé.

5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some {{eight years}} her junior, {{who chaired the}} Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the {{daughter}} of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield's biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as the <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> Bondfield's life.|$|E
