40|$|AbstractHigh Thrust Cryogenic Rocket Stages entail {{the use of}} a Vent and Relief Valve {{which can}} cater to a higher {{discharge}} rate. The Vent function is called for during ground servicing operations like tank chilling and pressurant replenishment and during flight {{to take care of the}} decrease in ambient pressure and boil-off losses. The <b>Relief</b> <b>function</b> acts as a redundant feature to protect the tanks from catastrophic failure due to structural damage caused by over-pressurization. Nevertheless, this valve needs to be characterized for both these functions during ground tests. This paper describes the modelling of and experimentation on an Inverted Type Pilot Operated Vent and Safety Valve. A mathematical model for simulating the dynamic behavior of this tank-mounted valve is developed. For this, a set of non-linear, first order, coupled ordinary differential equations, based on laws of conservation of mass and energy, are derived using fixed control volume approach. The numerical solution of these equations is obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The pressure, temperature, flow rate, seat stress and lift thus obtained are plotted to find the characteristic parameters such as cracking pressure, full flow pressure, reseal pressure, opening and closing response, tank pressure decay rate and full flow rate. The valve performance is studied for the effect of main valve outlet orifice and the pilot valve outlet orifice using these simulations. These results are validated by comparing it to the test results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Despite the {{widespread}} treatments for osteoarthritis (OA), data on treatment patterns, adequacy of pain relief, {{and quality of}} life are limited. The prospective multinational Survey of Osteoarthritis Real World Therapies (SORT) was designed to investigate these aspects. Objectives: To analyze the characteristics and the patient reported outcomes of the Portuguese dataset of SORT at the start of observation. Methods: Patients ≥ 50 years with primary knee OA who were receiving oral or topical analgesics were eligible. Patients were enrolled from seven healthcare centers in Portugal between January and December 2011. Pain and function were evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and WOMAC. Quality of life was assessed using the 12 -Item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 12). Inadequate pain relief (IPR) was defined as a score > 4 / 10 on item 5 of the BPI. Results: Overall, 197 patients were analyzed. The median age was 67. 0 years and 78. 2 % were female. Mean duration of knee OA was 6. 2 years. IPR was reported by 51. 3 % of patients. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio - OR 2. 15 [95 %CI 1. 1, 4. 5]), diabetes (OR 3. 1 [95 %CI 1. 3, 7. 7]) and depression (OR 2. 24 [95 %CI 1. 2, 4. 3]) were associated with higher risk of IPR. Patients with IPR reported worst outcomes in all dimensions of WOMAC (p < 0. 001) and in all eight domains and summary components of SF- 12 (p < 0. 001).

PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects.

Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money.
