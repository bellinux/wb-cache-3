5|$|Many {{animals and}} plants have taken up {{residence}} in urban environments. They tend to be adaptable generalists and use the town's features to make their homes. Rats and mice have followed man around the globe, pigeons, peregrines, sparrows, swallows and house martins use the buildings for nesting, bats use <b>roof</b> <b>space</b> for roosting, foxes visit the garbage bins and squirrels, coyotes, raccoons and skunks roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around Chicago. A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities {{in the twentieth century}} found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 butterflies and moths, 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants {{and a number of other}} groups. In warmer climates, termites are serious pests in the urban habitat; 183 species are known to affect buildings and 83 species cause serious structural damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{hospital building}} is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 was new, {{and the second}} provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted <b>roof</b> <b>space,</b> accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.|$|E

25|$|The {{hand loom}} with {{jacquard}} is a wooden hand loom {{typical of the}} many thousands of looms {{that were used in}} the domestic cottage industry throughout the British Isles. They were gradually replaced by all-metal looms (see the Hattersley domestic loom) and new methods of working practice, such as the factory system, during the Industrial Revolution. The loom has a four-shuttle drop box to weave up to four colours of weft, and has John Kay's flying shuttle method of inserting the weft. Most of the handlooms used in the home were ordinary shaft looms. These do not require <b>roof</b> <b>space</b> and would be weaving standard cloths, unlike this loom which is fitted with a 360 hook de Vogue jacquard and can weave very complex fabrics.|$|E
25|$|After the {{successful}} trial, £30 million proposals were drawn {{up and went}} on public consultation in January 2012 followed by a planning application in February 2012. The application outlined plans to transform the building into a 152-bedroom luxury hotel. The restoration would comprise remodeling the original 230 rooms into 152 air conditioned rooms, 8 new suites, with two new roof terraces in previously unused <b>roof</b> <b>space,</b> and nine new meeting rooms in the former stock rooms. Other elements include {{the creation of a}} terrace in the central courtyard, a hotel bar and restaurant accessed from Colmore Row, a standalone bar on the corner of Church Street and Barwick Street, a new main entrance on Church Street, and refurbished shops on Colmore Row based on a harmonised design and colour scheme. The stonework façades on Colmore Row and Church Street, the Grosvenor Suites and the grand staircase will be restored.|$|E
25|$|The teacher's {{house had}} three levels {{and apart from}} ornate {{external}} stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen's cottages. The basement contained a storage cellar, pantry and space for a WC. As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC's were actually installed. The ground floor contained two living rooms, one with a sink, range and access to a private yard. An entrance hall opened to the stair hall. At the mezzanine landing of the stair was a door into the school corridor. On the first floor there were two bedrooms, each with a fireplace, and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower. Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central chimney stack supported by an arch (hidden in the <b>roof</b> <b>space)</b> across the stair hall. This was unusual and expensive form of construction, but visually impressive.|$|E

500|$|The hall {{has been}} said to be [...] "among the most {{impressive}} of all the Oxford college halls", with its [...] "fine panelling, austere ceiling, and its notable paintings". Like the chapel, it was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620, and was finally completed soon {{after his death in}} 1620. Pevsner noted the [...] "elaborately decorated columns" [...] of the screen (installed in 1634) and the dragons along the frieze, and said {{that it was one of}} the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four [...] "L" [...] shapes around a centre. In 1741 and 1742, the oak-beamed roof was covered with plaster to make rooms in the <b>roof</b> <b>space.</b> Pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall, which contains the college crest, as [...] "large [...] rich". The hall contains a portrait of Elizabeth I, as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors.

500|$|During the 1880s, Antony had Henry Woodyer {{redesign}} {{the hallway}} staircase. This allowed more light to permeate the lower floors from the glazed lantern roof, and hence turn the hallway into a reception room. Woodyer also extended the Dining Room by taking {{in part of}} the original housekeeper's room. Crace's original wallpaper– a British imitation of Japanese paper, that itself imitated Spanish tooled leather– was lightened by a 14-year-old apprentice who hand-painted in a cream background. The sideboard, which had been commissioned from Collier and Plucknett, was further extended. New items were also ordered from Collier and Plucknett. Simultaneously, Antony had electricity installed, an early UK example of houses being lit in this way. Antony spent the first night after turning on the electrical system watching the main entrance light, to ensure that it did not create a fire and was hence safe for his family. At some point between 1868 and 1884 a water hydraulic lift was installed by Waygood and Co., the remains of which were discovered in 2008. A wooden lift car was discovered on the ground floor and a [...] spanning sheave in the <b>roof</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{vaulting}} a <b>roof</b> <b>space</b> using stone {{ribs and}} panels of infill, the bearing ribs all spring from columns along the walls. There is commonly a rib called the ridge rib which {{runs along the}} apex of the vault. There may be intermediate or [...] "tierceron" [...] ribs, which have their origin at the columns. In Decorated Gothic there are occasionally short lierne ribs connecting the bearing and tierceron ribs at angles, forming stellar patterns. This is the feature that appears at Bristol, at a very early date, and quite unlike the way that [...] "lierne" [...] ribs are used elsewhere. In this case, there is no ridge rib, and the lierne ribs are arranged to enclose a series of panels that extend the whole way along the centre of the choir roof, interacting with the large east window by reflecting the light from the smoothly arching surfaces. From the nave can be seen the intricate tracery of the east window echoed in the rich lierne pattern of the tower vault, which is scarcely higher than the choir, and therefore clearly visible. The two aisles of the choir both also have vaults of unique character, with open transverse arches and ribs above the stone bridges.|$|E
500|$|In 1741 and 1742, a {{total of}} £423 17s 4d was spent on the hall, which {{included}} the cost of covering the oak-beamed roof with plaster and making rooms in the original <b>roof</b> <b>space.</b> Writing in 1891, Llewellyn Thomas noted that the plaster roof was added to create attic rooms to increase the accommodation of the lodgings. He expressed {{the hope that the}} hall might soon regain its original proportions, following the enlargement of the lodgings a few years previously. This has not happened, and the plaster ceiling remains. However, in 2003, partitions between the rooms were knocked through to convert them into teaching rooms and the renovations enabled {{the upper part of the}} hall's hammerbeam roof to be seen from inside the rooms. Pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall, which contains the college crest, as [...] "large [...] rich". Tyack noted the [...] "lively Rococo plasterwork" [...] of the flat ceiling. In the early 19th century the east and west sides of the hall were crenellated, and the roof was re-slated. A clock was installed on the external wall of the hall in 1831 by the principal Henry Foulkes. There is a college tradition that students aim a champagne cork at the clock after finishing their final university examinations; hitting it is supposed to mean that the student will obtain a first class honours degree. An extensive fire on 4 December 1913 threatened to destroy the hall before it was brought under control. In the rebuilding work that followed, a gallery was added to the hall, with the balustrade joining the 1634 screen. The hall contains a portrait of ElizabethI, as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors. There are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors: Charles I (by Anthony van Dyck) and Charles II (by Sir Peter Lely). It has been said to be [...] "among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls", with its [...] "fine panelling, austere ceiling, and its notable paintings".|$|E

50|$|Collections of specimens, {{especially}} of insects, are also vulnerable to attack, making A. verbasci a common pest in museums. In a 1987 survey of British national history museums, {{at least five}} noted that A. verbasci was categorised as a major pest for biological collections. Larvae are often found in the nests of sparrows and wagtails, and so larvae and adults may enter museums at upper levels through windows and <b>roof</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Before {{the days}} of {{mechanised}} farming, hop picking was a labour-intensive process, requiring a vastly greater number of people than were available locally. Whole families (including children {{who could have been}} at school) from London, particularly the south-east and east of London, would leave their homes and spend their time working in the Wealden hop-fields of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. By the 1870s, the South Eastern Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway were running Hop Pickers' Specials to transport Londoners to the towns and villages {{at the start of the}} season. Similar trains were run to serve the pickers in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. An estimated 250,000 hop pickers from London were travelling to Kent by the early twentieth century [...] In Hampshire, some workers came from the Portsmouth, Southampton and Salisbury areas. Hopper huts were also provided in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Workers in these two counties would come from the Black Country or South Wales. The miners from South Wales remained at home and carried on working at their pits. Accommodation in the early Victorian period would be in barns, stables, cattle sheds, pigsties, tents or the <b>roof</b> <b>space</b> of buildings. This led to problems with hygiene and therefore health. An outbreak of cholera killed 43 hop-pickers at East Farleigh in September 1849.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek Ministry of Finance has now {{installed}} a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens. [...] The so-called [...] "oikostegi" [...] (Greek – oiko, pronounced eeko, meaning building-ecological, and stegi, pronounced staygee, meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September, 2008. [...] Studies of the thermodynamics {{of the roof}} in September 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation. [...] In further studies, in August 2009, energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation. [...] The ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares. [...] The oikostegi covers 650m2, equalling 52% of the <b>roof</b> <b>space</b> and 8% of the total floor space. [...] Despite this, energy savings totalling €5,630 per annum were recorded, which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building. [...] An additional observation and conclusion {{of the study was}} that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months {{between the first and second}} study. [...] This suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further. [...] The study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras, a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof, such as butterflies, honey bees and ladybirds. [...] Obviously this was not the case before installation. [...] Finally, the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of Constitution Square, in Athens, Greece had been improved by the oikostegi.|$|E
