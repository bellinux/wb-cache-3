There are equations of state discussed in the article, i. e. the model of an ideal mixture of ideal gases, the model of an ideal mixture of <b>real</b> <b>gases</b> and the model based on the virial equation of state. The evaluation of sound speed based on the ideal mixture concept is mentioned. The sound speed calculated by the model of an ideal mixture of ideal gases is compared with the sound speed calculated by using the model based {{on the concept of}} an ideal mixture of <b>real</b> <b>gases.</b> The comparison of enthalpy end entropy based on the model of an ideal mixture of ideal gases and the model of an ideal mixture of <b>real</b> <b>gases</b> is performed.

25|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have {{an effect}} on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is van der Waals force. These forces {{play a key role in}} determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a <b>real</b> <b>gas</b> to be treated like an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use of ideal gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.|$|E
25|$|In thermodynamics, the Joule–Thomson effect (also {{known as}} the Joule–Kelvin effect, Kelvin–Joule effect, or Joule–Thomson expansion) {{describes}} the temperature change of a <b>real</b> <b>gas</b> or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while kept insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule–Thomson process. At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule–Thomson process; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{equation}} of state, {{it is important to}} remember that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry.

The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines.
