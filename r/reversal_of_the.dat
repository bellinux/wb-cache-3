5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new chaotic system of three coupled {{ordinary}} differential equations, limited to quadratic nonlinear terms. A {{wide variety of}} dynamical regimes are reported. For some parameters, chaotic <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitudes are produced by crisis-induced intermittency, following a mechanism different from what is generally observed in similar deterministic models. Despite its simplicity, this system therefore generates a rich dynamics, able to model more complex physical systems. In particular, a comparison with <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth shows a surprisingly good agreement, and highlights <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> deterministic chaos to describe geomagnetic field dynamics.

5|$|After also {{suffering}} financial {{losses and}} ownership struggles, the Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated {{the team to}} Winnipeg, a stark <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league's attempts to expand into the southern United States. Initially replacing the Thrashers in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division, {{as part of a}} realignment to four divisions, the Jets were moved to the Western Conference's Central Division before the 2013–14 season. The Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were then assigned to the Eastern Conference's Atlantic and Metropolitan divisions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{mechanism}} for oscillatory or random <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field that occur from a stationary dynamo state. The basic ingredient is <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> two nearly critical dynamo eigenmodes, {{a stable and}} an unstable one, that collide during a saddle-node bifurcation. Above this bifurcation, a finite amplitude limit cycle is generated. In <b>the</b> neighbourhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bifurcation, even {{a small amount of}} turbulent fluctuations is enough to generate random <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field. When the two competing eigenmodes have different symmetries, this scenario requires a broken symmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow that generates the dynamo. This is in good agreement with <b>the</b> observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VKS experiment.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{techniques}} of nonlinear dynamics to compare a special model for <b>the</b> <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's magnetic field with the observational data.

5|$|Central to the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit was {{the fact}} that the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and {{experience}} with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E

In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} finding <b>of</b> {{spontaneous}} flow <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> roll-like patterns in liquid gallium Rayleigh-Bénard convection.

The basic flow pattern observed in the vessel is a four-roll structure with its axis parallel to the magnetic field. Emergence of a new circulation at a corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel causes flow <b>reversal</b> with reorganization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole pattern.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reversals</b> and reorientations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large scale circulation (LSC) of convective fluid in a cylindrical container of aspect ratio one. We take Prandtl number to be 0. 7 and Rayleigh {{numbers in the}} range from 6 × 10 ^ 5 to 3 × 10 ^ 7. It is observed that <b>the</b> <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LSC are induced by its reorientation along the azimuthal direction, which are quantified using <b>the</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Fourier mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical velocity measured near the lateral surface in the mid plane. During a "complete reversal", the above phase changes by around 180 ^ 0 leading to <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical velocity at all the probes. On the contrary, the vertical velocity reverses only at some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probes during a "partial reversal" with phase change other than 180 ^ 0. Numerically we observe rotation-led and cessation-led reorientations, in agreement with earlier experimental results. <b>The</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second Fourier mode and the first Fourier mode rises sharply during the cessation-led reorientations.

In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch.
