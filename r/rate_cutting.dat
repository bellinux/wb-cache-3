40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{conventional}} drilling process and a circular milling process are compared {{with respect to}} delamination and fiber protrusion when machining carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The tool design (tool orthogonal clearance, drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed <b>rate,</b> <b>cutting</b> speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when circular milling. In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral {{angle at the circumference}} cutter and no feed in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special circular milling process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) as well as the setting parameters (depth of cut, feed <b>rate,</b> <b>cutting</b> speed, up and down milling) are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope. The fiber protrusion are visually identified {{with the help of an}} adapted imageprocessing algorithm. The diameters of the rivet holes are measured on two planes of the hole by a coordinate measuring machine. The cylindricity of the holes is determined using an instrument for roundness measurement...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of microwave treatment, especially at low power level on compressive strength and <b>cutting</b> <b>rate</b> of granite rock by using multimodal cavity. The power level and cooling rate of treated samples were found to have an effect on the compressive strength, and the <b>cutting</b> <b>rate.</b> This effect is due to the induction of the plastic zones and micro cracks in the rock matrix, especially at the grain boundaries induced by the thermal stresses of rock forming minerals which have the difference in dielectric properties after microwave heating for a certain exposure time together with the thermal-shock treatment after the heating. It was found that the strength of treated granite is less than 60 % of the original after 30 minutes of exposure. The dry heated samples with a water quenching seem to be the most affected samples. They exhibit a significant decrease in compressive strength up to 70 % and <b>cutting</b> <b>rate</b> up to 38 % after 30 -minute treatment at the power of 850 W, and after 10 -minute treatment at the power of 600 W respectively.

If the cumulative sum of the transmission rate does not exceed the threshold limit, the communication among the nodes is initiated for all the connections without any degradation of service.
