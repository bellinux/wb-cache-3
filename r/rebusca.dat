50|$|This leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between בננה (Banana) and אננס (Ananas - Pineapple). In Banana, teams {{made their way to}} Finca La <b>Rebusca,</b> a banana plantation, and entered the field of banana trees. Each team was given a number, and teams would have to find five bushels of bananas that were marked with this number and harvest them. They would then load the five bushels onto a hanging track and use the local pulley system to deliver them to the {{preparation}} plant, where they would receive their next clue. In Pineapple, teams made their way to a nearby pineapple field where they would have to harvest 100 pineapples and then load them into a truck. After this chore was complete, teams would get their next clue.|$|E
