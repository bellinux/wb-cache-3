40|$|Background: Robotic <b>rollators</b> {{enhance the}} basic {{functions}} of established devices by technically advanced physical, cognitive, or sensory support to increase autonomy in persons with severe impairment. In {{the evaluation of}} such ambient assisted living solutions, both the technical and user perspectives are important to prove usability, effectiveness and safety, and to ensure adequate device application. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the methodology of studies evaluating robotic <b>rollators</b> with focus on the user perspective and to give recommendations for future evaluation studies. Methods: A systematic literature search up to December 31, 2014, was conducted based on the Cochrane Review methodology using the electronic databases PubMed and IEEE Xplore. Articles were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: evaluation studies of robotic <b>rollators</b> documenting human-robot interaction, no case reports, published in English language. Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified that met the predefined inclusion criteria. Large heterogeneity in the definitions of the target user group, study populations, study designs and assessment methods was found across the included studies. No generic methodology to evaluate robotic <b>rollators</b> could be identified. We found major methodological shortcomings related to insufficient sample descriptions and sample sizes, and lack of appropriate, standardized and validated assessment methods. Long-term use in habitual environment was also not evaluated. Conclusions: Apart from the heterogeneity, methodological deficits {{in most of the}} identified studies became apparent. Recommendations for future evaluation studies include: clear definition of target user group, adequate selection of subjects, inclusion of other assistive mobility devices for comparison, evaluation of the habitual use of advanced prototypes, adequate assessment strategy with established, standardized and validated methods, and statistical analysis of study results. Assessment strategies may additionally focus on specific functionalities of the robotic <b>rollators</b> allowing an individually tailored assessment of innovative features to document their added value...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mobility devices (MDs) such {{as walking}} sticks, <b>rollators</b> and wheelchairs, often play an {{important}} role for older people living at home, striving to remain independent in everyday activities. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore how the use of MDs changes over time among very old people in five European countries. METHODS: Empirical data from the ENABLE-AGE Survey Study, part of a major interdisciplinary research project carried out in Sweden (n= 314), Germany (n= 322), the United Kingdom (n= 316), Hungary (n= 179), and Latvia (n= 225), were used. RESULTS: The use of MDs in the Swedish, German and UK samples showed a significant increase between the first occasion of data collection (T 1) and the second (T 2), 12 months later. A walking stick was the most common MD on both occasions, with the exception that the number of users of <b>rollators</b> outdoors exceeded the number of users of walking sticks in the Swedish sample at T 2. Among non-users of MDs at T 1, 12 - 21 % became new users at T 2. Continued use was seen between T 1 and T 2 (80 - 94 %) in the various samples, but the type of MD used changed. In the Swedish, German and UK samples, significant changes were seen in the use of MDs with greater assistive potential over the year. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the pattern of MD use changes over a short period of time. More research is needed to determine outcomes of MD use in very old age, focusing on the extent to which MDs decrease disability during the aging process, not least in a European perspective...|$|R

The 6MWD has demonstrated validity and reliability after one familiarisation test and the capacity to detect changes following pulmonary rehabilitation.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>rollator</b> is a {{very popular}} walking aid. However, {{knowledge}} about how a <b>rollator</b> affects the walking patterns is limited. Thus, {{the purpose of the}} study was to investigate the biomechanical effects of walking with and without a <b>rollator</b> on the walking pattern in healthy subjects. Methods The walking pattern during walking with and without <b>rollator</b> was analyzed using a three-dimensional inverse dynamics method. Sagittal joint dynamics and kinematics of the ankle, knee and hip were calculated. In addition, hip joint dynamics and kinematics in the frontal plane were calculated. Seven healthy women participated in the study. Results The hip was more flexed while the knee and ankle joints were less flexed/dorsiflexed during <b>rollator</b> walking. The ROM of the ankle and knee joints was reduced during rollator-walking. Rollator-walking caused a reduction in the knee extensor moment by 50 % when compared to normal walking. The ankle plantarflexor and hip abductor moments were smaller when walking with a <b>rollator.</b> In contrast, the angular impulse of the hip extensors was significantly increased during rollator-walking. Conclusion Walking with a <b>rollator</b> unloaded the ankle and especially the knee extensors, increased the hip flexion and thus the contribution of hip extensors to produce movement. Thus, <b>rollator</b> walking did not result in an overall unloading of the muscles and joints of the lower extremities. However, the long-term effect of <b>rollator</b> walking is unknown and further investigation in this field is needed. </p...|$|E

For the 3 Dreconstruction of the body segments it was used a movement analysis system. Results showed that the effects of assisted gait can be explained through support, energy consumption, posture and balance characteristics.

40|$|Abstract — Cognitive {{assistance}} of a <b>rollator</b> (wheeled walker) user tends to reduce the attentional capacity of the user and may impact her stability. Hence, {{it is important to}} understand and track the pose of <b>rollator</b> users before augmenting a <b>rollator</b> with some form of cognitive assistance. While the majority of current markerless vision systems focus on estimating 2 D and 3 D walking motion in the sagittal plane, we wish to estimate the 3 D pose of <b>rollator</b> users ’ lower limbs from observing image sequences in the coronal (frontal) plane. Our apparatus poses a unique set of challenges: a single monocular view of only the lower limbs and a frontal perspective of the <b>rollator</b> user. Since motion in the coronal plane is relatively subtle, we explore multiple cues within a Bayesian probabilistic framework to formulate a posterior estimate for a given subject’s leg limbs. In this work, our focus is on evaluating the appearance model (the cues). Preliminary experiments indicate that texture and colour cues conditioned on the appearance of a <b>rollator</b> user outperform more general cues, at the cost of manually initializing the appearance offline.

SETTING: Outpatient clinic at university hospital. PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with COPD in stable clinical condition. One patient had mild COPD, five patients had moderate COPD, six patients had severe COPD, and two patients had very severe COPD. INTERVENTIONS: Two 6 MWTs were performed with a portable metabolic system (VmaxST 1. 0; Viasys Healthcare; MEDA; Aartselaar, Belgium) with a <b>rollator</b> and without a <b>rollator,</b> in random order. In addition, maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) was measured with and without a <b>rollator,</b> randomly. RESULTS: The median 6 MWT distance increased significantly with a rollator: 416 m without a <b>rollator</b> (interquartile range [IQR], 396 to 435 m), vs 462 m with a <b>rollator</b> (IQR, 424 to 477 m) [p = 0. 04]. Significant increases were also seen in oxygen uptake (0. 04 L/min [IQR, - 0. 002 to 0. 09 L/min]); tidal volume (0. 06 L/min [IQR, - 0. 001 to 0. 11 L/min]); and Ve (0. 95 L/min [IQR, - 0. 67 to 7. 1 L/min]), recorded in the last minute of the 6 MWT; as well as in MVV (3 L/min [IQR, 0 to 12 L/min]) [p < 0. 05 for all]. Borg dyspnea scores tended to be lower with a rollator: 6 (IQR, 4 to 7) without a <b>rollator,</b> vs 5 (IQR, 4 to 7) with a <b>rollator</b> (p = 0. 10). The variation in the 6 MWT was explained by individual changes in walking efficiency (partial R(2) = 0. 31) and changes in Ve (partial R(2) = 0. 36) [p model < 0. 04].

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and perception of robotic <b>rollators</b> (RRs) {{from the perspective of}} users. Methods: Studies identified in a previous systematic review published on 2016 on the methodology of studies evaluating RRs by the user perspective were re-screened for eligibility based on the following inclusion criteria: evaluation of the human–robot interaction from the user perspective, use of standardized outcome measurements, and quantitative presentation of study results. Results: Seventeen studies were eligible for inclusion. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies, a narrative synthesis of study results was conducted. We found conflicting results concerning the effectiveness of the robotic functionalities of the RRs. Only a few studies reported superior user performance or reduced physical demands with the RRs compared to unassisted conditions or conventional assistive mobility devices; however, without providing statistical evidence. The user perception of the RRs was found to be generally positive. Conclusions: There is still no sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of RRs from the user perspective.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{advances}} in technology make possible the incorporation of sensors and actuators in <b>rollators,</b> building safer robots and extending the use of walkers to a more diverse population. This paper presents a new method for the extraction of navigation related components from upper-body force interaction data in walker assisted gait. A filtering architecture is designed to cancel: (i) the high-frequency noise caused by vibrations on the walker's structure due to irregularities on the terrain or walker's wheels and (ii) the cadence related force components caused by user's trunk oscillations during gait. As a result, a third component related to user's navigation commands is distinguished. Results For the cancelation of high-frequency noise, a Benedict-Bordner g-h filter was designed presenting very low values for Kinematic Tracking Error ((2. 035 ± 0. 358) · 10 - 2 kgf) and delay ((1. 897 ± 0. 3697) · 10 1 ms). A Fourier Linear Combiner filtering architecture was implemented for the adaptive attenuation of about 80 % of the cadence related components' energy from force data. This was done without compromising {{the information contained in}} the frequencies close to such notch filters. Conclusions The presented methodology offers an effective cancelation of the undesired components from force data, allowing the system to extract in real-time voluntary user's navigation commands. Based on this real-time identification of voluntary user's commands, a classical approach to the control architecture of the robotic walker is being developed, in order to obtain stable and safe user assisted locomotion. </p...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, not all {{pedestrian}} paths {{are accessible}} for mobility impaired people. Especially paths which consist of complex public spaces and old streets constitute problems. However, no reliable information is (quickly) available about problems that cause hindrance. The sensing <b>rollator</b> called meet <b>rollator</b> {{is equipped with}} several sensors that provide detailed data about a range of factors which affect the accessibility of the outdoors environment. A meet <b>rollator</b> gathers data that is supplementary, new and different. The goal of this thesis is to use sensor-data collected by a meet <b>rollator</b> to develop a geo-database that provides insight into the accessibility of pedestrian routes for mobility impaired people who need a wheelchair, <b>rollator</b> or mobility scooter. In order to achieve this goal, the following research question is defined: Does the current setting of the meet <b>rollator</b> {{provide insight into the}} accessibility of pedestrian routes for mobility impaired people? If not, how can the current setting be improved? This research has evaluated the available sensor (handheld Global Positioning System (GPS), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS and camera) data collected by a meet <b>rollator.</b> Literature study showed that in order to determine walking restrictions in the outdoor activity space of people with mobility impairments, the geometrical demands for movement can be taken into account. According to the Manual-book of Accessibility and an expert Job Haug, a good pedestrian path for people with a wheelchair, <b>rollator</b> and scoot mobile has to meet three geometrical demands for movement. This means that a pedestrian path forms an obstacle if it is narrower than 0. 9 meter, steeper than 9. 46 ° or if the height difference on the path is higher than 0. 05 meter. The outcome, according to the assessment of the three available sensors (handheld Global Positioning System (GPS), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS and camera) of the meet <b>rollator</b> by using the knowledge of the Master of Science program Geomatics, is that with a handheld GPS no precise positioning can be reached. Therefore handheld GPS data is not useful for generating accessibility information. According to the knowledge the two sensors RTK GPS and camera are useful for generating accessibility information. The outcome, according to the implementation of the developed workflow for deriving outdoor accessibility information for a selected research area, is that some paths in the outdoor environment of Amsterdam require improvements to make them accessible for mobility impaired people. Furthermore through data processing, more insight is gained into the usefulness of RTK GPS and camera data. The results showed that the used sensors did not provide the needed precision. For the validation of the derived outdoor accessibility information a division is made between the validation of RTK GPS observations and camera observations. The BGT+ is proved suitable for providing more insight in and put semantics to the total observations obtained by implementing the workflows. The ground truth is proved suitable for validating the obtained accessibility information derived from RTK GPS and camera data. Finally, the results of an algorithm made by the Urban Modelling Group (UMG) of the University College Dublin are proved suitable for validating the obtained accessibility information derived from camera data. A geo-database that structures the validated accessibility information is created in order to give an overview of the accessible and non-accessible paths for the research area. The derived accessibility information obtained via camera data can best be stored by using polygons, to represent complex areas. The derived accessibility information obtained via RTK GPS data can best be stored by using line strings. In conclusion, this MSc thesis has demonstrated that the current setting of the meet <b>rollator</b> provides insight into the accessibility of pedestrian routes for mobility impaired people. However, the used sensors did not provide the needed precision. In order to improve the current setting of the meet <b>rollator</b> the usefulness of other sensors should be further investigated.

40|$|Current {{research}} in walkers and <b>rollators</b> with integrated intelligent computing and robotic components shows promise in treatment, management and rehabilitation {{of a variety}} of ailments and disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis. 	In this thesis a novel intelligent walker is designed, constructed and tested for the purpose of examining whether we can increase mobility among individuals with vision and cognitive impairments hindering their ability to move collision free about their environments, by detecting obstacles and using brakes to guide the user around them. 	This walker consists of a support frame, front castor wheels and rear particle brakes. Obstacle detection and localization are sensed by an onboard 3 D depth camera and RGB camera (The Microsoft Kinect) and encoders in the rear wheels. This data is processed by an onboard laptop, producing a 2 -dimensional map of the environment. This map is inputted into the control algorithms to make braking decisions for obstacle avoidance. 	Two control algorithms are presented. The first is an open loop proportional gain control which determines necessary braking torque directly from the distance to the nearest obstacle. The second is a closed loop control which uses the systems dynamics and velocity data from the wheel encoders to estimate the forces being applied by the user and calculates the braking torque necessary to avoid obstacles. 	The walker moment of inertia and the viscous damping parameters of the system are estimated experimentally. The effect of varying three parameters in the closed loop algorithm and one parameter in the open loop algorithm are examined in a corner turning test. Observations support predictions made by the derived system dynamics. 	Lastly, the efficiency of the system at real world obstacle avoidance is tested in a controlled indoor obstacle course using goggles to impair the vision of otherwise able bodied test subjects. The open loop control algorithm was found to reduce the occurrence of collisions by 44 % as compared to trials with no braking. The closed loop control algorithm was found to greatly reduce collisions with the front of the walker, however shows a tendency for over steering the user, producing a higher number of collisions with the walker's side. Possible causes and solutions to this problem are discussed. 	This thesis demonstrates promise in the approach of using braking to help walker users avoid collisions with their environments. Discussion is offered about necessary next steps towards testing with regular users of assisted walking devices, and eventually real world use...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the immediate effect of four-wheeled- walker(rollator) walking on lower-limb muscle activity and trunk-sway in healthy subjects.; In this cross-sectional design electromyographic (EMG) {{data was collected}} in six lower-limb muscle groups and trunk-sway was measured as peak-to-peak angular displacement of the centre-of-mass (level L 2 / 3) in the sagittal and frontal-planes using the SwayStar balance system. 19 subjects walked at self-selected speed firstly without a <b>rollator</b> then in randomised order 1. with <b>rollator</b> 2. with <b>rollator</b> with increased weight-bearing.; Rollator-walking caused statistically significant reductions in EMG activity in lower-limb muscle groups and effect-sizes were medium to large. Increased weight-bearing increased the effect. Trunk-sway in the sagittal and frontal-planes showed {{no statistically significant difference}} between conditions.; Rollator-walking reduces lower-limb muscle activity but trunk-sway remains unchanged as stability is likely gained through forces generated by the upper-limbs. Short-term stability is gained but the long-term effect is unclear and requires investigation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether {{walking with a}} <b>rollator</b> by persons 75 {{years of age or}} older is of sufficient intensity to improve aerobic fitness. Design: A cross-sectional cohort study. Setting: University movement laboratory. Participants: Fifteen subjects 75 years of age or older (mean age, 83. 7 y) who could only walk by using a <b>rollator.</b> Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: During 6 minutes of self-paced treadmill walking using a <b>rollator</b> at a mean walking speed of 0. 6 m/s, oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2)), carbon dioxide production, and heart rate were determined. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and energy expenditure were calculated. The energy expenditure was expressed as the number of metabolic equivalents (METS), the percentage of estimated maximal (V) over dotO(2) ((V) over dotO(2) max), the percentage of estimated (V) over dotO(2) max reserve, and the percentage of estimated maximal heart rate. Results: Mean (V) over dotO(2) was. 718 L/min. Mean RER was. 93 (95 % confidence interval [CI],. 89 -. 97). Thirteen participants showed an RER below 1. 0, which indicates a negligible contribution of anaerobic expenditure. Walking with a <b>rollator</b> required a mean of 2. 8 (95 % CI, 2. 4 - 3. 2) METS, 71. 9 % of (V) over dotO(2) max (95 % CI, 65. 2 %- 78. 6 %), 50. 5 % (95 % CI, 39. 4 %- 61. 5 %) of (V) over dotO(2) reserve, and 75. 2 % (95 % CI, 67. 6 %- 82. 8 %) of estimated maximal heart rate. Conclusions: For people 75 years of age or older, walking with a <b>rollator</b> is an activity of moderate to high level of intensity, with the capacity of improving aerobic fitness...|$|E
