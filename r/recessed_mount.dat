A simplified structure, a 2 D prismatic bump, located in a straight channel is used {{to better understand the}} bending flutter phenomenon. Time-resolved measurements of the unsteady surface pressures and the instantaneous model geometry measurements are performed in order to study the effect of the shock wave on the aerodynamic load acting over the flexible generic bump. The bump is oscillated in a controlled manner with amplitude of ± 0. 5 mm for four reduced frequencies ranging from k= 0. 123 to k= 0. 492. The experiments are performed for a transonic flow operating point characterized by an inlet Mach number of 0. 69 and a total inlet pressure of 160 kPa, with an outlet Mach number and outlet static pressure of 0. 79 and 106 kPa, respectively. The unsteady pressure measurements were performed using <b>recessed</b> <b>mounted</b> pressure transducers with Kulite fast response sensors.

40|$|Monolithic OptoPill {{integration}} {{by means}} of <b>recess</b> <b>mounting</b> is a heterogeneous technique employed to integrate III-V photonic devices on silicon CMOS circuits. The {{goal is to create}} an effective fabrication process that enables the volume production of high performance optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs). This thesis focuses on the development of post-assembly processes and technologies, in which InGaAs/InP P-i-N photodiodes were integrated as long wavelength photodetectors with an optical clock receiver circuit. Fabrication procedures, challenges experienced, and results accomplished are presented for each process step including the formation of alloyed and non-alloyed ohmic contacts on n-type and p-type InGaAs contact layers, active area definition by dry-etching InGaAs/InP with ECR-enhanced RIE, BCB passivation and planarization, via opening by dry-etching BCB with RIE, and top contact metallization. In conjunction, an InP-based test heterostructure was fabricated into discrete photodiodes. Decoupling the fabrication and benchmarking of III-V photonic device from the Si-CMOS electronic circuit allowed for the independent electrical and optical characterization of the photodetectors. Measurements and analysis of the P-i-N photodiodes will assist the forthcoming analysis of the final OEIC. Preliminary results and discussions of the calibration sample are presented in this thesis. by Yi-Shu Vivian Lei. Thesis (S. M.)

In RM 3 integration, partially processed heterostructure devices are placed in recesses formed in the dielectric layers covering the surface of an integrated circuit chip, the surface is planarized, and monolithic processing is continued to transform the heterostructures into optoelectronic devices monolithically integrated with the underlying electronic circuitry. Two different RM 3 techniques have been investigated, Aligned Pillar Bonding (APB) and OptoPill Assembly (OPA). APB integrates lattice mismatched materials using aligned, selective area wafer bonding at reduced temperature (under 3500 C), which protects the electronic chips from the adverse effects of high temperatures, and reduces the thermal expansion mismatch concerns. In the OPA technique, optoelectronic heterostructures are processed into circular pills of 8 gm height and 45 gm diameter, the pills are released from the substrate, and collected through a process that involves decanting. (cont.) The pills are then assembled into recesses on silicon chips using manual pick & place techniques, and they are bonded to the metal pads on the bottom surface of the recesses using a Cu-AuSn solder bond. A new magnet assisted bonding technique is utilized to obtain clamping pressure to form the solder bond. The gap between the pill and the surrounding recess is filled using BCB, which also provides good surface planarization. by Eralp Atmaca. Thesis (Elec. E.)

40|$|Cloud-cavitation, often {{formed by}} the {{breakdown}} and collapse of a sheet or vortex cavity, is responsible for severe cavitation noise and erosion damage. This thesis describes an experimental investigation of the dynamics and acoustics of cloud cavitation on a three dimensional hydrofoil and examines the injection of air {{as a means of}} noise suppression. Part one of this work examines the large amplitude impulsive pressures which were measured on the suction surface of an oscillating hydrofoil experiencing cloud cavitation and these pressure pulses are correlated with the observation of shock waves propagating through the bubbly mixture. <b>Recess</b> <b>mounted</b> transducers were used to measure unsteady pressures at four locations along the chord of the suction surface of a hydrofoil. By examining the transducer output, two distinct types of pressure pulses were identified. Local pulses occurred at a single transducer location and were randomly distributed in position and time. Conversely, global pulses were registered by all the transducers almost simultaneously. The location of the global pulses relative to the foil oscillation was quite repeatable and these events produced substantial far-field noise. Correlation of the transducer output with high speed movies of the cavitation revealed that the global pulses were produced by a large scale collapse of the bubble cloud. Conversely, local pulses were generated by local disturbances in the bubbly mixture characterized by large changes in void fraction. The large pressure pulse associated with the local and global cavitation structures, the geometric coherence of their boundaries and the nearly discrete change in void fraction across the boundaries of these structures indicate that these structures consist of bubbly shock waves. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the current experiments and the numerical, analytic and experimental bubbly shock wave analysis of other investigators support this conclusion. Part two of this work examines the dramatic reduction in cloud cavitation noise due to both continuous and pulsed injection of air into the cavitating region of the foil. At sufficient air flow rates, the radiated noise could be reduced by a factor greater than 200 relative to the noise produced without air injection. Unsteady surface pressure measurements also showed a reduction in the acoustic impulse with air injection by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude. An explanation for this noise reduction can be found by examining the high speed motion pictures. The presence of the non-condensible gas in the cavitation cloud is shown to prevent any rapid or coherent collapse process. Although the formation of local structures is still observed, the presence of air in the bubbles diminishes both the magnitude and the frequency of occurrence of local pressure pulses. Finally, pulsed air injection results in a lower acoustic impulse than the impulse obtained by injecting the same mass of air continuously over the entire oscillation cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} process using magnetic forces to assemble micro-components into recesses on silicon based integrated circuits. Patterned SmCo magnetic thin films at the bottom of recesses are used to provide forces to orient, align and retain micro-devices on silicon. The overall objective is to obtain functionalities not readily available from silicon device structures alone. This thesis was done in the context of assembling optoelectronic devices, specifically integrating vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), edge-emitting lasers (EELs), and light emitting diodes(LEDs) onto commercially processed Si-CMOS circuits. This method, magnetically assisted statistical assembly (MASA), incorporates past methods such as Fluidic Assisted Self- Assembly (FASA) and <b>Recess</b> <b>Mounting</b> with Monolithic Metalization (RM 3). Specifically, MASA addresses the main limitation to the FASA method by adding a magnetic layer as a restraint to keep assembled components correctly positioned in recesses until the time bonding may occur. Thus, all components may be permanently bonded into place simultaneously saving both time and money. This thesis will present simulations using Ansoft's Maxwell 3 d providing general behavioral intuition for the behavior of a device over a target magnetic substrate. These results include using a rectangle instead of a circular disc and making recess depths greater than 2 pm to overcome gravitational forces when inverting the substrate. Patterns of SmCo magnetic material, based on results from the simulations, included 50 x 100 [mu]m recesses containing either a solid rectangle, thirty 5 x 10 [mu]m rectangular pads, eighteen 5 x 10 m rectangular pads or four 5 x 10 m rectangular pads. (cont.) Patterns of SmCo material also were experimented with using 50 x 50 [mu]m square recesses containing either a solid square or nine 5 x 5 [mu]m square pads. Experiments with various rectangular patterns showed evidence that upside down devices do not retain as well as right side up devices. It was also seen that four 5 xl 0 [mu]m rectangular pads did not have enough magnetic material to retain even right side up devices. Solid rectangular patterns were also determined to have too much magnetic material to align and orient the device without recesses. Once recesses were added to the experiments, the pattern with thirty 5 x 10 m rectangles proved to assemble the most devices with an assembly ratio of 90 %. However problems occurred with fabricating perfect device shapes and thus mis-shapened devices were counted in the assembly ratio. Results from experimenting with square patterns with recesses show a 88 % assembly ratio with a solid square pattern. This {{may be due to the}} symmetry of the square devices and therefore has higher probability of assembly than that of the rectangular devices. by Diana I. Cheng. Thesis (M. Eng.)

5000|$|Outdoor Floodlights: Instead of {{the usual}} team challenge, this episode has the five lead members of each team (and Tyler, {{as a reward for}} the Pink Team’s victory in the {{previous}} challenge) attend a lesson on how to install an outdoor security floodlight, controlled by a switch inside the cabin. They will then be tasked with instructing their partners on how to install the floodlight on their cabins, with the caveat that the lead members cannot take any hands-on role, and will be ejected from the cabin if they set hands on the job even once (something that would ultimately happen to every team leader except for Fabian). The Green Team again performs the worst, as Jake bizarrely insists that Nicole install the switch {{in the middle of the}} cabin rather than by the door, something that she eventually corrects, but costs them valuable time. Additionally, Nicole fails to properly mount the light due to losing some of the necessary screws, and does such a poor wiring job that not only do two switches have to be turned on two switch on the light when only one should be necessary, the circuit isn’t even grounded, resulting in the experts declaring the job unsafe and refusing to test it. The Purple Team has a stormy build, with Richelene twice trying to give up due to the stress caused by the installation. She, too, fails to properly ground her circuit. Despite Fabian not actually being ejected, he proves very controlling and argues a lot with Luayn. While the Red Team’s light is installed mostly correctly, Luayn fails to correctly <b>recess</b> the <b>mounting</b> box, which will require additional work to make it waterproof. Tyler does a generally very solid job with the Pink Team’s light, but like Luayn, initially fails to realise that the box should be recessed. Tyler does try to correct the issue, but runs out of time and only succeeds in recessing it about halfway. The Blue Team are therefore the winners, as Jesse’s clear instructions (despite getting thrown out of the cabin) and Holly’s intelligent approach to the job leads to the job being completed to a near-perfect standard.|$|R
