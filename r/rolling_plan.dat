This plan was again rejected by the Indian National Congress government in 1980 and a new Sixth Plan was made.The <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plan</b> consists of three kind of plans that were proposed. The First Plan is for the present year which comprises the annual budget and Second is {{a plan for a}} fixed number of years, which may be 3, 4 or 5 years. Plan number two is kept changing as per the requirements of the Indian economy. The Third Plan is a perspective plan which is for long terms i.e. for 10, 15 or 20 years. Hence there is no fixation of dates in for the commencement and termination of the plan in the rolling plans. The main advantage of the rolling plans is that they are flexible and are able to overcome the rigidity of fixed five year plans by mending targets, the object of the exercise, projections and allocations as per the changing conditions in the country’s economy. The main disadvantage of this plan is that if the targets are revised each year, it becomes very difficult to achieve them which are laid down in the five-year period {{and it turned out to}} be a complex plan. Frequent revisions resulted in lack of stability in the economy which is essential for its balanced development and progress.|$|E
50|$|Developed {{countries}} {{together with}} International Financial Institutions have spent billions of US dollars in capacitating the government systems to bring development for many decades, {{but instead of}} poverty being decreased, it is increasing. There have been many internationally funded programs aiming at improving national economy since the 1980s, such as National Economic Survival Program (NESP), Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), and Economic Recovery Program (ERP), Economic and Social Action Program (ESAP), <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plan</b> and Forward Budget(RPFB). To-date there is a 25 years Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP 2001 - 2025) parallel with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs - 2000 to 2015); now there is Kilimo Kwanza initiative. Despite the observed initiatives, the economy is still insufficient to provide {{the impetus for the}} poverty eradication. The mentality of donor-led project is widespread from national to village level - there are several projects that could be accomplished by using locally available resources, for example potable water wells, small irrigation schemes, health structures, school building et cetera, but they have remained unimplemented awaiting for external donor assistance. The well known economic indicators such as GNP and GDP always show that the economy is growing, but in actual sense they do not show how wealth is distributed to the majority. The Tanzanian economy is recorded to improve every year, but more that 80% of its population mostly living in the rural areas are living below poverty line. During the early 1990s, International Financial Institutions (including International Monetary Fund advised Tanzania to do retrenchment and stop employment even in the key sectors, such as education, health and agriculture as a precondition for financial assistance; as a result the economy paralyzed, and now it has a long walk towards achieving socio-economic improvement.|$|E

40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, {{research}} in the dynamic plant layout problem (DPLP) assumes that the planning horizon is fixed and that material flows are known with certainty.

This paper investigates the performance of algorithms under fixed and rolling horizons, under different shifting costs and flow variability, and under forecast uncertainty.

Also it is difficult to identify an algorithm that performs well under all situations. Thus the development of efficient and effective heuristics might be useful in solving the rolling horizon problem. It also appears that increasing the <b>planning</b> horizon under <b>rolling</b> <b>plans</b> does not offer any advantage.

40|$|The rate of {{urbanization}} in Nigeria has witnessed tremendous increase {{in the last two}} decades. Census in the early Fifties showed that there were about 56 cities in the country and about 10. 6 % of the total population lived in these cities. This rose dramatically to 19. 1 % in 1963 and 24. 5 % in 1985. Today, the national population is now estimated to be about 120 million with the urban population constituting about 30 %.

40|$|AbstractThailand is a {{developing}} country whose energy demand is continuously increasing. However, Thailand has limited energy resources, {{and half of the}} energy consumed is imported. Buildings account for the largest sector, which shares 53 % of total electrical energy consumption in Thailand. Over half of this consumption is due to the large commercial buildings. This study aims to propose energy conservation programs focusing on these large commercial buildings. The energy consumption data were extracted from various sources to develop the building performance models, which were then employed to project its energy consumption for the next 20 years (2030). The analysis shows that the energy consumption from the large commercial buildings in 2030 will nearly double the consumption in the base year (2010) if there is no energy conservation program implemented. However, implementation of the proposed programs of building energy code (BEC) and building energy labeling (BEL) integrated with a <b>rolling</b> <b>plan</b> of the program revision show technically a high potential for savings of electrical energy up to 50 % from the total consumption in 2030.

For background on {{the formation of the}} NHS quasi-market see Le Grand and Bartlett[1] and Tilley[2]. In this “managed” market the strategy process has been somewhat removed from operational management. Throughout the 1960 s and 1970 s the medical profession continually acted to preserve their professionalism/monopoly with regard to choices over care and treatment, justified by the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship[3]. Managers, then termed administrators, were not influential actors and health agendas were dominated by the need to react to problems rather than anticipate them.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to determine the}} appropriateness and adequacy of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) acquisition planning practices to effectively meet the requirements of the AFP Modernization Program (AFPMP). Acquisition planning is key to the success of an acquisition because it provides the overall strategy for accomplishing and managing the acquisition. It is a formal documentation of the approach to satisfy the need of the warfighter, optimize resources, and fulfill the policy requirements of the proposed acquisition. In the AFP, planning for acquisitions depends on the Five-Year <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plan,</b> which contains the list of AFPMP projects and form the basis for the formulation of the Circular of Requirements (CORs). The circular does not elaborate on how to develop the CORs or the Bid Evaluation Plans (BEPs), a document similar to the source selection plan. This thesis evaluated AFP acquisition processes to determine the adequacy of AFP acquisition planning practices to adequately {{meet the needs of the}} AFPMP. However, the study found that acquisition plans are not even a requirement for the AFPMP projects and it is not mentioned in any of the other attendant documents to RA 7898 or to the IGRR. The study identified other issues that impact on acquisition planning for the AFPMP, which include lack of an acquisition organization, absence of a skilled acquisition workforce, no acquisition category designations for AFPMP projects, and lack of a single, coherent regulation that pertains to AFP weapon system acquisitions. The study then recommended acquisition plans to be a requirement for all AFPMP acquisitions and the adoption of the acquisition plan format in the FAR as a first step to the conduct of acquisition planning for AFPMP projects. With an acquisition plan that provides a logical and systematic approach for meeting the AFP need, the chance of success of AFPMP acquisition projects can be substantially improved.

It was developed by Port staff, along with input, as a five-year <b>rolling</b> <b>plan</b> designed to guide the Port’s future development while keeping in mind {{the needs of our}} tenants, local community members and stakeholders, and the nation. This is the second update to the Strategic Plan since its initial release. While the Port’s overarching principles – commitment to environmental stewardship, addressing tenant needs, goods movement, economic development, and security – have remained largely unchanged, it is important for us to adapt our strategies {{to meet the challenges of}} an ever changing local and global environment. The Port is among the world’s premier ports and is a critical hub for global trade. This prominence brings with it responsibilities and expectations for the highest possible standards for efficiency, safety and security, and environmental leadership. The Port is the nation’s busiest container port and part of the world’s busiest port complex, handling 3. 7 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2013. Global trade and goods movement is Western kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s strongest industries in terms of jobs and economic activity. The Port of Jeddah powers these industries, handling almost more than a quarter of the cargo that enters the kingdom of Saudi Arabia annually. Through the Port’s activities, a lot of jobs are created in western kingdom of Saudi Arabia and over five hundred thousand nationwide. In order to maintain our position among the world’ the kingdom of Saudi Arabia premier ports, the Port is continually addressing the demands for providing modern and efficient cargo handling terminals as well as transportation and infrastructure projects. Protecting one of the nation’s most vital economic hubs is also an ongoing challenge. Finally, promoting a sustainable “grow green” philosophy and ensuring that we are the leader among ports in promoting environmental stewardship is a strategic objective of the Port. A strategic plan is a management tool used to improve the performance of an organization and outlines the organization’s direction and priorities. This plan identifies the Port’s twelve strategic objectives for the next five years. Each of the objectives identifies a series of an act or strategy intended to resolve a difficulty or improve a situation; a fresh approach to something that the Port will undertake to accomplish that objective. While these objectives are organization-focused and require the coordination of resources throughout the Port, each one will be championed by a bureau, and the divisions within that bureau, as this paper will contain...|$|E

The Higher Education Academy has also joined that partnership. The Enhancement Themes are {{a key element of}} a five-part framework, which has been designed to provide an integrated {{approach to}} quality assurance and enhancement. The Enhancement Themes support learners and staff at all levels in further improving higher education in Scotland; they draw on developing innovative practice within the UK and internationally The five elements of the framework are: z a comprehensive programme of subject-level reviews undertaken by higher education institutions (HEIs) themselves; guidance is published by the SFC (www. sfc. ac. uk) z enhancement-led institutional review (ELIR), run by QAA Scotland (www. qaa. ac. uk/reviews/ELIR) z improved forms of public information about quality; guidance is provided by the SFC (www. sfc. ac. uk) z a greater voice for students in institutional quality systems, supported by a national development service - student participation in quality scotland (sparqs) (www. sparqs. org. uk) z a national programme of Enhancement Themes aimed at developing and sharing good practice to enhance the student learning experience, facilitated by QAA Scotland (www. enhancementthemes. ac. uk). The topics for the Enhancement Themes are identified through consultation with the sector and implemented by steering committees whose members are drawn from the sector and the student body. The steering committees have the task of establishing a programme of development activities, which draw on national and international good practice. Publications emerging from each Theme are intended to provide important reference points for HEIs in the ongoing strategic enhancement of their teaching and learning provision. Full details of each Theme, its steering committee, the range of research and development activities as well as the outcomes are published on the Enhancement Themes website (www. enhancementthemes. ac. uk). To further support the implementation and embedding of a quality enhancement culture within the sector - including taking forward the outcomes of the Enhancement Themes - an overarching committee, the Scottish Higher Education Enhancement Committee (SHEEC), chaired by Professor Kenneth Miller, Vice-Principal, University of Strathclyde, has the important dual role of supporting the overall approach of the Enhancement Themes, including the five-year <b>rolling</b> <b>plan,</b> as well as institutional enhancement strategies and management of quality.

40|$|This {{research}} commenced {{by looking}} at what the knowledge economy is and what the driving forces are. In order to decide on how knowledge in this new economy can be managed, it was first necessary to define the concept of knowledge. The difference between tacit and explicit knowledge and {{the interaction between the}} two were discussed and at the end ways of managing this knowledge were investigated. In a discussion of the term knowledge management it was concluded that it can be regarded as the handling of tacit and explicit objects of knowledge through information systems, so that it enhances innovation and learning in the enterprise. However, when this knowledge is used for creating economic value, it becomes an item of capital and it is therefore necessary to determine what Intellectual Capital is. The history of Intellectual Capital was discussed and in defining Intellectual Capital seven different models for Intellectual Capital were studied. It was found that Intellectual Capital is subdivided into three major components, viz. Human Capital, Structural Capital and Customer Capital. Each of these components was then thoroughly described and discussed. The aim of the research was to study the explicit management and measurement models of Intellectual Capital that would improve understanding of the mechanisms by which value is created and extracted. The different approaches that can be followed in managing Intellectual Capital were investigated. It was concluded that the three major components cannot be seen as independent from each other and must therefore be managed as a whole. The management of the interaction between the three components {{can be seen as the}} management of the intellectual assets of an organisation and this consists of two phases, viz. value creation and value extraction. In order to determine how successful an organisation is in managing its Intellectual Capital this management needs to be measured. The vehicle for measuring performance is a model with a set of indicators in each of the three major components. It was found that measurement models can be divided into four major categories: • Market capitalisation methods • Return on assets methods • Direct intellectual capital methods, and • Scorecard methods. Twenty-seven different models were investigated in order to understand which indicators were necessary to measure Intellectual Capital in an organisation. In order to propose a new framework a study was firstly done on what a framework should look like and which elements should be included. Thereafter an investigation was done to determine which indicators should be included in such a framework. As it was found that such a framework is very organisation-specific, a brief overview of the RAU was given and according to the strategic objectives of the University as set out in the three-year <b>rolling</b> <b>plan</b> a set of indicators was decided upon. It was necessary that each of these indicators indicate whether the University had been successful in the key performance area through the management of its Intellectual Capital. The criteria and indicators identified were applied in the composition of a new model in an effort to find a suitable model for use at universities. The evaluation process turned up the scorecard models as the most suitable for applying in this instance. An attempt was therefore made to modify and adjust these types of models to answer all the requirements of the University. Meeting the requirement that indicators from all three major components must be present was possible. Efforts to adapt existing models in such a way that sub-components can also be measured were met successfully. This model was then tested at RAU and it was measured whether the management of Intellectual Capital contributed to reaching the University’s strategic goals. Prof. A. S. A. Du Toi...|$|E
