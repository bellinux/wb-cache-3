60|$|The more Bartley dwelt {{upon his}} hard case, {{during the week}} that followed, the more it {{appeared}} {{to him that he}} was punished out of all proportion to his offence. He was in no mood to consider such mercies as that he had been spared from seriously hurting Bird; and that Squire Gaylord and Doctor Wills had united with Henry's mother in saving him from open disgrace. The physician, indeed, had perhaps indulged a professional passion for hushing the matter up, rather than any pity for Bartley. He probably had the scientific way of looking at such questions; and saw much physical cause for moral effects. He refrained, with the physician's reticence, from inquiring into the affair; but he would not have thought Bartley without excuse under the circumstances. In regard to the <b>relative</b> <b>culpability</b> in matters of the kind, his knowledge of women enabled him to take much the view of the woman's share that other women take.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{offers a}} new {{critique}} of Federal Rule of Evidence 609, which permits impeachment of criminal defendants by means of their prior criminal convictions. In admitting convictions as impeachment evidence, courts are wrongly assuming that such convictions are necessarily reliable indicators of <b>relative</b> <b>culpability.</b> Courts assume that convictions {{are the product of}} a fair fight, that they demonstrate <b>relative</b> <b>culpability,</b> and that they connote moral culpability. But current prosecutorial practice and other data undermine each of these assumptions. Accordingly, this Article proposes that before a conviction is used for impeachment, there should be an assessment {{of the extent to which}} it is a reliable indicator of <b>relative</b> <b>culpability.</b> In support of its proposals, this Article draws two new sources into the impeachment context. First, in a groundbreaking sentencing opinion, Judge Nancy Gertner refused to give the prescribed weight to the defendant’s prior convictions, because she feared that they were the product of racial profiling and that she would be compounding disparities. Second, the prosecution’s ethical duty to “do justice” militates in favor of a prosecutorial assessment of a conviction’s reliability before the prosecution proffers it for impeachment. Through these kinds of judicial and prosecutorial inquiries, the law of impeachment will hew more closely to the realities of the criminal justice system, and to justice itself...|$|E
40|$|American {{criminal}} law {{is committed to}} some version {{of the doctrine of}} double effect (“DDE”). In this paper, I defend a new variant of the agent-centered rationale for a version of DDE that is of particular relevance to the {{criminal law}}. In particular, I argue for a non-absolute version of DDE that concerns the <b>relative</b> <b>culpability</b> of intending a bad or wrongful state of affairs as opposed to bringing it about merely knowingly. My aim is to identify a particular feature of the former in virtue of which it is pro tanto more culpable than the latter. Providing an agent-centered argument of this kind for a culpability version of DDE, I argue, is an especially attractive route to take for those who are interested in vindicating the way the criminal law actually encodes DDE. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrech...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{criminal}} law is intensely one-sided in {{its treatment of}} victims and defendants. Crime victims and criminal defendants do not enter the trial process on an equal moral footing. Rather, from the beginning victims are assumed blameless, truthful, and even beyond doubt, while defendants are guilty, not worthy of credence, and immoral. This one-sided view of victims, however, is a fiction. As any other people, victims differ in their characterizations. Some are indeed trustworthy, truthful, blameless and ultimately innocent. Others, however, are bad actors themselves, have memory failures, falsely identify, provoke, and even lie. Some victims are in fact, and indeed encouraged to be by society, vengeful. Others, however, advocate mercy and forgiveness {{as part of the}} process of 2 ̆ 2 closure, 2 ̆ 2 a process to which prosecutors and victim advocates often allude in justifying particularly severe punishments like the death penalty. The first article in this project, Victim Wrongs: The Case for a General Criminal Defense based on Wrongful Victim Behavior in an Era of Victims 2 ̆ 7 Rights, 77 TEMP. L. REV. 645 (2003), advocates as a response to the one-sided nature of victim characterizations a nonspecific victim liability defense. It proposes a general defense that mitigates punishment or exculpates defendants when their criminal behavior occurs in direct response to wrongful behavior on the part of the victim. The term, 2 ̆ 2 nonspecific, 2 ̆ 2 denotes that the defense applies to any criminal defendant who responds to wrongful victim behavior, under the specified conditions, as opposed to just murder or assault defendants. 2 ̆ 2 Nonspecific 2 ̆ 2 also captures the idea that wrongful victim behavior can include more types of behavior than the current specific laws take into account. The elements of the nonspecific victim liability defense are: (1) The victim of the crime engaged in sufficiently wrongful conduct; (2) The victim 2 ̆ 7 s conduct caused the defendant to commit the charged offense; (3) The defendant was not predisposed to commit the charged offense; and (4) The severity of the victim 2 ̆ 7 s wrongful conduct balanced against the severity of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s response dictates that the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s actions were justified or excused or that punishment should be mitigated. This article is the second part of an on-going project to develop and justify the nonspecific victim liability defense by responding prospectively to potential criticisms of the defense based in penal theory. To that end, Part I of the article explains the importance of penological discourse in {{criminal law}} theory and introduces several broad categories of penal philosophy. Part II of the paper discusses the potential deontological criticism that the nonspecific victim liability defense inaccurately reflects sentiments regarding just deserts because of its potential to sanction victim negligence. In responding to this important objection, the paper distinguishes the non-specific victim liability defense from the seemingly analogous tort principles of contributory and comparative negligence. Part III briefly responds to consequentialist critiques of the defense, which involve concerns over deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, and redistribution. In the end, this project hopes to recharacterize criminal law in a more transactional way so that criminal doctrines can account adequately for the <b>relative</b> moral <b>culpability</b> of all the parties to an injurious event...|$|R
40|$|Credit default swaps (CDSs) {{have been}} {{identified}} in media accounts and by various commentators as sources of risk for the institutions that use them, as potential contributors to systemic risk, and as the underlying reason for the bailouts of Bear Stearns and AIG. These assessments are seriously wide of the mark. They seem to reflect a misunderstanding of how CDSs work and how they contribute to risk management by banks and other intermediaries. In addition, the vigorous market that currently exists for CDSs is a significant source of market-based judgments on the credit conditions of large numbers of companies—information that is not publicly available anywhere else. Although the CDS market can be improved, excessive restrictions on it would create considerably more risk than it would eliminate. There are so many potential culprits in the current financial crisis {{that it is difficult to}} keep them all straight or to assess their <b>relative</b> <b>culpability.</b> Greedy investment banks, incompetent rating agencies, predatory lenders and mortgage brokers— even the entire system of asset securitization—have all been blamed for the current condition of the financial markets. The oddest target, however, is CDSs. Almost every media report and commentary about the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September and the ensuing freeze in the credit markets mentions CDSs as one of the contributing causes, just as similar reports and commentary accompanied the government’s decision to rescue Bear Stearns in March and AIG in September. One conventional explanation for the Bear rescue has been that CDSs made the financial markets highly “interconnected. ” It is in the nature of credit markets to be interconnected, however: that is the way money moves from where it is less useful to where it is most useful, and that is why financial institutions are called “intermediaries. ” Moreover, there is very little evidence that Bear was bailed ou...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Story Model of juror decision making, using an actual personal injury automobile accident case, this thesis investigated the influence of mock jurors emotional response to an injured plaintiff on decisions about defendant liability and the plaintiffs contributory negligence as well as the efficacy of procedural legal safeguards to control any such biases. Study One validated the Story Model of juror decision making in individual decisions, and revealed that mock jurors failed to consider the requisite legal elements in rendering a verdict. Study Two ascertained participants affective response to a mock trial in which evidence relevant to liability was held constant and the severity of the plaintiffs injuries differed. A multiple mediator model revealed that sympathy for the plaintiff and anger toward the defendant mediated the relation between injury severity and determinations of the <b>relative</b> <b>culpability</b> of the parties. Study Three demonstrated that mock jurors exposed to emotionally evocative damages evidence constructed stories about the defendants liability and the plaintiffs contributory negligence that differed from those constructed in response to emotionally neutral evidence. Study Four showed that the process of group deliberation failed to correct the misuse of evidence relevant to damages in liability decisions. However, Study Five demonstrated that judicial admonitions both acknowledging mock jurors emotional response to the evidence and explaining why this response was irrelevant to judgments of liability moderated the influence of emotional states on decisions about liability and contributory negligence. Study Six indicated that jury-eligible citizens conceptions of negligence law closely matched the normative model of negligence law, and that their mental models of negligence cases that ended successfully for the plaintiff featured more severely injured plaintiffs than those that ended unsuccessfully for the plaintiff. These studies addressed analytical and methodological weaknesses in previous research, resolved conflicting findings on fusion of liability and damages, provided direct empirical support for the central premise of the Story Model of juror decision making, and advanced knowledge on the influence of emotion on decisions in civil legal cases...|$|E
40|$|Beginning with Pennsylvania in 1794, most American jurisdictions have, at {{one time}} or another, {{separated}} the crime of murder into two degrees based on {{the presence or absence of}} premeditation and deliberation. An intentional, premeditated, and deliberate murder is murder of the first degree, while second-degree murder is committed intentionally but without premeditation or deliberation. The distinction was created in order to limit the use of the death penalty, which generally has been imposed only for first-degree murder. Critics have attacked the premeditation-deliberation formula on two fronts. First, they have charged that the formula is imprecise as a measure of the <b>relative</b> <b>culpability</b> or dangerousness of intentional murderers. The premeditation deliberation formula, the critics tell us, is incapable of segregating out the worst murderers because it is both under- and over-inclusive. In addition, critics have pointed to the courts’ inability or unwillingness to apply the premeditation deliberation formula in any coherent fashion. Many courts have held that the premeditation and deliberation required to transform a mere intentional, second-degree murder into first-degree murder can be formed in the instant before the killing. Thus do many courts fail to meaningfully distinguish one degree of intentional murder from the other. This second failing appears inextricably related to the first: since many unplanned but intentional murders are as bad as or worse than many planned killings, and their perpetrators at least as dangerous, courts contort the meanings of premeditation and deliberation to allow the most culpable and dangerous murderers to be punished most harshly. These criticisms are founded on the premise that the distinction between first and second-degree murder is grounded solely upon principles of retribution and incapacitation. What the critics have overlooked is that there is a powerful deterrence-based rationale for distinguishing premeditated, deliberate murders from those that are unpremeditated or nondeliberate. Where a murder is premeditated and deliberate, it is much more likely that the murderer has not only planned out the crime itself but has developed a plausible way to avoid or delay detection. Because the value of punishment as a deterrent depends in large part on the likelihood and swiftness of punishment, crimes that are less likely to be punished swiftly, all other things being equal, ought to be punished more severely. Thus, given two equally dangerous and culpable intentional murderers, we are arguably justified in punishing more severely the one who, by virtue of better planning beforehand, is more likely to escape or delay detection...|$|E
