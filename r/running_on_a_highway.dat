5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown <b>running</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway.</b> In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{caused by}} <b>running</b> {{vehicles}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> bridge is {{spread to the}} superstructure, substructures and ground. The ground vibrates both in horizontal and vertical direction. When vehicles load {{at the tip of}} the cross beam in the T-shaped pier, rocking vibration of the pier occurs. Its ground vibration in transverse direction is the biggest. In the two-box girders bridge, which bearings are installed {{at the tip of the}} cross beam of the T-shaped pier, the ground vibration has greatly occurred due to the rocking vibration of the pier. Two measures to mitigate the vibration are proposed in this study. The evaluation the change of the vibration characteristics and effects of the measures to mitigate the vibration are also discussed in the study...|$|R

This system provides warning message {{on the basis of}} data obtained by detector. If distance is within the safety limit, alert tone is activated. While distance of vehicles crosses threshold distance, this system will reduce the speed automatically. General Terms Laser light detection, Road accident...|$|R
