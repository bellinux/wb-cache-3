5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he had not found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered {{that this was a}} case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E
5|$|The Meccans <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> they {{accepted}} the last condition. Soon they realized their mistake and sent Abu Sufyan {{to renew the}} Hudaybiyyah treaty, a request that was declined by Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{had noticed}} one {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} defences. The roofs were flat and unprotected; he demanded to know if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them. Student <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> it could be done, but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this would deliver 80–90 paratroopers onto the target.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{expressed}} {{the hope that}} the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan {{by the end of the}} year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he could make one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December, Ferdinand again {{asked the}} castle's {{defenders}} to surrender. They <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> {{they did not}} know {{the meaning of the word}} and would hold the Godesburg to the last man. A report dated 23 December 1583 relates that, having given Ferdinand a rude reply, the defenders went back to lunch.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} justifications, {{found in the}} Qur'an and sunnah, {{for the use of}} ijtihad. For example, during a {{conversation}} with Mu'ādh ibn Jabal, Muhammad asked the former how he would give judgments. Mu'ādh <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he would refer first to the Qur'an, then to the Sunnah and finally commit to ijtihad to make his own judgment. Muhammad approved of this.|$|E

5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he did not want him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> the film {{would still be}} made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse {{it would be difficult to}} return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E

5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to await the arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|Chłapowski advised Plater {{to stand}} down and return home. She {{allegedly}} <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> {{she had no}} intention of taking off her uniform until her fatherland was fully liberated. Her decision was accepted and she was made a commanding officer of the 1st company of the Polish–Lithuanian 25th Infantry Regiment. She was promoted to the rank of captain, the highest rank awarded to a woman at that time. She spent some time in Kaunas, before the insurgents were forced to retreat in late June.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education. Exposed to slaves throughout his childhood, he sympathized with their condition. According to his own account, Coffin became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, who considered the impact of a father being taken away from his family.|$|E

5|$|Hand {{followed}} this {{up with an}} address to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy, Hand <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he had Richard Nixon in mind as well. Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{only those}} wishing to use {{specialised}} material unavailable in other public or academic libraries {{would be given}} a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, {{who have access to}} their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> it has always admitted undergraduates {{as long as they have}} a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.|$|E
5|$|Hoover {{accompanied}} Harding on the Western {{trip and}} later wrote that Harding asked then what Hoover {{would do if}} he knew of some great scandal, whether to publicize it or bury it. Hoover <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> Harding should publish and get credit for integrity, and asked for details. Harding stated {{that it had to}} do with Smith but, when Hoover enquired as to Daugherty's possible involvement, Harding refused to answer.|$|E

5|$|In a 16 December 2008 interview, {{when asked}} by the Spanish {{newspaper}} El País if Litvinenko could {{have been killed in}} the interests of the Russian state, Lugovoy – wanted by British police on suspicion of the murder of Litvinenko – <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> he would order the assassination of anyone, for example, President Saakashvili of Georgia and the KGB defector Gordievsky, in the interests of the Russian state.|$|E
5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips <b>replied</b> <b>that</b> the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E
