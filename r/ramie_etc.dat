5000|$|Jute {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{affordable}} natural fibers and it is second only to cotton in amount produced and variety of uses of vegetable fibers. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials cellulose and lignin. It falls into the bast fiber category (fiber collected from bast, the phloem of the plant, sometimes called the [...] "skin") along with kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen), <b>ramie,</b> <b>etc.</b> The industrial term for jute fiber is raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) long. Jute is also called the golden fiber for its color and high cash value.|$|E
50|$|Several Native American groups {{originally}} {{inhabited the}} region {{now known as}} Wyoming. The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone were {{but a few of}} the original inhabitants encountered when white explorers first entered the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the Spanish Empire and later Mexican territory of Alta California, until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican-American War. French-Canadian trappers from Québec and Montréal went into the state in the late 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as Téton, La <b>Ramie,</b> <b>etc.</b> John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, itself guided by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young Shoshone wife, Sacagawea, first described the region in 1807. At the time, his reports of the Yellowstone area were considered to be fictional. Robert Stuart and a party of five men returning from Astoria discovered South Pass in 1812. The Oregon Trail later followed that route. In 1850, Jim Bridger located what is now known as Bridger Pass, which the Union Pacific Railroad used in 1868—as did Interstate 80, 90 years later. Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that, like those of Colter, were largely regarded as tall tales at the time.|$|E
40|$|By {{embedding}} natural reinforcing fibres e. g. flax, hemp, <b>ramie</b> <b>etc.</b> into a bio-polymeric matrix made of derivatives from cellulose, starch, {{lactic acid}} etc., new fibre reinforced materials, the so-called bio-composites, were created at the DLR Institute of Structural Mechanics in 1989 {{and are still}} being developed. Regarding the mechanical properties, bio-composites have been comparable to the will-known glass fibre reinforced compounds {{right from the start}} but now can actually replace them. Therefore the new construction materials are very well suited to be used for anisotropic and specially tailored lightweight structural parts making use of the DLR know how in fibre reinforced technology. In this report the latest results of new fibre/matrix combinations and examinations on environmentally compatible flame retardants will be presented. Whereas traditional compounds consist of very stable components being very difficult to decompose, bio-composites are made completely from biologically renewable resources. This offers additional options of a convenient removal after the end of lifetime, i. e. biodegradation of composting of the biodegradable kinds of bio-composites or combustion of the more stable ones which is carbon dioxide neutral and completely slag-free. Thus bio-composites can also meet the steadily increasing environmental demands of legislative authorities...|$|E
40|$|Using {{examples}} from the Nukata Collection of Japanese “boro,” or rags, this paper assesses how such extensively repaired, patched, and pieced utilitarian textiles reflect Japan’s social stratification, agriculture, economy, and trade. These humble cloths, tangible remnants of stories lived by the common people – farmers, fishermen, and lumberjacks – who lived in rural areas along the Sea of Japan and northeastern Honshu Island until several decades ago, point to a material’s aesthetic and functional transformation. A majority of pieces in the collection are futon, bedding which are made of or patched with various shades of blue fabric pieces mostly recycled from cotton clothing and other castaway rags brought via the “Kitamaesen,” a commercial shipping route servicing the northern sea coast, used by ships originating from the port of Sakai for transporting fish meal, oil, and collecting “rice tax. ” By way of China, cotton cultivation was brought to Japan. By the eighteenth century it was firmly established in the country’s warmer regions where commoners could enjoy this new material just like their more well-to-do urban counterparts. However, cotton was precious in these areas where available fibers were the local hemp, <b>ramie,</b> mulberry, <b>etc.</b> Owing to a harsh economy and long bitter winters, the inexpensive, warm cotton cloths were a treasure. High demands led to cotton’s transformation into regional folk textile traditions such as sakiori, rag weaving; sashiko and kogin, stitching or quilting combined with bast fibers, as well as vernacular boro...|$|R
40|$|Originally {{coming from}} {{aerospace}} technology, fibre reinforced plastics (FRP) are successfully used for various applications, {{today because of}} their excellent specific properties, e. g. high strength and stiffness low weight and the potential of optimization of orientation (esp. continuous) fibres along the load paths. In order to successfully meet the environmental problems of these classic composites, the DLR Institute of Structural Mechanics developed an innovative idea in 1989. By embedding natural and near natural reinforcing fibres e. g. flax, <b>ramie,</b> cellulose <b>etc.</b> into a biopolymeric matrix from cellulose, starch, lactic acid derivatives or plant oils based polymers etc. (thermosets as well as thermoplastics), new fibre reinforced materials, called bio-composites, were created and are still being developed. In terms of mechanical properties being comparable to glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP), latest developments on new fibre/matrix combinations and environmentally compatible flame retardants enable biocomposites to replace GFRP in most cases. Bio-composites are {{designed to meet the}} processing requirements for commonly used manufacturing techniques, e. g. pressing, injection moulding, filament winding, BMC; SMC etc. Apart from anisotropic and specially tailored lightweight structural parts with continuous fibre reinforcements, biocomposites are very well suited for paneling elements in cars, railways and aeroplanes. Etc. using different kinds of nonwovens from single fibres (needlefelt nonwovens, fleeces etc.) to be easily adapted to the usual curved shapes of paneling, fairings etc. When modifying the resin systems more or less extensively, biocomposites can be designed for different applications either to be stable or biodegradable. Apart from re-use or recycling, this offers additional options of a convenient removal {{after the end of the}} lifetime, i. e. combustion of any kind of biocomposites now being carbon dioxide neutral and completely slag-free, or biodegradation or compositing of the biodegradable kinds of biocomposites. Thus they are fully integrated into natural cycles and can also meet the steadily increasing environmental demands of legislative authorities...|$|R
