5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar <b>rocks.</b> <b>To</b> their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there {{was less than a}} 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E

5|$|On June 5, 2013, the Wolves {{announced}} that Owumi would be returning for another {{season with the}} team. Head coach Paul James hoped to build the team around the Nigerian guard in their upcoming season. Beginning {{early on in the}} season, Owumi joined forces with Zaire Taylor in the back court. On September 28, 2013, to start his second BBL season, Owumi scored 18 points and added two rebounds and two assists in a 117–60 win over the Surrey Scorchers. On December 1, Owumi scored a season-high 30 points to guide the Wolves past the Durham Wildcats. In a rematch with Durham on January 10, 2014, Owumi notched 27 points to extend his team's winning streak to seven. On March 31, he put up 11 points as the Wolves defeated the Glasgow <b>Rocks</b> <b>to</b> win the BBL Trophy. In May, Worcester also claimed the BBL Championship title behind Owumi's 14 points and six rebounds. By the end of the season, he was averaging 17.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.3 steals in BBL Championship play.|$|E
5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> make room for the wagons.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364.

As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> survive a hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world {{in search of}} the family from whom it was separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the hibernation point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial.

Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake <b>rocks</b> <b>to</b> a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene.
