50|$|Reel {{capacity}} {{is affected by}} both the <b>reel</b> <b>diameter</b> and the reel hub diameter. The standard ten and a half inch reel has approximately twice {{the capacity of the}} seven inch reel, which in turn has twice the capacity of the five inch. Some (not all) reels described as three inches are in fact three and a quarter inches in diameter, in order to have half the capacity of a five-inch reel.|$|E
50|$|With two {{interleaved}} stereo pairs, {{the track}} format {{and speed of}} the RCA tape cartridge is fully compatible with the slower 3.75 IPS speed of consumer reel-to-reel stereo tape recorders. It is possible to dismantle the cartridge, spool the tape onto an open reel, and play it on such a machine. In fact, RCA offered an adapter for their Sound Tape Cartridge machines {{to enable them to}} both play back and record traditional reels of tape up to 5 inches in <b>reel</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{thermoplastic}} pipes (RTPs) {{are considered}} as prospective alternatives to traditional steel pipes in various offshore {{oil and gas}} applications due to their attractive properties such as better corrosion resistance, high stiffness and strength to weight ratios and low maintenance costs. In this work, studies of the mechanical behaviour of RTPs composed of pipe grade polyethylene (PE) and aramid fibres, and subjected to various loads are conducted using Finite Elements Analysis (FEA). The RTP is modelled using shell elements available in Abaqus/Standard with both geometric and material nonlinearities considered. In order to model the material nonlinearity, equations describing the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of PE are adopted in the material models which reflect strain-dependent mechanical characteristics of PE and fibre-reinforced PE composites during loading. Based on these models, numerical algorithms have been developed using the FORTRAN programming language and implemented through user-defined subroutines, UMATs. The developed modelling approach has been verified by comparisons with experimental and computational results reported in the literature. The pressure capacity of an RTP is investigated {{as it is a}} primary concern in designing offshore pipes. It was found that the nonlinear mechanical behaviour of PE enables the RTP to avoid premature material failures in the PE matrix, liner and cover. Since the spoolability of RTPs is essential in their installation process, their flexural behaviour is also analysed. The analysis showed that the estimation of the minimum allowable bend radius of the RTP can be improved by using the proposed modelling approach. It was found that the sufficient spoolability of RTPs can be also achieved by employing certain one and two angle-ply reinforcing layer systems, and the <b>reel</b> <b>diameter</b> could decreased by 24. 29 %. This will result in significant reduction in the transportation and material costs during the installation phase of the pipeline. Several combined loading cases are considered. For each load combination, parametric studies have been conducted. The failure modes are found to be dependent on loading paths and types of loads applied. Based on the computational results obtained, design guidelines and recommendations {{that could be used in}} practical design of RTPs for offshore applications are formulated...|$|E

40|$|A {{magnetic}} tape recorder developed for the special requirements of radio astronomy and geodesy is described. These requirements include a high bit packing density and long record times. The current version of this longitudinal recorder used by the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) records 5. 5 Terabits on a 14 -in <b>diameter</b> <b>reel</b> of inch-wide tape. A maximum record rate of 256 Mb/s is achieved in the VLBA configuration with one recorder operating at 4 ms and utilizing 32 of the heads in a single stack. The VLBA recorders have been tested using a longitudinal density of 2. 25 fr/micron; 448 data + 56 system tracks are recorded in 14 passes, each lasting 50 min, for a total record time (at 128 Mb/s) of 12 h on 14 -in <b>diameter</b> <b>reel</b> of inch-wide 13 -microns-thick D 1 -equivalent tape...|$|R

5000|$|Then {{there is}} the Magnasync Nomad, a mechanically-coupled dual-system, circa 1960. It used split-16 <b>reels</b> (2.5" [...] <b>diameter,</b> 100) of {{magnetic}} tape, sprocketed for 16mm film. A camera (Bolex, Kodak Cine Special, B&H 70, Pathe Webo; and factory-modified Auricons or Arris) is docked {{to the top of}} the Nomad. A mechanical transmission interlock cable to the single frame-per=turn gear of the camera, and to the Nomad. The spring of the camera thus also turns the mag tape reels of the Nomad. Alternatively, a 24 fps sync electric motor docks to the Nomad, and turns the camera gears. A connected external amplifier and control handset connects to the Nomad. The tape drive had extension arms for larger 400 mag tape reels. It was a marvel of engineering from the ubiquitous vendor of editing suite 16mm and 35mm sync editing.|$|R
2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) <b>diameter</b> <b>reel</b> and around a pulley with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|R
40|$|A {{versatile}} cable-dispensing cart {{can support}} {{as many as}} a few dozen reels of cable, wire, and/or rope. The cart can be adjusted to accommodate <b>reels</b> of various <b>diameters</b> and widths, and can be expanded, contracted, or otherwise reconfigured by use of easily installable and removable parts that can be carried onboard. Among these parts are dispensing rods and a cable guide that enables dispensing of cables without affecting the direction of pull. Individual reels can be mounted on or removed from the cart without affecting the other reels: this feature facilitates the replacement or reuse of partially depleted reels, thereby helping to reduce waste. Multiple cables, wires, or ropes can be dispensed simultaneously. For maneuverability, the cart is mounted on three wheels. Once it has been positioned, the cart is supported by rubber mounts for stability and for prevention of sliding or rolling during dispensing operations. The stability and safety of the cart are enhanced by a low-center-of-gravity design. The cart can readily be disassembled into smaller units for storage or shipping, then reassembled in the desired configuration at a job site...|$|R

5000|$|EIAJ-1 was a {{standard}} for video tape recorders (VTRs) developed by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan with the cooperation and assistance of several Japanese electronics manufacturers in 1969. It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a Helical scan system employing open reel tape. Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2" [...] wide tape. As a result, video tapes recorded on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility. For example, a reel of tape recorded on a Panasonic machine would not play on a Sony machine, and vice versa. The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers {{a standard}}ized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time. The format offered black-and-white (and later colour) video recording and playback on 1/2" [...] magnetic tape on a 7" [...] <b>diameter</b> open <b>reel,</b> with portable units using smaller 5" [...] <b>diameter</b> <b>reels.</b>|$|R
40|$|Interest in the {{development}} of stripper headers is growing owing to the excessive losses of combine harvesters and costs of manually harvesting for chickpeas. The design of a new concept can enhance the mechanized process for chickpea harvesting. A modified stripper platform was designed, in which passive fingers with V-shape slots removes the pods from the anchored plant. The floating platform was accompanied by a reel to complete the harvesting header. Black-box modeling was used to redesign the functional operators of the header followed by an investigation of the system behavior. Physical models of the platform and reel were modified to determine the crucial variables of the header arrangement during field trials. The slot width was fixed at 40 mm, finger length at 40 mm, keyhole diameter at 10 mm and entrance width at 6 mm; the batted <b>reel</b> at peripheral <b>diameter</b> of 700 mm and speed at 50 rpm. A tractor-mounted experimental harvester was built to evaluate the work quality of the stripper header. The performance of the prototype was tested with respect to losses and results confirmed the efficiency of the modified stripper header for chickpea harvesting. Furthermore, the header with a 1. 4 m working width produced the spot work rates of 0. 42 ha h- 1...|$|R
