50|$|Two scales that {{measures}} rebound hardness are the Leeb <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and Bennett hardness scale.|$|E
50|$|The Leeb <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of}} {{the four}} most used methods for testing metal hardness. This {{portable}} method is mainly used for testing sufficiently large workpieces (mainly above 1 kg). It measures the coefficient of restitution.|$|E
50|$|A {{scleroscope}} is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} rebound hardness. It consists of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height. The device was invented in the early 1900s. As an improvement on this rough method, the Leeb <b>Rebound</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>Test,</b> invented in the 1970s, uses the ratio of impact and rebound velocities (as measured by a magnetic inducer) to determine hardness.|$|E

30|$|Leeb <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> was {{measured}} using similar methodology to the previous case studies (Equotip 3 with D-type probe). In addition to measurements on the damaged ledges 30 measurements were taken on an undamaged window ledge to obtain baseline values of these properties.|$|R
50|$|The Leeb <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> {{method was}} {{developed}} in 1975 by Leeb and Brandestini at Proceq SA to provide a portable hardness test for metals. It was developed {{as an alternative to}} the unwieldy and sometimes intricate traditional hardness measuring equipment. The first Leeb rebound product on the market was named “Equotip”, a phrase which still is used synonymously with “Leeb rebound” due to the wide circulation of the “Equotip” product.|$|E
50|$|The Leeb <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is {{the only}} commonly-available test related to {{determining}} the COR. It uses a tip of tungsten carbide, {{one of the hardest}} substances available, dropped onto test samples from a specific height. But the shape of the tip, the velocity of impact, and the tungsten carbide are all variables that affect the result that is expressed in terms of 1000*COR. It does not give an objective COR for the material that is independent from the test.|$|E
50|$|The {{coefficient}} of restitution (COR) is {{the ratio of}} the final to initial velocity difference between two objects after they collide. It normally ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 would be a perfectly elastic collision. A perfectly inelastic collision has a {{coefficient of}} 0, but a 0 value {{does not have to be}} perfectly inelastic. It is measured in the Leeb <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test,</b> expressed as 1000 times the COR, but it is only a valid COR for the test, not as a universal COR for the material being tested.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hardness {{tests have}} always been {{important}} to conclude on specific mechanical properties of materials in a fast and economic manner, i. e. in a (quasi) non destructive test.

The EQUOTIP 1, Leebs original instrument, is fully discussed and newest improvements are presented. So far, PROCEQ SA, Swiss manufacturer of the instruments, maintained and protected the constancy of the L-Value over the last 30 years.

40|$|AbstractThe micro <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is {{characterized}} by using a small and hard ball as an impact element and measuring the restitution coefficient of the ball against the test piece as a hardness property of the test piece. In this study, {{in order to determine}} the specifications for the prototype tester presently under development, the features of the restitution coefficient measured by the test were investigated by computer simulation. In the simulation, the impact ball and the test piece were assumed to be an elastic body and an elastic-plastic body, respectively. Through the simulation, the influences of the factors in the impact ball side, Young's modulus, density and hardness, and of the factors in the test piece side, yield stress, work-hardening index, Young's modulus and thickness, on the restitution coefficient, essential for determining the specifications of the tester and important for understanding the hardness test result, were revealed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} cuttability {{of selected}} rocks in south-western (S/W) Nigeria. Rock samples from this region were <b>tested</b> for <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> value, uniaxal compressive strength, and silica content using Schmidt hammer, 1100 KN compression machine and X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer, respectively.

40|$|Hardness" is an {{important}} yet diverse material physical property and is a key parameter in the mining industry in fields such as comminution, geotechnical and blast modelling. Several laboratory and field based measurement techniques exist to measure hardness (e. g. Point Load Testing, Vickers, Brinell, A∗b, BMWi, UCS), all are designed for specific applications. Current tests are generally destructive and require specific sample preparation procedures which results in high cost tests that are not conducted in adequate quantities to map hardness across an ore body. The EQUOtip rebound hardness tester is a device that has been developed for application in ore body hardness domaining within the AMIRA P 843 GeMIII Research Project. The <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is non-destructive and suitable for application on half and whole diamond drill core. Data acquisition protocols and a data processing software application (EQProcess) {{have been developed to}} facilitate routine collection of comparative hardness information. This paper outlines the data acquisition and processing methodology and provides application examples of defining relative hardness domains in different geological deposit styles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recently, the {{interest}} in maintenance and repair of existing concrete structures have increased, and it is typical to use non-destructive testing methods such as <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> or ultrasonic pulse velocity method to execute maintenance and repair of structures efficiently. Many non-destructive testing methods are being used in practice such as at construction sites, but verification for site applications are quite inadequate. Thus, this study intends to evaluate the applicability of Impact Echo Method {{which is one of}} the non-destructive testing methods using stress wave. Total of four specimens were planned and produced. The thickness of concrete slab members was estimated using I. E(OLSEN’s Freedom Data PC with Win. TFS Software Version 2. 5. 2). The estimated materials of concrete members by IE was found to be IE- 1 specimen 178 mm, IE- 2 specimen 197 mm, IE- 3 specimen 191 mm, and IE- 4 specimen 263 mm, and the error rate was found to be 4. 22 %~ 18. 67 % (average 9. 6 %), showing that they are relatively well in agreement. In this study, the experiments were executed with the objective of estimating the thickness of concrete slab members using Impact Echo Method. Through this study, the applicability of thickness estimation in concrete slab members using impact echo method could be confirmed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines optimization of blasting {{parameters for}} economic production of granite aggregates in Ratcon and NSCE quarries located at Ibadan, Oyo State. Samples {{were collected from}} the study areas for the determination of rock density and porosity. Schmidt hammer was used for in situ determination of rock hardness. Uniaxial compressive strength of in situ rock was estimated from the values obtained from Schmidt hammer <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and density determined from laboratory test. Blasting {{data were collected from}} the study areas for optimization. Multiple regression analysis using computer aided solution SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) was used to analyse data ob-tained from the laboratory test, field test and the study areas. The estimated mean uniaxial compressive strength value of NSCE is 240 MPa and that of Ratcon is 200 MPa and their average densities and average porosities are 2. 63 g/cm 3, 2. 55 g/cm 3, 1. 88 % and 2. 25 % respectively. Eleven parameters were input into the multiple regression analysis to gener-ate the models. Two parameters out of eleven input parameters such as geometric volume of blast (Y 1) and number of boulders generated after blasting (Y 2) were dependent variables and the remaining nine such as X 1 (Drill hole diameter), X 2 (Drill hole depth), X 3 (Spacing), X 4 (Burden), X 5 (Average charge per hole), X 6 (Rock density), X 7 (Porosity), X 8 (Uniaxial compressive strength) and X 9 (Specific charge) were input as independent variables.

50|$|Hardness is {{a measure}} of how {{resistant}} solid matter is to various kinds of permanent shape change when a compressive force is applied. Some materials (e.g. metals) are harder than others (e.g. plastics). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: scratch hardness, indentation <b>hardness,</b> and <b>rebound</b> <b>hardness.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Meyer <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is a {{rarely used}} <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> based upon {{projected}} area of an impression. This {{is a more}} fundamental measurement of hardness than other <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> {{which are based on}} the surface area of an indentation. The principle behind the test is that the mean pressure required to test the material is the measurement of the hardness of the material. The mean pressure is calculated by dividing the load by the projected area of the indentation. The result is called the Meyer hardness, which has units of megapascals (MPa).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{sources of}} {{problems}} with a <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machine that are detectable via day-to-day inspection using hardness standard blocks, or indirect verification, can be roughly divided into three: the indenter, the test force, and the indentation measuring apparatus.
