First specimen was the control specimen where no additional shear link on beam reinforcement and no anchorages of bars were tied between beam and column. Second speciment consist of additional shear link on beam reinforcement with 75 mm spacing which is closer then specimen 1 and 3. Third specimen introduced cross-bracing of reinforcement bars at the intersection of beam-column joint. In this study, failure load, beam displacement, stiffness, strain value of steel reinforcement, mode of failure had been presented. The repeated reversed loads were applied to the end of cantilever beam. The dimension for each column was 300 x 300 x 1500 mm, and the cantilever beam with dimension, 300 x 150 x 1000 rnm was located at the mid-height of column. High-yield steel was utilized for all main reinforcement with 8 T 16 bars for column rebar and 4 T 16 for cantilever RC beam. Mild steel type was used for all steel links.

Hysteresis loops were captured during these tests and the form of stress versus number of cycles to failure (S-N) curves was established. <b>Reversed</b> <b>loading</b> is the most damaging mode of cyclic stress application. In terms of static strengths, the wood laminate is weaker in compression than in tension. However at low levels of stress, following many fatigue cycles, the fatigue life is greater in compression-compression than in tension-tension. The shape of captured hysteresis loops is strongly influenced by loading mode. As subcritical damage develops, loop area increases and dynamic modulus falls.

40|$|We studied load {{partitioning}} during {{tensile loading}} of a 7093 Al alloy reinforced with 15 volume percent SiC particles, by observing {{the evolution of}} phase stresses using in-situ neutron diffraction. Microscopic deformation and damage evaluation had indicated that the dominant damage mechanism of the composite, during uniaxial tensile loading, was reinforcement particle fracture, combined with matrix plasticity at locations of particle cracks. In this study, changes in the load partitioning behavior were investigated up to high macro-strains, where the effects of particle fracture damage became significant. During the initial period of plastic deformation of the composite, we observed the anticipated transfer of load from the yielding matrix to the discontinuous reinforcements. However, beyond approximately 3 % applied strain, an anomalous <b>reversed</b> <b>load</b> transfer behavior was observed, wherein the load appeared to be shed back to the matrix from the reinforcement particles.

Seismic design of precast reinforced concrete structures requires improved beam-column connections to transfer <b>reversed</b> <b>load</b> effects between structural elements.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the cyclic {{behaviour}} of selected powder metallurgical fabricated aluminium foam sandwiches with steel sheet layers was investigated, using methods of DoE (Design of Experiments) {{to get information}} {{about the effect of}} several factors. Static four-point bending tests were realised to define the test load for fatigue experiments. Almost all specimens consisting of X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 sheet layers failed by local delaminating of the sheet layer from the foamed core, which results in relative low testing loads. Higher loads were measured on sandwiches with low alloyed steel sheets DC 01, where failure occurred in the foam core by core shear. The load controlled cyclic four-point bending experiments with fully <b>reversed</b> <b>load</b> (R = - 1) were done until 105 load cycles. Nearly all specimens exceeded this limit at the selected load level. In spite of the low bending forces, many specimens showed a progressive separation of the stainless steel sheet layers, however not leading to a complete miss of the sandwiches composite action or rather failure. Sandwiches with DC 01 -sheet layers partly exhibited a decrease of deflection until 104 load cycles, which probably results from an increasing bending stiffness due to cyclic hardening of the face sheets. On higher loaded specimens or such with very low core density fatigue crack propagation in the foam core leaded to core shear failure. The results of the experiments realised in this thesis serve as first step stone for further investigations. These should concern with the fatigue behaviour on higher load cycles and finally determine characteristic values for cyclic loaded steel-aluminium-sandwiches...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a strain-intensity-factor-based {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to calculate the}} fatigue crack growth under the fully reversed loading condition. A theoretical analysis is conducted in detail {{to demonstrate that the}} strain intensity factor {{is likely to be a}} better driving parameter correlated with the fatigue crack growth rate than the stress intensity factor (SIF), especially for some metallic materials (such as 316 austenitic stainless steel) in the low cycle fatigue region with negative stress ratios R (typically R = − 1). For fully reversed cyclic loading, the constitutive relation between stress and strain should follow the cyclic stress-strain curve rather than the monotonic one (it is a nonlinear function even within the elastic region). Based on that, a transformation algorithm between the SIF and the strain intensity factor is developed, and the fatigue crack growth rate testing data of 316 austenitic stainless steel and AZ 31 magnesium alloy are employed to validate the proposed model. It is clearly observed that the scatter band width of crack growth rate vs. strain intensity factor is narrower than that vs. the SIF for different load ranges (which indicates that the strain intensity factor is a better parameter than the stress intensity factor under the fully <b>reversed</b> <b>load</b> condition). It is also shown that the crack growth rate is not uniquely determined by the SIF range even under the same R, but is also influenced by the maximum loading. Additionally, the fatigue life data (strain-life curve) of smooth cylindrical specimens are also used for further comparison, where a modified Paris equation and the equivalent initial flaw size (EIFS) are involved. The results of the proposed method have a better agreement with the experimental data compared to the stress intensity factor based method. Overall, the strain intensity factor method shows a fairly good ability in calculating the fatigue crack propagation, especially for the fully reversed cyclic loading condition...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} cold forging processes is cold heading of steel wire or rod to produce screws, bolts, nuts and rivets. The process is limited by a complicated interplay of many factors. The cold work (pre-drawing) is one of them. Although several investigations into the effects of pre-drawing on the formability of metals during cold heading processes have been conducted, so far no attention has been given to the numerical simulations of this phenomenon. The current work aims at examining effects of pre-drawing on formability during cold heading through numerical simulations. Physical tests in the literature investigating the effects of pre-drawing on the formability of three metals are simulated using ABAQUS 6. 4, with three successive FE models: the drawing model, the cutting model and the upsetting model. A new combined linear kinematic/nonlinear isotropic hardening constitutive model is proposed and derived to account for the Bauschinger effect existing in reverse plastic deformation. The new model is implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit v 6. 4 by a user subroutine VUMAT, which is verified by one-element numerical tests under tension, compression and <b>reverse</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. In addition, for the purpose of comparison, the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model is also applied for the materials. The Cockroft and Latham criterion is employed to predict surface fracture.

Alternatively, during compression, the activity of { 10 (1 ‾) 2 } tensile twinning was observed and was much larger than that during tension. When the sheet was subjected to tension following compression, detwinning occurred. Although the trend in the activity of twinning {{was similar to that}} of a magnesium alloy sheet, the behavior observed in the stress–strain curves was quite different from that of a magnesium alloy sheet. Based on the results presented, the effect of twinning and detwinning activities on the work-hardening behavior was discussed...|$|R
