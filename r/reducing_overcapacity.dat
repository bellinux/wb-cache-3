Thus, in Norway the main management system refers to a bundled individual vessels quota system (IVQ) to regulate both inputand output in fisheries. Within the frame of such a closed and strict regime, fisheries should be sufficiently framed to avoid unprofitable overcapacity.

40|$|Scrapping {{programmes}} {{and individual}} transferable quotas (ITQs) are two management measures frequently used to <b>reduce</b> <b>overcapacity</b> in fisheries. These measures are often aimed at specific vessel segments targeting specific fish stocks. In this case, fishermen who scrap their vessels or sell their quotas may shift their fishing activities, possibly contributing to overcapacity in other fleets. The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide some insights on this issue based on a Swedish scrapping programme for trawlers targeting cod and Norwegian lobster and the introduction of an ITQ system for pelagic vessels introduced in 2008 and 2009. Individual-level data on fishing activities and income from other industries are used to examine how effort and catches have changed after 2009, and to what extent fishermen have left the fishing industry. The lesson learnt from the Swedish case is that fishermen tend to stay in the fishing sector, and this holds true for both participants in the scrapping programme and fishermen who sold their quota in the ITQ system. Therefore measures to <b>reduce</b> <b>overcapacity</b> in targeted fleets have increased fishing pressure and competition for quotas in the Swedish small-scale fleet...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a global analysis of recent {{trends in the}} EU fishing fleet. Analysis of the capital productivity, labour rates, and economic benefits of the fleet revealed that considerable replacement of fishermen by better technology and well-equipped vessels occurred between 1990 and 2006. The analysis confirms that the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been ineffective in reducing fishing capacity. In addition, the changes in capacity that occurred in this time interval differed among the different sectors of the fleet. Some members of the high sea fishing fleet increased their capacity (range 11 - 57 %), and the deep-sea sector, which has greater tonnage and fishing power, increased its fishing capacity by 34 - 44 %.

40|$|Overcapacity is {{probably}} the most fundamental challenge to fisheries management as it can lead to both overfishing and to low profitability. Most of the Norwegian fisheries have limited entry, through the use of annual permits (coastal fleet) and licences (ocean going fleet) in combination with individual vessel quotas (IVQ). Limited entry is necessary in order to secure a stable resource basis for the participants. This can also ensure profitability and future investments in the fishing fleet, without using fisheries subsidies. The shares of the overall Norwegian TAC is allocated to different vessel groups, and then distributed between the vessels within the different groups. This allows for several ways of <b>reducing</b> <b>overcapacity,</b> where marked based instruments have aimed at reducing the overall number of operating vessels, while simultaneously protecting the small-scale fleet, maintaining coastal settlements and encompassing regional considerations. The two primary structural instruments that have been employed are decommissioning and various systems for consolidating vessel quotas. In 2007 the current structural system was introduced in the White Paper Norwegian structural policy, which among other alterations put a time limitation on 20 to 25 years on the use of consolidated quotas, and the system was extended to include the vessel group between 11 and 15 meters.

Numerous studies have looked at either the ex-ante potential of catch shares management to <b>reduce</b> <b>overcapacity</b> in a fishery or the ex-post effects of implementing such a program, but no research has evaluated how catch share trading networks impact fleet level efficiency gains. Many commercial fisheries cover large areas and are geographically segmented into distinct regional groups with little interaction between groups; given this reality catch share trading is often localized with limited trading between regions due to high transaction costs. This research uses social network analysis of quota trading markets to determine how trading network structure impacts fleet consolidation in a catch share managed fishery. Using a combination of IFQ trading and fishing effort data from the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery this research evaluates how trading network structure impacted capacity reduction and fleet efficiency gains after IFQ implementation. This analysis will evaluate and compare realized technical efficiency gains and fleet consolidation to what would be expected if quota trading were frictionless (a non-segmented market with no search costs).

40|$|Management {{objectives}} of the European Union for North Sea fish stocks are shifting towards considering both biological sustainability and economic benefits. As part of multiannual management plans, an adjustment restriction on fish quota has been introduced. Its objective is to obtain an efficient fish stock and to <b>reduce</b> <b>overcapacity</b> for the fishing industry. We develop and apply a bi-level stochastic dynamic programming model to study {{the effect of a}} quota adjustment restriction on the net present value of resource rents, overcapacity and fish stock, when the system is recovering from a downward environmental shock. At level one, a policy maker sets the quota, considering fishermen behavior, stochastic fish stock dynamics, capital stock dynamics and a quota adjustment restriction. At level two, fishermen harvest myopically and make long-term investment decisions, assuming that fish stock and quota do not change over time. The two levels are linked by the quota, which is optimized by the policy maker at level one and becomes a restriction for myopic harvest and long-term investment decisions of fishermen at level two.

40|$|Tunas {{and their}} {{relatives}} dominate the world’s largest ecosystems and sustain {{some of the most}} valuable fisheries. The impacts of fishing on these species has been debated intensively over the past decade, giving rise to divergent views on the scale and extent of the impacts of fisheries on pelagic ecosystems. We use all available age-structured stock assessments to evaluate the adult biomass trajectories and exploitation status of 26 populations of tunas {{and their relatives}} (17 tunas, 5 mackerels and 4 Spanish mackerels) from 1953 to 2006. Overall, there has been a 48 % global decline in total adult biomass over the last half century. The trajectories of individual populations depend on the interaction between life histories, ecology and fishing pressure. The steepest declines are exhibited by two distinct groups: the largest longest-lived temperate tunas and the smaller short-lived mackerels, both with most of their populations being overexploited. The remaining populations, mostly tropical tunas have been fished down to approximately maximum sustainable yield levels preventing further expansion of these fisheries. Fishing mortality has increased steadily to the point where around 15 % of the tunas and their relatives are killed each year globally. Overcapacity of these fisheries is jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of these species.

Also, institutional measures to <b>reduce</b> <b>overcapacity</b> are established. However, the management of shrimp trawling fisheries in the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and in the Fisheries Protection Zone around Svalbard provides exceptions to this management regime.

40|$|Purpose. The {{railways}} of Ukraine {{have been}} operated the locomotives, which are both morally and physically obsolete. Therefore, {{to ensure the}} competitiveness of rail transport {{it is necessary to}} update the locomotive fleet, and first of all the fleet of electric locomotives, because electrified railways provide the greater part of passenger and freight traffic. In this connection it is of special importance to determine the optimum parameters of the nominal mode of electric rolling stock. The purpose of the work is to examine the features of solution of these problems with respect to electric locomotives. Methodology. Assuming that the limit values of traction force are determined by the conditions of wheel-rail grip, then the power of the nominal mode can be represented as the product of rated speed, estimated friction coefficient, train weight and the coefficients that represent the ratio of the estimated (starting) value of traction force to value of traction force the nominal mode and the ratio of the mass of the locomotive to the train weight. Since the mass of the train is not a constant value, there is always a surplus power of the locomotive fleet required for the mastering of a predetermined volume of transportations. <b>Reduced</b> <b>overcapacity</b> of the locomotive fleet can be achieved by introduction of the locomotives of different power, designed for driving trains of different weight that will result in increased completeness of the power use but also in difficulty in selecting of locomotives for trains in operation. The paper shows the method of calculating the optimum values of power, speed and traction force of the nominal mode. It presents the mathematical model of the relationship of traction rate, excessive capacity and power of the traction unit. Findings. It is proved that the power of the traction unit, the total fleet power requirement and the excess of power in absolute units are proportional to the speed of the nominal mode. To reduce the total power of the fleet when selecting the optimum power of the traction unit it is necessary to take into consideration the speed of the nominal mode, defined by the condition of minimization of power consumption for traction, i. e. the smallest value that enables the implementation of the given running speed and the powerredundancy level required for operation.

40|$|Last October, the {{government}} of Mauritania put a two month stop to fishing. The measure has been taken to ensure that fish stocks are preserved and can be replenished in a natural way. The country's decision coincides with an initiative taken at a UN fisheries meeting to address fleet overcapacity, {{one of the most}} important factors contributing to overfishing. However, governments failed to finish their work and give themselves a firm deadline to <b>reduce</b> fleet <b>overcapacity,</b> according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Key provisions of a draft action plan on overcapacity were agreed by about 80 member countries at the conclusion of their meeting at FAO's headquarters, at the end of last year. The draft action plan commits FAO member nations to develop national plans to address fleet capacity and begin to control the size of distant-water fishing fleets. WWF estimates that thirteen of the world's largest fishing fleets have a fleet capacity that is two and half times greater than necessary to ensure a sustainable catch.

40|$|China´s {{interests}} in Central Asia were propelled, with {{the launching of}} the initiative “One Belt, One Road”, renamed as “The Belt and Road Initiative”, {{better known as the}} New Silk Road. Thanks to the infrastructure investment China will become interconnected with other regions of the world, breaking up its secular isolation and will send its products to the global market more easily by land and sea. One principal question in this revolutionary change has to do with China´s hypothetical second intentions of geopolitical influence on the countries affected by the new routes (countries of transit or final destination). The article tries to answer the following questions: Does the People's Republic of China aim only to revive its internal labour market, <b>reduce</b> its industrial <b>overcapacity</b> and boost its exports? Is globalization coming to an end or is it entering a new phase of interconnectivity? How does this affect the relations between Russia and China in the Asian region...|$|R
40|$|Surveys on {{the hook}} fishery of Lake Victoria {{revealed}} that long lines {{are the most important}} gear used for catching Nile perch. Hand lines and hook and line are used to catch Nile tilapia and also Nile perch. Hooks are increasing because of their cheapness. They now total about 12 million lake-wide. Hooks are preferentially baited with live bait; they select the catch according to their sizes and bait type. Big range of fish sizes is caught. Hooks tend {{to reduce the size of}} the brood stock made up of big perch that carry millions of eggs. The use of live bait suppresses the recovery of resurging species with an adverse impact on the lake’s biodiversity. Use of the recommended hook sizes 4 - 9 should be enforced and <b>overcapacity</b> <b>reduced</b> for sustenance of the fish stocks. The farming of bait fish should be encouraged for standardisation of bait size to target the right size of the catch and spare the recovering species. Key words: hook fishery management, fish stocks, biodiversity, bait fish farmin...|$|R
40|$|To {{provide a}} good deal of {{manufacturing}} processes, is used a compressed air, which is produced by compressors of various types, including turbochargers. In highlands, the turbocharger operation is characterized {{by the fact that the}} actual performance of the turbochargers differ significantly from the certified values, and the compressed air parameters do not always guarantee the smooth and efficient functioning of using equipment. The conducted theoretical and experimental studies have found out that the highland has impact on the probability of emerging surge. The paper proposes a method to determine a performance margin, which can <b>reduce</b> the <b>overcapacity,</b> i. e., to bring the operating point to the border zone of the surge without opening the anti-surge valve. The paper presents research results of the turbochargers of the type 4 CI 425 MX 4, a series of "CENTAC" manufactured by INGERSOL – RAND, made under production-line conditions in the highland under severe weather conditions. A boundary position of the surge can significantly vary depending on the atmospheric air condition (pressure, temperature, humidity). Knowing the current position of the surge zone and the operating point of the compressor it is possible to regulate the compressor capacity so that, when moving the operating point in the area of low consumption, to provide maximum approximation of the operating point to the border zone of the surge without opening the anti-surge valve. The performance margin relative to the border of surge margin sets the lower limit of regulation and its choice depends on the speed of the operating point movement towards reducing consumption. A reliably determined starting point of the unstable turbocharger operation is an important component to maintain the reliable operation of the air-compressed installations. As follows from the data in the article, the borders of the starting surge and the line of the maximum acceleration of the operating point movement towards surge with decreasing density of the intake air are moved to the left of the operating point, and the value of surge margin increases. The turbocharger stability in highland conditions, when moving the operating point in the area of low consumption is increased. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} three decades, {{there has been a}} move towards rights-based {{management}} of access to marine fisheries, especially individual transferable quotas (ITQs). Although it is generally agreed that ITQs improve the economic efficiency of fisheries, few empirical studies examined how stakeholders respond to the incentives set in an ITQ fishery, determining the actual economic, social and ecological outcomes of such a management system. This thesis addresses the question of how fishers and quota owners make decisions regarding their fishing activities {{in the context of an}} ITQ system. The study focuses on the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery. In 1998, ITQs were introduced in the fishery in an attempt to decrease fishing effort, while the total allowed catch (TAC) would restore the stock at a sustainable level. The thesis investigates the dynamics of the fishery as it evolved during the decade after introduction of ITQs. The study is based on an empirical analysis of the changes that occurred in the fleet and its activity, and on a bio-economic simulation model. To understand the complex dynamics of the fishery, fishing activity of the fleet was categorised as metiers that account for the spatial and seasonal heterogeneity of biological characteristics, infrastructure and weather encountered in the fishery. These metiers were used to inform an agent based model of fishing behaviour. The model combines individual decisions on allocation of fishing effort with a quota trading market where quota owners can lease in/out quota according to their expected economic performances. Empirical analysis shows that ITQs <b>reduced</b> the <b>overcapacity</b> in the fishery and that the TAC allowed the stock to rebuild. The impacts of ITQs on the fishery were the results of both structural changes of the fishing fleet and of the change of fishers behaviour. Fishers responded to the management change by modifying their fishing strategies in space and time to increase profit. In addition, the ownership of the fishing rights changed toward a higher proportion of quota owned by non-fishers, although concentration of quota has been limited in the fishery. The bio-economic model was used to investigate the key drivers that underpin fishing and quota-trading decisions by the fishers and profit-maximising decision process predicted well the observed fishing behaviour. The limitation of quota aggregation is believed to have facilitate the reduction of excess capacity of the fleet but could constrain economic efficiency of fishing firms. The model was also used to assess the future of the fishery and test scenarios on the potential impacts of changes in the economic and ecological environment in which the fishery operates. Although the future of the fishery remain uncertain, integrating dynamic fishing behaviour in projection models reduce the uncertainty and the use of economic drivers to simulate decision process allows to explore a wide range of scenarios regarding economic predictions and their outcomes including social and economic considerations...|$|R
