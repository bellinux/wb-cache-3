An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and <b>reverses</b> <b>the</b> orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} <b>reverses,</b> <b>the</b> Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E

5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, <b>reverses</b> (<b>the</b> secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley <b>reverses</b> <b>the</b> ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way.

When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters.

In 2004, the Thai government made an agreement with China to open the river to commercial navigation by destroying rapids, which Thai Baan research had identified as important fish spawning grounds. On the Chinese side, dams were constructed. Living River Siam gathered additional Thai Baan surveys from 146 villagers in Amphoe Chiang Khong, which determined that the blasting of rapids had made the river water unsuitable for drinking and bathing, washed away many local riverside gardens, and decimated the populations of local plants and fish. In response to the 2004 studies, the Thai government suspended blasting on one of the rapids, the Khon Pi Luang.|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that <b>reverses</b> <b>the</b> drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
5|$|Yojimbo (The Bodyguard), Kurosawa Production's second film, {{centers on}} a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two {{opposing}} violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the Western, {{while at the same}} time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically <b>reverses</b> <b>the</b> historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring Tatsuya Nakadai in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon) and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad. Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.|$|E
