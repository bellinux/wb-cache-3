40|$|This article {{examines}} the nature of <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> in intellectual property law. Taking the United States' Plant Patent Act of 1930 as its central focus, it explores the terms in which the compatibility of biological <b>inventions</b> with <b>the</b> modern paradigm of <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> was debated {{in the first part}} of the 20 th century. The questions addressed in the debates leading up to the enactment of the Plant Patent Act of 1930 - what kinds of plant qualified as patentable subject matter; what exactly did a breeder have to do in order to qualify as an inventor; and what was the relationship between <b>the</b> act of <b>invention</b> and <b>the</b> act of <b>reproducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> - were ultimately questions about the consistency of ideas and the nature of manufacture, the answers to which are as pertinent today as they were some 80 years ago. We argue that in answering these questions, the traditional notion of <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> was redefined. Whereas traditional utility patents were based on the assumption that the only actor able to exercise agency in relation to the development of a novel <b>invention</b> was <b>the</b> human inventor, the regime of plant patents acknowledged that nature played a key role in the creation of new plant varieties. By altering the concept of agency that underpins the inventive process within patent law, plant patent law fundamentally changed the way that <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> was configured. In particular, whereas mechanical inventors were inventors at the beginning, breeders were inventors after the fact. At the same time, plant patent law also reversed the roles normally played by the participants involved in the creation of <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b> Under traditional patent doctrine, nature provided the material which was then shaped into an <b>invention</b> by <b>the</b> human inventor. In the case of plant patents, nature did the inventing, and the breeder was relegated to the task of identifying and then reproducing nature's creations. One of the consequences of this is that breeders did not create a new genetic principle - instead, they inductively appropriated a natural event. This changed <b>the</b> premise of <b>invention</b> - invention became an inductive rather than an originating act. Using the doctrinal requirement of enablement as a case study, we show how the reconfiguration of <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> had and continues to have important ramifications for the way that plant inventions, as with biological inventions more generally, are dealt with by intellectual property law.

40|$|As an {{extension}} to last lecture’s “How to Read a Paper”, Professor Dally explained {{the format of}} patents and gave {{tips on how to}} read a patent in preparation for one of the reading materials for next lecture. • Heading: Includes various information such as the inventors, date of filing, cited references and related publications. • Terminology: Patents use certain words in certain ways, with different meanings. e. g. ’consists of ’ has the meaning ’consists solely of’, so ’comprises ’ is used in cases where there may be other parts. • Claims: The claims {{at the end of a}} patent are the ideas that are being claimed as the invention. There are two types of claims, which can be thought of as in a tree structure. Independent claims are central ideas. Dependent claims are claims that elaborate on the central idea. • “Summary of the Invention ” : succinct description of the invention. • Two requirements of patents: ’Enabling ’ in that a person of average skill in the art must be able to <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> based on the disclosed details. ’Best Mode ’ in that the best configuration and use of the invention known at the time of application must be described. • Searching through patents: There is a patent search engine at ’www. ibm. com ’ if one needs to search through patents. 2 EE 482 : Lecture # 4...|$|E
50|$|American print clubs or printmaking {{societies}} were prolific in the 19th century. Their impetus {{was primarily}} exhibition, technical exchange, shared equipment, {{and the promotion}} of printmaking as a fine art, as opposed to a method of <b>reproducing</b> images. <b>The</b> <b>invention</b> of photography meant that reproduction of art works could be achieved photographically instead of through the graphic arts of etching, engraving, and lithography. Thus, these methods of printmaking were freed from their reproducing role to develop as pure fine arts. In addition to the rise of printmaking societies/clubs, individual printmaking artists also sought to distinguish their work as a fine art, as opposed to a craft. Generally these artists from the 19th century were referred to as painter-etchers. Nineteenth century printmaking societies in the United States were the New York Etchers Club (1877), Boston Etchers Club (1880?), Philadelphia Society of Etchers (1880), Brooklyn Etchers Club (1881), Brooklyn Scratchers Club (1882), Society of American Etchers (1888), Cincinnati Etchers Club (circa 1890).|$|R
