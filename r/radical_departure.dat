5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were {{not convinced that}} the album would sell well, because the project was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|After 1966, in a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from past}} policies, the Ministry of Economy {{announced}} a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from {{an annual rate}} of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, {{everything}} was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E

5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E
5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam. In {{what became known as}} the Easter Offensive, the combined North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces employed combined arms tactics using heavy weapons that were a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the low-intensity guerrilla warfare of previous years. Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek to win the war outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} {{and is the}} third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions. The game was released in 1998 on Microsoft Windows, and in 1999 for the PlayStation. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player {{in the role of}} a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Spanish {{military}} began modernizing their handguns. The extensive trials {{continued into the}} 1980s and Llama-Gabilondo proposed first, the Omni series, and then later a new model, the M-82. Both entries were <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> from their normal products and used the latest technology.|$|R
50|$|In {{considering}} the work {{performed by the}} Corps Observation Groups these weather conditions must {{be kept in mind}} as an element which affected the execution of each type of mission. In the matter of reconnaissance and infantry contact patrol work they produced some <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> from the methods ordinarily used.|$|R
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O'Brien in 1829 for the {{construction}} of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter's Church. In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul's, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul's School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom {{and on the}} Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies {{came to the fore}} that were a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.|$|E
50|$|Others, such as Daniel Ellsberg {{disagree}} with Raiffa's reasoning and have devised alternative interpretations of decision theory. One {{of the most}} <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> is Dempster-Shafer theory, which rejects the use of probability theory completely, in favour of a theory of belief functions, which do not satisfy the axioms of probability.|$|R
50|$|Plasma Desktop is {{the first}} {{workspace}} that was developed by KDE. It was declared mature {{with the release of}} KDE SC 4.2. It is designed for desktop PCs and larger laptops.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is not to offer any new {{political}} measures for consideration or to suggest any <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> from the present plans of our government. Nor does it propose to advocate any new ideology, but to study trends in economic policies, and to suggest a philosophic approach to the appraisal of these trends...|$|R
25|$|According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from former}} United States foreign policies, and a {{continuation}} of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.|$|E
25|$|But {{the period}} {{produced}} {{a significant change}} in Weston's work. Isolated, Weston turned his attention away from landscapes and to his own wife's body. He painted her nude figure repeatedly, applying his painting techniques to the contours and curves of her body. The paintings Harold Weston produced {{came to be known as}} 'landscape nudes'—a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from traditional nudes.|$|E
25|$|He {{wished to}} reach this `holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s—despite his related health problems—took its toll, and finally {{prevented}} him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced {{the work of his}} student Robert Rosen.|$|E
5000|$|Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt The Fireman's Curse was [...] "overly {{ambitious and}} cluttered, and {{generally}} {{suffered from a}} lack of fresh ideas".

50|$|Taborite {{theology}} represented one of {{the most}} <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> from that of the medieval Catholic Church. They rejected what they called a veneer of corruption in the Church and insisted on the normativeness of biblical authority. Even though Taborite theologians were versed in scholastic theology, they were among the first intellectuals to break free from centuries-old scholastic methods.|$|R
25|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{advanced}} reactor designs are {{in various stages of}} development. Some are evolutionary from the PWR, BWR and PHWR designs above, some are more <b>radical</b> <b>departures.</b> The former include the advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), two of which are now operating with others under construction, and the planned passively safe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) and AP1000 units (see Nuclear Power 2010 Program).|$|R
25|$|The family intrigues that {{challenged}} his succession to {{the throne}} probably contributed to John's approach to rulership, which was to appoint men from outside the imperial family to help him govern the empire. This was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the methods of his father, who had used the imperial family and its many connections to fill almost all senior administrative and military posts.|$|E
25|$|The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, {{the most}} {{hardline}} {{of all the}} Exclusive Brethren groups, has developed into a de facto hierarchical body which operates under the headship of an Elect Vessel, currently Bruce Hales of Australia. Some defectors have accused him and his predecessors of having quasi-papal authority. This development is almost universally considered by other streams of the Plymouth Brethren movement, however, as a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from Brethren principles.|$|E
25|$|A new flying Batmobile design {{appears in}} Batman Beyond {{used by the}} new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made {{multiple}} appearances {{in the future of}} the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat faceplate on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings.|$|E
50|$|The program {{offered a}} magazine-of-the-air mix of news, sports, comedy, variety, music, celebrity {{interviews}} and other short segments (along with records, usually of popular middle-of-the-road songs, especially in its later years). Its length and eclectic format were <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> {{from the traditional}} radio programming structure of 30- and 60-minute programs and represented an ambitious attempt {{to respond to the}} rise of television as Americas major home-entertainment medium.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{challenges}} Mäki's {{argument about}} commonsensibles {{by offering a}} case study from contemporary microeconomics – contemporary revealed preference theory (hereafter CRPT) – where terms like "preference," "utility," {{and to some extent}} "choice," are <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> from the common sense meanings of these terms. Although the argument challenges the claim that economics is inhabited solely by commonsensibles, it is not inconsistent with such folk notions being common in economic theory...|$|R
50|$|Various bizarre {{forms are}} {{included}} here, all <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> from the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes. These forms range from nearly square or triangular (boxfishes), globose (pufferfishes) to laterally compressed (filefishes) and triggerfish. They {{range in size}} from Rudarius excelsus, measuring just 2 cm in length, to the ocean sunfish, the largest of all bony fish at up to 3 m in length and weighing over 2 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|At the Salon d'Automne of 1910, {{held from}} 1 October to 8 November, Jean Metzinger {{introduced}} an extreme form {{of what would}} soon be labeled Cubism, {{not just to the}} general public for the first time, but to other artists that had no contact with Picasso or Braque. Though others were already working in a proto-cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger's Nude represented a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> further still.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, the German {{entrepreneur}} Carl Hagenbeck {{founded the}} Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now {{a quarter of}} Hamburg. His zoo was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from {{the layout of the}} zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments. He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|When the Lincoln one-cent coin {{made its}} initial {{appearance}} in 1909, it marked a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the accepted styling of United States coinage, {{as it was}} the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. Previously, a strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.|$|E
50|$|What {{was later}} {{known as the}} C1-A was among the three {{original}} cargo ship designs including the basic C2 and C3. The further developments included the C1-B which included minor changes and turbine engines, and then more <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> for special needs to meet the exigencies of the war, including troop ships based on the C1-B. Deliveries of the C1-B began before the other models, in mid 1941.|$|R
40|$|The {{universe}} {{we observe}} is homogeneous on super-horizon scales, {{leading to the}} ``cosmic homogeneity problem''.

50|$|University of Toronto {{psychiatrist}} Saul V. Levine made a {{study of}} deprogramming in his book <b>Radical</b> <b>Departures</b> (1984). He concluded that {{as a means of}} changing people's views it was not only a failure but positively dangerous. These conclusions were supported by other scholars who provided civil libertarians, religious leaders in established churches and members of new religions with evidence against the practice of deprogramming. As a result it gradually fell into disrepute.|$|R
