Amber comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard {{screaming}} after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber {{out of the house}} before returning to Katie, who resumes <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Christmas Day 1975, George looked up at the house after {{checking}} on the boathouse and saw the pig standing behind Missy at her bedroom window. When he ran up to her room he found her fast asleep with her small rocking chair slowly <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E
25|$|Using {{his newly}} {{developed}} electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created {{one of the}} first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern DC motor. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.|$|E

25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually very subtle but may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth).</b> A high pain threshold is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E
25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|... "Great Big World" [...] was sung by Anne Hathaway and {{replaced}} another song called [...] "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and {{described as being}} [...] "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." [...] This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. [...] "Be Prepared" [...] was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> on his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart {{later on in the}} film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the character switch his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept.|$|E

500|$|Horses are herd animals, {{with a clear}} {{hierarchy}} of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures {{that are able to}} form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses. However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, [...] "weaving" [...] (<b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth),</b> and other problems.|$|E
2500|$|A {{person on}} a moving swing can {{increase}} the amplitude of the swing's oscillations without any external drive force (pushes) being applied, by changing the moment of inertia of the swing by <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> ("pumping") or alternately standing and squatting, in rhythm with the swing's oscillations. [...] The varying of the parameters drives the system. [...] Examples of parameters that may be varied are its resonance frequency [...] and damping [...]|$|E
2500|$|A {{familiar}} {{experience of}} both parametric and driven oscillation is {{playing on a}} swing. <b>Rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> pumps the swing as a driven harmonic oscillator, but once moving, the swing can also be parametrically driven by alternately standing and squatting at key points in the swing arc. This changes moment of inertia of the swing and hence the resonance frequency, and children can quickly reach large amplitudes provided that they have some amplitude to start with (e.g., get a push). [...] Standing and squatting at rest, however, leads nowhere.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the 2,400 species of praying mantises are ambush predators, although some ground and bark species actively pursue prey. Species that are predominantly ambush predators camouflage themselves and spend long periods standing perfectly still. They largely wait for their prey to stray within reach, but most mantises chase prey if it strays closely enough. In pure ambush mode, a mantis lashes out at remarkable speed when a target does get within reach. [...] When the prey is a butterfly or other flying insect, the mantis snatches {{it out of the}} air. Praying mantises are deliberate when they move, and only do so when there is good reason to. When they do move, they often travel forward while gently <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> This helps them to blend in with the bush or tree on which they are climbing, as it sways in the breeze.|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted off to sleep, and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to reports that Fred Durst, {{lead singer of}} Limp Bizkit, is {{a big fan of}} Tool, the latter's vocalist Maynard James Keenan said, [...] "If the lunch-lady in high school hits on you, you appreciate the compliment, but you're not really gonna start dating the lunch-lady, are ya?" [...] While Durst has cited Rage Against the Machine as a major influence, Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine is open about hating Limp Bizkit's music. At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the Best Rock Video category for their song [...] "Break Stuff", beating Rage Against the Machine's [...] "Sleep Now in the Fire". When Limp Bizkit accepted their award, Commerford went on stage and climbed [...] up a backdrop, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> After the incident, Commerford was arrested and spent a night in jail. Years later, Tim Commerford called Limp Bizkit [...] "one of the dumbest bands in the history of music". Years later, Commerford also said, [...] "I do apologize for Limp Bizkit. I really do. I feel really bad that we inspired such bullshit... They're gone, though. That's the beautiful thing." ...|$|E
