The name was also given to a suburb within the electorate. The district of Hanson was renamed to Ashford at the 2002 election. Hanson was re-drawn from a marginal Liberal to a marginal Labor electorate at the 1993 election. Often redistributed in all directions, particularly north and east, the only constant suburb in Ashford and Hanson has been the western half of Plympton. Incumbent Liberal MP Heini Becker moved to Peake, now West Torrens, however Ashford was still narrowly won by Liberal candidate Stewart Leggett. Currently the seat is held by Labor member Steph Key who defeated Leggett at the 1997 election. A redistribution prior to the 2014 election saw Labor's margin significantly reduced from 4.8 percent to 0.6 percent however Labor retained the seat with an increased margin of 1.9 percent.

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies optimal {{redistribution}} among {{two different}} regions {{in a federal}} state. Regional governments supply local public goods financed with distorting local taxes. They have better information on their tax bases than the federal government. We model this both as an adverse selection problem {{on the size of}} local tax bases and/or as moral hazard problem on local tax enforcement. Moral hazard alone does not affect the first best redistribution rule, which is a lump sum transfer from the rich to the poor region. In all other cases the optimal transfer rule involves a lump sum tax on the rich regions and a premium for fiscal effort by the poor regions, with the transfer falling short of the first-best level. In the equilibrium with moral hazard and adverse selection, tax evasion occurs only in the poor region, even though the possibility of lax tax enforcement benefits the rich and harms the poor region because it reduces equilibrium <b>redistribution.</b> <b>Key</b> words: intergovernmental grants, regional redistribution formula, information, fiscal federalism Jel classification: H 23 asymmetric # We thank Jordi Brandts, Andreas Haufler, Christian Schulz and participants in seminars a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A key {{assignment}} {{scheme is}} a model for enforcing an information flow policy using cryptographic techniques. Such schemes have been widely studied in recent years. Each security label {{is associated with a}} symmetric encryption key: data objects are encrypted and authorised users are supplied with the appropriate key(s). However, updates to encryption keys pose a significant problem, as the new keys have to be issued to all authorised users. In this paper, we propose three generic approaches to key assignment schemes that remove the problem of <b>key</b> <b>redistribution</b> following <b>key</b> updates. We analyse the overheads incurred by these approaches and conclude that these overheads are negligible in practical applications...|$|R

By redistributing {{the keys in}} each round of radix, each processor has exactly {{the same number of}} keys, thereby reducing the overall sorting time. Load balanced radix sort is currently known as the fastest internal sorting method for distributed-memory multiprocessors. However, as the computation time is balanced, the communication time emerges as the bottleneck of the overall sorting performance due to <b>key</b> <b>redistribution.</b> We present in this report a new parallel radix sorter that solves the communication problem of balanced radix sort, called partitioned parallel radix sort. The new method reduces the communication time by eliminating the <b>redistribution</b> steps. The <b>keys</b> are first sorted in a top-down fashion (left-to-right as opposed to right-to-left) by using some most significant bits. Once the keys are localized to each processor, the rest of sorting is confined within each processor, hence eliminating the need for global <b>redistribution</b> of <b>keys.</b> It enables well balanced communication and computation across processors...|$|R

This is precisely what is considered as a challenging problem which needs a lot of work and effort. Many wireless sensor network applications are used in gathering information for military, industrial, and environmental issues. These sensors for example may be deployed in hostile when they collect precise information about the enemy. This deployment introduces several security issues to apply to the sensor network. This encourages researchers to start developing dependable routing protocols, which are suitable for the network sensor. In other words, if the sensors are deployed in a hostile area without protection against attacks, the enemy can attack the network and may start using it for his/her own benefit. Therefore, achieving secure communication paradigm for sensor networks becomes an important issue.

Several variations of this basic model have been proposed (e. g., [1, 6]) but {{they have in common}} to minimize the trust required on the client at the cost of a static way of sharing data. Indeed, whatever the granularity of sharing, the dataset is split in subsets reflecting a current sharing situation, each encrypted with a different key.

Total internal reflection fluorescence imaging indicated that LFA- 1 and both chemokine receptors redistributed into closer contact with the substrate as the cells spread onto the surface and remodeled their topography. A geometric model of the surface remodeling with nonuniform distribution of molecules and a realistic distribution of microvilli heights was matched to the data, and the fits indicated a 1000 -fold increase in the concentration of chemokine receptors and integrins available for bond formation at the interface.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{evaluate}} the diffusion coefficient of vacancy-hydrogen clusters (VHn) in metals. The key is a good separation of time scales between H diffusion and the metal-vacancy exchange. The Ni-H system is investigated in details, using ab initio calculations, but the arguments can be transposed to other systems. It is shown that cluster diffusion can be treated as an uncorrelated random walk and that H is always in equilibrium before the vacancy-metal exchange. Then, the diffusion coefficient is a sum over jump paths of the equilibrium probability {{of being in a}} specific VHn configuration times the corresponding activation terms. The influence of H on the energy barrier is well reproduced by effective pair interactions between the jumping Ni and the H atoms inside the vacancy. This model is motivated by an analysis of the electronic charge <b>redistribution</b> in <b>key</b> saddle configurations. The interaction is repulsive and decreases with distance. The model is used to find easy jump path, reduce the number of saddle searches, and provide an estimate of the error expected from this reduction. The application to the Ni-H system shows that vacancies are drastically slowed down by H. The effects of temperature and bulk H concentration are explored and the origin of the non-Arrhenius behavior is explained. At equilibrium, VHn clusters always induce a speedup of metal diffusion.

Recently, a randomized key pre-distribution scheme has been introduced to serve as a practical solution and many improvements are subsequently proposed. These schemes mainly focus on key allocations based on pre-deployment estimates of post-deployment information items, such as location data and attack probabilities. Unfortunately, such information items may be unavailable or may change over time. Based on adaptability to post-deployment contexts, we propose a <b>key</b> <b>redistribution</b> scheme that exploits neighboring keys from connected neighbors to reach unconnected nodes. We show that our scheme can be integrated into most existing key predistribution schemes to further improve their performance. We demonstrate our proposed scheme’s salient features, such as high connectivity, high resilience, and efficient memory usage, by both analytical and simulation results.
