Daniel, the younger and most reckless partner, pays remittances {{to his family and}} spends the rest on goods and privileges inside prison.

When Coronel and his partner Bernabe (Rayver Cruz) arrive at the local precinct, they clash with Philippine National Police Sergeant Joaquin Acosta (Joey Marquez), a twenty-year veteran who believes the case was taken from him for political reasons.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the socio-economic profile of access to resources and social behaviour of rural households of the Northern Province of South Africa. It is based on the survey conducted in 24 villages covering 586 households. The preliminary results reflect a number of disparities among men and female household heads and their occupations. Women farmers tend to dominate the agricultural sector, while men are predominantly in the service and industry sectors. Also, male headed households have more members than female headed households, which are mostly single parents and have higher percentage of members under fifteen (reflecting high fertility rates). Unemployment is <b>rife,</b> coupled <b>with</b> a significant number of old (retired) people, and more women involved in subsistence agriculture. Migration is prevalent, and is a source of support for households to supplement their livelihood, since farming is not enough to meet household requirements. There is still a gap in access to water and land resources. These results pose major challenges for agriculture in the new millennium since access and distribution of resources will be imminent.

[...] During this period, crime was <b>rife</b> and encounters <b>with</b> highwaymen could be bloody if the victim attempted to resist. The historian Roy Porter described the use of direct, physical action as a hallmark of public and political life: [...] "From the rough-house of the crowd to the dragoons' musket volley, violence was as English as plum pudding. Force was used not just criminally, but as a matter of routine to achieve social and political goals, smudging hard-and-fast distinctions between the worlds of criminality and politics...Highwaymen were romanticized, with a hidden irony, as 'gentlemen of the road'." ...|$|R
