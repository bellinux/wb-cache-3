40|$|There is a {{high degree}} of {{complexity}} in both fluid flow and phase-behavior of gas condensate reservoirs during the depletion period due to <b>retrograde</b> <b>condensation.</b> Natural depletion in gas condensate reservoirs results in low condensate recoveries at surface due to in-situ condensation and accumulation of condensate in the reservoir especially in vicinity of wellbore.

Here we show that a simple reformulation allows us to handle the disappearance or reappearance of phases and thus allows us to solve a wider class of process problems. The proposed strategy uses a penalty function approach, called Penalty Simulation of Nonsmooth Algebraic Terms and Attributes (P-SONATA), to accomodate the nonsmooth nature of the system. To solve the vapor-liquid equilibrium problem, we also extend the theoretical results of the approach of Bullard and Biegler (1991) to characterize descent and convergence properties for P-SONATA. The performance of this formulation is demonstrated for process models involving phase equilibrium, such as transitions from one and two phases in flash and distillation problems, where mass and energy balances must be satisfied but the phase equilibrium expression can be relaxed.

40|$|In gas-condensate reservoirs, {{production}} rate starts to decrease when <b>retrograde</b> <b>condensation</b> occurs. As the bottomhole pressure drops below the dewpoint, gascondensate and water buildup impede flow of gas to the surface. To stop the impairment of the well, many publications suggest wettability alteration to gas-wetting {{as a permanent}} solution to the problem. Previous simulation work suggests an "optimum wetting state" to exist where maximum gas condensate well productivity is reached. This work has direct application in gas-condensate reservoirs, especially in identifying the most effective stimulation treatment which can be designed to provide the optimum wetting conditions in the near-wellbore region. This thesis presents an extensive experimental study on Berea sandstone rocks treated with a fluorinated polymer. Various concentrations of the polymer are investigated to obtain the optimum alteration in wettability to intermediate gas-wet. This wetting condition is achieved with an 8 % polymer solution treatment, which yields maximum gas mobility, ultimately increasing the relative permeability curves and allowing enhanced recovery from gas-condensate wells. The treatments are performed mainly at room conditions, and also under high pressure and high temperature, simulating the natural environment of a reservoir.

The experimental work took place in the Wettability Research Lab in Texas A&M University at Qatar in Doha, Qatar.

30|$|According to the {{explained}} {{procedure in}} Sect.  2.1, IPR curves were plotted and compered in four different average reservoir pressures (Pr) through compositional and modified black-oil simulation of single-layer reservoir model. These results are demonstrated in Fig.  4. It should be mentioned that only reservoir rock and fluid model were simplified and other specifications {{such as the}} number of grid blocks in the radial direction, well perforation, wellbore radius and reservoir pore volume were the same in all cases. Also, IPR curves were plotted by running reservoir model at similar bottom-hole pressures for both simulators. As observed from Fig.  4, the IPR curve moves downward by decreasing average reservoir pressure. In other words, for a specific bottom-hole pressure, well produces a lower rate at lower average reservoir pressure. Also, in defined average reservoir pressure, when the bottom-hole pressure becomes close to average reservoir pressure, flow rate decreases and becomes zero due to absence of any pressure drawdown. Maximum flow rate, i.e., absolute open flow (AOF) potential, happens when bottom-hole pressure tends to be zero. According to Fig.  4, for the target gas condensate reservoir, compositional and modified black-oil simulator have good agreement with each other in estimation of flow rate in various bottom-hole pressure. The relative errors of estimated IPR curves using these two simulators are reported in Table  6. These reported errors of less than 10 % show that selecting modified black-oil simulator instead of compositional gives good results with significantly lower runtime. So, the modified black-oil as an optimal simulator was utilized for running the reservoir model in other parts of this study. Also, results illustrated in Fig.  4 and Table  6 state that for average reservoir pressure above dew point pressure, the error between these two simulators is insignificant. This is due to small changes in reservoir fluid composition at pressures higher than dew point pressure with low rate of <b>retrograde</b> <b>condensation.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{issue in the}} development of gas condensate reservoirs is accurate prediction of well deliverability. In this investigation a procedure has been developed for accurate prediction of well production rates using semi-empirical approach. The use of state of the art fine grid numerical simulation is time consuming and computationally demanding, therefore not suitable for real time rapid production management decisions required on site. Development of accurate fit-for-purpose correlations for fluid property prediction below the saturation pressure was a major consideration to properly allow for <b>retrograde</b> <b>condensation,</b> complications of multiphase flow and mobility issues. Previous works are limited to use of experimentally measured pressure, volume, temperature (PVT) property data, together with static relative permeability correlations for simulation of well deliverability. To overcome the above limitations appropriate fluid property correlations required for prediction of well deliverability and dynamic three phase relative permeability correlation have been developed to enable forecasting of these properties at all the desired reservoir conditions The developed correlations include; condensate hybrid compressibility factor, viscosity, density, compositional pseudo-pressure, and dynamic three phase relative permeability. The study made use of published data bases of experimentally measured gas condensate PVT properties and three phase relative permeability data. The developed correlations have been implemented in both vertical and horizontal well models and parametric studies have been performed to determine the critical parameters that control productivity in gas condensate reservoirs, using specific case studies. The improved correlations showed superior performance over existing correlations on validation. The investigation has built on relevant literature to present an approach that modifies the black oil model for accurate well deliverability prediction for condensate reservoirs at conditions normally ignored by the conventional approach. The original contribution to knowledge and practice includes (i) the improved property correlations equations, (4. 44, 4. 47, 4. 66, 4. 69, 4. 75, 5. 21) and (ii) extension of gas rate equations, for condensate rate prediction in both vertical and horizontal wells.

30|$|Natural gas is of {{non-renewable energy}} {{resources}} which are continuously produced and supplied {{to the market}} (Farahani et al. 2015). This significant energy resource {{is referred to as}} a good strategy for many industries and factories so that consumers try to provide storage facilities and equipment to protect themselves against possible fluctuations and crisis arisen from natural gas shortages (Alim and Tohidi 2012). The first successful natural gas storage project was implemented in Canada in 1915; however, by 1995, the number of underground gas storage reservoirs increased to 554 reservoirs worldwide, of which 400 reservoirs were located within Canada and US borders (Flanigan 1995). Underground natural gas storage can be defined as storing a mass volume of natural gas within porous media of rocks at different depths (Wang and Economides 2012). Before planning for a storage project, it is of vital importance to investigate reservoir capacity and deliverability, knowledge of market demand and also consider impacts of weather conditions on the gas market (Confort and Jorge 2014). Gas storage is the operation of gas transmission from a reservoir to another reservoir which is close to the target market, to avoid burning and other losses incurred from a drop-in consumption demand (Azin et al. 2008). One of the common methods of natural gas storage, due to consumption supplement in cold season, referred to gas storage in one depleted gas condensate reservoir (Arfaee and Iman 2014). Among other features of depleted gas reservoirs is that they can accommodate an easy and low-cost gas storage operation, because they enjoy appropriate porosity and permeability characteristics (Kuncir et al. 2003). Also, geological structure and petrophysical properties of many gas reservoirs are thoroughly investigated and well specified, so that one can employ computer models developed in the oil and gas industries to predict thermodynamic behaviors, movements and trapping of hydrocarbons (Katz et al. 1959). Furthermore, some of existing facilities and wells can be utilized for storage operations (Knepper 1997). Besides the mentioned reasons, the gas injection can act to recover several percents of the remaining hydrocarbon in the reservoir, so that a gas storage project can also be seen as an enhanced gas and condensate recovery project (Aminian et al. 2007). As such, these reservoirs may provide the best and the most economical accommodations for gas storage (Bennion et al. 2000; Rabbani et al. 2018). The annual number of injections and withdrawals is normally low with the daily transmission rate depending on the porosity and permeability values (Ahmed et al. 1998). Gas injection into depleted gas condensate reservoirs not only stabilizes the reservoir pressure but also leads within-reservoir condensates to be evaporated. As a result, the produced gas via recovery cycles will contain heavy hydrocarbons which are necessary to be separated from the produced gas in the processing units so as not to witness gas condensation thus forming a liquid phase in the pipeline (Katz et al. 1983). The composition of the produced gas from a depleted gas condensate reservoir is {{different from that of the}} injected gas, because of the existence of gas condensates within the reservoir in the course of depletion process (Adib et al. 2014; Davarpanah et al. 2017, 2018). In the case where there are some gas condensates in the reservoir due to <b>retrograde</b> <b>condensation</b> phenomenon, the secondary purpose to be followed alongside gas storage process is to produce condensates above via evaporating and then depleting or displacing them (Carriere et al. 1985). Gas storage operation design depends on the reservoir location and performance (Barker and Germer 2010). Those decisions made for the sake of enhanced volume of working gas and deliverability, determining new wells to be drilled and, possibly, specifying some of wells to be abandoned, must be based on an analysis of the circumstances coupled with an accurate simulation of reservoir behavior, so that one can determine the manner in which the operation and corresponding investment should be realized (Masanori et al. 2000). Failure to consider these parameters, there would be a high risk of gas leakage and operation failure. Such a leakage can stem from various reasons such as gas migration, gas trapping in non-accessible regions of the reservoir, and fingering phenomenon of the displacing phase (gas phase) (Mogbo 2011). Furthermore, availability of full history of the field with its initial development details (provided the reservoir under consideration have been originally a gas reservoir) strongly contributes to the successful management of a gas storage operation. Total gas to be addressed in a gas storage reservoir can be divided into two categories. Cushion gas or base gas, which, remaining unchanged within the reservoir, participate in neither injection nor production operations. It only provides the required pressure for the gas to be produced. Cushion gas is either originally in the reservoir or introduced into the reservoir via the first injection phase and will remain in the reservoir until the very end of the reservoir lifetime. Working gas, which is, one or more than one times a year, injected into and withdrawn from the reservoir (Kanaga et al. 2004; Davarpanah and Nassabeh 2017 a, b).|$|E
