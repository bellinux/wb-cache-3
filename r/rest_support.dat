In fact customers comprise with available car seats. By considering this factor this paper mainly concentrated on the human comfort. This research papers helps to understand the current seat problems and its recommended solutions. This paper proposes a neuro fuzzy rule-based approach to generate models relating car seat design variables to affective user satisfaction. Affective user satisfaction such as body contact, sweat and heat generation, shoulder support, head <b>rest</b> <b>support,</b> lumbar support and child safety were modeled for Car seat designs. The main objective is to generate a new car seat model in order to provide maximum human comfort. Maximum human comfort is estimated by an intelligence system called Neuro fuzzy system, where it gives the comfort of seat with respect to its influencing parameters. By adopting this neuro fuzzy logic eliminate the antiquity of modifications, whether they are correct or not and the results gives us an accurate decision to adopt the change or not.

40|$|Flute playing-related {{musculoskeletal}} {{conditions have}} been reported in a number of studies in recent decades (Fain 2010; Fry 1988; Norris 1996; Spence 2001; Thompson 2008). Performing arts medicine experts recommend various approaches to preventing playing-related discomfort or pain, which include improving posture and ergonomic set-up, good general fitness and conditioning, managing stress and anxiety, reassessing technique, ensuring adequate rest breaks, and gradually increasing playing intensity or load (Brandfonbrener 1991; Dawson 2008; Foxman and Burgel 2006; Lederman 2003; Llobet and Odam 2007). Instrument modifications or adaptations are suggested as one way of achieving a better match of the instrument to the physical characteristics of the musician, or a more ergonomically sound set-up (Dawson 2008; Horvath 2009; Llobet and Odam 2007). One possibility for modifying the flute is by using a flute <b>rest,</b> <b>support,</b> platform, or pad. Llobet and Odam (2007, p. 48) state that such a device "prevents the flute rolling and helps the hand maintain the correct position". Dawson (2008, p. 43) suggests thumb supports "distribute the instrument's weight over a larger area of skin and protect both the skin and underlying nerves from excessive pressure". This article will focus on one of these thumb rests, called the Thumbport, designed by Taiwanese-American flutist Ho-Fan Lee. Arts, Education & Law Group, Queensland ConservatoriumFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 63 - 67. Policy {{makers are}} well aware that {{creating}} jobs is an important priority if the health of our economy is to be preserved and improved. However, the first step towards a successful strategy of employment creation is an understanding of the labour market. The aim {{of this paper is to}} add, in a small way, to that understanding. Our focus is on African women, looking at the extent of the influence of education as well as fertility on their participation and employment. The paper begins with a review of labour supply theory, focusing on the basic model of labour force participation. This is followed by a review of South African literature on participation. The aim of this chapter is to show what work has been done in this area and what contribution this paper makes. The following chapter looks at the relationship between education, fertility, and employment. We find that education is negatively related to fertility but positively related to employment. We also find that fertility and employment are negatively related. This is followed by regression analysis. Our conclusion is that education plays a significant role in the participation and employment of African women. In addition, we find that fertility has an insignificant effect on participation of African women in the labour market. This is likely to be a result of the fact that African women are relatively poorer than the <b>rest.</b> <b>Support</b> of this view is shown by the finding of a significant effect of fertility on the participation of White women...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} the Functional Task Test (FTT) study were to {{determine}} the effects of space flight on functional tests that are representative of high priority exploration mission tasks and to identify the key underlying physiological factors that contribute to decrements in performance. Ultimately this information will be used to assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for exploration class missions. We have previously shown that for Shuttle, ISS and bed rest subjects, functional tasks requiring a greater demand for dynamic control of postural equilibrium (i. e. fall recovery, seat egress/obstacle avoidance during walking, object translation, jump down) showed the greatest decrement in performance. Functional tests with reduced requirements for postural stability (i. e. hatch opening, ladder climb, manual manipulation of objects and tool use) showed little reduction in performance. These changes in functional performance were paralleled by similar decrements in sensorimotor tests designed to specifically assess postural equilibrium and dynamic gait control. The bed rest analog allows us to investigate the impact of axial body unloading in isolation on both functional tasks and on the underlying physiological factors that lead to decrements in performance and then compare them with the results obtained in our space flight study. These results indicate that body support unloading experienced during space flight plays a central role in postflight alteration of functional task performance. These data also support the concept that space flight may cause central adaptation of converging body-load somatosensory and vestibular input during gravitational transitions [1]. Therefore, we conclude that providing significant body-support loading during inflight treadmill along with balance training is necessary to mitigate decrements in critical mission tasks that require dynamic postural stability and mobility. Data obtained from space flight and bed <b>rest</b> <b>support</b> the notion that in-flight treadmill exercise, in addition to providing aerobic exercise and mechanical stimuli to the bone, also has a number of sensorimotor benefits by providing: 1) A balance challenge during locomotion requiring segmental coordination in response to a downward force. 2) Body-support loading during performance of a full-body active motor task. 3) Oscillatory stimulation of the otoliths and synchronized periodic foot impacts that facilitate the coordination of gait motions and tune the full-body gaze control system. 4) Appropriate sensory input (foot tactile input, muscle and tendon stretch input) to spinal locomotor central pattern generators required for the control of locomotion. Forward work will focus on a follow-up bed rest study that incorporates aerobic and resistance exercise with a treadmill balance and gait training system that can serve as an integrated interdisciplinary countermeasure system for future exploration class missions...|$|E
