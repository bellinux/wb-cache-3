5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} season with a 3–0 win in the Charity Shield against last season's Premier League runners-up Manchester United. Goals came from Overmars in the first half, Christopher Wreh after 61 minutes and Nicolas Anelka 11 minutes after. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first time that a club from Southern England had won the Shield {{outright}} since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} yields three <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{analysis of}} the motivation by four coded specific expressions; <b>the</b> second <b>result</b> <b>is</b> an analysis of ability by four playing stages; <b>the</b> third <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> observation of learning experience.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> Low <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> bin {{that has}} the {{percentile}} ResPc–Er. <b>The</b> High <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> bin {{that has the}} percentile ResPc[*]+[*]Er where Er <b>is</b> <b>the</b> percentile error set with a value of 25 % by the manual.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s it {{was clear}} that France was unable to match British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington to establish a mint. Feeling that the resolution was inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive law which would govern the new facility. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Mint Act of 1792, which prescribed the specifications of the new US coins, the highest denomination being the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Hayes {{was elected}} {{president}} {{in one of the}} most contentious elections in national history. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J. Tilden but he won an intensely disputed electoral college vote after a Congressional commission awarded him twenty contested electoral votes. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Compromise of 1877, in which the Democrats acquiesced to Hayes's election and Hayes withdrew remaining U.S. troops protecting Republican office holders in the South.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic weaponry and that it was necessary that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, {{following}} the serious attack on Pi Vell ten months before, the government {{set up a}} working group consisting of representatives of the Barcelona provincial administration, the local municipality, and the Institute of Catalan Studies, to manage the maintenance and protection of the two trees. The first <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> repair of the damaged tree in July, and in February 2016 they decided to place video security cameras at the site, watching both trees.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division in the Wau {{area and}} Major General Horace Fuller's US 41st Infantry Division around Morobe {{were ordered to}} advance on Salamaua so as to {{threaten}} it and draw Japanese forces away from Lae. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> arduous Salamaua Campaign, which was fought between June and September, and which at times looked like succeeding all too well, capturing Salamaua and forcing the Japanese back to Lae, thereby throwing Blamey's whole strategy into disarray.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment {{was formed}} at Ringway {{airfield}} near Manchester. Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, {{it was also}} directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport troops into battle. At the same time, the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Limited to design and produce a glider for this purpose. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> General Aircraft Hotspur, an aircraft capable of transporting eight soldiers, that was used for both assault and training purposes.|$|E

5|$|On May 12, Werth stole four bases, {{including}} home plate, tying a Phillies {{record and}} {{leading to a}} 5–3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers; however, the series <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same as the previous one, as the Phillies dropped two games in the set to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Singapore was colonized by the British in the 19th century, {{during which}} society was ruled {{according}} to English law. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> transplantation of the Western idea of representative democracy into Singapore's legal system. This idea has taken root and developed tremendously {{since the end}} of World War II into what it is today.|$|E
5|$|The London Chess Club, {{which had}} fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, {{organised}} a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players (many of whom had competed in Staunton's tournament), and the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same – Anderssen won.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Lipizzan {{can be traced to}} approximately A.D. 800. The earliest predecessors of the Lipizzan originated in the 7th century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed on native Spanish stock. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Andalusian horse and other Iberian horse breeds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery {{into one}} body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to obtain isotopes of nobelium by Swedish (1957) and American (1958) groups, {{but the first}} reliable <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of 256No by the Russian group (Georgy Flyorov et al.) in 1965, as acknowledged by the IUPAC in 1992. In their experiments, Flyorov et al. bombarded uranium-238 with neon-22.|$|E
