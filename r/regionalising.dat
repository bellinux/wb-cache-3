Our results indicate that for most industries, the output change would be negligible but for sugar, butter and several textile industries output contractions would be large. The state employment changes are all between − 0. 5 and 0. 2 percent.

40|$|The Australian Government {{is leading}} efforts to affect {{nationwide}} {{changes in how}} natural resources are managed, specifically the country’s agricultural areas and rangelands. The focus is organising regionally, with community-based groups planning for and managing the delivery {{of millions of dollars}} of resource management works. This paper analyses these arrangements from the ideal of democratic decentralisation, drawing on interviews with key informants in two Australian states (Victoria and Western Australia) and participant observation. Centring the analysis on representation, accountability, fairness and the secure transfer of power indicates that this ideal is far from being achieved. Although unachieved, opportunities for agency by local people exist and continue to develop. Given the strong directing roles of the Australian Government in these <b>regionalising</b> efforts, the paper concludes with comments about their potentially important role in progressing democratic decentralisation...|$|E
30|$|The geomorphologic {{studies are}} helpful in <b>regionalising</b> the hydrologic models. Since {{most of the}} basins are either ungauged or {{sufficient}} data are not available for them, the study on geomorphologic characteristics of such basins becomes much more important. The linking of geomorphologic parameters with the hydrological characteristics of the basin provides {{a simple way to}} understand the hydrological behaviour of different basins. The need for accurate information on watershed runoff and sediment yield has grown rapidly during the past decades because of the acceleration of watershed management programs for conservation, development, and beneficial use of all natural resources, including soil and water (Gajbhiye and Mishra 2012; Mishra et al. 2013; Gajbhiye et al. 2014 a). In this study, morphometric analysis and prioritization of sub-watersheds are carried out for Shakkar River Catchment in Narsinghpur district of Madhya Pradesh, India.|$|E

40|$|Input-output {{models are}} often used in {{regional}} science due to their versatility {{and their ability to}} capture many of the distinguishing features of a regional economy. Input-output tables are available for all EU member countries, but they are hard to find at the regional level, since many regional governments lack the resources or the will to produce reliable, survey-based regional input-output tables. Therefore, in many cases researchers adopt nonsurvey techniques to derive regional input-output tables (RIOT) on their own. The earliest applications of this type relied on the commodity balance (CB) method, and the simple location quotient (SLQ) method. Over time, numerous variations therefore have been introduced. The latest proposals have been the FLQ method (Flegg and Webber, 2000; Flegg et al., 1995) and the CHARM approach (Kronenberg, 2009). This increasing variety of methods has spawned a stream of literature comparing the relative performance of nonsurvey regionalisation methods. The present paper contributes to that literature by examining a largely neglected problem of nonsurvey techniques: the allocation of imports. In the European System of Accounts (ESA) there are two ways of allocating imports: inside the interindustry transactions matrix or outside. In the latter case, imported products are allocated to the sector that uses them (direct allocation). In the former case, they are allocated as imports in the sector that produces similar goods and as a delivery from that sector to the sector which uses them (indirect allocation). The present paper argues that the choice of a nonsurvey method should depend on the way in which imports are allocated. The argument is explained with reference to the theoretical and empirical literature. It is shown that if the nonsurvey method is not properly chosen the results of the procedure may be misleading and implausible. These findings suggest that LQ methods are better suited for <b>regionalising</b> input-output tables with directly allocated imports, whereas commodity-balance methods like CHARM are better suited for <b>regionalising</b> input-output tables with indirectly allocated imports. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{estimates}} of limited oil resources as constituting a constraint {{on the future}} of oil, lack validity. The issue is unimportant for the oil market for 50 years. Similarly, fears for the adequacy of annual additions to reserves are unfounded: the world is running into oil, not out of it. By contrast, the geography of reserves development is important. Twothirds of reserves are in the Middle East, but 85 % of these are irrelevant to global production to 2010, given the potential in OECD and non-OPEC developing countries, and the maintenance of the current oil price. Thus, demand for Middle East oil will remain frustratingly modest. Efforts to expand production, necessarily in cooperation with major oil corporations, will regenerate fears elsewhere for supply security and create prospects for <b>regionalising</b> global oil around the three groupings of OECD countries, to which the non-Middle East OPEC members will adhere. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is concerned with the intentions of pedagogical integration and the notion of an expanded concept of teaching as described in the National School Curriculum of Sweden. In the analysis a theoretical synthesis comprising critical discourse analysis and sociological theories of institutional identities and processes is used through a policy ethnography approach. Purpose has been focus on the relationship between the formal, written curriculum and specific, local, classroom practices. The analysis shows that the Pedagogical dimensions of integration were transformed toward economic interests and control at the local political level. Education work is distinctly <b>regionalising</b> into two so-called safety zones, and a hybrid zone. Four different pedagogical identities are also identified in the analysis. The analysis thus suggests that the creation of safety zones restricts education work to pre-existing patterns. Only the hybrid zone is presently carrying a potential to significantly renew education and encourage and social change...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation of milk quota trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value of quota. Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade of quota is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact of <b>regionalising</b> quota trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies of regionalised quota trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of restricted quota trade, especially in the context of eventual quota removal...|$|E

Are there any links between regionalism and global crises in terms of stimuli, processes, and consequences? This edited volume brings together a range of examples to illustrate the development and importance of regional actors in the global governance of the political economy. <b>Regionalising</b> Global Crises highlights the regional level dynamics that exacerbate or contribute to solving the global economic crisis. It also explores the potential for change in the governance of the global political economy and international financial architecture by assessing the current and past financial crises through regional lenses. In particular, it addresses the debates that have emerged on the roles of regions and regional actors by undertaking empirical investigation {{of the impact of}} the crises on Africa, Europe, BRICS, and East Asia and their reactions to those events. As such it will provide an important empirical and methodological resource for students, researchers and practitioners with an interest in regional actors, comparative regionalism and international political economy...|$|E

40|$|The {{extraction}} {{of information from}} hydrological data has been increased {{by the use of}} multiple objective functions which lead to trade off strategies during model calibration. Uncertainty within input data, model calibration and structure and parameter regionalisation schemes all led to uncertainty within model simulations when used as predictive tools. However, model success and failure is commonly determined not by abstract fit statistics but by the sensitivity of subsequent analyses to the uncertainty in the simulated stream flow data. This paper will explore some of these issues {{in the context of the}} assessment of potential impacts of climate change on river flows using the results from a UK case study on <b>regionalising</b> model parameters for a rainfall runoff model. The paper will comment on the utility of regionalised hydrological models for evaluating the impact of potential climate change scenarios using the specific example of a study from the United Kingdom and will conclude by outlining some current research directions in the regionalisation of rainfall runoff models and climate change impact assessment...|$|E
40|$|Economic Accounting is {{relatively}} well developed in Norway {{especially on the}} national level, {{but also on the}} regional level. Satellite accounting is used for focusing certain features of the economy, a. o. for tourism. A satellite account for tourism has been developed on the national level. Because the tourists'activities are regional activities, and because the impacts of tourism are significant not only on the national, but also on the regional level, a regional satellite account for tourism was developed by us during the past two years. Such satellite accounts on the regional level are, to our knowledge, not developed worldwide. The data can a. o. be used for moderating existing input-output models, so they can become more tailor-made for analysing impacts of tourists' economic activities. We propose a paper that focuses on our work - methods for <b>regionalising</b> satellite accounts for tourism, - indicators applied for this regionalisation, - how regional satellite account figures can be adapted into existing input-output models of the Norwegian economy (on the regional level), and - an example, showing how the regional satellite accounts for tourism can be used for simulating the regional impacts of tourism by the use of input-output techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with two parameterized methods of <b>regionalising</b> input-output coefficients: the Flegg et al. Location Quotient (FLQ) and its augmented version (AFLQ). For applying the two techniques, a parameter δ has to be estimated. In this regard, the paper faces two matters that are still open in the literature: {{the existence of a}} range of δ {{that can be used in}} different regions and the estimation of the most appropriate value of δ. For this aim, a Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out in order to generate 'true' multiregional I-O tables randomly. From the simulation, analyses based on probability distributions and regression were also carried out. Finally, these simulation results have been compared with those of an empirical case. Results confirm that there is actually a range of values of δ within which the best δ is more likely to fall. For the FLQ, this range is centred on 0. 3 with an associated probability of 33 % (if the width of the range is set at 0. 1), whereas, for the AFLQ, the relevant range is between 0. 3 and 0. 4 with a probability by 38 %. Finally, this paper provided a way to estimate the best δ for a given region, without knowing the relevant and detailed economic structure at sectoral level.

40|$|The re-articulation of China {{into the}} global economy since December 1978 has led to a {{tremendous}} influx of foreign capital during the past two decades. Constrained by the limited domestic market and encouraged by home-country government, transnational corporations from Singapore are <b>regionalising</b> increasingly into the Asia Pacific region. To date, a significant amount of Singaporean investments abroad has gone to China. Based on personal interviews with parent companies in Singapore and their subsidiaries and/or affiliates in China, this paper aims to examine the political economy of Singaporean investments in China. Specifically, I argue that successful cross-border operations of Singaporean firms are embedded in dense networks of social and political relationships. These relationships provide the political leverage and strategic resources to enable the establishment of Singaporean firms in China. This estab-lishment, however, is contingent on blending with local politics in China through which foreign firms use leverage on the partnership advantage of local governments (difang zhengfu), their enterprises, and business activities. This rise of local corporatism is a key institutional conse-quence of the recent rescaling of China’s political economy. Case studies of ventures by Singa-porean firms in China are presented to support my arguments. Taken together, these empirical materials shed light on the importance of understanding the role of politics at different spatial scales in influencing transnational corporations and their international business operations. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{complex and}} {{extremely}} important {{topic of the}} administrative division of Romania is again of interest after the firm statements of the new Government (2012) concerning the imminent adoption of the law concerning the regionalisation of the country. If, after the Law 151 from 1948 and the Law 315 from 2004 concerning the regional development in Romania were passed, they were extremely slow {{to be put into}} administrative practice and used to support sustainable development, to attract and use European funds (the fundamental reason of the policy of regional development in the European Union), <b>regionalising</b> Romania nowadays seems to be completely different.

40|$|Segregation is {{studied as}} a multidimensional {{characteristic}} of individual behaviour in social space. It {{is argued that}} in a globalising world, homology among residential, territorial (forms of <b>regionalising</b> daily life) and interactive (forms of developing social networks) segregations cannot be taken for granted. The study shows {{that even in the}} highly segregated case of Arabs resident in Jaffa, the different dimensions of segregation only partially correlate, and they are explained by different mechanisms of exclusion. The results of the study suggest that structural constraints impact on ghettoisation of Arabs in Jaffa, {{but at the same time}} it is shown that Arabs respond differentially to these constraints. Four types of segregation are noted: (i) the majority, who are segregated in all three dimensions (residential, territorial and interactive); (ii) a small minority who succeeded in forming desegregated daily activity spaces and interethnic social networks regardless of their levels of residential segregation; (iii) those who failed to transform their desegregated daily activity spaces into interethnic social networks and (iv) those who succeeded in developing interethnic networks within the residential space of the ghetto. The analysis highlights the double marginalisation of Arab females, who are restricted to poor residential spaces by state and municipal renewal policies and to segregation in everyday life activity spaces by Arab males.
