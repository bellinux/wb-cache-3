40|$|The {{practice}} of cash retention {{has been identified}} to be an opportunity cost to the contractor, equivalent to interest loss on cash retained, which could amount to a huge sum for larger contract. Literature revealed the use of <b>retention</b> <b>bond</b> as the best solution {{to the problems of}} cash retention. Hence, the need to evaluate and compare the cost of ‘cash retention’ and ‘retention bond’ costs to the contractor. This study will assist in improving payment practice in the construction industry and also improves financial stability of the contractor. Data were collected from interim valuations of completed projects and subsequently analyzed using “compounding method” to evaluate the compound interest loss on cash retained by the client and the cost of providing <b>retention</b> <b>bond</b> in-lieu of cash retention. T-test analysis was further used to determine the level of significance of the difference between both costs. The results of both analyses reveal that there is a significant difference between both cost and the utilization of <b>retention</b> <b>bond</b> in-lieu of cash retention will reduce the cost of retention by 65 %. Subsequent to the findings of this research, it is therefore suggested that, clients should adopt <b>retention</b> <b>bond</b> in-place of cash retention as this will reduce the cost of retention to the contractor, while still providing adequate level of security to the clients’ money...|$|E
40|$|Cash {{retention}} is {{a common}} means of protecting an employer from a contractor's insolvency as well as ensuring that contractors finish the work that they start. Similarly, contractors withhold part of payments due to their sub-contractors. Larger contracts tend {{to be subjected to}} smaller rates of retention. By calculating the cost of retention as an amount per year of a contract, it is shown that retention is far more expensive for firms whose work consists of short contracts. The extra cost is multiplied when the final payment is delayed, as it often is for those whose work takes place {{at the beginning of a}} project. This may explain why it is that main contractors are a lot less interested than sub-contractors in alternatives to cash retention, such as <b>retention</b> <b>bond...</b>|$|E

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect selected variables have on the retention of irreversible hydrocolloid impression material in an impression tray. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To simulate custom impression trays, acrylic resin plates were fabricated from autopolymerizing tray resin and visible light-activated composite resin (VLC). A total of 240 plates of each material were fabricated. Half of the plates of each material were polymerized against baseplate wax and the other half against tinfoil. Specimens fabricated against wax were divided into four groups of 30 specimens each and were prepared as follows: Group 1 (control) : plain, left untreated plates, Group 2 : plates were perforated, Group 3 : plates were coated with a tray adhesive, Group 4 : plates were perforated and coated with adhesive. Specimens fabricated against tinfoil were also divided into four similar groups. Impression holders were prepared from autopolymerizing acrylic resin (AAR). Neocolloid (an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material) was mixed, applied to the tray plate, and seated over the impression holder. The test assembly was then placed in an incubator and allowed to set for 5 minutes. Tensile forces were applied to specimens using an Instron testing machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The results were recorded in Kg/mm 2. The mode of failure was recorded as either adhesive or cohesive. Data analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Scheffe post hoc tests (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The tensile bond strength of Neocolloid to AAR specimens fabricated against wax and specimens fabricated against tinfoil increased significantly when both methods of retention (perforation and adhesive) were applied. The same was observed with VLC specimens fabricated against wax and tinfoil. The best tensile bond strength of all specimens tested was obtained with the combination of VLC/tinfoil specimens having both methods of <b>retention.</b> <b>Bond</b> failure occurred at the Neocolloid-adhesive interface in all specimens. CONCLUSION: Tray materials, type of spacers, and retention methods interacted to influence the tensile bond strength of irreversible hydrocolloid. The performance of the VLC resin fabricated against tinfoil spacer was consistently superior to AAR. Applying an adhesive to a perforated acrylic surface produced significantly greater tensile bond strength. All specimen failures occurred adhesively indicating a weak bond between the adhesive and the irreversible hydrocolloid impression material. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this investigation suggested perforating custom trays, routinely applying irreversible hydrocolloid adhesive, and using a custom tray made from VLC resin that was fabricated against a tinfoil spacer is needed to achieve the maximum tensile bond strength during impression making.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} surface {{treatment}} (conditioning) methods on dental ceramics {{is to improve}} the <b>retention</b> and <b>bonding</b> between the enamel or the dentin and ceramic veneer, with the help of resin composite luting cements. These types of surface treatments include chemically altering the surface of ceramics with some specific acidic etchants followed by applying a silane coupling agent (silane). The silane currently used in dentistry is 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, a hybrid organic-inorganic trialkoxy ester monomer, which is diluted in an acidified water-ethanol solvent system. Such silane primers are said to be pre-hydrolyzed. Some oxide ceramics with high crystalline content, such as alumina and zirconia, cannot be easily etched with acid etchants. They should be silica-coated and silanized prior to bonding. A silane coupling agent should be applied after silica-coating to the ceramic surface to achieve chemical bonding and the optimal durable bond strength. © 2011 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of retentive capability of the luting materials namely; adhesive composite resin and glass ionomer cements along the bonded length of fiber re¬inforced posts with radicular dentin. As well as, characterization {{of the type of}} the bond at cement/ dentin interface. Ten single rooted maxil 1 ary anterior teeth free of defects were decapitated. An endodontic me¬chanical preparation was performed followed by post space preparation of 9 mm length. Five root canals were acid etched, adhesive resin was applied to dentin substrate and then the posts were luted with light cured composite resin. The other five root canals were irrigated by 2. 5 % NaOCI and then posts were luted by glass ionomer cements. Each root was cut transversely to obtain three speci¬mens; ccrvical, middle and apical sections of 3 mm thickness each. For SEM study; two roots wcre decapitated, endodontically prepared and then post holes were drilled. One of the root canal of these roots was acid etched and the other one was irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCI. Both roots were sectioned longitudinally and photomicrographed at X 1500. Also, two specimens luted with the two in¬vestigated cements were photomicrographed after dislodgement of the posts by mechanical testing. Generally, both luting materials showed significant difference of the <b>retention</b> <b>bonding</b> strength among their three sections of the roots. The cervical section recorded the highest significant value while the apical section recorded the least significant value. Luting with glass ionomer cement showed higher significant retention strength values in middle and apical sections when compared with the corresponding ones luted with adhesive resin composite cement but comparison of the cer¬vical sections of both groups showed higher insignificant difference. SEM study of acid etched den¬tin surface showed widened dentinal tubules and severe rugosity and an adhesive failure was evident after mechanical testing of posts luted with adhesive composite resin cement suggesting mechanical H 1 terlocking attachment of this cement to radicular dentin.

30|$|The primary {{function}} of the cementation is to establish reliable retention and a durable seal of {{the space between the}} tooth and the restoration, and to provide adequate optical properties especially for tooth-colored ceramic. Depending on the chemical composition of the cementing agent and the type of pretreatment of both the tooth surface and the indirect restoration, adhesion may be obtained by a chemical or micromechanical retention, or both [4].

They were asked about their experience with retainers, opinions regarding {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different types of retainers, responsibility for patients wearing <b>bonded</b> <b>retention</b> and the communication between orthodontists and general dentists. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software. RESULTS: The response rate was 61 per cent. About 55 per cent of the respondents had had experience with bonding fixed retainers and even more were familiar with their follow-up and repair. In case of complications, dentists usually contacted orthodontists according to the following rule: the more severe the complication, the more intense the communication. Most dentists hesitated to remove retainers when requested to do so by the patient and attempted to convince them to continue wearing them. Retainers bonded to all six anterior teeth were considered more efficient than those bonded to canines only; however, possible side effects (e. g. unwanted changes of the torque) were not well known. 66. 4 per cent respondents were willing to take responsibility for patients in retention as early as 6 months after retainer placement. 93. 2 per cent respondents would welcome the establishment of standardized guidelines.

30|$|Although bonding {{to tooth}} tissues {{has long been}} of {{particular}} interest in dentistry, {{the introduction of the}} acid etch method by Buonocore was revolutionary [1].

Although this technique has been widely adopted in all these dental fields, it is not free of complications and adverse consequences. Acid conditioning of dental enamel causes superficial tissue loss that ranges between 20 and 50  μm [7], while a possible removal of the bonded material or the bonded attachment (de-bonding) is associated with additional loss of dental tissue [7], enamel tear-outs [8], or enamel cracks [8].|$|R

40|$|As in any {{commercial}} activity, {{cash flow}} {{is vital for}} the survival of construction businesses. Construction activities take a long time, the products are expensive and the fact that payments are usually made for work already done, makes cash flow and financial status highly dependent on timely payments from the principals. Cash flow constraints of contractors not only result in business failures but also create flow-on effects in the supply chain. In recognition of these effects, most countries including New Zealand have established payment-specific construction industry legislation to ensure a steady flow of cash to project participants. However, payment problems persist within culture and practices, suggesting that industry characteristics may make it difficult to mitigate the problems. It is in this context, that this research investigates payment problems in the New Zealand construction industry with the main focus on exploring feasible solutions to secure payments to construction parties. This research has adopted a sequential mixed-method design consisting of three approaches; preliminary document analyses of liquidators’ reports, and payment disputes heard in the High Court; analysis of a questionnaire survey; and interviews with construction industry practitioners. The data collected through preliminary investigations and an online questionnaire administered to consultants, contractors and subcontractors based in New Zealand was validated and extended using semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs). Data analysis techniques employed include: descriptive, inferential statistics and thematic analysis. The findings of the study confirm that payment problems are still prevalent though not as widespread and significant as was the situation before the introduction of the Construction Contracts Act (CCA). The prevalence of payment problems is mainly due to failure to comply with the requirements of the CCA, lack of knowledge and understanding of the Act, and financial strength of industry players. The study found that other main causes were cash flow difficulties due to delays and non-payments experienced on other projects, disputes over payment claims and responses, inadequate fund sourcing and management, the easy exit of players from the industry with little/no liability to creditors, and the general payment culture of the industry. The research revealed that the cost consequences of construction insolvencies are significant and very often there is no security for payment losses due to insolvencies. The research finds that the most appropriate forms of securities include: escrow/trust accounts, principal payment bonds, direct payments/tripartite agreements and <b>retention</b> <b>bonds.</b> Amongst, the use of escrow accounts seems the most appropriate/feasible protection mechanism for held funds (e. g. retention monies). Subcontractors and lower tier parties in the construction supply chain are more impacted by payment difficulties and very often are unable to secure payment from the upper tiers. The cost of a financial security and constructors not being able to influence the upper tiers are found to be two major practical obstacles for obtaining security for payment in New Zealand. The research therefore recommends among others, adjustments to provisions within the CCA and other regulatory documents, changes to registration and pre-qualification of project owners and participants, changes to project administration processes, and general attitudinal changes within the New Zealand construction industry...|$|R

Interfacial ultrastructural analysis for 2 RMGIs disclosed a shallow hybridization of hydroxyapatite-coated collagen, on which a submicron gel phase was deposited through reaction of the polyalkenoic acid with calcium extracted from the dentin surface. One RMGI, however, bonded to dentin without hybrid layer or gel phase formation. XPS indicated that polycarboxylic acids included in the RMGIs electrostatically interacted with hydroxyapatite.

The test results proved the fact that bonded joints are more than suitable alternative to the mechanical joints. During the tests appeared some differences in stability and failure behaviour between the adhesive systems as well as within the sheeting material. Additionally, the suitability of selected group of adhesives in combination with wooden plastic cladding material as well as with the timber substructure was confirmed. A research case focused on vented wooden façade system with bonded joints is presented in this paper. The potential of bonded joints is studied and described in more detail and verified through experimental measurements. For the purpose of tests spruce timber profiles were chosen for the load bearing substructure and Wooden plastic composite façade sheeting for the cladding. Three types of industrial adhesives intended for structural bonding were selected.

40|$|The use of {{beryllia}} as {{the basis}} of an all-ceramic fuel element for high-temperature reactors cooled by ambient air depends on inhibition of corrosion of beryllium oxide by protecting the surface of the fuel element. Alumina is a promising coating material. The development of corrosion resistant alumina coatings for BeO spheres is described, and results of corrosion, accelerated corrosion and neutron irradiation tests are presented. The limitations of the coating are discussed in detail Porous coatings can fail by 'undermining', but dense coatings are probably satisfactory for at least two years' operation out-of-pile at 1200 ºC and for much longer times at lower temperatures. Satisfactory operation at 1200 ºC for one year has been proved in a long term test. The eventual failure mechanism will probably be associated with the growth of a two layer reaction zone. Neutron irradiation tests indicate that a dose of 1020 nvt and possibly 1. 6 — 2 x 102 º nvt should be acceptable for <b>retention</b> of coating-to-BeO <b>bond</b> during simultaneous exposure above 500 - 700 ºC to fast neutrons and moist air...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} chemically-functionalized block copolymers as adhesion promoters for metal/thermoset resin interfaces. Novel block copolymers were synthesized which contain pendant functional groups reactive toward copper and epoxy resins. In particular, imidazole and triazole functionalities that chelate with copper were incorporated onto one block, while secondary amines were incorporated onto the second block. These copolymers were found to self-assemble from solution onto copper surfaces to form monolayers. The structure of the adsorbed monolayers were studied in detail by neutron reflection and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The monolayer structure was found to vary markedly with the solution conditions and adsorption protocol. Appropriate conditions were found for which the two blocks form separate layers on the surface with the amine functionalized block exposed at the air surface. Adhesion testing of block copolymer-coated copper with epoxy resins was performed in both lap shear and peel modes. Modest enhancements in bond strengths were observed with the block copolymer applied to the native oxide. However, {{it was discovered that}} the native oxide is the weak link, and that by simply removing the native oxide, and then applying an epoxy resin before the native oxide can reform, excellent bond strength in the as-prepared state as well as excellent <b>retention</b> of <b>bond</b> strength after exposure to solder in ambient conditions are obtained. It is recommended that long term aging studies be performed with and without the block copolymer. In addition, the functionalized block copolymer method should be evaluated for another system that has inherently poor bonding, such as the nickel/silicone interface, and for systems involving metals and alloys which form oxides very rapidly, such as aluminum and stainless steel, where bonding strategies involve stabilizing the native oxide...|$|R
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>retention.</b>|$|R
