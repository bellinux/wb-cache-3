Currently using the novel type of strip rolling mill, such as the work <b>roll</b> <b>crossing</b> and shifting is {{the one of the}} main methods to control the strip profile quality in cold rolling. In this paper, 3 -D finite element simulation models of the thin strip profile in cold rolling for the work <b>roll</b> <b>crossing</b> and shifting system were successfully developed. The strip profile and edge drop are discussed considering both crossing angle and shifting value of the work rolls. The research shows that the combination of the work rolls crossing and shifting can effectively improve the strip profile.

40|$|Controlling cold strip {{profile is}} a {{difficult}} and significant problem {{has been found in}} industry during thin strip rolling. At present choosing the new type of strip rolling mill is the one of main methods to control the strip shape quality in cold rolling. The influences of rolling process parameters such as the work roll cross angle and work roll shifting on the strip shape and profile of thin strip are recognised throughout this study. The results show that the <b>roll</b> <b>crossing</b> and shifting is efficient way to control the strip shape. The increase of the work <b>roll</b> <b>crossing</b> angle would lead to improve the strip profile significantly by decreasing the exit strip crown and edge drop. The strip profile would be enhanced if the axial roll shifting was increased. Moreover, the total rolling force was analysed in detail by changing the roll cross angle and axial shifting roll.

In this paper, the factors affecting the low carbon steel thin strip profile of asymmetrical cold rolling have been studied at a speed ratio of 1. 3 without lubricant applied. The effect of rolling parameters on the resulting microstructure was also investigated. It was found that under dry condition, work roll shifting and work <b>roll</b> <b>cross</b> angle can improve the strip profile, and the improvement is more significant with an increase of work <b>roll</b> <b>cross</b> angle rather than that of work roll shifting. A slight change in microstructure was evident with increasing work roll shifting values.

40|$|This work {{presents}} improved {{technology for}} attaining high-quality rolled metal strip. The {{new technology is}} based on an innovative method to model both the static and dynamic characteristics of rolling mill deflection, and it applies equally to both cluster-type and non cluster-type rolling mill configurations. By effectively combining numerical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with analytical solid mechanics, the devised approach delivers a rapid, accurate, flexible, high-fidelity model useful for optimizing many important rolling parameters. The associated static deflection model enables computation of the thickness profile and corresponding flatness of the rolled strip. Accurate methods of predicting the strip thickness profile and strip flatness are important in rolling mill design, rolling schedule set-up, control of mill flatness actuators, and optimization of ground roll profiles. The corresponding dynamic deflection model enables solution of the standard eigenvalue problem to determine natural frequencies and modes of vibration. The presented method for solving the roll-stack deflection problem offers several important advantages over traditional methods. In particular, it includes continuity of elastic foundations, non-iterative solution when using pre-determined elastic foundation moduli, continuous third-order displacement fields, simple stress-field determination, the ability to calculate dynamic characteristics, and a comparatively faster solution time. Consistent with the most advanced existing methods, the presented method accommodates loading conditions that represent roll crowning, roll bending, roll shifting, and <b>roll</b> <b>crossing</b> mechanisms. Validation of the static model is provided by comparing results and solution time with large-scale, commercial finite element simulations. In addition to examples with the common 4 -high vertical stand rolling mill, application of the presented method to the most complex of rolling mill configurations is demonstrated with an optimization example involving the 20 -high Sendzimir mill...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} resonant temporal forcing on an anisotropic system that exhibits a Hopf bifurcation to obliquely traveling waves {{in the absence of}} this forcing. We find that the forcing can excite various phase-locked standing-wave structures: <b>rolls,</b> rectangles and <b>cross</b> <b>rolls.</b> At onset, at most one of the two - rolls or rectangles - is stable. The <b>cross</b> <b>rolls</b> can arise in a secondary bifurcation and can be stable. Experimentally, they would appear as a periodic switching between a structure in which the `zig'-component dominates and one with dominating `zag'-structure. Since there are two symmetry-related states of this kind one may expect disordered structures to arise due to the break-up of the pattern into domains. The results are consistent with recent experiments on electro-convection in nematic liquid crystals by de la Torre and Rehberg. We also apply the general analysis to a model of the behavior near a Lifshitz point, where the angle of obliqueness vanishes. This analysis indicates that phase-locked standing rectangles are always unstable in this parameter regime. Comment: 36 pages (Revtex 3), 12 figures (postscript...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} strain path change during rolling has been {{investigated}} for copper and nickel using X-ray diffraction and electron back scatter diffraction as well as crystal plasticity simulations. Four different strain paths namely: (i) unidirectional rolling; (ii) reverse rolling; (iii) two-step cross rolling and (iv) multi-step cross rolling were employed to decipher the effect of strain path change {{on the evolution of}} deformation texture and microstructure. The <b>cross</b> <b>rolled</b> samples showed weaker texture with a prominent Bs { 1 1 0 } and P(B(ND)) { 1 1 0 } component in contrast to the unidirectional and reverse rolled samples where strong S { 1 2 3 } and Cu { 1 1 2 } components were formed. This was more pronounced for copper samples compared to nickel. The <b>cross</b> <b>rolled</b> samples were characterized by lower anisotropy and Taylor factor as well as less variation in Lankford parameter. Viscoplastic self-consistent simulations indicated that slip activity on higher number of octahedral slip systems can explain the weaker texture as well as reduced anisotropy in the <b>cross</b> <b>rolled</b> samples.

In this paper, thin strip asymmetrical rolling of aluminum at various speed ratios under lubricated condition has been investigated at various combinations of work <b>rolls</b> <b>cross</b> (WRC) angles and work rolls shifting (WRS) values. The effects of strip width, reduction, and rolling speed on strip shape taking WRC and WRS into consideration are discussed. Results show that strip profile improves significantly when the WRC angle is increased from 0 ° to 1 °, with an associated reduction in rolling force. Increasing WRS value from 0 to 8 [*]mm improves the strip profile as well but not as significantly as when WRC angle is increased. No significant improvement was found in strip shape when the strip width was increased. At higher reduction, the strip shape was improved; a decrease in the rolling force was also observed. A higher speed ratio was found to be effective only at a higher WRC angle. The effect of lubrication on the strip profile was significant. Results indicate that an optimum combination of WRC, WRS, reduction, width, and speed ratio under lubricated conditions can ensure an improved exit strip profile, reduce rolling force, and obtain a better quality strip...|$|R
