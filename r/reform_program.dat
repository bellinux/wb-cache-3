5|$|For the sejm of 1606 {{the royal}} faction, hoping to take {{advantage}} of the glorious Battle of Kircholm victory and other successes, submitted a more comprehensive constructive <b>reform</b> <b>program.</b> Instead the sejm had become preoccupied with the dissident postulate of prosecuting instigators of religious disturbances directed against non-Catholics; advised by Skarga, the King refused his assent to the proposed statute.|$|E
5|$|The legislature, at Tillman's recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing Charleston County {{four of its}} twelve seats, {{and other}} lowcountry {{counties}} one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his <b>reform</b> <b>program</b> required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military <b>reform</b> <b>program</b> was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's highly popular {{presidency}} in 1951, Árbenz {{was elected to the}} presidency. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land <b>reform</b> <b>program</b> known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Due to the political climate of the Cold War, the US was already predisposed to see the socialist policies of the democratically elected Arévalo and Árbenz as communist. This conception had been strengthened by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion, and by the 1950s the US government was considering overthrowing Árbenz.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} {{a constructive}} <b>reform</b> <b>program</b> during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness to move toward the implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe's {{commercial}} farming {{sector was}} traditionally {{a source of}} exports and foreign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land <b>reform</b> <b>program</b> badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. For example, between 2000 and 2016 annual wheat production fell from 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons, maize was reduced from two million tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000 to 244,000. Coffee production, once a prized export commodity came to a virtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white-owned coffee farms in 2000, and has never recovered.|$|E

40|$|Thousands {{of schools}} around the country have {{implemented}} whole-school <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> to boost student performance. This paper uses quasi-experimental methods to estimate the impact of whole-school reform on students' reading performance in New York City, where various <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> were adopted in dozens of troubled elementary schools in the mid- 1990 s. This paper complements studies based on random assignment by examining a broad-based reform effort and explicitly accounting for implementation quality. Two popular <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> [...] the School Development and Success for All [...] do not significantly increase reading scores but might have if they had been fully implemented. The More Effective Schools program does boost reading scores, particularly for the poorest students, but only when program "trainers" remain in the school and the students are native English speakers. ...|$|R
5|$|Across the country, {{statues of}} Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after {{prominent}} colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare {{to commemorate the}} struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land <b>reform</b> <b>program,</b> and provided military advisers to aid {{the integration of the}} guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups.

5|$|Initially, in fact, Brezhnev portrayed {{himself as}} a moderate— not as radical as Kosygin but not as {{conservative}} as Shelepin. Brezhnev gave the Central Committee formal permission to initiate Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. According to historian Robert Service, Brezhnev did modify some of Kosygin's reform proposals, {{many of which were}} unhelpful at best. In his early days, Brezhnev asked for advice from provincial party secretaries, and spent hours each day on such conversations. During the March 1965 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev took control of Soviet agriculture, another hint that he opposed Kosygin's <b>reform</b> <b>program.</b> Brezhnev believed, in contrast to Khrushchev, that rather than wholesale re-organization, the key to increasing agricultural output was making the existing system work more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic <b>Reform</b> <b>Program</b> Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

40|$|The first {{portion of}} this paper {{develops}} a simple framework that decomposes home demand for a domestic risky asset into a portfolio diversification incentive, a relative risk incentive, and a relative return incentive. It shows that capital flight {{may be caused by}} factors that increase the relative riskiness of the home asset or by structural distortions (such as financial sector inefficiency), which reduce the relative return of the domestic asset. The second portion of the paper provides empirical estimates of capital flight from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Russia for the 1988 - 93 period. The analysis concludes that the implementation of "shock therapy" <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> has been accompanied by substantial capital flight. This has apparently occurred because such <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> have initially generated increased economic and political uncertainty: prices have jumped toward world levels, property rights have been redistributed, and new institutions have been established. As these <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> have progressed, however, the quantity of capital flight has declined.

25|$|John Casimir's poor {{relations}} with the magnates contributed to his initial alienation from the Commonwealth's nobility and armed forces in 1655 {{at the time of}} the Swedish Deluge. In 1658 the King, supported by the more patriotic faction of the szlachta, postulated a <b>reform</b> <b>program,</b> which included the introduction of majority voting rules in parliamentary assemblies. The proposal was supported by the Senate in 1658 and considered by the Sejm, which in 1659 established a committee for implementing new procedures, but the reforms soon became a victim of disagreements over the vivente rege and royal succession issues. Although during the sejm of 1661 John Casimir predicted and warned of partition of the Commonwealth by Russia, Brandenburg and Austria if unsettled successions cause significant interregnum periods, by that time the <b>reform</b> <b>program</b> had been defeated and the army remained unpaid.|$|E

40|$|In {{search of}} {{sustainable}} systemic success, school <b>reform</b> <b>programs</b> are evolving into a distinctly different form of school reform {{that has been}} described as the “Third Age ” of school reform (Hopkins & Reynolds, 2001). Proponents and com-mentators of the third age (Fullan, Hill & Crévola, 2006; Hill & Crévola, 2001, 2005; Hopkins & Reynolds, 2001) reflect positivist notions of knowledge and learning.
