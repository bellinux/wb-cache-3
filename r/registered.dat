5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans <b>registered</b> in 1965, one-third of whom were <b>registered</b> by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was <b>registered</b> in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), {{and a majority of}} African American residents became <b>registered</b> to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992.

5|$|In 1981, a breed registry, {{called the}} American Welara Pony Registry, {{was created in}} the US in order to develop and promote the breed. A {{studbook}} also began to be published, and pedigrees of Welaras were collected and preserved. Only Welsh and Arabian blood is allowed for purebreds, and all <b>registered</b> ponies must have at least 1/8 and no more than 7/8 blood from each breed. As of 2005, the registry claimed slightly over 1,500 ponies <b>registered</b> in North America, with around 100 new foals <b>registered</b> annually.

5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 <b>register</b> {{signalling}} variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The outgoing <b>register</b> transmits forward MF tones to the incoming <b>register.</b> The incoming <b>register</b> transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing <b>register.</b> The outgoing <b>register</b> detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming <b>register.</b> The incoming <b>register</b> detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing <b>register.</b> The outgoing <b>register</b> transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing <b>register</b> merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming <b>register.</b> (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing <b>register's</b> first push signal to the incoming <b>register</b> is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming <b>register's</b> pull signals, which request information from the outgoing <b>register,</b> are client-server, where the client is the incoming <b>register</b> and the server is the outgoing <b>register.)</b> ...|$|R
