25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E
500|$|Based on such safety concerns, US {{federal judge}} Richard Posner, Future of Humanity Institute {{research}} associate Toby Ord {{and others have}} argued that the LHC experiments are too risky to undertake. In the book , English cosmologist and astrophysicist Martin Rees calculated an upper limit of 1 in 50 million for the probability that the Large Hadron Collider will produce a global catastrophe or black hole. However, Rees has also reported not to be [...] "losing sleep over the collider," [...] and trusts the scientists who have built it. He has stated: [...] "My book has been misquoted in one or two places. I would <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the up-to-date safety study." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Smith {{claimed that}} Facsimile No. 1 portrays Abraham {{fastened}} to an altar, with the idolatrous priest of Elkenah attempting to sacrifice him. [...] The Book of Abraham makes explicit reference to this facsimile, noting: [...] "That {{you may have}} a knowledge of this altar, I will <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the representation at the commencement of this record." [...] Egyptologists, however, claim that it is a vignette taken from a version of The Book of Breathings, also known as the [...] "Breathing Permit", copied for a Theban priest named Hôr. A comparison of Smith’s interpretation of the facsimile, and that of Egyptologists is as follows: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} why I have <b>referred</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> what I felt (and confessed to feeling) when we were {{together}} at Craig Fernie.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Arkell v. Pressdram (1971), the {{plaintiff}} {{was the subject of}} an article. Arkell's lawyers wrote a letter which concluded: [...] "His attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of your reply." [...] Private Eye responded: [...] "We acknowledge your letter of 29th April referring to Mr J. Arkell. We note that Mr Arkell's attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of our reply and would therefore be grateful if you would inform us what his attitude to damages would be, were he to learn that the nature of our reply is as follows: fuck off." [...] In the years following, the magazine would refer to this exchange as a euphemism for a blunt and coarse dismissal, for example: [...] "We <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the reply given in {{the case of}} Arkell v. Pressdram". As with [...] "tired and emotional" [...] this usage has spread beyond the magazine.|$|E

"I would <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> my father," [...] said Alice, {{blushing}} {{and casting}} her eyes down; but instantly raising them again, she repeated, in a firmer and a sadder tone, [...] "Yes, Julian, I would <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> my father; {{and you would}} find that your pilot, Hope, had deceived you; and that you had but escaped the quicksands to fall upon the rocks." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "read {{that account}} of a case, which has--as I believe--a direct bearing on your own position, and on the {{experiment}} which I am tempting <b>you</b> <b>to</b> try. Observe, Mr. Blake, before you begin, that I am now <b>referring</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the greatest}} of English physiologists. The book in your hand is Doctor Elliotson's HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY; and the case which the doctor cites rests on the well-known authority of Mr. Combe." ...|$|R
60|$|My Lords, I next {{stated that}} this recriminatory charge {{consisted}} of two distinct parts,--injustice and delay. To the injustice we are to answer by the nature and proof of the charges which we have brought before you; and to the delay, my Lords, we have answered in another place. Into one {{of the consequences of}} the delay, the ruinous expense which the prisoner complains of, we have desired your Lordships to make an inquiry, and have <b>referred</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> facts and witnesses which will remove this part of the charge.|$|R

60|$|Some gentleman asks me what Ford's History {{says about}} him. My own {{recollection}} is that Ford speaks of Trumbull in very disrespectful terms in several portions of his book, {{and that he}} talks a great deal worse of Judge Douglas.

30|$|Imagine that {{somebody}} asks you the following question: “How successful has your occupational career been so far?” Would it {{be easy for}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> answer this question or would you need considerable {{time to think about}} it? Which criteria would you apply? Would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> your bank-account, would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> your reputation among colleagues, would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> an ongoing project? Would you give a simple successful vs. unsuccessful answer or would you differentiate between several criteria? Which standard(s) of comparison would you use? Irrespective of how these questions will be answered people are no doubt concerned about their career success, they want to be successful and they want to feel successful. The meaning of career success is, however, not easy to grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "'...I {{really have}} no {{patience}} with such absurdities as you have written to me. You say I am driving you on {{to do what is}} beyond a woman's courage. Am I? I might <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> any collection of Trials, English or foreign, to show that you were utterly wrong. But such collections may be beyond your reach; and I will only <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a case in yesterday's newspaper. The circumstances are totally different from our circumstances; but the example of resolution in a woman is an example worth your notice.|$|E

60|$|On one side, your Lordships {{have the}} {{prisoner}} {{declaring that the}} people have no laws, no rights, no usages, no distinctions of rank, no sense of honor, no property,--in short, that they are nothing but a herd of slaves, to be governed by the arbitrary will of a master. On the other side, we assert that the direct contrary of this is true. And to prove our assertion we have <b>referred</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Institutes of Genghis Khân and of Tamerlane; we have <b>referred</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Mahometan law, which is binding upon all, from the crowned head to the meanest subject,--a law interwoven with a system of the wisest, the most learned, and most enlightened jurisprudence that perhaps ever existed in the world. We have shown you, that, if these parties are to be compared together, {{it is not the}} rights of the people which are nothing, but rather the rights of the sovereign which are so. The rights of the people are everything, as they ought to be, in the true and natural order of things. God forbid that these maxims should trench upon sovereignty, and its true, just, and lawful prerogative!--on the contrary, they ought to support and establish them. The sovereign's rights are undoubtedly sacred rights, and ought to be so held in every country in the world, because exercised {{for the benefit of the}} people, and in subordination to that great end for which alone God has vested power in any man or any set of men. This is the law that we insist upon, and these are the principles upon which your Lordships are to try the prisoner at your bar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> Miss Clibborn's {{engagement}} to Captain Parsons?" [...] he asked, with a gloomy face. [...] "Bad news travels fast." ...|$|R

60|$|With {{respect to}} the repairs of the Anicut and banks of the Cavery we have upon various {{occasions}} fully expressed <b>to</b> <b>you</b> our sentiments, and in particular in our general letter of the 4th July, 1777, we <b>referred</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the investigation and correspondence on that subject of the year 1764, and to the report made by Mr. James Bourchier, on his personal survey of the waters, and to several letters of the year 1765 and 1767; we also, by our said general letter, acquainted you that it appeared to us perfectly reasonable that the Rajah {{should be permitted to}} repair those banks, and the Anicut, {{in the same manner as}} had been practised in times past; and we directed <b>you</b> <b>to</b> establish such regulations, by reference to former usage, for keeping the said banks in repair, as would be effectual, and remove all cause of complaint in future.|$|R
