The project received a US patent (No. 7,235,988) on 26 June 2007. He has published more than 100 papers in leading photonics, applied physics and multidisciplinary journals in the US and Europe. His efforts resulted in {{the development}} of novel and cost-effective / non-invasive method techniques in optical signal recovery, retrieval and identifying microscopic defects in integrated circuits (IC) enabling the accurate identification of circuit defects by producing a high-contrast image map that distinguishes semiconductor, metal and dielectric sites from each other. The pioneering work of his team {{on the use of the}} hydrogen <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter</b> as a light source for two-color two-photon excitation microscopy was also awarded a US patent (No. 8,227,256 B2) on 24 July 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, a {{paper was}} {{published}} by two researchers of the Scientific Laboratory at the Ford Motor Company, P. D. Maker and R. W. Terhune, in which the CARS phenomenon was reported for the first time. [...] Maker and Terhune used a pulsed ruby laser to investigate the third order response of several materials. They first passed the ruby beam of frequency ω through a <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter</b> to create a second beam at ω-ωv, and then directed the two beams simultaneously onto the sample. When the pulses from both beams overlapped in space and time, the Ford researchers observed a signal at ω+ωv, which is the blue-shifted CARS signal. They also demonstrated that the signal increases significantly when the difference frequency ωv between the incident beams matches a Raman frequency of the sample. Maker and Terhune called their technique simply 'three wave mixing experiments'. The name coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy was assigned almost ten years later, by Begley et al. at Stanford University in 1974. Since then, this vibrationally sensitive nonlinear optical technique has been commonly known as CARS.|$|E

For both pump wavelengths, more laser {{lines are}} generated using the <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter</b> with CWG {{compared to a}} conventional <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter.</b> Both 355 and 532 nm pumps showed a 60 % decrease in threshold power for the generated first Stokes (S 1) Laser line.

40|$|As {{shown in}} the early 1960 s, the gain in stimulated Raman {{scattering}} (SRS) is drastically suppressed when the rate of creation of phonons (via pump-to-Stokes conversion) is exactly balanced by the rate of phonon annihilation (via pump-to-anti-Stokes conversion). This occurs when the phonon coherence waves synchronized vibrations of a large population of molecules have identical propagation constants for both processes, i. e., they are phase-velocity matched. As recently demonstrated, hydrogen-filled photonic crystal fiber pumped {{in the vicinity of}} its zero dispersion wavelength provides an ideal system for observing this effect. Here we report that Raman gain suppression is actually a universal feature of SRS in gas-filled hollow-core fibers, and that it can strongly impair SRS even when the dephasing rate is high, particularly at high pump powers when it is normally assumed that nonlinear processes become more (not less) efficient. This counterintuitive result means that intermodal stimulated Raman scattering (for example between LP 01 and LP 11 core modes) begins to dominate at high power levels. The results reported have important implications for fiber-based <b>Raman</b> <b>shifters,</b> amplifiers or frequency combs, especially for operation in the ultraviolet, where the Raman gain is much higher.

The two-photon absorption coefficient was determined in the 370 - 600 -nm wavelength range, with the highest value found to be ~ 1. 9 cm/GW at 370 nm. Nonlinear losses are crucial in determining the conversion efficiency of the stimulated Raman scattering process when it is excited with ultrashort laser pulses with photon energy exceeding half of the bandgap. In addition, the results were analyzed within the context of a simple two-parabolic-band theoretical model to yield an effective bandgap energy value for the crystal...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of a fast technique for analysis of typical anthropogenic contaminants in soil, e. g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and mineral oils resp. heavy metals. The detection was based on laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) and laser-induced Breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). We could demonstrate that stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is a suitable method for simultaneous generation of multiple excitation lines for multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. The characterization of the <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter</b> revealed that a mixture of methane and hydrogen permits the generation of SRS with high pulse energies between 250 and 400 nm, which is the wavelength range relevant for detection of PAH and mineral oils. The combination of the <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter</b> with an intensified CCD-camera and a fiber-optical interface allowed the design of a new fiber-optic sensor array. The realized fiber-optical sensor was ruggedized and simple in design. Measurements with spiked soils gave excellent detection limits in the ppm-range for PAH and mineral oils. Time-resolved excitation-emission fluorescence spectra allowed a significant gain in the available analytical information, especially for complex matrices such as humic substances and mineral oils in soil.

40|$|An ozone {{lidar system}} was {{installed}} at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) in Tsukuba, Japan in March 1988 and has been measuring vertical profiles of ozone (15 - 45 km) since September 1988. The lidar system consists of a XeCl (308 nm) excimer laser, its deuterium <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter</b> (339 nm), a XeF excimer laser (351 nm), a 2 m telescope, a receiving system and a data processing system. The precision of the derived ozone concentration is about 10 percent of an altitude of 40 km for a 4 hr observation. Temperature profiles (30 - 80 km) are also obtained from the Rayleigh scattering signals at 351 nm. Approximate 50 ozone measurements are carried out {{in a year and}} variations of vertical profiles of ozone such as seasonal variations and shorter-term variations are observed.

40|$|Since the XeCl {{excimer laser}} (308 nm) {{was first used}} in Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) for stratospheric ozone detection, the XeCl ozone lidar became {{a useful tool for}} the {{monitoring}} of the stratospheric ozone concentration. Shorter wavelength lasers are needed for the observation of ozone in the troposphere where the ozone concentration is about one order of magnitude smaller than in the stratosphere. In 1983, tropospheric ozone was observed with the combination of the second Stokes line (290. 4 nm) of stimulated Raman scattering from methane pumped by a KrF laser and the XeCl laser line. The measurement of the ozone distribution from ground to 30 km was reported, using three Stokes lines of Raman lasers pumped by a KrF laser. At wavelengths shorter than 295 nm, the background solar radiation is effectively suppressed by atmospheric ozone. Such a solar-blind effect can be expected when two wavelengths 277 and 290. 4 nm are used for DIAL ozone detection. A preliminary measurement of the day time ozone distribution in the troposphere is presented using these wavelengths generated by a KrF laser with a <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter.</b> Analysis using the lidar equation predicts the maximum detectable range is 7 km...|$|E

The XRD measurement was performed at a scan rate of 18 °min− 1 and step size of 0.02 °. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out by a JEOL JEM- 7500 F Field Emission SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were recorded on an FEI Tenai F- 20 microscopy with a field emission gun operating at 200  kV.

40|$|A blue {{shift in}} the CH {{stretching}} vibration of formic acid cyclic dimer of 6. 6 ern" (symmetric) and 3 ern" (antisymmetric) is observed by high resolution Raman (symmetric) and infrared (antisymmetric) spectroscopy. This is corroborated by theoretical ab initio calculations where blue shifts in the CH stretching vibration of 12. 79 ern" (symmetric) and 10. 26 ern" (antisymmetric) are calculated (CP corrected MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory). This is unusual due to the CH bond not playing a direct part in the bonding of the dimer. The electric dipole moment derivative curve with respect to bond length of the CH bond in formic acid {{is found to be}} unusual. The equilibrium bond length is on the negative gradient side of the maximum of the dipole, and this has been used to explain interesting behaviour observed, including the blue shift of the CH stretching vibration and how the contribution of electrostatics to the interaction energy can cause a blue shift of the stretching vibration in the spectrum. A mechanism is proposed where the electron density is transferred from the CH bond, through to the OH site where bonding does take place. This in turn causes the CH bond to have increased polarity, and therefore the bond contracts due to this interaction. Several chloroform complexes are investigated, which show either blue shifting or red shifting of the CH stretching vibration. Complexation with dimethyl ether shows an experimental red shift of the CH stretching vibration of chloroform of - 1. 5 ern", and a theoretical shift of - 2. 11 crn'. The complex of chloroform with trimethyl amine shows an experimental red shift of the CH stretching vibration of chloroform of - 54 ern", and a theoretical prediction of - 79. 51 ern". Both of these complexes show a 1 : 1 stoichiometric equation. The chloroform self dimer shows blue shifts in the CH stretching vibration, calculated to be 2. 1 and 8. 8 ern", experimental results are currently inconclusive. Morokuma Kitaura energy decomposition has been used to understand the energy contributions to intermolecular bonding. Electrostatic interaction and exchange repulsion {{have been shown to be}} the main contributions to bonding, but some unusual cases, for example the CH bond of formic acid cyclic dimer, have shown electrostatics to cause a blue shift. - 3 - A tuneable stimulated Raman photoacoustic spectroscopy (PARS) set up has been further applied to the trace detection of H 2 ' and has achieved a detection limit of 6. 69 ppm by volume.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{inversion}} algorithm for the retrieval of {{particle size distribution}} parameters, i. e., mean (effective) radius, number, surface area, and volume concentration, and complex refractive index from multiwavelength lidar data. In contrast to the classical Tikhonov method, which accepts only that solution for which the discrepancy reaches its global minimum. in our algorithm we perform the averaging of solutions {{in the vicinity of}} this minimum, This averaging stabilizes the underlying ill-posed inverse problem, particularly with respect to the retrieval of number concentration. Results show that, for typical tropospheric particles and 10 % error in the optical data, the mean radius could be retrieved to better than 20 % from a lidar {{on the basis of a}} Nd:YAG laser, which provides a combination of backscatter coefficients at 355, 532, and 1064 nm and extinction coefficients at 355 and 532 nm. The accuracy is improved if the lidar is also equipped with a hydrogen <b>Raman</b> <b>shifter.</b> In this case two additional backscatter coefficients at 416 and 683 nm are available. The combination of two extinction coefficients and five backscatter coefficients then allows one to retrieve not only averaged aerosol parameters but also the size distribution function.

CARS spectra of hydrogen clusters with different ratios of ortho- and para- hydrogen are analyzed in terms of band intensities and frequencies. The CARS experimental setup and helium droplet apparatus are thoroughly described.; Small water clusters of 2 to 30 molecules per cluster as well as water monomers were studied in helium droplets. Rotational constants and rotational and vibrational relaxation times of single water molecules in helium droplets were deduced from the analysis of their depletion spectra. The method of studying the infrared intensities of molecules and molecular clusters was developed by using the helium droplet encapsulation technique. The method was applied to study the non-additive enhancement of the infrared intensity in water clusters of 2, 3 and 4 molecules.

40|$|UnrestrictedInteractions of 13 CO 2 guest {{molecules}} with vapor-deposited porous H 2 O ices {{have been}} examined using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. Specifically, the trapping and release of 13 CO 2 by amorphous solid water (ASW) has been studied.; Samples were prepared by: (i) depositing 13 CO 2 on top of ASW; depositing 13 CO 2 underneath ASW; and (iii) co-depositing 13 CO 2 and H 2 O during ASW formation. The use of 13 CO 2 eliminates problems with background 12 CO 2. Some of the deposited 13 CO 2 becomes trapped when the ice film is annealed. The amount of 13 CO 2 trapped in the film depends on the deposition method (i. e., {{on top of the}} ASW, underneath the ASW, and co-deposition).; The release of trapped molecules occurs in two stages. The majority of the trapped 13 CO 2 escapes during the ASW-to-cubic ice phase transition at 165 K and the rest desorbs together with the cubic ice film at 185 K. We speculate that the presence of 13 CO 2 at temperatures up to at 185 K is due to 13 CO 2 that is trapped in cavities within the ASW film. These cavities are similar to ones that trap the 13 CO 2 that is released during crystallization. The difference is that 13 CO 2 that remains at temperatures up to 185 K does not access escape pathways to the surface during crystallization.; The UHV system was modified to incorporate a novel laser induced desorption (LID) technique in addition to TPD and FTIR.

The jet-cooled spectrum of HF dimer (in the 1. 3 microm overtone region) is also presented in this thesis to demonstrate that the CRDS technique is reliable and sensitive enough to detect weakly bound species. Finally, a novel method in probing transient species in 'cool flames' is presented here and has been used to successfully measure the 41 0 band and the 401 hot band of formaldehyde using CRDS with a vertical tube reactor (VTR) for the first time.
