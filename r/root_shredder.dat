60|$|As he {{stretched}} himself he laid back his head, shut his eyes, and yawned, by which act he displayed a tremendous collection of canines and grinders, {{with a pink}} throat of great capacity. The yawn ended in a gasp, and then {{he raised his head}} and looked quietly about him, gently patting the ground with his tail, as a man might pat his bedclothes while considering what to do next. Not unlike man, he lay down at full length and tried to go to sleep again, but it would not do. He had evidently had his full allowance, and therefore got up and stretched himself again in a standing position. In this act, bending his deep chest to the ground, he uttered a low gurr of savage satisfaction, sank his claws into the soil, and gently tore a number of tough <b>roots</b> into <b>shreds.</b> Sundry little creatures of various kinds in the neighbourhood, hearing the gurr, presented their tails to the sky and dived into their little holes with incredible rapidity.|$|R
5000|$|The taproot {{of young}} burdock plants can be {{harvested}} and eaten as a root vegetable. While generally out of favour in modern European cuisine, it remains popular in Asia. Arctium lappa {{is known as}} [...] "niúbàng" [...] (...) in Chinese, which was borrowed into Japanese as gobō, and is still eaten in both countries. In Korea burdock root is called [...] "u-eong" [...] (우엉) and sold as [...] "tong u-eong" [...] (통우엉), or [...] "whole burdock". Plants are cultivated for their slender roots, which can grow about one metre long and two centimetres across. Burdock root is very crisp and has a sweet, mild, and pungent flavour with a little muddy harshness that can be reduced by soaking julienned or <b>shredded</b> <b>roots</b> in water for five to ten minutes.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of antioxidants in the cold storage of fresh cut radishes. The <b>shredded</b> <b>roots</b> were submerged in the respective treatments during 3 min (ascorbic acid or citric acid) and stored at 5 ºC and 90 % RH during 10 days. The radish treated with ascorbic acid showed the higher respiratory rate in the first 4 h after the processing during the storage. The content of total soluble solids (TSS) was significantly higher in the treatment with citric acid. There was an increase in the content of ascorbic acid after two day of storage in the treatments with this antioxidant. The values of lightness (L*) were decreasing along the storage. Citric acid treatments caused strongly red coloration in the minimally processed roots. None of the treatments avoided the browning of the shredded radishes during the cold storage...|$|R
2500|$|The main meal {{might be}} eaten about 2p.m. or later. It {{is larger than}} the North American lunch. It might be {{composed}} of three courses especially among the traditionalists, starting with a soup like a popular rosół and tomato soup or more festive barszcz (beet borscht) or żurek (sour rye meal mash), followed perhaps in a restaurant by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken. Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as surówka [...] – <b>shredded</b> <b>root</b> vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (...)

40|$|Beet roots cv. Early Wonder were graded for firmness, {{color and}} size, and were peeled inside a cold room (10 ºC). <b>Roots</b> were then <b>shredded</b> (2 mm thick), {{sanitized}} for 6 minutes (NaClO/ 200 mg L- 1), rinsed and centrifuged.

The material was centrifuged again, placed in trays, wrapped with PVC plastic film, and stored at 5 ºC and 85 - 90 % HR for 10 days. Every two days, treatments were analyzed for respiratory activity and betacyanin and betaxanthin contents. The application of citric acid caused the reduction of respiratory rate in the fresh-cut tissue. In {{the second day of}} storage, control showed the highest respiratory activity among treatments, reaching around 77 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1. Citric acid solution dips in a concentration higher than 500 mg L- 1 contributed to a decrease in respiratory activity and no peak in CO 2 evolution was observed. There were significant differences among all treatments during the storage period for the contents of betacyanin, which were around 40; 45; 48; 51 and 55 mg 100 g- 1 for the fresh-cut material treated with 0; 500; 1, 000; 1, 500 and 2, 000 mg L- 1 of citric acid, respectively. Also, levels of betaxanthin were around 25; 29; 33; 35 and 39 mg 100 g- 1 for the material treated with 0; 500; 1, 000; 1, 500 and 2, 000 mg L- 1 of citric acid, respectively.

O presente experimento objetivou testar o uso de antioxidantes na conservação de rabanetes minimamente processados. Os rabanetes minimamente processados foram submersos nos tratamentos por 3 minutos (ácido ascórbico ou ácido cítrico) e armazenados a 5 ºC (± 1 ºC) e 90 % (± 5 %) UR durante 10 dias. O tratamento com ácido ascórbico gerou a maior taxa respiratória nas 4 primeiras horas após o processamento e durante o armazenamento. O teor de sólidos solúveis totais (SST) foi significativamente maior no tratamento com ácido cítrico. Quanto ao teor de ácido ascórbico, para os tratamentos com ácido ascórbico houve um aumento significativo no 2 º dia. Os valores de luminosidade (L*) apresentaram redução durante o armazenamento. Os tratamentos com ácido cítrico provocaram uma forte coloração vermelha nas raízes minimamente processadas.

Beterrabas 'Early Wonder' foram selecionadas quanto à firmeza, cor e tamanho e descascadas em câmara fria (10 ºC). As raízes foram cortadas (2 mm de espessura), sanitizadas, enxaguadas e centrifugadas. As beterrabas foram tratadas com ácido cítrico nas concentrações: 0 (controle), 500; 1000; 1500 e 2000 mg L- 1. O produto foi novamente centrifugado, colocado em bandejas envoltas com filme de PVC e armazenado a 5 ºC e 85 - 90 % de umidade relativa durante 10 dias. A cada dois dias, foram avaliados a atividade respiratória e os teores de betacianina e betaxantina nos tratamentos. A aplicação de ácido cítrico nas diferentes concentrações reduziu a taxa respiratória nos tecidos minimamente processados. No segundo dia de armazenamento, o tratamento controle apresentou a maior atividade respiratória alcançando valores próximos a 77 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1. A aplicação de ácido cítrico igual ou maior a 500 mg L- 1 contribuiu para o decréscimo da atividade respiratória e o pico na evolução de CO 2 não foi observado. Foi verificada diferença significativa entre os tratamentos durante todo o armazenamento para os teores de betacianina, tendo sido observados valores ao redor de 40; 45; 48; 52 e 55 mg 100 g- 1 para os produtos tratados com 0; 500; 1. 000; 1. 500 e 2. 000 mg L- 1, respectivamente. Os níveis de betaxantina para beterrabas minimamente processadas foram ao redor de 25; 29; 33; 35 e 39 mg 100 g- 1 para os tratamentos de 0; 500; 1. 000; 1. 500 e 2. 000 mg L- 1, respectivamente. A aplicação de ácido cítrico é sugerida durante o processamento mínimo como forma de reduzir a taxa respiratória e a degradação de pigmentos, contribuindo assim para o aumento da vida de prateleira de produtos minimamente processados...|$|R
