50|$|Despite {{being named}} NFL MVP, Paul Hornung was briefly {{lost to the}} military. In {{response}} {{to the construction of}} the Berlin Wall, the United States Department of Defense activated thousands of reservists. Two dozen football players were activated, including Paul Hornung, Boyd Dowler and Ray Nitschke. On November 14, Hornung was to report to Fort Riley in Kansas. Wisconsin residents were so upset that Republican senator Alexander Wiley and Democratic congressman Clement Zablocki <b>requested</b> <b>deferments</b> <b>for</b> the players. On October 18, the final word was that the players had to serve. Hornung missed the November 19 game against the Los Angeles Rams. He was flown from Fort Riley to Detroit for the November 23 Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions. Hornung would score a field goal and two extra points in the 17-9 victory.|$|R

500|$|Bush's {{method of}} {{management}} at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret {{the mandate of the}} OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: [...] "Will it help to win a war; this war?" [...] Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD <b>requested</b> <b>deferments</b> <b>for</b> some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, The New York Times described Bush as [...] "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1940, Congress {{passed the}} first peace-time draft legislation. It was renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It {{involved}} {{questions as to}} who should control the draft, {{the size of the}} army, and the need <b>for</b> <b>deferments.</b> The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them. There was very little draft resistance.|$|R
50|$|Student loan {{deferment}} is {{an agreement}} between the student and lender that the student may postpone repayment of a student loan for a designated period. The student agrees to pay more money for the loan so the loan {{will not be in}} default.

Tolokonnikova subsequently filed an appeal with the Zubovo-Polyansky District Court in Mordovia, where she was imprisoned, and Alyokhina with the Berezniki District Court in Perm. Alyokhina's appeal was rejected on January 16, 2013, the judge stating that the presence of her child was already taken into account during her original sentence.|$|R
50|$|Conscription of {{men into}} the Armed Forces {{continued}} ad hoc from 1945 until the National Service Act 1948 established a system from 1 January 1949 of calling up men in Britain reaching {{the age of}} 18 for eighteen months full-time service followed by four years reserve service. In 1950, {{as a result of}} the Korean War, full-time service was increased to two years, and reserve service reduced to three and a half years. In 1957, phasing-out of the system was announced, the last men being called up in 1960, and the last conscript being discharged in May 1963, after allowance <b>for</b> <b>deferment</b> of service.|$|R
40|$|Clearcutting upland {{hardwood}} stands is {{a common}} management prescription in the South which maximizes harvest efficiency. However, with increasing concerns about esthetics and ecological impacts, {{a better understanding of}} alternative treatments is needed. This study compared conventional block clearcutting, strip clearcutting, and deferment cutting in replicated treatments in northem Alabama. Treatment did not {{have a significant effect on}} felling productivity or costs, but did affect skiddiig productivity. The primary factor affecting harvesting productivity was average tree size of nmovals. Clearcutting caused significantly greater increases in soil bulk density than deferment or strip cutting. However, clearcut soil disturbance was the same as <b>for</b> <b>deferment</b> cutting...|$|R

Draft counselors, and the Selective Service System itself, emphasized {{that there was no}} such thing as an [...] "exemption" [...] from the draft, only a [...] "deferment". Even the coveted status of 4-F (which by the late 1960s had lost its shameful connotation) was technically a deferment, implying that even 4-Fs might have to serve if America were invaded, as a home guard.|$|R
