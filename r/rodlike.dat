5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear <b>rodlike</b> projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine.

The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short <b>rodlike</b> protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm.

5|$|The spores are , amyloid (meaning {{they turn}} bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7–9 by 4–5μm.

50|$|The {{resulting}} solid macrostructure from a eutectic reaction {{depends on}} a few factors. The most important factor is how the two solid solutions nucleate and grow. The most common structure is a lamellar structure, but other possible structures include <b>rodlike,</b> globular, and acicular.|$|E
5000|$|The haegeum (...) is a {{traditional}} Korean string instrument, resembling a fiddle. It is popularly known as kkangkkangi. It has a <b>rodlike</b> neck, a hollow wooden soundbox, and two silk strings, and is held vertically on the knee of the performer and played with a bow.|$|E
50|$|Rhabditophorans are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} lamellated rhabdites, <b>rodlike</b> granules secreted in the cells of the epidermis and consisted of concentric lamellae. They are absent in the clade Neodermata, most likely due to a secondary loss of this feature because their epidermis is turned into a syncytium in adult forms.|$|E

50|$|Both sexes {{of adults}} have a cephalic {{inflation}} and an oral opening lined with {{both internal and}} external leaf crowns. Female adults, which have a length range of 6.5-24 mm, are generally larger than their male counterparts, with a length range of 6-16.6 mm. Males can be distinguished by their bell-like copulatory bursa, located in the tail, and their paired <b>rodlike</b> spicules.|$|E
50|$|Rhabdites (from Greek, rhabdos, rod) are <b>rodlike</b> {{structures}} in {{the cells of the}} epidermis or underlying parenchyma in certain turbellarians, and in the epidermis of nemerteans. They are discharged in mucous secretions. They are a defensive mechanism, which dissolve in water, and they are distasteful to most animals who would prey on rhabditid worms. In nemerteans, rhabdites form mucus on which the animals glide.|$|E
50|$|This genus {{belongs to}} the {{subfamily}} Ennominae. Therein, its relationships are not quite clear, but they may indeed belong into the tribe Nacophorini.

50|$|Symplectites may {{be formed}} by {{reaction}} between adjacent phases or to decomposition {{of a single}} phase. The intergrown phases may be planar or <b>rodlike,</b> depending on the volume proportions of the phases, their interfacial free energies, the rate of reaction, the Gibbs free energy change, {{and the degree of}} recrystallization. Lamellar symplectites are common in retrogressed eclogite. Kelyphite is a symplectite formed from the decomposition of garnet. Myrmekite is a globular or bulbous symplectite of quartz in plagioclase.|$|E

50|$|Aorun is {{different}} from other theropods discovered from the same region, such as Guanlong, Haplocheirus, Limusaurus, Monolophosaurus, Sinraptor and Zuolong. It {{is different}} from Guanlong in lacking a medial crest on the premaxilla, nasals and frontal bones. It also lacks high external nostrils, and a short anterior maxillary process. It has a shorter premaxillary body, but with a larger maxillary fenestra, a <b>rodlike</b> jugal, closely spaced fine serrations on the distal tooth carinae of the maxilla and dentary. The cervical vertebral centra are elongated with two pneumatic foramina, the neural spines are short and elongated towards the posterior in the dorsal vertebrae, and the pubic shaft is curved at the end. The limb bones are also substantially different.|$|E
50|$|Shifts in PT {{absorption}} bands due {{to changes in}} temperature result from a conformational transition from a coplanar, <b>rodlike</b> structure at lower temperatures to a nonplanar, coiled structure at elevated temperatures. For example, poly(3-(octyloxy)-4-methylthiophene) undergoes a color change from red-violet at 25 °C to pale yellow at 150 °C. An isosbestic point (a point where the absorbance curves at all temperatures overlap) indicates coexistence between two phases, which may exist on the same chain or on different chains. Not all thermochromic PTs exhibit an isosbestic point: highly regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (PATs) show a continuous blue-shift with increasing temperature if the side chains are short enough {{so that they do}} not melt and interconvert between crystalline and disordered phases at low temperatures.|$|E

50|$|A trichocyst can {{be found}} in tetrahymena and along cila {{pathways}} of several metabolic systems. It is also a structure in the cortex of certain ciliate and flagellate protozoans consisting of a cavity and long, thin threads that can be ejected in response to certain stimuli. Trichocysts may be widely distributed over an organism or restricted to certain areas (e.g., tentacles, papillae, around the mouth). There are several types. Mucoid trichocysts are elongated inclusions that may be ejected as visible bodies after artificial stimulation. Filamentous trichocysts in Paramecium and other ciliates are discharged as filaments composed of a cross-striated shaft and a tip. Toxicysts (in Dileptus and certain other carnivorous protozoans) tend to be localized around the mouth. When discharged, a toxicyst expels a long, nonstriated filament with a <b>rodlike</b> tip, which paralyzes or kills other microorganisms; this filament is used to capture food and, presumably, in defense.|$|E
50|$|Determining {{exactly how}} {{the members of the}} Sphenacodontidae—Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, Ctenospondylus, Cryptovenator, and Secodontosaurus—are related to each other has posed an {{evolutionary}} puzzle for paleontologists. Dimetrodon and Secodontosaurus have very similar postcranial skeletons, with a tall dorsal sail supported by thin, <b>rodlike</b> cylindrical neural spines. By contrast, Sphenacodon and Ctenospondylus have a lower dorsal crest formed from flat, blade-like neural spines, relatively low in Sphenacodon and taller in Ctenospondylus. However, Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, and Ctenospondylus have very similar deep skulls with teeth of different sizes while Secondontosaurus has an unusual low, elongated skull with more uniform teeth. Depending on whether the tall dorsal sail or the deep skull is considered the key character in the phylogeny of sphenacodontids, Secodontosaurus is either in a clade with Dimetrodon that excludes Sphenacodon or is placed on a distinct branch of its own with Dimetrodon and Sphenacodon united in a separate clade.|$|E

50|$|Foraging {{takes place}} almost {{exclusively}} at night. It {{is characterized by}} large numbers of wasps explosively departing from the nest, then quickly returning only to depart again in a similar fashion. As the night progresses there are moderate to heavy levels of return and departures by smaller groups of wasps. The foraging patterns of Apoica pallens are dependent on the moon’s cycle: when the moon is new or small, Apoica pallens forages during the first 4 hours after sunset, with another small peak of activity just before dawn as wasps return to the nest. When the moon is waxing, Apoica pallens extends the hours that it forages until individuals are out all night long. Over time, Apoica pallens have developed adaptations that have enhanced their vision allowing them to forage in these low light intensity conditions. These wasps have larger visual fields compared to those of relatives due to a greater diameter of the rhabdom,a <b>rodlike</b> structure in the eye that’s sensitive to light. A. pallens also have increased number of facets instead of larger facets of the eye, which has increased its relative eye size. Although these features help increase the wasp’s nocturnal vision, other factors not widely studied also contribute, such as the lateral branching of neurons in the first optic ganglion within the eye.|$|E
