5000|$|There {{were many}} {{optional}} feature for the Classics, including the rear exit doors. Most orders specified the wide versions, but a narrower single-stream door was also available. A majority of orders had either large or no rear windows, {{but a few}} opted for a small rear window {{at the top of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>cap.</b> The rear window was dropped as an option for US-built buses due to revised air conditioning equipment and a stand-out exhaust deflector that extended the upper half of the <b>rear</b> <b>cap</b> by a few inches. Another modification during the production run was the size of the front destination sign. A taller and wider version was offered from 1990 as more transit systems specified larger electronic signs. The major exception was Montreal, as MCI and NovaBus built an [...] "M-version" [...] which retained the narrow destination sign windows, and was ordered primarily by properties in the Montreal area.|$|E

50|$|The {{attempted}} {{sinking of}} the US submarine is almost certainly based on {{the loss of the}} Royal Navy submarine HMS Thetis in Liverpool Bay in 1939. As in the film the drip cock was blocked on the newly built Thetis (by dockyard-applied fresh paint) which led to the <b>rear</b> <b>cap</b> being opened while the bow cap was already open to the ocean. Water entered at the rate of one ton per second and Thetis sank with the loss of 98 lives. In the movie the drip cock has been blocked with epoxy adhesive.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{series of}} breech-lock FD lenses (1973-1976), which {{discontinued}} the chrome barrel front, is engraved [...] "S.C." [...] in white or [...] "S.S.C." [...] in red {{on the front}} of the lens. The S.S.C. coating was extended to most lenses in this series. The basic S.C. coating was, for the most part, limited to the least expensive lenses. These 2nd breech ring generation FD lenses still had a green [...] "o", but now there was a chrome lock button on the aperture ring that had to be depressed to put the lens on or take the lens off of [...] "o". One still could not put the lens on [...] "o" [...] unless the camera body had the AE switch pin hole. And the lens could not be mounted on a non-EE / AE body if the lens was set on [...] "o". The breech ring now featured a lock which prevented it from rotating unless a <b>rear</b> <b>cap</b> was put on or the lens was mounted to a body. Further, the breech ring rotated slightly when the lens was mounted to aid in getting the lens securely mounted.|$|E

In addition, due to its use as an MFSAB, the MyBus {{is not allowed to}} be fitted with warning lights, a stop sign, nor can it be painted school bus yellow (conversely, the Minotour is required to be painted that color if it is a school bus).|$|R
40|$|Particle {{concentration}} {{is a key}} unit operation in biochemical assays. Although there are many techniques for particle concentration in continuous-phase microfluidics, relatively few are available in multiphase (plug-based) microfluidics. Existing approaches generally require external electric or magnetic fields together with charged or magnetized particles. This paper reports a passive technique for particle concentration in water-in-oil plugs which relies on the interaction between particle sedimentation and the recirculating vortices inherent to plug flow in a cylindrical capillary. This interaction can be quantified using the Shields parameter (θ), a dimensionless ratio of a particle’s drag force to its gravitational force, which scales with plug velocity. Three regimes of particle behavior are identified. When θ {{is less than the}} movement threshold (region I), particles sediment {{to the bottom of the}} plug where the internal vortices subsequently concentrate the particles at the rear of the plug. We demonstrate highly efficient concentration (∼ 100 %) of 38 [*]μm glass beads in 500 [*]μm diameter plugs traveling at velocities up to 5 [*]mm/s. As θ is increased beyond the movement threshold (region II), particles are suspended in well-defined circulation zones which begin at the rear of the plug. The length of the zone scales linearly with plug velocity, and at sufficiently large θ, it spans the length of the plug (region III). A second effect, attributed to the co-rotating vortices at the <b>rear</b> <b>cap,</b> causes particle aggregation in the cap, regardless of flow velocity. Region I is useful for concentrating/collecting particles, while the latter two are useful for mixing the beads with the solution. Therefore, the two key steps of a bead-based assay, concentration and resuspension, can be achieved simply by changing the plug velocity. By exploiting an interaction of sedimentation and recirculation unique to multiphase flow, this simple technique achieves particle concentration without on-chip components, and could therefore be applied to a range of heterogeneous screening assays in discrete nl plugs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to derive {{accurate}} models for quantities characterizing the dynamics of droplets of non-vanishing viscosity in capillaries. In particular, we propose models for the uniform-film thickness separating the droplet from the tube walls, for the droplet front and rear curvatures and pressure jumps, and for the droplet velocity in a range of capillary numbers, Ca, from 10 ^- 4 to 1 and inner-to-outer viscosity ratios, λ, from 0 to 100. Theoretical asymptotic results obtained in the limit of small capillary number are combined with accurate numerical simulations at larger Ca. With these models at hand, we can compute the pressure drop induced by the droplet. The film thickness at low capillary numbers (Ca 10 ^ 3. At larger capillary numbers, the film thickness follows the rational function proposed by Aussillous & Quéré for bubbles, with a fitting coefficient which is viscosity-ratio dependent. This coefficient modifies the value to which the film thickness saturates at large capillary numbers. The velocity of the droplet is found to be strongly dependent on the capillary number and viscosity ratio. We also show that the normal viscous stresses at the front and <b>rear</b> <b>caps</b> of the droplets cannot be neglected when calculating the pressure drop for Ca> 10 ^- 3...|$|R
50|$|The {{second major}} crash in turn one {{in as many}} days {{occurred}} on Thursday. At 5:18 p.m., Josef Newgarden lost control in turn one, did a three-quarter spin, and hit the outside wall in the south short chute with the nose. The car flipped over, and slid to a rest upside-down {{near the entrance to}} turn two. Newgarden was uninjured, and the crash appeared vastly similar to Hélio Castroneves' a day earlier. The two accidents prompted officials to re-evaluate an optional Chevrolet aerokit <b>rear</b> wheel <b>cap</b> that had been installed on both cars.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1970s, the All American saw few {{external}} changes, {{but more}} {{changes were made}} under {{the skin of the}} bus. To comply with federal regulations, Blue Bird strengthened the skin and structure of the bus for 1977 safety regulations, which also saw the addition of high-back padded passenger seats. [...] In addition, for 1977, Blue Bird changed the <b>rear</b> roof <b>cap</b> to match its counterpart in the front (borrowing bodywork from the Wanderlodge).

50|$|Dodge {{pioneered the}} American 15-passenger van genre with the {{introduction}} of the Maxiwagon along with the other front engine B series vans that were new for 1971. Ford didn't produce a 15-passenger van until 1978, and GM did not introduce theirs until 1990. Little changed on Dodge vans produced between 1971 and 1977, with only a grille change from metal to plastic for the 1974 model year. 1978 was a transition year for B series vans, consisting of the nose from 1977 and earlier vans (with a one-year only Dodge symbol in the grille) but with a completely new dashboard and <b>rear</b> end <b>cap.</b> On the standard length vans, the <b>rear</b> end <b>cap</b> just contained new larger tail lamps, but the extended length Maxivan and Maxiwagon had a completely redesigned rear extension which was longer and had large windows that wrapped around the corners for better visibility. This was unique to the B vans, and this same extension was used until the B vans were discontinued in 2003. On the 1971-77 models, the rear side doors were set back about two feet towards the rear wheelwells, with a filler panel between them and the front doors. Passenger models had a small window between the front and rear doors. Early 1971 vans had black plastic door push buttons, an inlaid pentastar logo low right front fender, drum brakes and points type ignition. 1972 model year began a phase in of chrome door push buttons, electronic ignition, and front disc brakes. In 1978, the filler panel was removed and the doors were moved forward to be next to the front passenger door, similar to the Ford and Chevrolet vans.|$|R

50|$|A minor style {{revision}} {{was applied}} for the 1997 model year. The front grille opening was given a more aggressive profile. The headlights were given a sharper slant on the inner edges, and the previous all-chrome fixture interior changed to a black interior with chrome reflector inserts. The driving lights were revised from a reflector type to a smaller projection type. The <b>rear</b> bumper <b>cap</b> was altered and had the reverse lights restyled and moved out into the bumper fascia, away from their original central position by the license plate bracket. The GS-T coupe and GSX received a large rear spoiler. The interior color choices also changed from blue, and grey in 1995-1996 model years to black/grey, tan/black, and grey in the 1997-1999 model years.

40|$|The paper {{represents}} {{a case study}} which focuses on Poka Yoke which is a concept coined by Japanese people. We have studied a system that eliminated the rework and increased productivity of the plant which results in achievement of 0 PPM as well; in the company based in Satpur, Nashik. There was a punching machine there in the plant which was punching a hole on a <b>rear</b> end <b>cap</b> of Mahindra Scorpio’s rear bumper. There were 4 metal clips which were fitted on that component before the part gets punched on punching machine. After some of the lots get punched, we observed that component is getting punched unless those clip fittings. At that time, company needs more time to fit metal clips on the component again which was time consuming. So this problem can be avoided by implementing Poka Yoke system to it.

5000|$|Dealerships {{could finally}} order a Firebird Convertible from a {{recognized}} coach builder {{that was already}} converting other GM products (though {{more than a dozen}} other companies had been converting F-bodies into convertibles since 1982 for Pontiac & Chevrolet dealers). ASC (American Sunroof Company, Later [...] "American Specialty Cars") (of ASC McLaren fame) offered Pontiac Dealerships a Firebird/Formula/Trans Am/GTA convertible. ASC was contracted to convert all of the official Camaro Convertibles from 1987 to 1992. However, due to fuel economy restrictions mandated by the EPA, a convertible Firebird would have been assessed a $1200 Gas Guzzler Tax because the LB9 & L98 when paired with a Trans Am or GTA would have been lower than 22.5 average MPG. For this reason Pontiac did not directly offer a convertible through dealers like the Camaro. However these were not an official Pontiac offering, they are considered coach convertibles. The conversion of the Firebird was identical to the [...] "Factory" [...] Camaros of the same model year. The exception was the obvious cosmetic changes, the <b>rear</b> quarter <b>caps,</b> spoiler (Which was a Base spoiler Wing cut off) and the high mount 3rd brake light were Firebird convertible specific.|$|R
