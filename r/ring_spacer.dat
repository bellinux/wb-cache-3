Flexible analogs of suberic acid bisdimethylamide are approximately 100 times as active as the parent compound or hexamethylenebisacetamide.

Animals-large breed cadaveric canine cervical vertebral columns (C 2 -C 7) from skeletally mature dogs without (cadaveric group 1, n[*]=[*] 6, historical data) and with an intervertebral disk spacer (cadaveric group 2, n[*]=[*] 6) were used. All PVC models and cadaver specimens were instrumented with monocortical titanium screws/PMMA. Stiffness of the 2 PVC groups was compared in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using non-destructive 4 -point bend testing. Stiffness testing in all 3 directions was performed of the unaltered C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion unit in cadaveric spines and repeated after placement of an intervertebral cortical allograft ring and instrumentation. Data were compared using a linear mixed model approach that also incorporated data from previously tested spines with the same screw/PMMA construct but without disk spacer (cadaveric group 1).

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Cadaver cervical spines from skeletally mature large breed dogs (n[*]=[*] 18). METHODS: Specimens were screened using radiography and allocated into balanced groups based on bone density. Stiffness of intact C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion units was measured in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using nondestructive 4 -point bend testing. Uniplate 2 was then implanted at C 4 -C 5 and mechanical testing was repeated. Mechanical test data were compared against those from 6 spines implanted with monocortical screws, an allograft <b>ring</b> <b>spacer,</b> and PMMA. RESULTS: The Zero-P and Zero-P VA systems could not be surgically implanted due to anatomical constraints in the vertebral column sizes of the canine cervical spines used in this study. Fixation with Uniplate 2 or with screws/PMMA significantly increased stiffness of the C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion units compared to unaltered specimens (P[*]<[*]. 001) in extension. Stiffness of the titanium screw/PMMA fixation was significantly greater than the Uniplate 2 construct in extension. Flexion and lateral bending could not be evaluated in 3 of 6 specimens in the Uniplate 2 group due to failure at the bone/implant interface during extension testing. CONCLUSION: Fixation with Uniplate 2 was biomechanically inferior to screws/PMMA. Particularly concerning was the incidence of vertebral fracture after several testing cycles.

Because of a-carbon substitution and extended conjugation offered by the pyrrole ring, the optical absorbance and emission spectra of BDP macrocycle {{were found to be}} red-shifted significantly. Electrochemical studies provided information on the redox potentials while computational studies performed at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* level yielded an optimized geometry of the dyad that was close to that reported earlier for a BDP-C 60 dyad covalently connected through the central boron atom, 2. The HOMO of the dyad was found to be on the BDP macrocycle, extended over the pyrrole bridging group, a property that is expected to facilitate electronic communication between the BDP and fullerene entities. The established energy level diagram using spectral, redox, and optimized structural results predicted possibility of photoinduced electron transfer in both benzonitrile and toluene, representing polar and nonpolar solvents. However, such energy diagram suggested different routes for the charge recombination processes, that is, direct relaxation of the radical ion-pair in polar solvent while populating the triplet level of the sensitizer ((BDP) -B- 3 * or C- 3 (60) *) in nonpolar solvent. Proof for charge separation and solvent dependent charge recombination processes were established from studies involving femto- and nanosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. The measured rate of charge separation, kCS, for 1 was higher in both solvents compared to the earlier reported values for 2 due to electronically well-communicating pyrrole spacer. The charge recombination in toluene populated (BDP) -B- 3 * as an intermediate step while in benzonitrile it yielded directly ground state of the dyad. The present findings reveal the significance of pyrrole spacer between the donor and acceptor to facilitate charge separation and solvent polarity dependent charge recombination processes...|$|E

40|$|Photochemistry is {{a natural}} phenomenon, which began at {{the origin of the}} {{universe}} and the world and also a modern science which describes the interaction between light and matter in several main science domains, such as chemistry, physics and biology. Photochemistry plays a fundamental role in life (photosynthesis, vision, phototaxis, etc…) and also in technology (image reproduction, photocatalysis, photodegradation, etc…). The last 30 years of photochemistry have shown the fundamental role played in experiment and theoretical investigations. From determination of molecular mechanisms to photocatalysis and electronic information of complex devices, studying photochemistry is now indispensable. The photochemical and photophysical processes of thousands of organic and organometallic, coordination compounds complexes have been studied and elucidated, and now confirmed with the help of theoretical tools to explain the structural, energetic and dynamic properties of the molecules in their most important excited state. The major part of photochemical investigations were focused on molecular species with simple processes (molecular photochemistry). The combination of atoms leads to molecules and the combination of molecular components leads to supramolecular species. Current chemical research shows us that photons and energy information can be used in supramolecular species. The interest in the chemistry of the interaction of supramolecular species with light is great because its allows several types of properties not previously observed. In the last few year supramolecular photochemistry has taken an important part in chemistry. Photochemistry and supramolecular photochemistry are interdisciplinary areas. In this introduction we will show the meaning of supramolecular chemistry and also define some fundamental concepts of photochemistry, and the host-guest theory and explain some recent investigations oligopyridine chemistry. This work shows the design of new ruthenium (II) oligopyridine complexes and their photophysical and electrochemical properties. Chapter I highlights some recent developments of those topics in chemistry and especially in supramolecular systems. Chapter II describes the synthesis via Suzuki-coupling of the in the 4 -methoxyphenyl, 3, 5 - dimethoxy and 1 -naphthyl substitution of 4, 4 ´ position of 2, 2 ´-bipyridine. The corresponding Ru(II) complexes have been prepared. Chapter III deals with the synthesis of new starshaped X and Y metallodendrimers, the synthesis of 4 ’-substitued tpy ligands their complexation with Ru(II), and the synthesis of polynuclear supramolecular assemblies. Chapter IV concerns the photophysical and electrochemical properties of some chapter II and III complexes Ru(II), determination of luminescence lifetimes and quantum yields. Chapter V decribes the synthesis of 6, 6 ´-dimethyl- 4, 4 ´-(3, 5 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 2, 2 ´-bipyridine ligand, its complexation with Cu(I) and Ru(II) and their photophysical and electrochemical properties. Chapter VI shows the synthesis of 1 -pyrenyl substituted tpy ligand and its complexation with Ru(II), Os(II) and Ir(III) as potent donors and acceptors for the formation of polyads.

The eventual resolution was Large Scale Fuel Channel Replacement and all the pressure tubes were replaced in all Pickering A reactors. Since then, additional monitoring of the location of the annulus gas <b>spacer</b> <b>rings</b> has been a significant part of routine reactor inspections.|$|R

The role of the thiophene ring as an auxiliary donor was also investigated. All chromophores in this study exhibit high decomposition temperatures, above 230 °C. The macroscopic nonlinear response has been evaluated by incorporating some of the chromophores as a guest in a polycarbonate (PC) host matrix.

The components object of investigation consisted in 1 st and 2 nd high pressure turbine wheels made in nickel-base superalloy (Inconel 718), the <b>spacer</b> <b>ring</b> (Inconel 718) and the compressor shaft made in CrMoV low alloy steel (ASTM A 471 type 10). Aim {{of the work is}} to set up the capability of the instrumented spherical indentation testing system to evaluate variations in the material properties due to damage, resulting from temperature field and stresses acting on components during service. To perform this task load-indentation depth curves will be acquired in various zones of the above mentioned components. The analysis of the results has allowed to identify an energy parameter which shows a linear evolution with the mean temperature acting on the components...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of star-shaped {{discotic liquid crystal}} trimers using Co 2 (CO) 8 -catalyzed terminal alkyne [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is reported. The trimers consist of three triphenylene discotic units linked to a central 1, 2, 4 -trisubstituted benzene <b>ring</b> via flexible <b>spacers.</b> The trimers were synthesized in the yields up to 70 % by mixing the monomers with 10 mol % of Co 2 (CO) 8 as the catalyst in refluxing 1, 4 -dioxane. The liquid crystalline properties were investigated by using polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Trimer 4 with an ester connecting group and a longer spacer exhibited a rectangular columnar mesophase, while 5 b and 5 c possessing an ether linkage and a shorter spacer display a hexagonal columnar mesophase. The connecting functional group {{and the length of}} the flexible spacer between the central benzene ring and the triphenylene units have pivotal influence on the mesomorphism...|$|R
