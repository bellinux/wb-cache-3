Texture {{parameters}} are important factors for characterizing the sensory quality of raw almonds; nevertheless there is scarce literature that explores sensory differences among cultivars. The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize quality attributes of different <b>raw</b> <b>almond</b> cultivars. Materials and methods. The almond cultivars 'Nonpareil', 'Mission', 'Supernova', `Tuono', 'Ferragnes' and 'Marcona' were used to characterize their industrial and sensory quality attributes. A panel of 14 assessors with previous experience in testing stone fruit was specifically trained on descriptive analysis for determining quality and particularly texture of raw almonds. Results and discussion. A direct relationship was observed between kernel yield and shell fracture resistance; the American cultivars 'Nonpareil', and 'Mission' showed more minor shell fracture resistance than the European. `Tuono' stood out for being tasty, crunchy and hard, whereas 'Marcona' was noted for its color intensity, crispness and hardness; but it lacked taste. 'Supernova' was described as tasty. Conclusion. A 5 -h training period proved to be adequate for characterizing <b>raw</b> <b>almond</b> cultivars. The panel was able to discriminate between cultivars and segregate 'Nonpareil' and 'Mission' from the other cultivars in terms of texture attributes. CONICYT FONDECYT project 113019...|$|E

The content and activity {{of water in}} the kernels before and after the pre-germination treatments were measured by oven drying and dew point water analysis, respectively. The total phenolic and phytic acid contents of the kernels were quantified by using Folin-Ciocalteu and a published spectrophotometric assay, respectively. (±) -Catechin and quercetin contents in the almond kernels were determined using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry. The total antioxidant capacity of the kernels were measured by 2, 2 ’-diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyl assay. Treatment with water, PBS pH 5 and PBS pH 7 significantly increased the water, total phenolic, (±) -catechin contents and total antioxidant capacity of the almond kernels regardless of the treatment temperatures (25 or 40 °C). The phytic acid and quercetin contents were significantly elevated after the  three treatments at 40 °C. The total phenolic, (±) -catechin, quercetin and phytate contents in the almond kernels contributed significantly to its antioxidant property. Our results suggested that the phytochemical compositions of the almond kernels changed during pre-germination.

We estimated the risk associated with the consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>almonds</b> and the risk reduction associated with almonds treated with a theoretical 5 -log reduction process or treated with propylene oxide using a standard commercial process. Probability distributions were chosen to describe the chance of almond contamination and the effects of storage time, storage temperature, and processing from currently available data. A -Poisson model for the dose-response relationship for Salmonella was obtained from published literature. The simulation estimated a 78 % chance of one or more cases of salmonellosis per year from consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>almonds.</b> The application of a commercial propylene oxide treatment reduced this risk to 0. 01 %.

Sera {{from each of the}} eight almond allergic individuals exhibited unique binding patterns with the almond proteins. As many as eight IgE-binding proteins were identified in immunoblots of SDS-PAGE separated almond proteins. Sera from four of the eight individuals reacted to a protein of approximate molecular weight of 70, 000 daltons. Another protein, of approximately 45, 000 to 50, 000 molecular weight was also recognized by four individuals. The three different varieties of almonds that were studied exhibited identical IgE-binding patterns. Processing reduced the allergenicity as was evidenced by reduced IgE-binding in immunoblots of blanched almonds and roasted blanched almonds. ^ Fewer IgE-binding proteins were identified in immunoblots of almond proteins separated using nondenaturing conditions. As many as four IgE-binding proteins were exhibited in <b>raw</b> <b>almonds.</b> One of these proteins was recognized by the same four individuals that reacted to the 70, 000 dalton protein in the SDS-PAGE immunoblots. Fewer IgE-binding proteins were exhibited in extracts of processed almonds separated under nondenaturing conditions as well. ^ The common IgE-binding protein in the nondenaturing immunoblots was purified using conventional chromatography. This protein (Pru a Bd 68 K) had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 68, 000 daltons. The IgE-binding activity of Pru a Bd 68 K was eliminated by heating at 100 - 121 ∘C and was absent in immunoblots of almond butter and roasted blanched almond. While this protein exhibited IgE-binding activity by immunoblotting, skin tests with three almond allergic individuals have failed to give positive results. Peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing were initiated but further studies await confirmation of in vivo allergenicity. ^ Five commercially prepared allergen extracts were also studied and compared using immunoblotting with sera from the same eight almond allergic individuals. The different extracts varied widely in quantity and quality of protein. While IgE-binding patterns differed between extracts, all exhibited some reactivity. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2000 to 2001, 2003 to 2004, and 2005 to 2006, three {{outbreaks}} of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis were {{linked with the}} consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>almonds.</b> The S. Enteritidis strains from these outbreaks had rare phage types (PT), PT 30 and PT 9 c. Clinical and environmental S. Enteritidis strains were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and DNA microarray-based comparative genomic indexing (CGI) to evaluate their genetic relatedness. All three methods differentiated these S. Enteritidis strains {{in a manner that}} correlated with PT. The CGI analysis confirmed {{that the majority of the}} differences between the S. Enteritidis PT 9 c and PT 30 strains corresponded to bacteriophage-related genes present in the sequenced genomes of S. Enteritidis PT 4 and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT 2. However, PFGE, MLVA, and CGI failed to discriminate between S. Enteritidis PT 30 strains related to outbreaks from unrelated clinical strains or between strains separated by up to 5 years. However, metabolic fingerprinting demonstrated that S. Enteritidis PT 4, PT 8, PT 13 a, and clinical PT 30 strains metabolized l-aspartic acid, l-glutamic acid, l-proline, l-alanine, and d-alanine amino acids more efficiently than S. Enteritidis PT 30 strains isolated from orchards. These data indicate that S. Enteritidis PT 9 c and 30 strains are highly related genetically and that PT 30 orchard strains differ from clinical PT 30 strains metabolically, possibly due to fitness adaptations...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{demonstrated}} that consuming almonds increases satiety but does not result in weight gain, despite their high energy and lipid content. To understand the mechanism of almond digestion, in the present study, we investigated the bioaccessibility of lipids from masticated almonds during in vitro simulated human digestion, and determined the associated changes in cell-wall composition and cellular microstructure. The influence of processing on lipid release was assessed by using natural <b>raw</b> <b>almonds</b> (NA) and roasted almonds (RA). Masticated samples from four healthy adults (two females, two males) were exposed to a dynamic gastric model of digestion followed by simulated duodenal digestion. Between 7 · 8 and 11 · 1  % of the total lipid was released as a result of mastication, with {{no significant differences between the}} NA and RA samples. Significant digestion occurred during the in vitro gastric phase (16 · 4 and 15 · 9  %) and the in vitro duodenal phase (32 · 2 and 32 · 7  %) for the NA and RA samples, respectively. Roasting produced a smaller average particle size distribution post-mastication; however, this was not significant in terms of lipid release. Light microscopy showed major changes that occurred in the distribution of lipid in all cells after the roasting process. Further changes were observed in the surface cells of almond fragments and in fractured cells after exposure to the duodenal environment. Almond cell walls prevented lipid release from intact cells, providing a mechanism for incomplete nutrient absorption in the gut. The composition of almond cell walls was not affected by processing or simulated digestion...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was (I) to create a new product, smart bar type which can be {{consumed}} as protective food by adults and children (II) to characterize the bioactive compounds from the designed food. The bioactive compounds were identified from nuts, <b>raw</b> seeds of <b>almonds,</b> dry cranberries, dry plums and flax seeds. Secoisolariciresinol (683 ppm) has been identified as a major compound in flax seeds.   The vitamin C was quantified by HPLC in a concentration of 35. 02 mg% in cranberries extract. The total phenolic content varied from 7. 1 mg/g for walnut to 71. 8 mg/g for cranberries. In addition, the antioxidative capability of phenolic compounds was monitored and evaluated using a colored free radical 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Almond showed better results than walnut in the antioxidant capacity test. The results obtained in this study collect information that enables the use of nuts, <b>raw</b> seeds of <b>almonds,</b> dry cranberries, dry plums and flax seeds as raw material for the production of smart bar which may serve as a new product for food market...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSalmonella {{has been}} shown to survive in tree nuts over long periods of time. This {{survival}} capacity and its variability are key elements for risk assessment of Salmonella in tree nuts. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a mathematical model to predict survival of Salmonella in tree nuts at ambient storage temperatures that considers variability and uncertainty separately and can easily be incorporated into a risk assessment model. Data on Salmonella survival on <b>raw</b> <b>almonds,</b> pecans, pistachios and walnuts were collected from the peer reviewed literature. The Weibull model was chosen as the baseline model and various fixed effect and mixed effect models were fit to the data. The best model identified through statistical analysis testing was then used to develop a hierarchical Bayesian model. Salmonella in tree nuts showed slow declines at temperatures ranging from 21 °C to 24 °C. A high degree of variability in survival was observed across tree nut studies reported in the literature. Statistical analysis results indicated that the best applicable model was a mixed effect model that included a fixed and random variation of δ per tree nut (which is the time it takes for the first log 10 reduction) and a fixed variation of ρ per tree nut (parameter which defines the shape of the curve). Higher estimated survival rates (δ) were obtained for Salmonella on pistachios, followed in decreasing order by pecans, almonds and walnuts. The posterior distributions obtained from Bayesian inference were used to estimate the variability in the log 10 decrease levels in survival for each tree nut, and the uncertainty of these estimates. These modeled uncertainty and variability distributions of the estimates can be used to obtain a complete exposure assessment of Salmonella in tree nuts when including time–temperature parameters for storage and consumption data. The statistical approach presented in this study may be applied to any studies that aim to develop predictive models to be implemented in a probabilistic exposure assessment or a quantitative microbial risk assessment...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how roasting affected disintegration and solid release properties of almond in simulated gastric environment. In vitro trials were performed for <b>raw</b> and roasted <b>almonds</b> by using static soaking method and a model stomach system.
