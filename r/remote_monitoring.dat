25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E
500|$|The 2008 {{version was}} {{announced}} on August 28, 2007, adding support for Windows Vista 64-bit. New features include SONAR, the Norton Identity Safe, and Browser Defender. SONAR monitors applications for malicious behavior. The Identity Safe supersedes the information filtering function; instead of blocking personal information from leaving the computer, it stores personal information to fill webforms. It is password protected and checks a website's authenticity before filling any forms. Browser Defender inspects and blocks suspicious API calls, intended to stop drive-by downloads. The Network Map identifies networked computers with Norton Internet Security 2008 installed. <b>Remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> allows checking {{the status of}} other installations on different computers; problems are identified with a red [...] "X" [...] icon. Using the feature, users also can control network traffic between computers. It also warns users if they are using an unencrypted wireless network. The startup application manager and advertisement blocking features were dropped from this release. Information filtering, although superseded by the Identity Safe in the suite, is available separately. It {{can be used in}} conjunction with the Identity Safe.|$|E

2500|$|The DR {{forms an}} {{important}} part of Giddens’s recent preoccupation with the emergence of the high opportunity, high risk society. [...] For example, the advent of the DR promises fundamental advances in core areas of medicine. New threats and problems abound, both in our everyday lives and in the larger institutions of our societies. Scientists can communicate with one-another in a direct way across the world. The overlap of supercomputers and genetics means that genetic structures can be decoded instantaneously, promising huge advances in conquering major diseases. Medical practice is likely to be transformed through <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> and other digital innovations. Yet the overlap of the DR with criminality, violence and war is pervasive and dangerous. Military drones are just one example of the continuing involvement of the DR with war.|$|E
