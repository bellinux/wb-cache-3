50|$|Two {{mechanisms}} may compete. In {{step one}} of a radical cation mechanism a radical cation is formed from one <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> by oxidation, in step two the radical ion attacks the second neutral partner in a substitution reaction and a new radical ion is formed with one ring bearing the positive charge {{and the other one}} the radical position. In step three dihydrogen is split of with rearomatisation to the biaryl compound. In the arenium ion mechanism one <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> is protonated to an arenium ion which then attacks the second <b>reaction</b> <b>partner.</b> The arenium ion can also be formed by attack of the Lewis acid. The mechanisms are difficult to distinguish because many Lewis acids can behave as oxidants. Reactions taking place at room-temperature with well-known one-electron oxidizing agents likely proceed through a radical cation mechanism and reactions requiring elevated temperatures likely proceed through an arenium ion mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|Hans Horst Meyer (March 17, 1853 [...] - [...] October 6, 1939) was a German pharmacologist. He studied {{medicine}} and did research in pharmacology. The Meyer-Overton hypothesis on {{the mode of}} action on general anaesthetics is partially named after him. He also discovered the importance of glucuronic acid as a <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> for drugs, and the mode of action of tetanus toxin on the body.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSupramolecular {{catalysis}} is {{a rapidly}} expanding discipline which {{has benefited from}} the development of both homogeneous catalysis and supramolecular chemistry. The properties of classical metal and organic catalysts can now be carefully tailored by means of several suitable approaches and the choice of reversible interactions such as hydrogen bond, metal–ligand, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The first part of these two subsequent reviews will be dedicated to catalytic systems for which non-covalent interactions between the <b>partners</b> of the <b>reaction</b> have been designed although mimicking enzyme properties has not been intended. Ligand, metal, organocatalyst, substrate, additive, and metal counterion are <b>reaction</b> <b>partners</b> that can be held together by non-covalent interactions. The resulting catalysts possess unique properties compared to analogues lacking the assembling properties. Depending {{on the nature of}} the <b>reaction</b> <b>partners</b> involved in the interactions, distinct applications have been accomplished, mainly (i) the building of bidentate ligand libraries (intra ligand–ligand), (ii) the building of di- or oligonuclear complexes (inter ligand–ligand), (iii) the alteration of the coordination spheres of a metal catalyst (ligand–ligand additive), and (iv) the control of the substrate reactivity (catalyst–substrate). More complex systems that involve the cooperative action of three <b>reaction</b> <b>partners</b> have also been disclosed. In this review, special attention will be given to supramolecular catalysts for which the observed catalytic activity and/or selectivity have been imputed to non-covalent interaction between the <b>reaction</b> <b>partners.</b> Additional features of these catalysts are the easy modulation of the catalytic performance by modifying one of their building blocks and the development of new catalytic pathways/reactions not achievable with classical covalent catalysts...|$|R
50|$|Now {{limitations}} {{emerge from}} the chemistry of the probe to its target. In order for this technique to be useful in biological systems, click chemistry must run at or near biological conditions, produce little and (ideally) non-toxic byproducts, have (preferably) single and stable products at the same conditions, and proceed quickly to high yield in one pot. Existing reactions, such as Staudinger ligation and the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, have been modified and optimized for such reaction conditions. Today, {{research in the field}} concerns not only understanding and developing new reactions and repurposing and re-understanding known reactions, but also expanding methods used to incorporate <b>reaction</b> <b>partners</b> into living systems, engineering novel <b>reaction</b> <b>partners,</b> and developing applications for bioconjugation.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to the dynamics of reactions of diﬀusing chemical species with species ﬁxed in space e. g. by binding to a membrane. The non-diﬀusing <b>reaction</b> <b>partners</b> are clustered in areas with a diameter smaller than the diﬀusion length of the diﬀusing partner. The activated fraction of the ﬁxed species determines {{the size of an}} active sub-region of the cluster. Linear stability analysis reveals that diﬀusion is one of the ma jor determinants of the stability of the dynamics. We illustrate the model concept with Ca²⁺ dynamics in living cells, which has release channels as ﬁxed <b>reaction</b> <b>partners.</b> Our results suggest that spatial and temporal structures in intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics are caused by ﬂuctuations due to the small number of channels per cluster...|$|R
50|$|In addition, novel {{methods for}} the {{incorporation}} of click reaction partners into systems in and ex vivo contribute to the scope of possible reactions. The development of unnatural amino acid incorporation by ribosomes has allowed for {{the incorporation of}} click reaction partners as unnatural side groups on these unnatural amino acids. For example, an UAA with an azide side group provides convenient access for cycloalkynes to proteins tagged with this “AHA” unnatural amino acid. In another example, “CpK” has a side group including a cyclopropane alpha to an amide bond {{that serves as a}} <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> to tetrazine in an inverse diels-alder reaction.|$|E
50|$|Reactions {{that can}} be used in DCvC are diverse and can be placed into two general categories. Exchange {{reactions}} involve the substitution of one <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> in an intermolecular reaction for another with an identical type of bonding. Some examples of this are shown in schemes 5 and 8, in an ester exchange, and disulfide exchange reactions. The second type, formation reactions, rely on the formation of new covalent bonds. Some examples include Diels-Alder, and Aldol reactions. In some cases, a reaction can pertain to both categories. For example, Schiff base formation can be categorized as a forming new covalent bonds between a carbonyl and primary amine. However, in the presence of two different amines the reaction becomes an exchange reaction where the two imine derivatives compete in equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|The color {{reaction}} between borates and curcumin is used {{within the}} spectrophotometrical determination and quantification of boron present in food or materials. Curcumin is a yellow coloring natural pigment {{found in the}} root stocks of some Curcuma species, especially Curcuma longa (turmeric), in concentrations up to 3%. In the so-called curcumin method for boron quantification it serves as <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> for boric acid. The reaction is very sensitive and so the smallest quantities of boron can be detected. The maximum absorbance at 540 nm for rosocyanine is used in this colorimetric method. The formation of rosocyanine depends on the reaction conditions. The reaction is carried out preferentially in acidic solutions containing hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The color reaction also takes place under different conditions; however, in alkaline solution, gradual decomposition is observed. The reaction might be disturbed at higher pH values, interfering with other compounds.|$|E

5000|$|Meyer is {{best remembered}} for three discoveries. [...] With Schmiedeberg, he {{discovered}} glucuronic acid {{as the most}} important <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> of drugs (in his case, a metabolite of camphor). [...] He also discovered a relationship between the lipophilicity of general anaesthetics and their potency. Meyer concluded that lipophilicity was the essential factor in the effectiveness of an anaesthetic. These findings were summarized in three papers in Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie by Meyer and his coworker Fritz Baum, published in 1899. A year later, Charles Ernest Overton (1865-1933) independently came to the same conclusion. This correlation became known as the Meyer-Overton hypothesis. It has been called the most influential correlation in anaesthesia Meyer also discovered that tetanus toxin acts on the central nervous system and is transported there from the periphery via the motor neurons. This explains why the incubation time always takes several hours, and why therapy with antibodies is of limited value.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{significant}} geometric constraints {{imposed by the}} R-C≡C-R functionality, cycloalkynes smaller than cyclodecyne (C10H16) result in highly strained structures. While the cyclononyne (C9H14) and cyclooctyne (C8H12) are isolable (though strongly reactive) compounds, cycloheptyne (C7H10), cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclopentyne (C5H6) only exist as transient reaction intermediates or as ligands coordinating to a metal center. There is little experimental evidence supporting the existence of cyclobutyne (C4H4) or cyclopropyne (C3H2), aside from studies reporting the isolation of an osmium complex with cyclobutyne ligands. Initial studies which demonstrated the transient intermediacy of the seven-, six- and five-membered cycloalkynes relied on trapping of the high-energy alkyne with a suitable <b>reaction</b> <b>partner,</b> such as a cyclic dienes or diazo compounds to generate the Diels-Alder or diazoalkane 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition products, respectively. Stable small-ring cycloalkynes have subsequently been isolated in complex with various transition metals such as nickel, palladium and platinum. Despite long being considered to be chemical curiosities with limited synthetic applications, recent work has demonstrated the utility of strained cycloalkynes in both total synthesis of complex natural products and bioorthogonal chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|The mode integration/resolution and {{inversion}} (INT/RES and INV) {{depend on}} the orientation of recombinase target sites (RTS), among these pairs of attP and attB. Section C indicates, in a streamlined fashion, the way recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) {{can be reached by}} synchronous double-reciprocal crossovers (rather than integration, followed by resolution). Of note is the way reversible Flp-integration/resolution is modulated by 48 bp (in place of 34 bp minimal) FRT versions: the extra 13 bp arm serves as a Flp [...] "landing path" [...] contributing to the formation of the synaptic complex, both in the context of Flp-INT and Flp-RMCE functions (see the respective equilibrium situations). While it is barely possible to prevent the (entropy-driven) reversion of integration in section A for Cre and hard to achieve for Flp, RMCE can be completed if the donor plasmid is provided at an excess due to the bimolecular character of both the forward- and the reverse reaction. Posing both FRT sites in an inverse manner will lead to an equilibrium of both orientations for the insert (green arrow). In contrast to Flp, the Ser integrase PhiC31 (bottom representations) leads to unidirectional integration, at least {{in the absence of an}} recombinase-directionality (RDF-)factor. [...] Relative to Flp-RMCE, which requires two different ("heterospecific") FRT-spacer mutants, the <b>reaction</b> <b>partner</b> (attB) of the first reacting attP site is hit arbitrarily, such that there is no control over the direction the donor cassette enters the target (cf. the alternative products). Also different from Flp-RMCE, several distinct RMCE targets cannot be mounted in parallel, owing to the lack of heterospecific (non-crossinteracting) attP/attB combinations.|$|E

50|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, chemists have opted to proceed by identifying pairs of bioorthogonal <b>reaction</b> <b>partners,</b> thus allowing {{the use of}} small exogenous molecules as biomolecular probes.
