40|$|The skin colour of <b>red</b> <b>porgy,</b> Pagrus pagrus, can be {{modified}} by exposure to different background colours. Red and white background colours brighten the dark skin colour that develops under common culture conditions in <b>red</b> <b>porgy.</b> To assess whether skin colour is also modified by aquaculture related handling stress, we subjected <b>red</b> <b>porgy</b> to 5 min of netting stress combined with air exposure. Fish kept on a white background have: (1) a lighter skin colour, which is not influenced by an acute stressor, (2) a less saturated red colour, which significantly decreases 24 h post-handling, and (3) a similar hue as fish kept on a red background. The first plasma parameters to rise after application of the stressor are cortisol, lactate and Na(+); then, glucose levels rose. Other plasma ions (Ca(2 +), Cl(-), K(+)) were not affected up to 2 h post-stressor, but had decreased at 8 and 24 h after handling. Plasma pH decreased over the first 2 h post-handling, indicative of plasma acidosis upon air exposure. The acidosis then coincided with increases in plasma lactate levels.

40|$|<b>Red</b> <b>porgy,</b> Pagrus pagrus, is a {{potential}} candidate for aquaculture. However, darkening of the body occurs after capture of wild fish and during fanning of cultured animals. In fish, skin pigmentation is hormonally controlled and the main hormone involved in skin darkening, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alphaMSH), is not only involved in pigmentation {{but also in the}} regulation of the response to stressors. In this study, several environmental conditions were evaluated for their potency to influence the skin colour and to evoke a stress response. Background colour was the main factor in controlling skin pigmentation. A light background colour restored the lightness value of the skin up to levels found in wild <b>red</b> <b>porgy</b> (L*=similar to 70). The background effect was enhanced by applying blue illumination. Light intensity had no clear effect on the body colour, but a high density of fish had a negative effect on the lightness. Plasma parameters (cortisol, alphaMSH, glucose, lactate and osmolality) were not influenced by background colour. A stocking density of 25 kg/m(3) did not evoke a stress response in contrast to earlier studies on <b>red</b> <b>porgy,</b> nor influenced the body colour. We propose that this difference {{can be attributed to the}} number of fish per volume of water, which was lower than in other studies. This indicates that the number of fish per volume of water rather than the density in kilograms of fish per volume of water is the relevant factor. Furthermore, we suggest that the culture of adult <b>red</b> <b>porgy</b> can be optimised by maintenance of fish on a light background, thereby restoring the body colour to a more natural hue, without affecting the stress response.

All fish fed carotenoid supplemented diets displayed a pink-coloured skin after 4 months of feeding {{in contrast to the}} greyish appearance displayed by fish fed the basal diet not supplemented with carotenoids (B). Furthermore, astaxanthin diesters were the major carotenoid in the skin of pink fish. A second carotenoid, tentatively identified as tunaxanthin diester, was also detected. The best results in terms of skin natural reddish hue, total carotenoid and astaxanthin contents were found by using the esterified forms of dietary astaxanthin (N 25, N 50 and B+S).
