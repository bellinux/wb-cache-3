The {{purpose of this study is}} to come up with an overview of these issues to assist all practitioners in this field to formulate potentially effective and sustainable project plans. From the literature review it was concluded that the issues can be grouped in three categories: the vision of the <b>receiving</b> <b>organisation</b> and issues internal and external to this organisation. It appeared that particularly the learning culture and the abilities of management to change the organisation and lead the staff are very important issues that must be properly sorted out before the project can start. From the field research it appeared that weaknesses in the <b>receiving</b> <b>organisation</b> with regards to the issues that came out of the literature review had indeed a negative effect on the results of the researched project. One of the most important conclusions of the research is that the identification and formulation phase should not be underestimated and that the success of the project depends largely on a proper and thorough approach in this stage. The most attention must be paid to all circumstances surrounding the actual technical capacity that will be developed. Main recommendation for the target group of this research is therefore to take enough time to gather information in this phase and adapt the project to the abilities of the <b>receiving</b> <b>organisation</b> which should become clear as a result of this information. It might even be necessary to have a project to strengthen these abilities preceding the actual Capacity Development interventio...|$|E
40|$|Country-level {{longitudinal}} data at three-year intervals over 1990 - 2004 {{are used to}} analyze the factors affecting emigration of physicians from Sub-Saharan countries and the effects of this medical brain drain on life expectancy and number of deaths due to AIDS. Data are compiled on emigrating African physicians from 16 <b>receiving</b> <b>Organisation</b> for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. A comprehensive {{longitudinal data}}base is developed by merging the medical brain drain variables with recent data on HIV prevalence rates, public health expenditures, physicians' wages, and economic and demographic variables. A triangular system of equations is estimated in a random effects framework using five time observations for medical brain drain rates, life expectancy, and number of deaths due to AIDS, taking into account the interdependence of these variables. Lower wages and higher HIV prevalence rates are strongly associated with the brain drain of physicians from Sub-Saharan African to OECD countries. In countries in which the HIV prevalence rate exceeds 3 percent, a doubling of the medical brain drain rate is associated with a 20 percent increase in adult deaths from AIDS; medical brain drain does not appear to affect life expectancy. These findings underscore the need to improve economic conditions for physicians in order to retain physicians in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as antiretroviral treatment becomes more widely available...|$|E
40|$|When an {{organisation}} {{is looking}} for a computer-based system to support part of their operation {{it is not uncommon for}} them to consider purchasing an application software that is already in use in an organisation similar to itself. Those responsible for the system 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition are considerably influenced by any advice they receive on experiences with the proposed new system from those who have successfully used the application. Such communication between organisations may only occur at management level so that actual end-users are rarely involved. Issues of system usability are therefore assumed to be unproblematic, as the system has been used in a comparable real world situation. Even less of a consideration is whether the context of use in the <b>receiving</b> <b>organisation</b> is similar to those where the system is currently being used so that systems implementation can take place with ease. The study presented in this thesis confirms the importance of critical contextual factors that affect the capability of people in an organisation and the performance of the whole organisation when a complex new system is implemented. It also demonstrates the relationships between contextual factors and the importance of these factors. The research has used a grounded theory approach to reveal details within complex phenomena in an organisation when a substantial new system was implemented. This approach has been shown to be eminently suitable for the study which involved a new timetabling system in an educational institution. Furthermore, Activity Theory was seen as an appropriate framework to display and interpret large amounts of inter-related data in a holistic and comprehendible way. The study revealed three critical issues: Knowledge Transfer, System Capability, and Organisational Context that appeared to be related to the problems of implementing the new information system in the organisation. These three issues are the main categories emerging from the data analysis leading into the effect of 2 ̆ 7 influencing capability and thereby organisational performance 2 ̆ 7 which was designated as the core category. From a holistic view, the Activity Theory interpretation revealed that the dominant activities of the organisation in the case, teaching and learning were distorted by the new system as people in the organisation put more effort on getting the system to work rather than doing their own job. This research adds to the understanding of a common situation where management have an over simplified view of organisational work and assume that implementing a new computer based system can quite easily improve the performance of the organisation. However the nature and the processes of most work are more complicated than they realise so that it is rarely simple to implement a system to support a job that is inherently complex. Traditional organisations, which rely on a 2 ̆ 7 command and control 2 ̆ 7 approach to management, do not handle complexity well thereby restricting the ability of staff to use their knowledge of the real conditions to adapt their work to suit changing organisational systems...|$|E

40|$|Can a ‘Theory of Change’ {{really be}} an honest, {{accurate}} and transparent reflection {{of how a}} development intervention may lead to change? Theories of Change are often required by donors in international development.

Yet the very fact that Theories of Change are demanded may create certain tensions and pressures which contradict the purpose of using them. The grand narratives found within Theories of Change (along with other donor-facing documents) may act as ‘mobilising metaphors’, telling us more about how the relationship between aid donors and <b>receiving</b> <b>organisations</b> functions than how a programme operates and/or has wider impacts...|$|R
