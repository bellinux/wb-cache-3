40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{tremendous}} development of full-suspended mountain bikes, especially for downhill and free-ride market. These mountain bikes strongly rely {{on the ability of}} the rear suspension shock absorber to manage extremely large forces and wheel travel. Wheel travel is generally achieved through the geometry of the suspension linkage; whereby forces are counterbalanced by the shock hydraulic and spring. The Sports Engineering Research Group (SERG) at the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, RMIT University has investigated the dynamic characteristics of different rear linkages suspension geometry. The kinematic analysis has been performed using different programs. A customised Matlab&#x 2122; code has been developed to analyse in detail the kinematic of the linkages, a MSC. Adams&#x 2122; simulation has been conducted to better understand the kinematic and kinetic behaviour. After-market shock absorbers {{are becoming more and more}} popular but how their performance is influenced by the <b>rear</b> <b>linkage</b> geometries is often underestimated or not even considered. The results of this research aim to investigate and compare the dynamic characteristics of <b>rear</b> <b>linkage</b> of modern full-suspended mountain bikes...|$|E
40|$|Suspension is a {{necessary}} system for solar cars because it protects the frame and other on-board components from large jolts encountered along highways. If the suspension is too soft, energy is wasted by absorbing the motion of a car as it travels over bumps. For increased efficiency, most solar cars use a suspension that is stiffer than normal. For this project, the solar car has two front wheels and one rear wheel. The front wheels provide turning, so the front suspension needs to let the wheels turn. The suspension also allows the wheels to {{move up and down}} as the car runs over bumps. The type of front suspension for this project is a double wishbone system. It has a pair of an A-frames, one above the other, mounted to {{the top and bottom of}} the wheel hub. A separate spring until then sits between either the hub itself or one of the wishbones and the body to control the wheel movement. Lastly, this car uses a trailing arm on rear suspension. This kind of suspension has only one link (arm) on each side which puts greater structural requirements on it. Strong bending forces in all directions (especially during cornering) must be withstood by this suspension and as well as breaking, camber and steer torques. Nevertheless trailing arm suspension has been used in many vehicles as a <b>rear</b> <b>linkage,</b> because it requires little space to be accommodate...|$|E

50|$|Engine {{performance}} {{began to}} decrease with EPA restrictions on tailpipe emissions and grams per mile emissions requirements, forcing gear ratios to taller and taller ratios, dropping to {{as low as}} 2.41:1. A new common frame/suspension design {{was introduced in the}} latest generation Sixty Special which was also used in other GM full size cars. While the other GM divisions used a front-steer setup (steering linkage in front of the engine crossmember), all Cadillac RWDs retained the 1961-vintage front suspension (<b>rear</b> steering <b>linkage,</b> eccentric cams in the steering knuckle in lieu of shims, strut rods attached to the framerails for caster adjustment). Rear suspensions were now driven by the Pontiac-designed -inch ring-gear 10-bolt Salisbury live axle. A new trailer towing package was added allowing larger trailer loads to be pulled. Coupled with heavy duty cooling, 3.23 gearing, high output 80 amp large frame alternator and heavy-duty THM400 transmission, the long wheelbase was ideal to pull trailers weighing up to 7,000 lb (3,200 kg).|$|R
40|$|Variable camber {{actuator}} assemblies {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag performance is maximized for slotted flap wings. Lift is improved over {{a broader range of}} cruising speeds by varying wing camber with rotational flap movements that do not introduce wing slots and induced drag. Forward flaps are secured to forward flange links which extended from, and are a part of forward flap linkage assemblies. The forward flaps rotate about flap pivots with their rotational displacement controlled by variable camber actuator assemblies located between the forward flaps and the forward flange links. Rear flaps are held relative to the forward flaps by <b>rear</b> flap <b>linkage</b> assemblies which may act independently from the forward flap linkage assemblies and the variable camber actuator assemblies. Wing camber is varied by rotating the flaps with the variable camber actuator assemblies while the flaps are in a deployed or tucked position. Rotating the flaps in a tucked position does not introduce significant wing surface discontinuities, and reduces aircraft fuel consumption on most flight profiles...|$|R
50|$|The JS19 was {{designed}} by Michel Beaujon under the technical direction of Jean-Pierre Jabouille, who had retired as a driver from Formula One the previous year. It was provided with a Matra MS81 V-12 badged as a Talbot. The chassis had side pods which enclosed the <b>rear</b> suspension <b>linkage,</b> which minimised disruption to the air flow, and had skirts running their full length for maximum ground-effect. However, when introduced for its first race, the 1982 Monaco Grand Prix, the team was forced by race officials to remove {{a portion of the}} skirts with a resulting loss of downforce that affected the cars' performance. The team used the JS17B, with which it had started the first five races of the season, for the following races in the United States and Canada while the aerodynamics of the JS19 were reworked in wind tunnel testing. A single JS19 was present for the Dutch and British races while the other was in the wind tunnel. Two cars were present from the French Grand Prix onwards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interesting}} {{rear suspension}} permits independent action of each wheel. Vertical {{movements of the}} wheels are controlled by two links, in which the upper link doubles as the axle shaft; and a rod, rubber bushed on each end as the lower. A third link runs from each rear wheel hub forward to the frame to transmit driving and braking thrust. Variable rate coil springs unitized with direct, double-acting shock absorbers are diagonally mounted at each rear wheel. Adjustment provisions in the <b>rear</b> suspension <b>linkage</b> permit variations in camber and toe-in to facilitate engineering studies. Front suspension is independent with high roll center geometry, and also utilizes unitized variable rate coil springs and shock absorbers as in the rear suspension. An 11/16" [...] stabilizer bar interconnects the front wheels. The independent rear suspension design became {{the basis of the}} 1963 Corvette Sting Ray suspension. So that weight distribution during tests shall vary little if any, two fuel cells of rubber construction and total capacity of 20 gallons, are located {{on either side of the}} [...] "CERV-I" [...] at approximately the fore and aft location of the center of gravity. Thus, the amount of fuel in the tanks at any given moment will have virtually no effect on weight distribution.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of the Watt's <b>linkage</b> <b>rear</b> suspension came first. This {{was followed by the}} front anti-dive modifications. The {{development of}} the anti-dive geometry was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC’s schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang’s 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the unibody on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building performance parts for Ford.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to test this new thinner machine on {{apricots}} fruitlets, identifying the suitable working speed that best combine the most thinning effect in absence of visible damage of the branches and the remaining fruits. The machine is composed by a rotor equipped with radial rods on a central axe mounted in a <b>rear</b> tree point <b>linkage</b> of a tractor. Trials were carried out in March-May 2016 in an apricot orchard sited in Cesena (FC). The experimental was designed to compared mechanical thinning at different working speed (1. 11 and 0. 83 m/s) and hand thinning on green fruits (2 ≤ Ø ≤ 2. 5 cm). The thinning effect was evaluated counting fruits remained from 40 branches randomized choice in upper and down part of four plants replicates. After the mechanical thinning, it was performed a manual thinning of finishing, aimed to eliminate the fruits too close together on the branch and, in general, ensure a uniform fruit set on the tree. Time required for thinning was measured in the trees mechanical thinned and compared with those one thinned only Handily (control).

From 2011 on the 300s got 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The 2012s got improvements to the starter, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools. The 2013s got a diaphragm spring clutch, a stronger starter and lighter battery. In 2013, the Husaberg became the Husqvarna TE300 and was given the <b>linkage</b> <b>rear</b> suspension.

All the 2015 models have the new White Power 4CS forks with revised damping, the ability to make adjustments on the fly and a smaller front axle. The triple clamps have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric starter has different gearing to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{operators}} run a {{very high}} risk of exposure to mechanical vibration. To improve comfort, many different devices have recently been fitted to agricultural self-propelled machinery, especially on the most modern high-powered wheeled tractors. In contrast, agricultural tracklaying tractors are not equipped with a suspended cab floor and frequently poor or no seat suspension is fitted. Consequently, the levels of vibration measured in the driving seat of tracklaying tractors often widely exceed the limit stipulated by official national standards. The manufacturers of tracklaying tractors are currently trying to improve the level of comfort at the driver’s place by reducing both the production and the transmission of vibration. The vibration levels at the driving seat {{of a group of}} tracklaying tractors produced by some leading Italian manufacturers were so measured. The models examined in the study differed in having either 5 - or 6 -roller track support, different types and stiffness of seat suspension, and in {{whether or not they were}} coupled to an implement. The type of seat suspension, and above all its correct adjustment, dramatically influenced the level of vibration, as did the increase in the number of track rollers. In contrast, whether or not the tractor was coupled to an implement at the <b>rear</b> 3 -point <b>linkage</b> did not make any significant change to the vibration comfort during transport. Also on the best modern trackalying tractor models, vibration levels frequently exceed stipulated limits, so that a further reduction is urgently required. Possible solutions that could be developed may involve the universal adoption of rubber tracks and/or the fitting of silent blocks on the cab floor and suspension devices on one or both axles...|$|R
