40|$|The <b>recording</b> <b>industry</b> {{has been}} a major focus of {{interest}} for cultural commentators throughout the twenty-first century. As the first major content industry to have its production and distribution patterns radically disturbed by the internet, the <b>recording</b> <b>industry’s</b> content, attitudes and practices have regularly been under the microscope. Much of this discussion, however, is dominated by US and UK perspectives and assumes the ‘the recording industry’ to be a relatively static, homogeneous, entity. This book attempts to offer a broader, less Anglocentric and more dynamic understanding of the <b>recording</b> <b>industry.</b> It starting premise is the idea that the <b>recording</b> <b>industry</b> is not one thing but is, rather, a series of <b>recording</b> <b>industries,</b> locally organised and locally focused, both structured by and structuring the international industry. Seven detailed case studies of different national <b>recording</b> <b>industries</b> illustrate this fact, each of them specifically chosen to provide a distinctive insight into the workings of the <b>recording</b> <b>industry.</b> The expert contributions to this book provide the reader with a sense of the history, structure and contemporary dynamics of the <b>recording</b> <b>industry</b> in these specific territories, and counteract the Anglo-American bias of coverage of the music <b>industry.</b> The International <b>Recording</b> <b>Industries</b> will be valuable to students and scholars of sociology, cultural studies, media studies, cultural economics and popular music studies...|$|R
