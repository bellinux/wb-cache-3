New requirement in NASA-Battery Safety Requirements document: JSC 20793 Rev C 5. 1. 5. 1 Requirements - Thermal Runaway Propagation a. For battery designs greater than a 80 -Wh energy employing high specific energy cells (greater than 80 watt-hours/kg, for example, lithium-ion chemistries) with catastrophic failure modes, the battery shall be evaluated to ascertain the severity of a worst-case single-cell thermal <b>runaway</b> <b>event</b> and the propensity of the design to demonstrate cell-to-cell propagation in the intended application and environment. NASA has traditionally addressed the threat of thermal runaway incidents in its battery deployments through comprehensive prevention protocols. This prevention-centered approach has included extensive screening for manufacturing defects, as well as robust battery management controls that prevent abuse-induced runaway {{even in the face}} of multiple system failures. This focused strategy has made the likelihood of occurrence of such an event highly improbable. b. The evaluation shall include all necessary analysis and test to quantify the severity (consequence) of the event in the intended application and environment as well as to identify design modifications to the battery or the system that could appreciably reduce that severity. In addition to prevention protocols, programs developing battery designs with catastrophic failure modes should take the steps necessary to assess the severity of a possible thermal <b>runaway</b> <b>event.</b> Programs should assess whether there are reasonable design changes that could appreciably affect the severity of the outcome. Evaluation should include environmental effects to surrounding hardware (i. e., temperature, pressure, shock), contamination effects due to any expelled contaminates, and venting propulsive effects when venting overboard...|$|E

In fact, for such processes, a thermal <b>runaway</b> <b>event</b> may be triggered whenever {{the rate of heat}} removal becomes lower than the rate of heat production. Such a dangerous phenomenon consists in an uncontrolled reactor temperature increase that, occurring in practically adiabatic conditions, can trigger secondary undesired exothermic reactions or, worse, decompositions of the whole reacting mixture with consequent reactor pressurization due to uncontrollable gases formation. In this work, a dedicated software has been developed and used to simulate a cooling system breakdown in an industrial SBR where the nitration of 4 -Chlorobenzotrifluoride is carried out. The mathematical model is able to simulate both reactor temperature and pressure vs. time profiles thanks to a complete description of both the desired reaction and the unwanted reacting mixture decomposition kinetics.

In this study, externally applied compression has been employed to prevent lithium ion battery failure during such events. Commercially available cells with Nickel Cobalt Manganese (NCM) cathodes were exposed to temperatures at 80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C for 10 h, and electrochemically characterised before and after heating. The electrode stack structures were also examined using x-ray computed tomography (CT), and post-mortems were conducted to examine the electrode stack structure and surface changes. The results show that compression reduces capacity loss by − 0. 07 %, 4. 95 % and 13. 10 % respectively, measured immediately after the thermal testing. The uncompressed cells at 80 °C showed no swelling, whilst 90 °C and 100 °C showed significant swelling.

40|$|Evidence for shocks in nova {{outflows}} include (1) multiple velocity {{components in}} the optical spectra; (2) keV X-ray emission weeks to months after the outburst; (3) early radio flare on timescales of months, in excess of that predicted from the freely expanding photo-ionized gas; and (4) ~ GeV gamma-rays. We present a 1 D model for the shock interaction between the fast nova outflow and a dense external shell (DES) and its associated thermal X-ray, optical, and radio emission. The forward shock is radiative initially when the density of shocked gas is highest, at which times radio emission originates from the dense cooling layer immediately downstream of the shock. The radio light curve is characterized by sharper rises to maximum and later peak times at progressively lower frequencies, with a peak brightness temperature that is approximately independent of frequency. We apply our model to the recent gamma-ray classical nova V 1324 Sco, obtaining an adequate fit to the early radio maximum for reasonable assumptions about the fast nova outflow and assuming the DES possesses a velocity ~ 1 e 3 km/s and mass ~ 2 e- 4 M_sun; the former {{is consistent with the}} velocities of narrow line absorption systems observed previously in nova spectra, while the total ejecta mass of the DES and fast outflow is consistent with that inferred independently by modeling the late radio peak. Rapid evolution of the early radio light curves require the DES possess a steep outer density profile, which may indicate that the onset of mass loss from the white dwarf was rapid, providing indirect evidence that the DES was expelled by the thermonuclear <b>runaway</b> <b>event.</b> Reprocessed X-rays from the shock absorbed by the DES at early times may contribute significantly to the optical/UV emission, which we speculate is responsible for the previously unexplained `plateaus' and secondary maxima in nova optical light curves.

In order to explain these NWP and climate modeling issues, a few researchers performed idealized single column and large-eddy simulations. They documented that these idealized simulations crashed (without much warning) when substantial amounts of downward (negative) sensible heat flux are prescribed as lower surface boundary conditions. Since these crashing simulations were usually accompanied by substantial temperature drop, these simulations were identified as <b>runaway</b> cooling <b>events.</b> In this presentation, we demonstrate that the previously reported crashing events in idealized simulations are not related to the runaway cooling problem experienced by the atmospheric models.

Microemulsions were determined to be forming in the mixed-acid nitration system and that additional functional groups on the aromatic ring could affect the microemulsion formation within the system, usually adversely. However, the formation of three phases including a middle phase microemulsion ? a key point of interest to this work with regard to operability of the process ? did not occur in compositional ranges commonly seen and expected in industry. Additionally, the type-III and type-IV microemulsions which where the central focus of this work all collapsed at temperatures of around 30 ?C, well below the 60 - 100 ?C expected of continuous industrial nitration processes. It was determined that existing models in literature for prediction microemulsions are ill suited to describe the behavior of this system. However, experimental results showing that this behavior poses no threat to the process show that developing a new model for systems such as this one is of little practical value...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{and safety of}} lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are dependent on interfacial processes at {{the positive and negative}} electrodes. For example, the surface layers that form on cathodes and anodes are known to affect the kinetics and capacity of LIBs. Interfacial reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes are also known to initiate electrolyte combustion during thermal <b>runaway</b> <b>events</b> that compromise battery safety. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) are thin film deposition techniques based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. ALD and MLD can deposit ultrathin and conformal films on high aspect ratio and porous substrates such as composite particulate electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. The effects of electrode surface modification via ALD and MLD are studied using a variety of techniques. It was found that sub-nm thick coatings of Al 2 O 3 deposited via ALD have beneficial effects on the stability of LIB anodes and cathodes. These same Al 2 O 3 ALD films were found to improve the safety of graphite based anodes through prevention of exothermic solid electrolyte interface (SEI) degradation at elevated temperatures. Ultrathin and conformal metal alkoxide polymer films known as “metalcones” were grown utilizing MLD techniques with trimethylaluminum (TMA) or titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) and organic diols or triols, such as ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (GL) or hydroquinone (HQ), as the reactants. Pyrolysis of these metalcone films under inert gas conditions {{led to the development of}} conductive metal oxide/carbon composites. The composites were found to contain sp 2 carbon using micro-Raman spectroscopy in the pyrolyzed films with pyrolysis temperatures ≥ 600 °C. Four point probe measurements demonstrated that the graphitic sp 2 carbon domains in the metalcone films grown using GL and HQ led to significant conductivity. The pyrolysis of conformal MLD films to obtain conductive metal oxide/carbon composite films is presented as a method for enabling non-conductive, but possibly electrochemically active materials, to be used for electrochemical applications...|$|R
40|$|Plasma/material {{interactions}} (PMI) during {{four types}} of plasma transient/instabilities is a critical issue for magnetic fusion. Key concerns are: 1) Plasma Facing Component (PFC) erosion lifetime, structural integrity, and plasma contamination. The major events for surface and structural response to plasma transients are Edge Localized Modes (ELM’s), disruptions, Vertical Displacement <b>Events</b> (VDE’s), and <b>runaway</b> electrons. The US is the world leader in PMI transient/surface-interaction modeling with a 20 + year history in the US fusion program incorporating theory/modeling, computer code development, and experimental validation. Analysis has been made for numerous devices such as DIII-D ITER, and plasma guns, laser and z-pinch machines, and powerful electron beams. In spite of this effort, there are very serious gaps in modeling, analysis, and understanding the PFC transient response in existing machines, ITER, and future DEMO machines. Such understanding is critically needed for ITER and DEMO; for example {{it is not clear}} whether future machines will survive the projected ELMs frequency, one major disruption, one VDE, or one <b>runaway</b> electron <b>event.</b> This thrust proposes an integrated effort to comprehensively answer these questions and predict/analyze all possible mitigation methods and innovative plasma facing component designs...|$|R
5000|$|Earth's climate has swung {{repeatedly}} between warm {{periods and}} ice ages during its history. In {{the current climate}} the gain of the positive feedback effect from increased atmospheric water vapor, as well as Earth being {{too far away from}} the Sun at its current luminosity for such to occur is well below that which is required to boil away the oceans. Climate scientist John Houghton has written that [...] "there is no possibility of Venus's runaway greenhouse conditions occurring on the Earth". However, climatologist James Hansen disagrees. In his Storms of My Grandchildren he says that burning coal and mining shale oil will result in runaway greenhouse on Earth. A re-evaluation in 2013 of the effect of water vapor in the climate models showed that James Hansen's outcome might be possible, but requires ten times the amount of CO2 we could release from burning all the oil, coal, and natural gas in Earth's crust. [...] Further, Benton and Twitchett have a different definition of a <b>runaway</b> greenhouse; <b>events</b> meeting this definition have been suggested as a cause for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the great dying.|$|R
40|$|We present {{numerical}} simulations in 3 D {{settings where}} coronal rain phenomena {{take place in}} a magnetic configuration of a quadrupolar arcade system. Our simulation is a magnetohydrodynamic simulation including anisotropic thermal conduction, optically thin radiative losses, and parametrised heating as main thermodynamical features to construct a realistic arcade configuration from chromospheric to coronal heights. The plasma evaporation from chromospheric and transition region heights eventually causes localised <b>runaway</b> condensation <b>events</b> and we witness the formation of plasma blobs due to thermal instability, that evolve dynamically in the heated arcade part and move gradually downwards due to interchange type dynamics. Unlike earlier 2. 5 D simulations, in this case there is no large scale prominence formation observed, but a continuous coronal rain develops which shows clear indications of Rayleigh-Taylor or interchange instability, that causes the denser plasma located above the transition region to fall down, as the system moves towards a more stable state. Linear stability analysis is used in the non-linear regime for gaining insight and giving a prediction of the system's evolution. After the plasma blobs descend through interchange, they follow the magnetic field topology more closely in the lower coronal regions, where they are guided by the magnetic dips.
