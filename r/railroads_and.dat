5|$|The new {{commissioner}} {{spent the}} second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the <b>railroads,</b> <b>and</b> the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but {{to strike a balance between}} the desires of <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> those of shippers.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed business on the Old Bay Line, World War I doubled freight and passenger business {{on the line to}} the busy ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) to take charge of <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E

5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{industries}} in the Guild's Lake area was a sawmill built in the 1880s. Although {{large parts of the}} land remained undeveloped until the early 20thcentury, lumber mills, grain storage structures, <b>railroads,</b> <b>and</b> docks appeared along the waterfront. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important switching yard for trains.|$|E
5|$|Part of the state's {{tradition}} of cowboys {{is derived from}} the massive cattle drives which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to drive livestock to <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> markets in Kansas, for shipment to the East. Towns along the way, such as Baxter Springs, the first cow town in Kansas, developed to handle the seasonal workers {{and tens of thousands of}} head of cattle being driven.|$|E

5|$|The Commission {{spent much}} of 1907 {{investigating}} the <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman, holding hearings across the country. In October, Lane determined that the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of Harriman's lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the U.S. state of Minnesota is shaped by its {{original}} Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, {{and the emergence of}} industries made possible by the state's natural resources. Minnesota achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through <b>railroads,</b> <b>and</b> iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.|$|E
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E

5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, <b>railroads,</b> <b>and</b> petroleum storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|George Sears Greene (May 6, 1801 – January 28, 1899) was a civil {{engineer}} and a Union general during the American Civil War. He {{was part of the}} Greene family of Rhode Island, which had a record of distinguished military service to the United States. He first served in the Army from 1823 to 1836 after graduating second from his class at West Point. As a civilian, he was a founder of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects and was responsible for numerous <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> aqueduct construction projects in the northeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Hays left GTR for a {{short time}} to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but {{returned}} to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary <b>railroads,</b> <b>and</b> steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – {{sometimes in the}} form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E
5|$|<b>Railroads</b> <b>and</b> {{roads in}} the Sammamish River and Snoqualmie River valleys, where modern-day SR202 runs, were built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The early roads were {{incorporated}} into the Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s and became a state highway in 1925. SR202 was established in 1964 {{as part of a}} new state highway system, running from Woodinville to Monroe; SR522 was designated to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, continuing west to Seattle. By 1970, the designations were reversed, with SR202 moved to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, and SR522 moved to the Bothell–Monroe highway.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War forever altered Indiana's economy. Despite hardships {{during the}} war, Indiana's {{economic}} situation improved. Farmers received {{higher prices for}} their agricultural products, <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> commercial businesses thrived in the state's cities and towns, and manpower shortages gave laborers more bargaining power. The war also helped establish a national banking system to replace state-chartered banking institutions; by 1862 there were thirty-one national banks in the state. Wartime prosperity was particularly evident in Indianapolis, whose population more than doubled during the war, reaching 45,000 {{at the end of}} 1864.|$|E

Progressives sought to reform corrupt political practices of the ruling Martin machine and to regulate <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> big corporations. Martin delegates agreed to restrict suffrage of African-Americans and illiterate whites, and a State Corporation Commission was established. When the railroads challenged the State Corporation Commission's constitutionality on the grounds it violated separation of powers, the commission was upheld in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the Chinese Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and {{calisthenics}} they practiced. It began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist, peasant-based movement that attacked foreigners who were building <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> violating Feng shui. Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city. The Qing ordered foreign diplomats and personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the legation quarter of Beijing.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of <b>railroads</b> <b>and</b> the evolution of refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E
