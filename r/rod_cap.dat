50|$|The {{original}} {{connecting rod}} beam (forging ID C9OE-A) featured drilled oil squirt bosses to lubricate the piston pin and cylinder bore and rectangular-head rod bolts mounted on broached shoulders. A number of fatigue failures {{were attributed to}} the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of 'football head' bolts. In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The <b>rod</b> <b>cap</b> forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A).

40|$|In Salmonella, the rod {{substructure}} of the flagellum is a periplasmic driveshaft {{that couples}} the torque {{generated by the}} basal body motor to the extracellular hook and filament. The rod subunits self-assemble, spanning the periplasmic space and stopping at the outer membrane when amature length of 22 nm is reached. Assembly of the extracellular hook and filament follow rod completion. Hook initiation requires that a pore forms in the outer membrane and that the rod-capping protein, FlgJ, dislodges {{from the tip of}} the distal rod and is replaced with the hook-capping protein, FlgD. Approximately 26 FlgH subunits form the L-ring around the distal rod that creates the pore through which the growing flagellumwill elongate from the cell body. The function of the L-ring in the mature flagellum is also thought to act as a bushing for the rotating rod. Work presented here dem-onstrates that, in addition to outer membrane pore formation, L-ring formation catalyzes the removal of the FlgJ <b>rod</b> <b>cap.</b> <b>Rod</b> <b>cap</b> removal allows the hook cap to assemble at the rod tip and results in the transition from rod completion in the periplasm to extracellular hook polymerization. By coupling the rod-to-hook switch to outer membrane penetration, FlgH ensures that hook and filament polymerization is initiated at the appropriate spatial and temporal point in flagellar biosynthesis. The bacterial flagellum exemplifies nanoscale engineering thatmicrobes have been perfecting over billions of years (1). This supramolecular structure is composed of approximately 25 dis-tinct protein subunits and self-assembles to final lengths of up to 20 m, several times the length of the cell itself (2).

40|$|Upon {{completion}} of the flagellar hook-basal body (HBB) structure, the flagellar type III secretion system switches from secreting rod/hook-type to filament-type substrates. The secretion specificity switch {{has been reported to}} occur prematurely (prior to HBB completion) in flk-null mutants (P. Aldridge, J. E. Karlinsey, E. Becker, F. F. Chevance, and K. T. Hughes, Mol. Microbiol. 60 : 630 - 643, 2006) and in distal rod gene gain-of-function mutants (flgG* mutants) that produce filamentous rod structures (F. F. Chevance, N. Takahashi, J. E. Karlinsey, J. Gnerer, T. Hirano, R. Samudrala, S. Aizawa, and K. T. Hughes, Genes Dev. 21 : 2326 - 2335, 2007). A fusion of β-lactamase (Bla) to the C terminus of the filament-type secretion substrate FlgM was used to select for mutants that would secrete FlgM-Bla into the periplasmic space and show ampicillin resistance (Apr). Apr resulted from null mutations in the flhE gene, C-terminal truncation mutations in the flhA gene, null and dominant mutations in the flk gene, and flgG* mutations. All mutant classes required the hook length control protein (FliK) and the <b>rod</b> <b>cap</b> protein (FlgJ) for the secretion specificity switch to occur. However, neither the hook (FlgE) nor the hook cap (FlgD) protein was required for premature FlgM-Bla secretion in the flgG* and flk mutant strains, but it was in the flhE mutants. Unexpectedly, when deletions of either flgE or flgD were introduced into flgG* mutant strains, filaments were able to grow directly on the filamentous rod structures...|$|E

5000|$|Until the mid-1950s, poured Babbitt {{bearings}} {{were common}} in automotive applications. The Babbitt was {{poured into the}} block or caps using a form. Tin-based Babbitts were used as they could {{stand up to the}} impact loads found on the connecting rods and crankshaft. The poured Babbitt bearings were kept thin.

Ford was known to use two [...]002" [...] on each cap and Babbitt that was 86% tin, 7% copper, 7% antimony (see the KRW catalogs for the Model T). Steel shims were used as the brass shims used today tend to compress over time contributing to shorter bearing life. The poured Babbitt bearings commonly get over 50,000 miles of use before needing replacement.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{mechanism}} for opening a locally resonant band gap {{in a thin}} elastic plate is investigated. Two previously suggested structures, which are constructed by periodically drilling holes on elastic plate and then filling them with the rubber-coated masses, or just by periodically stubbing the rubber <b>rods</b> with mass <b>cap</b> on the plate, are revisited. We find that, because of the partial band gaps for in-plane and out-of-plane plate modes cannot be appropriately overlapped, the full band gaps in both of the structures are generally narrow. The reason for this phenomenon {{is based on the}} selective coupling between the different resonant patterns of the resonant units and the in-plane and out-of-plane plate modes. Based on the understanding, a new structure with the three-layered spherical resonant units is proposed. Numerical results show that, making use of such kind of resonant units, a large sub-wavelength full band gap can be opened...|$|R

The morphological features, phase structure, and infrared characteristics were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Results revealed that silica significantly changes the hexagonal morphology of bare ZnO rod to “pointed tips” when using low initial OH− precursor concentration. Increasing OH− ion concentration resulted in a “flower-like” formation of ZnO-SiO 2 and a remarkable change from “pointed tips” to “hemispherical tips” at the top surface of the <b>rods.</b> The surface <b>capping</b> of SiO 2 to ZnO leads {{to the formation of}} these “hemispherical tips. ” The infrared spectroscopic analysis showed the characteristics peaks of ZnO and SiO 2 as well as the Si-O-Zn band which confirms the formation of ZnO-SiO 2.

50|$|The SRT-4 {{used the}} same basic engine block as the {{naturally}} aspirated 2003+ 2.4L, and {{was different from the}} years previous used in the naturally aspirated Chrysler 2.4L mid-size cars such as the PT Cruiser and four-door Stratus. The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting <b>rods</b> with cracked <b>caps</b> and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located {{on the right side}} of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram <b>rod</b> and percussion <b>cap</b> which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|R
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} {{was used}} to measure the thickness of air-dried, collapsed murein sacculi from Escherichia coli K- 12 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. Air-dried sacculi from E. coli had a thickness of 3. 0 nm, whereas those from P. aeruginosa were 1. 5 nm thick. When rehydrated, the sacculi of both bacteria swelled to double their anhydrous thickness. Computer simulation of a section of a model single-layer peptidoglycan network in an aqueous solution with a Debye shielding length of 0. 3 nm gave a mass distribution full width at half height of 2. 4 nm, in essential agreement with these results. When E. coli sacculi were suspended over a narrow groove that had been etched into a silicon surface and the tip of the atomic force microscope used to depress and stretch the peptidoglycan, an elastic modulus of 2. 5 × 107 N/m 2 was determined for hydrated sacculi; they were perfectly elastic, springing back to their original position when the tip was removed. Dried sacculi were more rigid with a modulus of 3 × 108 to 4 × 108 N/m 2 and at times could be broken by the atomic force microscope tip. Sacculi aligned over the groove with their long axis at right angles to the channel axis were more deformable than those with their long axis parallel to the groove axis, as would be expected if the peptidoglycan strands in the sacculus were oriented at right angles to the long cell axis of this gram-negative <b>rod.</b> Polar <b>caps</b> were not found to be more rigid structures but collapsed to the same thickness as the cylindrical portions of the sacculi. The elasticity of intact E. coli sacculi is such that, if the peptidoglycan strands are aligned in unison, the interstrand spacing should increase by 12 % with every 1 atm increase in (turgor) pressure. Assuming an unstressed hydrated interstrand spacing of 1. 3 nm (R. E. Burge, A. G. Fowler, and D. A. Reaveley, J. Mol. Biol. 117 : 927 – 953, 1977) and an internal turgor pressure of 3 to 5 atm (or 304 to 507 kPa) (A. L. Koch, Adv. Microbial Physiol. 24 : 301 – 366, 1983), the natural interstrand spacing in cells would be 1. 6 to 2. 0 nm. Clearly, if large macromolecules of a diameter greater than these spacings are secreted through this layer, the local ordering of the peptidoglycan must somehow be disrupted...|$|R
