The Bochum <b>Radioastronomical</b> <b>Observatory</b> in the West Germany reported that it had received signals different from those that used to come from Soviet satellites. The Judica Cordiglia brothers also picked up on these signs, and claimed to have heard an SOS message in Morse code. Based on the Doppler effect, they deduced that the spacecraft was moving further away from Earth, rather than orbiting. [...] "Two days later, once again, the Soviet Union announced that it has put a 7.5-ton spacecraft into orbit, {{and that it has}} disintegrated. Strange coincidence," [...] noted Achille in the TV documentary [...] "I pirati dello spazio" [...] (The Space Pirates), made in 2007. Moscow has always denied that it was a manned flight. The historical flight of Gagarin is also in the documents of the two brothers. In the film, they show a recording made the morning of April 12, 1961, which they claimed to be conversations between the cosmonaut and mission control.|$|E
