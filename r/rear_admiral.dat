5|$|By May 1878, {{all three}} Preussen-class ships {{were ready for}} the annual summer {{maneuvers}} of the armored squadron. The three ships were joined by the large armored frigate , and operated {{under the command of}} <b>Rear</b> <b>Admiral</b> Batsch.

While steaming in the English Channel on 31 May, König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of between 269 and 276 men. Her loss spurred a series of investigations into the circumstances of the collision, which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of both <b>Rear</b> <b>Admiral</b> Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, and Count Alexander von Monts, the captain of Grosser Kurfürst.
