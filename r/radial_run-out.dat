5000|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>run-out</b> {{is caused}} by the tool or {{component}} being rotated off centre, i.e. the tool or component axis does not correspond with the main axis. <b>Radial</b> <b>run-out</b> will measure the same all along the main axis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>run-out</b> is {{the result}} of a {{rotating}} component running off centre, such as a ball bearing with an offset centre. This means that the rotating tool or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis. In general, cutting tools are more tolerant of <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> since the edges are parallel to the line of cutting tending to keep the tool tip aligned. However, a rotating shaft may be less tolerant of <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> since the centre of gravity is displaced by the amount of run-out.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{irregular}} run-out is {{the result}} of worn or rough bearings which can manifest itself as either axial or <b>radial</b> <b>run-out.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>run-out,</b> Lateral run-out, Conicity, and Bulge {{measurements}} are also {{performed on the}} tire uniformity machine. There are several generations of measurement technologies in use. These include Contact Stylus, Capacitive Sensors, Fixed-Point Laser Sensors, and Sheet-of-Light Laser Sensors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>run-out</b> (RRO) {{describes}} the deviation of the tire’s roundness from a perfect circle. RRO {{can be expressed}} as the peak-to-peak value as well as harmonic values. RRO imparts an excitation into the vehicle {{in a manner similar}} to radial force variation. RRO is most often measured near the tire’s centerline, although some tire makers have adopted measurement of RRO at three positions: left shoulder, center, and right shoulder.|$|E
50|$|Fixed-Point Laser Sensors were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the above methods. Lasers combine the narrow-track area-of-interest with a large stand off distance from the tire. In order to cover a larger area-of-interest, mechanical positioning systems have been employed to take readings at multiple positions in the sidewall. Fixed-Point Laser sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.|$|E
50|$|Radial and Lateral Force Variation can {{be reduced}} at the Tire Uniformity Machine via {{grinding}} operations. In the Center Grind operation, a grinder {{is applied to the}} tread center to remove rubber at the high point of RFV. On the top and bottom tread shoulder grinders are applied {{to reduce the size of}} the road contact area, or footprint, and the resulting force variation. Top and bottom grinders can be controlled independently to reduce conicity values. Grinders are also employed to correct excessive <b>radial</b> <b>run-out.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tire Uniformity {{refers to}} the dynamic {{mechanical}} properties of pneumatic tires as strictly defined {{by a set of}} measurement standards and test conditions accepted by global tire and car makers. These measurement standards include the parameters of radial force variation, lateral force variation, conicity, plysteer, <b>radial</b> <b>run-out,</b> lateral run-out, and sidewall bulge. Tire makers worldwide employ tire uniformity measurement as a way to identify poorly performing tires so they are not sold to the marketplace. Both tire and vehicle manufacturers seek to improve tire uniformity in order to improve vehicle ride comfort.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce error of the wheel run-out {{detection}} system, a harmonic-analysis-based detection method was proposed to enhance the precision of online detection. The moving average filtering method was used for digital filtering between the axial and <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> errors so that to decrease the effect of outside noise on the measured data. Practical application shows that this system works stably and reliably on the wheel detection line and it realizes 100 % online detection on the axial and <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> of work pieces, with the measurement error lower than 0. 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a sliding-mod controller for tracking servo of optical disk drives. The tracking servo is majorly subject to two disturbance sources: <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> and shock. The lateral run-out disturbance is mostly repeatable, and a model of such disturbance is incorporated into the controller design to effectively compensate for it. Meanwhile, as a shock disturbance is usually non-repeatable and unpredictable, the sliding-mode controller is employed for its robustness to abrupt perturbations. As a result, a sliding-mode controller design based on the internal model principle is tailored for tracking servo of optical disk drives {{in order to deal}} with these two major disturbances. Experimental comparative studies are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the specially designed controller. Keywords—Mechatronics, optical disk drive, sliding-mode control, servo systems.

40|$|The dynamic {{performance}} of a new high-speed spindle supported by water-lubricated hybrid bearings is experimentally studied on a test rig. The present design allows {{the speed of the}} spindle up to 30, 000 [*]rpm, with a bearing internal diameter of 40 [*]mm, which makes it possible to simulate many actual machining processes. Some experiments have been presented to study the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the spindle and its supporting hybrid bearings. The maximum temperature rise is less than 15 °C with a speed of 30, 000 [*]rpm and a water supply pressure of 2. 5 [*]MPa. The spindle <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> of the rotational frequency is about 1 [*]µm. Stability of the spindle system has been improved. The experimental results indicate that water-lubricated hybrid bearings are valuable choices to replace ceramic bearings and air bearings as support for spindles under high-speed, high-precision, and heavy-load machining conditions...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the micro}} milling {{phenomena}} {{involved in the}} process is critical and difficult through physical experiments. This study presents a 3 D finite element modeling (3 D FEM) approach for the micro end-milling process on Al 6082 -T 6. The proposed model employs a Lagrangian explicit finite element formulation to perform coupled thermo-mechanical transient analyses. FE simulations were performed at different cutting conditions to obtain realistic numerical predictions of chip formation, temperature distribution, and cutting forces by considering the effect of tool run-out in the model. The <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> is a significant issue in micro milling processes and influences the cutting stability due to chip load and force variations. The Johnson-Cook (JC) material constitutive model was applied and its constants were determined by an inverse method based on the experimental cutting forces acquired during the micro end-milling tests. The FE model prediction capability was validated by comparing the numerical model results with experimental tests. The maximum tool temperature was predicted in a different angular position of the cutter which is difficult or impossible to obtain in experiments. The predicted results of the model, involving the run-out influence, showed a good correlation with experimental chip formation and the signal shape of cutting forces...|$|E
40|$|Study {{of surface}} quality and {{machining}} accuracy {{of a deep}} hole in the camshaft in manufacturing environment is conducted to make recommendations to eliminate emerging stress concentrators on the hole surface after machining and arising cracks while the engine is in operation. So {{it is important to}} conduct a comprehensive task-driven study to determine qualitative and quantitative values of arithmetical mean deviation of the surface roughness profile (parameter of height) and available stress concentrators, as well as to define regularities of changing accuracy parameters for deep-hole length such as deviation size, <b>radial</b> <b>run-out,</b> and geometric tolerance in cross section. A guide diameter of the drill bushing and an outer diameter of the cutting part of one-sided cut have been determined too. A camshaft casting from ductile iron HF 65 - 48 - 1 was processed in the automatic line on the machine "Hȕller" by a drill with the cutting head from the hard alloy VK 6 with simultaneously rotating workpiece and tool. The drill was guided through drill bushing from solid alloy VK 15. The measurement results showed that in 53 % of samples there were tears and scratches up to 0. 15 mm in depth, which could serve as stress concentrators and in the process of operation encourage growth of cracks in the bulk of the camshaft material. A significantly increasing value of the <b>radial</b> <b>run-out</b> size and all six studied harmonic components show that there is a deviation of the hole axis (run) from the nominal (specified) position and faceting available with their copied (increased) values along {{the entire length of the}} hole. This is a qualitative confirmation that in processing the holes in parts made from grey cast iron, there is a mechanism of copying errors earlier available. It is found that the size of a clearance between guide diameter of drill bushing and diameter of tool gage ribbon makes 0. 150 mm and almost 3 times exceeds the recommended value. All this reduces resistance, promotes a wear of the guide elements and a gauge part of the tool. In turn, these reasons create favorable conditions for built-up edge on calibrating and cutting parts of the one-sided cuts which contribute to tears and scratches on the surface of the camshaft hole. Thus, the causes and the mechanism of appearing stress concentrators and their possible growth in the bulk of the material during camshaft operation have been defined. As the wear mechanisms of guide bushing of various drill bits are different, it is advised to settle no more than 80 processing cycles for bushing and at most 63 cycles for drills. The technological operation content on deep drilling to be made has to contain a mandatory checking of the diametral clearance between the drill bushing hole and the calibrating part of the drill, which must be of 0. 055 mm at most. It is recommended to introduce a drill size m= 0. 26 0. 39 mm in its working drawing because it is unavailable there. It allows to reduce deviation of drill cutting part from the nominal position, tool vibration, run of axis and faceting the camshaft holes. The elaborated recommendations can be used in the development of similar drilling operations. </p...|$|E
