25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not <b>really</b> <b>working</b> at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was <b>really</b> <b>working</b> too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s San Francisco mayor George Christopher hired M. Justin Herman to {{head the}} {{redevelopment}} agency {{for the city and}} county. Justin Herman began an aggressive campaign to tear down blighted areas of the city that were <b>really</b> <b>working</b> class, non-white neighborhoods. Enacting eminent domain whenever necessary, he set upon a plan to tear down huge areas of the city and replace them with modern construction. Critics accused Herman of racism for what was perceived as attempts to create segregation and displacement of blacks. Many black residents were forced to move from their homes near the Fillmore jazz district to newly constructed projects such as near the naval base at Hunter's Point or even to other cities such as Oakland. He began leveling entire areas in San Francisco's Western Addition and Japantown neighborhoods. Herman also completed the final removal of the produce district below Telegraph Hill, moving the produce merchants to the Alemany Boulevard site. His planning {{led to the creation of}} Embarcadero Center, the Embarcadero Freeway, Japantown, the Geary Street superblocks, and eventually Yerba Buena Gardens.|$|E

Since the song was <b>really</b> <b>working</b> at radio, our manager and label wanted us to also put it on our new album. We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A friend of ours at the label called me one day and politely {{let me know that}} we were making a lot of mistakes with our career.
