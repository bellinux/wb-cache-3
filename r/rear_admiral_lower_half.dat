5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving their country in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson became the first Hispanic-American female to command an afloat unit. In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to <b>Rear</b> <b>Admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half).</b> In 2009, Rear Admiral Joseph R. Castillo became the first Hispanic-American district commander in the U.S. Coast Guard. Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E

25|$|The Strike Group {{comprises}} several commands, all {{of which}} reside {{under the authority of}} the Commander of the CSG (CCSG or COMCARSTRKGRU). The CCSG is typically a 1-star <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half),</b> who often promotes to 2-stars while in the job. He is the Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) to the carrier, air wing, destroyer squadron, and cruiser commanding officers assigned to the strike group. As such, he is responsible for unit-level training, integrated training, and readiness for assigned ships and units, as well as maintaining administrative functions and material readiness tracking for ships and squadrons assigned to the group.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Halsey's {{promotion}} to <b>rear</b> <b>admiral,</b> both <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> (O-7) and <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> upper half (O-8) wore two stars. This was the case until 1982. [...] During World War II and up until 1950, the Navy used the one star commodore rank for certain staff specialties.|$|R
50|$|As {{it would}} have been {{expensive}} to increase the pay of all the former commodores to the level of <b>rear</b> <b>admirals,</b> the U.S. Congress at the time specified that the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> list have pay equal to brigadier generals of the U.S. Army. If there were an odd number of <b>rear</b> <b>admirals,</b> the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the list was to be the larger. All <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> and full <b>rear</b> <b>admirals,</b> were considered equal to major generals, flew a blue flag with the requisite number of stars instead of a broad pennant, and were entitled to a 13-gun salute. The U.S. Supreme Court later held that the rank of commodore had been removed from the U.S. Navy, leaving it without a rank equivalent to brigadier general. This act disgruntled all the brigadier generals, who could now be outranked by officers who were their juniors in terms of service. This was a point of inter-service controversy for many years, especially after 1916, when the U.S. Army made its brigadier generals equivalent to <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half).</b> Thus the two-star rank of <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> was now equal to that of major general.|$|R
25|$|The three-star grade goes hand-in-hand {{with the}} {{position}} of office it is linked to, so the rank is temporary. Officers may only achieve three-star grade if they are appointed to positions that require the officer to hold such a rank. Their rank expires with the expiration of their term of office, which is usually set by statute. Vice admirals are nominated for appointment by the President from any eligible officers holding the rank of <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> or above, who also meet the requirements for the position, under the advice and/or suggestion of their respective department secretary, service secretary, and if applicable, the Joint Chiefs. The nominee must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate before the appointee can take office and thus assume the rank. The standard tour length for most vice admiral positions is three years but some are set four or more years by statute.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago {{became the}} first person born in the United States of Hispanic American descent to be {{promoted}} to <b>Rear</b> <b>Admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> in the Coast Guard. He was the Coast Guard's Program Executive Officer (PEO) and Director of Acquisition Programs. On July 13, 2007, Rábago relieved Rear Adm. Gary T. Blore as the program {{executive officer of the}} U.S. Coast Guard's largest recapitalization and modernization initiative, the $24 billion, 25-year programmed Integrated Deepwater System Program. The Integrated Deepwater System Program (IDS Program), or [...] "Deepwater," [...] is the 25-year program to recapitalize the United States Coast Guard's aircraft, ships, logistics, and command and control systems. The $24 billion program includes equipment that will be used across all missions. Rábago not only acted as program executive officer of Deepwater, but also as director of all Coast Guard acquisition programs. His office oversaw all major acquisitions of cutters, aircraft, C4ISR and boats.|$|E

He served as Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Navy before commanding the 5th Naval Division during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936.|$|E
50|$|When {{formed in}} 1922, the Battle Fleet (renamed Battle Force in 1930 and Pacific Fleet in 1941), {{included}} various type commands. The battleship type {{was led by}} the COMBATPAC, generally a three-star vice <b>admiral</b> or two-star <b>rear</b> <b>admiral.</b> The COMBATPAC had five <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> reporting to him, each leading a Battleship Division.|$|R
5000|$|Maritime battlestaff {{commanders of}} one-star rank (commodores or <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> will {{normally}} embark on large capital ships such as aircraft carriers, which will {{function as the}} flagship for their strike group or battle group, but a captain will retain command of the actual ship, and assume the title of [...] "flag captain". Even when a senior officer {{who is in the}} ship's captain's chain of command is present, all orders are given through the captain.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, {{the rank}} of {{commodore}} was finally and officially reintroduced in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard as the O-7 rank. This was intended to quell the long-running dissatisfaction by U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force officers with the U.S. Navy's and the U.S. Coast Guard's policy of honoring its <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half),</b> who received the pay grade of O-7 while wearing the rank insignia of a two-star admiral, i.e., an O-8. The one-star officer's rank and insignia for Navy and Coast Guard officers was thence re-established with the initial title of commodore admiral.|$|R
2500|$|The first Hispanic-American to {{graduate}} from the academy to reach the rank of admiral was Robert F. Lopez, class of 1879. Lopez was a Commodore during World War I, which technically made him the first Hispanic alumnus to become an admiral. Commodore is an official flag rank when used during wartime and is equivalent to today's one-star admiral – <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half).</b> [...] Many rank systems only use this rank during wartime.|$|E
2500|$|On February 25, 2003, then Captain DeLoach was [...] {{nominated}} for {{appointment to the}} rank of <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> while serving as commanding officer, Naval Reserve, commander, Seventh Fleet Detachment 111, Fort Worth, Texas. That same year he earned a Masters of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies form the Naval War College.

2500|$|After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw {{her on a}} March 1983 {{segment of}} 60 Minutes, he championed , a joint {{resolution}} originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion to commodore by special Presidential appointment. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. [...] Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> and Hopper {{became one of the}} Navy's few female admirals.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to current}} Department of Defense policy, {{there is no}} limit {{to the number of}} two-, three-, and four-star generals (or admirals) who may be frocked at any one time. However, the number of frocked brigadier generals or <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> is restricted. Three- and four-star generals are {{generally}} frocked if headroom is not available to promote them {{at the time of the}} assumption of their new assignment. This is due both to the close relationship between these ranks and the position held, and to the fact that these are considered [...] "positions of importance and responsibility" [...] in accordance with 10 USC § 601. For all other officers frocking is normally reserved for joint, international, or other high-visibility positions that require the higher rank for diplomatic, protocol, or command authority reasons.|$|R
5000|$|From then on, {{commodore}} {{has remained}} a title for U.S. Navy captains in command {{of more than a}} single unit (other than captains commanding carrier air wings, who retained their traditional title of [...] "CAG") and all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard one-star admirals were subsequently referred to as <b>rear</b> <b>admiral.</b> The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard <b>rear</b> <b>admirals</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half),</b> continued to wear the single star for collar insignia and applicable shoulder insignia (i.e., flight suits, jackets, etc.), a single silver star on top of solid gold background shoulder board insignia, and a single broad gold sleeve stripe insignia for dress blue uniforms (service dress blue, full dress blue and dinner dress blue) of all USN and USCG flag officers in pay grade O-7, and for the service dress white and full dress white uniforms of female USN flag officers in pay grade O-7.|$|R

He was promoted to <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (commodore/rear <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half))</b> on 31 December 1993. During this period the Italian Navy was involved in supporting NATO arms embargo operations (Operation Sharp Guard) to contain the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and in the U.N. operation Restore Hope in Somalia.|$|R
2500|$|The term {{commodore}} {{was used}} by the Navy during the mid- to late nineteenth century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. It was the highest rank in the United States Navy until the Civil War. The closest warfighting rank in today's Navy is <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half.</b> (In the British Royal Navy, the designation of commodore was applied to the commanding officer.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 made CAPSTONE {{mandatory}} for all newly selected generals and admirals. Subsection 663(a) of the Act titled “Capstone Course for New Generals and Flag Officers,” specifically required that “Each officer selected for promotion to the grade of brigadier general or, {{in the case}} of Navy, <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> (<b>lower</b> <b>half)</b> shall be required, after such selection, to attend a military education course designed specifically to prepare new generals and flag officers to work with the other armed forces.” [...] In 1987, the number of CAPSTONE courses was increased to four per year to satisfy the statutory requirement.|$|E
2500|$|Vanderbilt's intercollegiate {{athletics}} teams are nicknamed the Commodores, {{in honor of}} the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping. The term commodore was used by the Navy during the mid-to-late 19th century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The rank is still used by the British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth countries, but the equivalent modern-day rank in the U.S. Navy is <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half.</b> Since the term was used most during the 19th century, Vanderbilt's mascot, [...] "Mr. C", is usually portrayed as a naval officer from the late 19th century, complete with mutton chops, cutlass, and uniform.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States Navy, midshipmen, chief petty officers, and {{commissioned}} officers wear combination covers, {{but there}} are differences between the three types. Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy or in Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) units wear a combination cap with a gold chinstrap attached by gold buttons, with a gold fouled anchor device. A chief petty officer wears a combination cap with a black chinstrap attached with gold buttons, with a device consisting of a gold fouled anchor with silver block letters [...] "USN" [...] superimposed on the shank of the anchor, with the addition of one, two, or three stars {{at the top of the}} anchor if the wearer is a Senior Chief Petty Officer, a Master Chief Petty Officer, or the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, respectively; while a commissioned officer wears a combination cap with a gold chinstrap attached by gold buttons, with an officer crest device, a silver federal shield over two crossed gold fouled anchors, surmounted by a silver eagle. Chief petty officer and junior commissioned officer visors are shiny black plastic without ornamentation. Officers O-5 (Commander) and above have gold embroidered oak leaves and acorns on a black felt-covered visor, with additional embroidery for flag officers (O-7, or <b>rear</b> <b>admiral</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half,</b> and above), referred to as [...] "scrambled eggs." [...] The crowns come in khaki or in white (the white combination cap is worn with both white and blue uniforms). The black band around the cap includes a black circle extending upward on the front of the crown as a backing behind the device. The gold buttons on the sides of the cover are of a design to match the gold buttons on the service dress jacket and the snaps on officer shoulder boards. For the female cap the brim is folded up on both sides whereas the men's cap has no brim but a visor at the front.|$|E

Only a year away from being eligible for release from active duty, she was nominated by her commanding officer to serve as Navy physician to the White House Medical Unit. She joined the unit in June 1992, serving as a physician to President George H.W.
