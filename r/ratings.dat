5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent <b>ratings.</b> However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the <b>ratings</b> had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies <b>ratings</b> greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' <b>ratings</b> were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' <b>ratings,</b> and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall <b>ratings.</b> Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's <b>ratings</b> to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E
