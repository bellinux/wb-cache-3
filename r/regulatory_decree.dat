40|$|Stabilization/solidification is an advanced, {{environmentally}} acceptable and commonly used treatment process for hazardous waste before its disposal into a landfill. However, common methods of stabilization/solidification {{are not sufficient}} in some cases and therefore some new binders for this purpose are studied. One of the options can be silicone polymers that could replace conventional binders such as cement, fly ash etc. The silicone polymers are hydrophobic, resistant to UV radiation and stable in the environment {{in a wide range}} of weather conditions. They are capable to form a hydrophobic barrier on the surface of waste particles and thus prevent leakage of harmful substances into the environment. As a source of the silicone polymer is used commercial product Lukofob ELX (water emulsion of methyl silicone resin). This study is focused on utilizing these properties and verifying the efficiency of the mentioned stabilization/solidification method on chromium contaminated synthetic waste. The properties are verified by three measured parameters: conductivity, pH and concentration of chromium. After that, these parameters are compared with limits set by <b>regulatory</b> <b>decree</b> No. 294 / 2005 Coll.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} contributions of apothecary craftsmen and their medicinal retailing practices to emerging cultures of scientific investigation and experimental practice in the Italian port city of Venice between 1565 and 1730. During this important period in Europe’s history, efforts to ground traditional philosophical investigations of nature in a new material culture of empirical and experimental practice elicited significant debate in scholarly communities. Leading the way in advancing the authority of “experience” were Europe’s medical practitioners divided between university-trained physicians and guild-regulated apothecaries and surgeons. In Italy, humanist praise for the practical arts and new techniques of analyzing inherited texts influenced sixteenth-century university physicians to redefine the medical discipline {{in terms of its}} practical aims to intervene in nature and achieve useful effects. This led to an important revival in northern Italian universities at Ferrara and Padua of the classical Greek writings on the empirical disciplines of anatomy and pharmacy. In the sixteenth century the university at Padua, under the patronage of the Republic of Venice, was the site of Europe’s first public botanical garden, anatomical theater and clinical demonstrations. The university also hosted important experimental practitioners such as Andreas Vesalius, Galileo Galilei and William Harvey, and remained a leading center of medical investigation attracting an international faculty of students and professors until the eighteenth century. At the same time, the study of Aristotelian natural philosophy in original Greek texts was largely emancipated from the faculty of theology at Padua, nurturing innovative discourses on experimental method by figures such as Giacomo Zabarella and the anatomist Fabricius Aquapendente. The unique intellectual climate at Padua has thus attracted significant scholarly attention in the history and philosophy of early modern science. However, the university’s important relationships with the thriving world of artisan guilds and their commercial practices in the nearby city of Venice have not received due attention in historical scholarship. To address this issue, this dissertation focuses upon a unique group of guild-trained medical practitioners in Venice – apothecaries – to trace the circulations of materials, skills, and expertise between Padua and the Venetian marketplace. Drawing on the methods of urban history, medical anthropology, literary studies and intellectual history, I conceptualize Venice as an important “contact zone,” or space of dialogue between scholarly and artisanal modes of investigating and representing nature between the latter sixteenth and early eighteenth centuries. In particular, I focus upon emerging apothecary strategies for retailing nature to public audiences through their medicinal creations, printed books, licensing petitions, and their pharmacy shops. Through these practices, apothecaries not only marketed commercial remedies during a period of growing interest in pharmaceutical matters, but also fashioned their own expertise as learned medical practitioners linking both theory and practice; head and hand; natural philosophy and practiced skill. In 1565 Venice’s apothecaries made their first effort to define their trade as a liberal profession in establishing a College of Apothecaries that lasted until 1804. Already {{by the turn of the}} eighteenth century, however, Venice’s apothecaries had adopted the moniker as “Public Professors” and engaged in dialogue with leading professors at Padua for plans to institute a new school of “experimental medical chemistry” with the prior of the apothecary college proposed as its first public demonstrator. Looking to a wide variety of statements on the urban pharmacy in Venice in published medical books, pharmacopeias, trade manuals, literary works, civic rituals and archival licensing and <b>regulatory</b> <b>decrees,</b> I trace the evolution of the public apothecary trade in Venice, paying particular attention to the pharmacy’s early modern materialization as a site of cultural and intellectual exchanges between the artisan workshop and the university world inhabited by scholars. My readings of these sources lead to three important conclusions regarding the significance of apothecary retailing to the scientific culture of early modern Italy. First, the urban terrain of artisan practice in a merchant republic must be placed alongside the traditionally studied princely courts and universities as a fertile ground for dialogue between artisans and scholars in the study of nature. Second, apothecary investments in processing and retailing nature during this period made significant contributions to the material culture of early modern science in both mediating a growing pharmacopeia of exotic materials imported from around the globe, and in fashioning workshop models for the first university chemical laboratories instituted at Padua in the eighteenth century. And third, apothecary marketing strategies expressing their own medical expertise over nature’s materials articulated a fusion of textual learning and manual skill that offered some of the earliest profiles of the experimental practitioner that was eventually adopted in the public discourse of the experimental New Sciences by the latter seventeenth century.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} social, economical, ecological, political, legal, and {{institutional}} implications of options related to ‘resettlement’, ‘boundary change’, and ‘enclave’ delineation {{for each of}} the five park villages. The study finds that attempting to resettle all the villages from the Korup National Park (KNP) may not be realistic or achievable. At the same time, the present status quo proves not being tenable. Bareka-Batanga is the village the most clearly prepared to resettle, and the least costly too. If the Bakoko group of villages cannot be resettled, it will need a comprehensive development conservation plan within a ‘sustainable livelihood option’ here named ‘enclave option. Three options exist for Erat and its twin village Ekon I: resettlement, with the financial cost scenarios particularly high; maintaining them where they are presently, that implies the much lower short-term financial cost; changing of the park’s boundary. The economic analysis finds that under the original assumptions of the Korup project, resettling the villages remains a preferred option for long-term economic benefits. But slight changes into these assumptions significantly reduce forecasted benefits. By contrast, in the short term, the financial costs of resettlement are much higher than other options. The ecological assessment finds that people in the KNP are traditional forest-farmers, with almost 1 / 12 th of the park already domesticated. At the same time, these communities depend vitally on the whole range of environmental services provided by the primary forest. In contrast, the study does not find evidence that hunting, fishing, or gathering by park villagers constitutes, as such, a threat to the sustainability of the wildlife or the ecosystems. The sociological analysis finds that communities’ perceptions of the KNP are dominated by the sentiment that they have been deceived and abandoned. Parts of these communities would still like to be resettled, other want to stop all talks of resettlement and just ‘divide’ up the forest between them and the Korup project. Legal alternatives to the resettlement such as degazettment of part of the KNP to allow for certain villages to stay where they are while exercising freely their activities; the adaptation of the management plan, with the justification that such enclaves fall within the fundamental objectives of the management of the park; and a special <b>regulatory</b> amendment, by <b>Decree</b> of the Prime Minister or by ordinance of the President of the Republic with regulatory power...|$|R

These companies are paid monthly administration fee by the residents {{under the assumption that}} the service providers are under regulation and control of the Superintendency of Surveillance and Private Security. The scope and responsibilities of the security service are provided within the Decree Law 356 of 1994 and the Single <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Decree</b> 1070 of 2015, in addition to the complementary provisions issued by the Superintendency of Private Security and Surveillance. The limits and conditions are rarely understood or included in the contracts or clarified to the parties legally related to the provision of the service. This results results in user dissatisfaction, lawsuits, and in some cases, evasion of responsibility by the private security and surveillance company or Cooperative. This continues to happen despite the findings of weaknesses in their operation, affecting the user and the whole image of the sector of Private Security companies. It is often assumed, {{as a result of the}} contractual gaps, that when incidents or affections occur, the contracted Private Security and Surveillance company is totally responsible for what happened. However, Is the monitoring company really responsible for what happened? To answer this question, it is necessary to evaluate the responsibilities and participaation of the administrator, the residents and the Private Security and Surveillance company. Only then it will assure the quality of the service and the delimitation of the responsibilities, without generating false expectations for any of the parties. This document presents the current legal requirements that the Private Security and Surveillance Companies must fulfill. It also includes their responsibilities to carry out their services in the residential area in the city of Bogotá as a tool. This will ensure that users can consciously select the security services that support their requirements and have the capacity to respond to incidents. The document further intends to cover the shortage of information currently available on the subject and provide clear guidance to residents regarding the choice of Security providers. The criteria are based on commitments of the companies or cooperatives providing the service in order to ensure the residents protection, the minimum the scope required for contracting, and the administration to sign better and well structured service conctracts. Finally, the paper intends to explain how the adequate quality of the service concludes in compliance with the regulatory provisions for the sector.
