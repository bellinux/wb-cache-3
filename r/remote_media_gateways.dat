[...] <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) using H.248 instructs one or more <b>Media</b> <b>Gateways</b> (MG)s to connect streams coming from outside a packet or cell data network onto a packet or cell stream such as the Real-Time Transport Protocol.|$|R

50|$|<b>Media</b> <b>gateways</b> {{are often}} {{controlled}} by a separate <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller which provides the call control and signaling functionality. Communication between <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> and Call Agents is achieved by means of protocols such as MGCP or Megaco (H.248) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Modern <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> used with SIP are often stand-alone units with their own call and signaling control integrated and can function as independent, intelligent SIP end-points.|$|R
40|$|In wide-area and {{heterogeneous}} environments, it {{is necessary}} to deploy <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> at strategic locations within the networks, in order to deliver customized and compose-able multimedia services to individual users. In many cases, <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> have to be dynamically discovered, because (1) a host may not know a priori all the <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> it will possibly use, and (2) the change of host location or end-to-end resource condition can make a known <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> no longer useful. However, current general service location mechanisms are not sufficient to perform <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> discovery. In this paper, we present MeGaDiP, a wide-area <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Discovery Protocol. It is based on the same basic architecture of the general service location mechanisms, and {{can be seen as a}} discovery heuristics that will be invoked first when discovering a <b>media</b> <b>gateway.</b> The key properties of MeGaDiP include: (1) awareness of both source and destination end hosts: any discovered <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> will not create an excessively long path between the end hosts via the gateway; (2) resource-awareness: any discovered <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> is likely to have sufficient end-to-end resources to perform its service; (3) return of discovery results with low latency and high validity by caching and resource validation; (4) small amount of management traffic, regardless of the number of <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> and end hosts in the environment. Furthermore, an extension to MeGaDiP using a hierarchical architecture is proposed to improve the discovery succes...|$|R
50|$|Both H.248 and MGCP are {{protocol}} for controlling <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> using a <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> controller or call agent.

50|$|MGCP recognizes three {{essential}} elements of communication, the <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> controller (call agent), the <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> endpoint, and connections between these entities. A <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> may host multiple endpoints and each endpoint {{should be able to}} engage in multiple connections. Multiple connections on the endpoints support calling features such as call waiting and three-way calling.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the types}} of devices {{targeted}} for control by H.248/Megaco and the low level of its control structure, H.248 is generally viewed as complementary to H.323 and SIP. While a <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) will use H.248/Megaco to manage media establishment and control with a number of <b>Media</b> <b>Gateways</b> (MG), other VoIP protocol such as SIP and H.323 are used for one <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) to communicate with another <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC). From a SIP perspective, the combination of MGC and MGs are treated together as a SIP Gateway.|$|R
50|$|SIP and H.323 are {{signaling}} protocols, while <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols are {{device control}} protocols. The architectural difference between SIP and H.323, and the <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols {{is that the}} relationships between entities in SIP and H.323 are peer-to-peer, while the relationships between entities in <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols use the master/slave (technology) model. SIP and H.323 handle call setup, connection, management, and tear-down of calls between like interfaces, whereas <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols define the mechanisms of setup of media paths and streams between IP and other networks.|$|R
50|$|The {{device that}} handles the call control {{function}} {{is referred to}} as an intelligent <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) and the device that handles the media {{is referred to as}} a relatively unintelligent <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> (MG). H.248 defines the protocol for <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controllers to control <b>Media</b> <b>Gateways</b> for the support of multimedia streams across IP networks and the Public Switched Telephone network (PSTN).

50|$|The H.248/Megaco model {{describes}} a connection model {{that contains the}} logical entities, or objects, within the <b>Media</b> <b>Gateways</b> (MGs) that can be controlled by the <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller. The main entities are Contexts and Terminations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Media</b> <b>Gateways</b> - {{comprise}} {{a line of}} highly reliable and scalable IP communications platforms that connect VoIP and TDM networks. The <b>Media</b> <b>Gateways</b> serve as a junction between VoIP networks, legacy TDM equipment, and the PSTN.|$|R
5000|$|The H.248/Megaco model {{considerably}} simplifies {{connection setup}} within the MG and to entities outside the MG. It simplifies the {{mechanism by which}} the <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) can specify associated media streams as well as specify the direction of media flow. H.248/Megaco is therefore able to provide greater application level support than [...] <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Control Protocol (MGCP). For example, setting up a multi-party conference using H.248/Megaco merely involves adding several terminations to a context. In case of [...] <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Control Protocol (MGCP) however, the <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) needs to establish several connections to a special type of endpoint called the conference bridge.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Control Protocol (MGCP) is a {{signaling}} {{and call}} control communications protocol used in voice over IP (VoIP) telecommunication systems. It implements the <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocol architecture for controlling <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> on Internet Protocol (IP) networks {{connected to the}} {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). The protocol is a successor to the Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP), which was developed by Bellcore and Cisco, and the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> connects {{different}} types of networks, one of its main functions is to convert between different transmission and coding techniques. Media streaming functions such as echo cancellation, DTMF, and tone sender are also located in the <b>media</b> <b>gateway.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{implementation}} of the <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Control Protocol architecture is <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Control Protocol.

5000|$|A <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> {{controller}} function (MGCF) is a SIP endpoint {{that does}} call control protocol conversion between SIP and ISUP/BICC and interfaces with the SGW over SCTP. It also controls the resources in a <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> (MGW) across an H.248 interface.|$|R
50|$|A network {{implementing}} NCS {{is designed}} {{according to the}} <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocol architecture for interconnecting a packet network with the traditional {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). This architecture physically decomposes the functionality of providing complete end-to-end multimedia telecommunication sessions into several discrete components, notably a <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> (MG) located at the customer premises that performs the physical translation between analog voice or video streams to packetized digital data, and a <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> controller (MGC) which is a centralized server that controls typically many <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> and manages the complexity of call setup, resource negotiation, call routing, and tear-down. In addition, the architecture also uses signaling gateways to the traditional telecommunication channels, such as SS7-based networks.|$|R
