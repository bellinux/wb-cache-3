Specialized applications {{have to support}} new ways of analysis and representation of the collected data {{in order to gain}} new insights. The article presents the thematic application for groundwater management in Baden-Württemberg, which is tailored {{to the needs of the}} users in the environmental agencies. Three typical use cases are described: calculation and visualization of the influence of geothermal drilling on the groundwater temperature, trend analysis on groundwater quality data according to legal <b>regulations,</b> new <b>diagrams</b> to clearly visualize and compare fluctuations of groundwater levels...|$|R

From the scientific literature, EcoCyc captures the functions of individual E. coli gene products; their regulation at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and protein level; and their organization into operons, complexes and pathways. EcoCyc users can search and browse the information in multiple ways. Recent improvements to the EcoCyc Web interface include combined gene/ protein pages and a <b>Regulation</b> Summary <b>Diagram</b> displaying a graphical overview of all known regulatory inputs to gene expression and protein activity. The graphical representation of signal transduction pathways has been updated, and the cellular and regulatory overviews were enhanced with new functionality. A specialized undergraduate teaching resource using EcoCyc is being developed. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between yield and evaporation {{as a function of}} lake morphology in semi-arid Brazil. First, a new methodology was proposed to classify the morphology of 40 reservoirs in the Ceará State, with storage capacities ranging from approximately 5 to 4500 hm 3. Then, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to study the effect of reservoir morphology (including real and simplified conical forms) on the water storage process at different reliability levels. The reservoirs were categorized as convex (60. 0 %), slightly convex (27. 5 %) or linear (12. 5 %). When the conical approximation was used instead of the real lake form, a trade-off occurred between reservoir yield and evaporation losses, with different trends for the convex, slightly convex and linear reservoirs. Using the conical approximation, the water yield prediction errors reached approximately 5 % of the mean annual inflow, which is negligible for large reservoirs. However, for smaller reservoirs, this error became important. Therefore, this paper presents a new procedure for correcting the yield-evaporation relationships that were obtained by assuming a conical approximation rather than the real reservoir morphology. The combination of this correction with the <b>Regulation</b> Triangle <b>Diagram</b> is useful for rapidly and objectively predicting reservoir yield and evaporation losses in semi-arid environments...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have {{prepared}} a comprehensive set of draft guidance for shippers and inspectors {{to use when}} applying the newly imposed regulatory requirements for low specific activity (LSA) material and surface contaminated objects (SCOs). These requirements represent significant departures in some areas from {{the manner in which}} these materials and objects were regulated by the earlier versions of the regulations. The proper interpretation and application of the regulatory criteria can require a fairly complex set of decisions be made. To assist those trying to apply these regulatory requirements, a detailed set of logic flow diagrams representing decisions related to multiple factors were prepared and included in the draft report for comment on Categorizing and Transporting Low Specific Activity Materials and Surface Contaminated Objects. These logic flow diagrams, as developed, are specific to the US regulations, but were readily adaptable to the IAEA <b>regulations.</b> The <b>diagrams</b> have been modified accordingly and tied directly to specific paragraphs in IAEA Safety Series No. 6. This paper provides the logic flow diagrams adapted to the IAEA regulations, and demonstrates how these diagrams can be used to assist consignors and inspectors in assessing compliance of shipments with the LSA material and SCO regulatory requirements...|$|R
5000|$|During {{that same}} year, Eno {{proposed}} {{the first version}} of today's roundabouts or traffic circles, which he termed [...] "the rotary or gyratory traffic system". In his 1920 book, Eno recalled that [...] "in 1903, the New York Police Department asked that a plan be suggested for Columbus Circle, where accidents were occurring almost daily. It was advised that vehicles should keep to the right, going around the circle in one direction instead of two. In 1905, the plan was put in operation.... In 1907, the system was put in operation at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but whether due to the suggestion sent them from New York or not is not clear." [...] His 1909 book, Street Traffic <b>Regulation,</b> contains a <b>diagram</b> of the Columbus Circle rotary.|$|R
40|$|Background: Literature on the {{negative}} socio-economic and environmental externalities generated by informal public transport (IPT) in developing countries is vast, vibrant and growing fast. These externalities include {{but are not limited}} to noise, air and land pollution, accidents and, more importantly, a source of congestion (human and vehicular) because of poor driver behaviour. In this article, the research does not seek to reinstate these, but rather, it argues that poor driver behaviour is a dependent variable to some regulatory policy stimuli. Yet, an extensive literature survey has shown that the driver behaviour and urban transport regulation linkage remain little explored. Objective: The purpose of this article was to unpack the relationship between informal public transport driver behaviour and the prevailing regulatory framework. Method: Based on a case study of Harare, Zimbabwe, the researcher adopted a mixed-methods paradigm and interrogated the prevailing urban public transport regulatory regimes and applied professional judgement, oral interviews backed by some quantitative data and relate these to obtaining IPT driver behavioural characteristics. Results: Poor driver behaviour exhibited by IPT were generated, exacerbated and or eased by the prevailing regulatory policy. This is well depicted through an IPT driver behaviour and <b>regulation</b> loop reinforcing <b>diagram.</b> Conclusion: Following this argument, the article cautions policy makers and urban managers alike that direct approaches and interventions when trying to regulate IPT poor driver behaviour and its secondary negative effects will be futile as long as the regulatory policy remains the same. Failure to recognise and connect the dots between IPT driver behaviour and policy partly explains why globally, the IPT sector has proved difficult in prohibiting, restructuring or even formalising it. </p...|$|R
