50|$|Ratchet spinners {{are short}} (about 1-1/2") {{extensions}} {{that have a}} knurled attachments on them for easy hand tightening or loosening without the <b>ratchet</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the <b>ratchet</b> <b>handle</b> to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|E
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional <b>ratchet</b> <b>handle</b> with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|E
50|$|Variations include T-shaped handles for {{providing}} the operator {{with a better}} grip, <b>ratcheting</b> <b>handles,</b> sockets with recessed magnets for holding fasteners, and flex shafts for bending around obstructions.|$|R
5000|$|A ratchet is a {{mechanical}} device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion {{in only one}} direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools. Though something of a misnomer, [...] "ratchet" [...] is also often {{used to refer to}} ratcheting socket wrenches, a common tool with a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Blackhawk {{introduced}} {{a number of}} innovations to conventional drive tools, such as the [...] "Lock-On" [...] system of locking sockets, gearless <b>ratchets,</b> telescoping <b>ratchet</b> <b>handles,</b> and 7/16" [...] drive tools. Many of these designs were developed by engineers Edward Pfauser and Sigmund Mandl (the latter notable for having founded the Husky Wrench Company prior to working for Blackhawk). Tools from the mid-20th century had distinctive art deco styling and remain highly collectible.|$|R
50|$|Lowell Corporation {{produces}} ratchet wrenches {{and other}} hand tools used for High Line and Pipeline Utility installation and repair. Lowell also makes <b>ratchets</b> as <b>handles</b> and clutches for inclusion in original industrial and commercial equipment. Through its Porter-Ferguson division, Lowell Corp. also produces portable hydraulic units and repair clamps for the automotive body and frame repair industry.|$|R
50|$|Snap-on Incorporated has {{patented}} {{a concept}} of a composite ring gear, which incorporates a metal gear insert bonded into a fiber reinforced composite plastic housing. Invented by Snap-on Incorporated, composite ring gear has been already successfully applied to mechanical engineering area. More specifically Snap-on is producing a gear mechanical system commonly known as <b>ratchet</b> wrench <b>handle,</b> which incorporates Snap-on composite ring gear as the key element of the system.|$|R
50|$|The photo {{shows the}} {{internal}} mechanism. The L-shaped handle has a gear rack, which spins the white step-up gear, {{which in turn}} spins the flywheel on which is mounted the dark grey magnet, seen on the lower left. The magnet induces an electric current in the red copper winding, seen on the lower right. The current from the copper winding flows through the filament of an incandescent light bulb (not shown), giving off light. A spring and <b>ratchet</b> returns the <b>handle</b> to its original position after each engagement.|$|R
50|$|In most braces, {{immediately}} {{behind the}} chuck is a three position gear release which allows <b>ratcheting</b> of the <b>handle</b> when in tight spots. Turning the gear {{release from the}} center position allows ratcheting the brace in the direction needed. Turning the gear release fully clockwise lets it remove wood in a clockwise direction with the ratchet action going counter-clockwise. Placing the gear release fully counter-clockwise then allows turning the brace and bit in a counter-clockwise direction, usually to remove the drill bit from the hole. The center position of the gear release prohibits the ratcheting effect.|$|R
