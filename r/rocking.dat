5|$|Magnapop {{established}} their fan {{base in the}} early 1990s through touring and the festival circuit—particularly in central Europe, where they first broke through to the mainstream. It was only after they had established a fan base in Europe and received positive press in the United Kingdom that the band first became recognized in the United States, including their native Atlanta. By the end of 1992, they were getting positive write-ups in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at <b>Rocking</b> Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993.

Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the <b>Rocking</b> Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club.

5|$|Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into {{striking}} the German plane because the real gulls {{used in the}} first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the <b>rocking</b> motion and flickering lights.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison <b>rocking</b> in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E
5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by <b>rocking</b> the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinases (<b>ROCKs)</b> reduces {{allergic}} airway {{responses in}} mice. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the roles of the two <b>ROCK</b> isoforms, <b>ROCK</b> 1 and <b>ROCK</b> 2, in these responses. Wildtype (WT) mice and heterozygous <b>ROCK</b> 1 and <b>ROCK</b> 2 knockout mice (<b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- and <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/-, respectively) were sensitised and challenged with ovalbumin. <b>ROCK</b> expression and activation were assessed by western blotting. Airway responsiveness was measured by forced oscillation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and the lungs were fixed for histological assessment. Compared with WT mice, <b>ROCK</b> 1 and <b>ROCK</b> 2 expression were 50 % lower in lungs of <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/-and <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- mice, respectively, without changes in the other isoform. In WT lungs, <b>ROCK</b> activation increased after ovalbumin challenge and was sustained for several hours. This activation was reduced in <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- and <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- lungs. Airway responsiveness was comparable in WT, <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/-, and <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- mice challenged with PBS. Ovalbumin challenge caused airway hyperresponsiveness in WT, but not <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- or <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- mice. Lavage eosinophils and goblet cell hyperplasia were significantly reduced in ovalbumin-challenged <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- and <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- versus WT mice. Ovalbumin-induced changes in lavage interleukin- 13, interleukin- 5 and lymphocytes were also reduced in <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- mice. In conclusion, both <b>ROCK</b> 1 and <b>ROCK</b> 2 are important in regulating allergic airway responses...|$|R
