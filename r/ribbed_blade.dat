40|$|Meat {{retailers}} have reported bone marrow discoloration to be a problem, especially in modified-atmosphere packages (MAP). To evaluate causes of bone marrow discoloration in different beef bones and packaging systems, 36 beef arm bones, <b>ribs,</b> shoulder <b>blades,</b> and thoracic vertebrae from USDA Select and Choice carcasses {{were obtained from}} a commercial abattoir, cut into 1 -inch-thick sections at 4 days postmortem, and packaged into 1) polyvinyl chloride film (PVC) overwrap; 2) high-oxygen (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) MAP; or 3) ultra-low-oxygen (70 % N 2, 30 % CO 2) MAP. Packages were displayed under continuous fluorescent lighting for 4 days at 35. 6 °F. <b>Ribs,</b> shoulder <b>blades,</b> and thoracic vertebrae packaged in PVC and high-oxygen MAP developed undesirable gray or black discoloration during display. In ultra-low-oxygen MAP, mean visual-color scores were acceptable throughout display. The a* values (larger values equate to redder color) for <b>ribs,</b> shoulder <b>blades,</b> and thoracic vertebrae decreased (P< 0. 05) over time. Arm-bone marrow had less oxidation and dramatically less total iron and hemoglobin than did marrow from ribs and thoracic vertebrae. The much larger amounts of iron and hemoglobin in ribs and thoracic vertebrae likely correspond to marrow discoloration. In summary, bone marrow discoloration occurs in <b>ribs,</b> shoulder <b>blades,</b> and thoracic vertebrae packaged in PVC or high-oxygen MAP. Bones packaged in ultralow- oxygen MAP or arm bones packaged in PVC or high-oxygen MAP had minimal oxidation and discoloration...|$|R

Subprimals were fabricated into bone-in or boneless retail or foodservice cuts and associated components by trained retail meat cutters. After each retail cutting test, trained technicians recorded weights of all cuts, lean trim, fat trim, and bone. All retail cuts were trimmed to an eighth of an inch (0. 32 cm), unless otherwise specified. Time (s) was recorded for each-cutting test and in two major phases: opening (retrieval of the subprimal from vacuum-packaged bag) and cutting (removal of all external and seam fat, connective tissue, and separation of individual muscles, as well as producing tray ready retail cuts). In general, Select subprimals had higher saleable yields than Choice subprimals. Select subprimals had less trimmable fat than Choice subprimals, and differences in retail yields appeared to follow these factors. Few significant differences were observed for processing times between USDA quality grade groups. These data will serve as an update to the CARDS (Computer Assisted Retail Decision Support) software program...|$|R

40|$|Agrostis castellana {{is one of}} the few plants colonizing one of {{the most}} extreme {{geothermal}} alteration fields characterized by low pH and high temperature of soil. The study of species surviving in these multi-stress habitats can help to know more in deep the adaptive ability of plants. In this work morpho-anatomical, functional and physiological traits of leaves of A. castellana living few meters from fumaroles were studied, focusing on their putative ecological significance. Some typical xeromorphic traits occurred in the leaves of these plants: abundant cutinization, cell wall thickening, slightly convolute and adaxially <b>ribbed</b> leaf <b>blades,</b> tissutal reinforcements by sclereids, pubescence, protected stomata and densely packed mesophyll. Abundant pectins, important in both water balance adjusting and as monosaccharide source, were observed in epidermal cell walls. Despite the low value of relative water content, indicative of a disturbed hydric state, oxidative damage, in terms of lipid peroxidation, indicative of membrane damage, was significantly lower than in other plants of the same environment, probably tanks to an adequate antioxidant response based mainly on enzymatic machinery. Interestingly catalase activity was not inhibited by extreme conditions of the geothermal alteration field as in other plants of the same habitat. In conclusion, a cooperation of xeromorphic traits and antioxidant response seems to make A. castellana able to survive in such a prohibitive environment...|$|R

40|$|Gas Turbines are {{designed}} to continuously and efficiently generate useful power from fuel energy and are developed into very reliable high performance engines. Nowadays gas turbines have been put to use in various fields like, power plants, marine industries {{as well as for}} industrial propulsion. For high thermal efficiency advanced gas turbines use high temperature at the entry of the turbine. Therefore, for the purpose of increasing thermal efficiency of the turbines, it is imperative to design effective cooling schemes. The current Turbine Inlet Temperature in advanced gas turbines is much higher than the melting point of the blade material. As a result a varied range of cooling techniques are used to cool the blade to maintain normal operation of the turbine. An attempt has been made to computationally analyse the effects of one type of cooling system, rib turbulated cooling, wherein the cooling effects of air flow through a <b>ribbed</b> turbine <b>blade</b> passage has been simulated using ANSYSFLUENT. The mass flow rates of air through the passage was varied to observe the variation of cooling effects with mass flow rate and results were compared. The temperature contours of the blade for different mass flow rates were observed. The trends of different parameters like heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt number, skin friction coefficient was also noted. It was noted that although the cooling effects increase with increasing mass flow rate, the pressure loss due to friction also increases and hence it is not feasible to have high mass flow rates for cooling turbine blades...|$|R

The choice of LES model {{is found to be}} of minor importance as the flow is dominated by large geometric scale structures. This is in contrast to several linear and nonlinear RANS models, which display turbulence model sensitivity. For LES, the influence of inlet turbulence is also tested and has a minor impact due to the strong turbulence generated by the ribs. Large scale turbulent motions destroy any classical boundary layer reducing near wall grid requirements. The wake-type flow structure makes this and similar flows nearly Reynolds number independent, allowing a range of flows to be studied at similar cost. Hence LES is a relatively cheap method for obtaining accurate heat transfer predictions in these types of flows. This is the accepted manuscript. The final version is available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of the meat yield {{breeding}} values of sires on highly valued parts of carcasses in their progeny. The study was carried out on Czech Fleckviehs, a breed dual purpose milk-beef production. Cutting parts evaluated were: round, strip loin and tender loin (first-class meat); <b>rib,</b> shoulder <b>blade</b> (boneless), fore shank, flank, chuck roll + neck (second-class meat) and separable fat. The correlation analysis showed significant negative relationships only for the relative breeding values of trading classes and the rib (r=− 0. 2079); relative breeding values of net daily gain with strip loin (r=− 0. 2433). Although strip loin is an important first-class meat cut, the correlation is rather low. Correlations between other meat cuts with breeding values were non-significant. The correlation between meat cuts and age showed the same pattern as correlations between meat cuts and weight at slaughter. Significant negative correlations were found between first-class meat and increasing age (r=− 0. 1979) and weight (r=− 0. 2884). In contrast, for second-class meat there were positive correlation with increasing age and weight (r= 0. 3489 for age, r= 0. 4495 for weight). This also corresponds with the correlation between age or weight and specific first-class meat cuts (tender loin r=− 0. 2804, r=− 0. 3413, strip loin r=− 0. 3710, r=− 0. 2012) and second-class meat (sep. fat r=+ 0. 2360, r=+ 0. 2951, r for correlation with age and weight respectively).

40|$|Germin and germin-like {{proteins}} (GLPs) are {{water soluble}} extra-cellular proteins reportedly expressed {{in response to}} some environmental and developmental signals. Some enzymatic activities have also been associated with germin/GLPs. However, their role in overall metabolism has not been fully understood. Significant insight into their function may also be gained by analysis of their promoter. A study was design to analyze the functional importance of a root expressed GLP gene promoter. During this study, about 1107 bp 5 'region of OsRGLP 2 gene was amplified, cloned, sequenced and was used for tobacco transformation. The sequence analysis by BLAST showed that this promoter sequence has five common regions (CRI-CR 5) of different sizes (25 - 71 bp) which are repeated at 3 - 5 other locations in 30 Kb region in which this gene driven by its promoter is located. Interestingly all the genes driven by promoter harboring varying number of these' common regions are GLPs/putative germins. These common regions were analyzed and found to contain some important regulatory elements. Analysis of the 30 kb germin/GLP clustered region by GenScan detected each gene to have a putative 40 bp promoter containing TATA box and Dof factor {{which turned out to}} be a part of CR 2. An attempt was also made to improve electroporation efficiency into EHA 10 l and LBA 4404 strains of Agrobacterium by modifying the existing method for electroporation to improve electroporation efficiency. Multiple electric shocks ranging from 1 - 5 at a constant high voltage (20 KV/cm) for ~ 10 ms with inter-pulse duration of - 15 seconds was used and found to be more effective than increasing the voltage and/or time as later can cause decrease in cell viability resulting in subsequent low transformation efficiency. It was observed that both EHA 10 l and LBA 4404 behaves equally well in response to multiple electric shocks. Cloned OsRGLP 2 promoter region was ligated into p 1391 Z for expression vector construct preparation. The expression construct was transferred into ERA 101 by the modified method of electroporation. ERA 101 harboring OsRGLP 2 promoter construct was used for transformation of tobacco by leaf disks method. Transformed plants were analyzed under different stress conditions like temperature; dehydration, salt, and effect of plant growth regulator were also monitored. Transgenic plants were also used for the analysis of tissue specific activity of OsRGLP 2 promoter. One of the striking and more important properties of OsRGLP 2 promoter analyzed was the wound induced activity, which seems to increases with the passage of time. This is the first report about GLPs that they may have role in response to wounding. It was also observed that OsRGLP 2 promoter is salt and dehydration inducible. Furthermore, temperature seems to have no effect on this promoter activity. Moreover, OsRGLP 2 promoter is responsive to cytokinin, which is also a new property of a GLP promoter. In contrast to cytokinin, auxin has almost no effect on OsRGLP 2 promoter induction. OsRGLP 2 promoter activity was observed in inner and outer phloem of mid rib, at petiole stem junction, phloem, cortical cells adjacent to phloem, epidermal layer cells and epidermal hairs in stem, in young xylem cells, phloem cells and cortical cells adjacent to phloem in root, in petals veins while in sepals it was diffused and at the growing edges, no activity was observed in leaf mid <b>rib,</b> <b>blade</b> and apex of mature and young leaves. Microscopic analysis showed clear GUS expression in veins of leaf disks treated with salt stress while in all other treatments (temperature, dehydration, plant growth regulator) it was diffused.

Samples of the Longissimus dorsi muscle {{at the level of}} the tenth rib were taken at the butchery in order to carry out a proximal chemical analysis. The average percentage of protein was 18. 6, which turned out to be 7. 5 % lower than the one reported by others authors.

40|$|An {{automatic}} three-dimensional non-rigid registration {{scheme is}} proposed {{in this paper}} and applied to thoracic computed tomography (CT) data of patients with stage III {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). According to the registration scheme, initially anatomical set of points such as the vertebral spine, the <b>ribs,</b> and shoulder <b>blades</b> are automatically segmented slice by slice from the two CT scans of the same patient in order to serve as interpolant points. Based on these extracted features, a rigid-body transformation is then applied to provide a pre-registration of the data. To establish correspondence between the feature points, the novel application of the self-organizing maps (SOMs) is adopted. In particular, the automatic correspondence of the interpolant points is based on the initialization of the Kohonen neural network model capable to identify 500 corresponding pairs of points approximately in the two CT sets. Then, radial basis functions (RBFs) using the shifted log function is subsequently employed for elastic warping of the image volume, using the correspondence between the interpolant points, as obtained in the previous phase. Quantitative and qualitative results are also presented to validate the performance of the proposed elastic registration scheme resulting in an alignment error of 6 mm, on average, over 15 CT paired datasets. Finally, changes of the tumor volume in respect to each reference dataset are estimated for all patients, which indicate inspiration and/or movement of the patient during acquisition of the data. Thus, the practical implementation of this scheme could provide estimations of lung tumor volumes during radiotherapy treatment planning. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} if and how group-lessons in the Feldenkrais Method (ATM-lessons) have a positive impact on the learning process in singing and performance. The method is an example of a learning process with a somatic approach. The use of the method is a well known and established instrument to achieve elasticity, flexibility and functionality in body and mind, that is, in the skeleton and nervous system. The study was carried out as a long term observation study with focus on four singers’ observations regarding their own voices in singing. The matters to investigate were singing technique, musical interpretation and musical communication. Beside the student’s own observations the investigation was based on interviews. This material was analyzed later with a phenomenological approach. Using the method, bringing up unaware movements and unconscious thinking to a level of awareness and conscious thinking and acting through differentiation, gives as result many interesting phenomena. Full breath and expressive singing are the two core categories extracted emerging from the following categories: working procedure, differentiation, intention, aspects of time bringing about effects in form of an increased kinesthetic awareness, deep sensibility, increased resonance and an open mind. The impact on the learning process in singing is both philosophical and concrete. The non-judging way of exploring without assessment is preventing performance anxiety since you become aware of your behavioral patterns, possibilities and wishes. A released thorax with full flexibility in <b>ribs,</b> clavicles, shoulder <b>blades</b> gives access to a full and extended singer’s breath. It is also obvious that elaboration with patterns of behavior and thinking together with linguistic phenomena also opens the entrance to expressive singing. Hence the conclusion is that the Feldenkrais Method can serve as a valuable tool for singers in their learning process and to improve the art of performing and communication as well...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} using 103 male and female lambs from the following genetic groups: Santa Inês (SS) purebred and Santa Inês &# 215; Texel (TS), Santa Inês &# 215; Ile de France (FS), and Santa Inês &# 215; Bergamacia (BS) crossbred. The animals were slaughtered at the following body weights: 15, 25, 35 or 45 kg. After slaughter and cooling of the carcasses, the following cuts were made: neck, rib/flank, short <b>ribs,</b> loin, <b>blade,</b> and hind limb. The composition in muscle, bone and fat of cuts and ½ carcass were evaluated. The alometric growth of each tissue of the loin, shoulder and leg {{in relation to the}} cut weight, and of each tissue of the ½ carcass in relation to the cold carcass weight, was measured. The allometric growth of muscles in the ½ carcass, for BS males and FS and BS females, was early (b 1), except shoulder fat in BS males, with isogonic growth (b= 1). The growth rate of shoulder muscles in SS and FS males, SS and TS females was isogonic (b= 1); for TS and BS males, FS and BS females, it was early (b< 1). The muscle development in the loin from SS, FS and BS males, and females FS, was isogonic (b= 1); for TS males and SS, TS and BS females, it was negative heterogonic (b< 1). The allometric growth of the muscle in the loin from SS, TS and FS, and SS and TS females, was isogonic (b= 1); and for BS males and TS and BS females, it was negative heterogonic (b< 1) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{aerodynamic}} performance of a semi-flexible membrane blade, fluid–structure interaction simulations have been performed for a non-rotating blade under steady inflow condition. The studied concept blade has a length of about 5  m. It consists of a rigid mast at the leading edge, <b>ribs</b> along the <b>blade,</b> tensioned edge cables at the trailing edge and membranes forming {{the upper and lower}} surface of the blade. Equilibrium shape of membrane structures in the absence of external loading depends on the location of the supports and the prestresses in the membranes and the supporting edge cables. Form-finding analysis is used to find the equilibrium shape. The exact form of a membrane structure for the service conditions depends on the internal forces and also on the external loads, which in turn depend on the actual shape. As a result, two-way coupled fluid–structure interaction (FSI) analysis is necessary to study this class of structures. The fluid problem has been modelled using two different approaches, which are the vortex panel method and the numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. Nonlinear analysis of the structural problem is performed using the finite-element method. The goal of the current study is twofold: first, to make a comparison between the converged FSI results obtained from the two different methods to solve the fluid problem. This investigation is a prerequisite for the development of an efficient and accurate multi-fidelity simulation concept for different design stages of the flexible blade. The second goal is {{to study the}} aerodynamic performance of the membrane blade in terms of lift and drag coefficient as well as lift-to-drag ratio and to compare them with those of the equivalent conventional rigid blade. The blade configuration from the NASA-Ames Phase VI rotor is taken as the baseline rigid-blade configuration. The studied membrane blade shows a higher lift curve slope and higher lift-to-drag ratio compared with the rigid blade...|$|R

Os danos causados pelas doenças de etiologia fitoplasmática são relevantes e podem ocorrer em diversas espécies economicamente importantes. Em videira, pesquisas {{realizadas}} em várias partes do mundo têm relatado a presença das doenças do tipo amarelo, porém, no Brasil, estas doenças ainda não foram relatadas para esta cultura. Em vinhedos comerciais localizados nos Estados de São Paulo e Paraná têm sido observadas plantas com sintomas semelhantes àqueles provocados por fitoplasmas em outros países. Estes sintomas têm sido caracterizados por amarelecimento e ou avermelhamento foliar, necrose do limbo e rachaduras nas nervuras principais. Com o objetivo de detectar e identificar molecularmente fitoplasmas associados a estes tipos de sintomas, folhas e ramos foram amostrados a partir de plantas sintomática e assintomáticas. A detecção foi conduzida com PCR duplo usando-se os iniciadores R 16 mF 1 /mR 2 ou P 1 /P 7 na primeira reação e R 16 F 2 n/R 2 na segunda reação. A identificação foi realizada através de PCR duplo com iniciadores específicos e análises de RFLP com as enzimas de restrição AluI, RsaI, KpnI, MseI, HhaI, HpaII, HinfI e MboI. Em 23 plantas amostradas, fitoplasmas foram detectados em 10 delas, através da amplificação do 16 S rDNA, visualizado em gel de agarose na forma de bandas de 1, 2 Kb. A identificação por PCR demonstrou que os fitoplasmas associados ao amarelo da videira pertenciam aos grupos 16 SrI e 16 SrIII. As análises dos perfis eletroforéticos obtidos com o uso da técnica de RFLP revelaram a presença de fitoplasmas afiliados ao subgrupo 16 SrI-B. A constatação de fitoplasmas pertencentes a estes dois grupos nas plantas amostradas demonstraram a ocorrência da doença conhecida como amarelo da videira nos Estados de São Paulo e Paraná. As pesquisas desenvolvidas neste trabalho vêm contribuir para aumentar os conhecimentos sobre o papel e a diversidade dos fitoplasmas no agroecossistema brasileiro. Yellows {{diseases are}} associated with phytoplasmas, wall-less prokaryotes, inhabitant of phloem vessels. Damage caused by these diseases are relevant for some important cultivated botanical species. Grapevine yellows diseases have been observed in several areas of the world, but in Brazil {{the presence of these}} diseases had not been reported yet. In vineyards located in São Paulo and Paraná States, plants exhibiting symptoms similar those observed in grapevines from other countries have been observed. The symptoms were characterized by yellowing or redding of leaf <b>blade</b> and <b>ribs,</b> leaf <b>blade</b> necrosis and main ribs fissures. In order to detect and identify phytoplasmas associated with those kind of symptoms, leaves and stems were sampled from symptomatic and asymptomatic plants. The phytoplasma detection was conducted with nested PCR using the primer pairs R 16 mF 1 /mR 2 or P 1 /P 7 for first reaction and 16 F 2 n/R 2 for second reaction. The identification was carried out by nested PCR with group-specifc primer pairs and RFLP analyses with enzymes AluI, RsaI, KpnI, MseI, HhaI, HpaII, HinfI and MboI. From a total of 23 samples analysed, phytoplasmas were detected in 10 of them, through amplification of the 16 S rDNA, visualized through a 1. 2 Kb band in agarose gel. The identification by PCR demonstrated that phytoplasmas associated with grapevine yellow belong to 16 SrI and 16 SrIII groups. Analyses of electrophoretic profiles revealed the presence of phytoplasmas affiliated to 16 SrI-B subgroup. The presence of phytoplasmas belonging to these two groups in the sampled plants demonstrated the occurrence of yellow disease in grapevine in São Paulo and Paraná States. The investigation conducted in the present work contributed to the knowledgement of the role and the diversity of phytoplasmas in Brasilian ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} {{have raised}} concerns in consumer’s minds about food safety associated with meat world-wide. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) both exist in Canada and consumer markets for beef, bison, elk and deer {{may have been}} affected by the diseases. While numerous studies have examined Canadian consumer beef purchasing behavior in the presence of BSE (Lomeli (2005), John(2007)), no examination {{of the impact of the}} animal diseases on consumer behavior for households who consume bison, elk and venison as part of their protein intake has been undertaken. In this study, meat consumption behavior for these specific households is examined, in particular, examining meat substitution possibilities between the exotic meats and domestic meats such as beef, pork, chicken, turkey and seafood. CWD was discovered on a Canadian elk farm in 1996 (CFIA) and since has been found on deer and elk farms and in the wild in Saskatchewan and Alberta. While to date no bison have been found with BSE, many of the trade bans put in place at the time of BSE have affected the bison market and consumers may associate bison with BSE through media coverage of the disease and trade barriers. In addition to examining the possible links between food safety concerns and consumption, the demographic characteristics of the households who consume exotic meats, and their responses to relative prices and other economic variables are modelled. No other empirical study exists on Canadian revealed meat purchasing behavior focused on these specific meats. Hobbs et al (2006) examined the potential market for bison in Canada. There are a number of past studies investigating the impact of food safety information reported in the media and product recalls on food demand. For many recent studies of consumers’ behavior associated with meat demand and food safety concerns, the linear approximate almost-ideal demand system (AIDS) model has been popular and used. In this study, the behaviour of selected households that include bison, elk and venison meat as part of their total meat consumption will be examined. The revealed impact of BSE and CWD incidences on these household’s behavior will be examined using a linear approximate almost-ideal demand system (LA/AIDS) model. Using theoretical concepts, model development can be explained as follow. First the usual LA/AIDS budget share demand functions using a Stone price index to avoid non-linearity are developed. To represent a system of demand functions, a set of three theoretical restrictions – homogeneity, symmetry and adding-up – are imposed and tested. To capture the influence of demographic and food safety factors, like BSE and CWD incidence, on meat consumption, Pollak and Wales (1981) proposed linking the demographic characteristics to the AIDS model as translation tools (Jones et al, 2003). Therefore, following the demographic translating method, demographic data and BSE, CWD media information (collected from tracking print media coverage of the two animal diseases from a national newspaper, in this case from the “Globe and Mail (Canada) ”) are incorporated into the LA/AIDS model and the extended demand function can be expressed as follows:, where, is the budget (expenditure) share of the ith good; is the intercept net of demographic and food safety effects; is the demographic variables and food safety media indices; are the prices deflated by CPI; and ln Y is the log of total expenditure. In this study, eight types of meats – Bison, Elk, Venison, Beef, Pork, Chicken, Turkey, and Seafood – are used and from the adding up property of the LA/AIDS demand system, one expenditure share equation (seafood) from the system is excluded. Using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation procedures, the above equations are estimated simultaneously. This study used annually aggregated Homescan™ household data (ACNielsen) for the years 2002 to 2008. The price data for bison, elk and venison are from ACNielsen Market TRack. Bison prices are computed as an average of retail prices of ground bison, roast bison and steak bison. For elk and venison, the annual average retail price of all types of elk and venison are calculated. Since there are no regional price indices for bison, elk and venison, the prices used for bison, elk and venison are the same for all provinces. Chicken and turkey regional retail prices are obtained through Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) web page. For beef and pork, national retail prices are derived as follows: the national retail prices of beef are computed as an average of prices of round steak, sirloin steak, prime <b>rib</b> roast, <b>blade</b> roast, stewing beef and ground beef. The national retail price of pork is approximated by the price of pork chops. In the next step, regional beef and pork retail prices are calculated by multiplying national retail prices of beef and pork with the regional price indices of beef and pork divided by the national price indices of beef and pork. The media coverage for BSE and CWD cases were collected from the Globe and Mail (Canada) through Factiva. com’s search criteria. For the household demographic data, dummy variables are used for the data defined in index numbers, which are language, region, household size, age of children, education of household head, and location (rural or urban). The midpoints are used for demographic data defined in value terms, such as the age of household head and household income. Because households who consumed the above exotic meats are not the same in all years, an unbalanced panel data for 2002 to 2008 was used in this study. Among total households (9304) surveyed by ACNielsen in 2006, only 7. 4 percent consumed these exotic meats. If the sample for 2006 in the analysis is compared to the total population from 2006 census of Canada, for example, the sample contains 66 (34) percent of households with size less than or equal to 2 members (greater than or equal to 3 members), while 2006 census population exhibits a breakdown of 60 (40) percent. Similarly, for the sample, data on children’s age and being present in the family, the sample contains 30 (71) percent for the presence of children 18 years and under (none), which is a close representation of the 2006 census population of 26 (74) percent. Meat expenditure shares for bison (3 %), elk (2 %) and venison (2 %) are relatively low as compared to those of beef (35 %), pork (18 %), chicken (26 %), turkey (6 %) and seafood (7 %) in the 2006 surveyed data. However, a significant increasing trend in expenditure share from 2002 to 2008 can be observed for bison (2 to 4 percent), elk and venison (0. 6 to 3 percent). A decreasing trend in beef (41 to 34 percent), pork (19 to 17 percent), chicken (27 to 25 percent), and a slightly increasing trend for turkey (4 to 5 percent) and seafood (5 to 8 percent) are also observed for the sampled households. Therefore, exotic meat types are tending to be consumed slightly more replacing domestic meat types beef, pork and chicken. From the results, it can be observed that all the own price elasticities have negative signs and expenditure elasticities have positive signs as a priori expectation showing the right curvature of underlying expenditure function and downward sloping demand (expenditure share) functions. Since the expenditure elasticities for beef, pork and chicken are slightly greater than 1, we may say that they are normal good to slightly luxury goods. Seafood, turkey, bison, elk and venison are normal to necessity goods. More interesting factors can be figured out from the results of demographic characteristics and BSE/CWD media indices. For example, 1) preferences for meat types are different across provinces; 2) pork and turkey are preferred by more English speaking people than French speaking people; 3) the larger the household size, the more elk and venison will be consumed; 4) the households with children under 18 consume less beef and more chicken; 5) elk, venison and turkey consumption increase and beef consumption decreases as income increases; 6) higher educated household heads choose more chicken, seafood and less elk, venison and pork; 7) urban people prefer more pork and less seafood; and 8) consumption will switch from beef/bison to elk/venison/turkey at the time of BSE reports and vice versa for CWD reports.
