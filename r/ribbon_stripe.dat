40|$|Wood is a {{very popular}} and {{preferred}} material for many applications because of its remarkable decorative peculiarities. A very interesting feature related to the appearance of wood is called <b>ribbon</b> <b>stripe</b> or stripe figure. Stripe figure {{is perceived as a}} series of longitudinal parallel stripes which alternate in colour shade. When the sample is slightly rotated, the bright stripes become dark and vice versa. This gonio-apparent effect provides the wood with a very dynamic appearance, distinguishing the material from alternatives such as laminate. In this paper, stripe figure is quantified by measuring and analyzing the absolute spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for different incident and viewing angle combinations. In a first step, perpendicular illumination is used and the viewing angle is varied in four half planes. Asymmetric BRDF values are found if the observation plane is parallel with the ribbon direction, in contrast to the behaviour in the plane perpendicular to it. In a second experiment, both incident and viewing angle are changed simultaneously, simulating the general observer behaviour when assessing the appearance of the sample. Important differences in lightness between two adjacent positions on the sample are recorded when slightly rotating the sample around an axis perpendicular to the ribbon pattern, revealing the characteristic contrast flop. Again, if the other rotation direction is chosen, almost no variation is observed. These observations {{can be attributed to the}} particular orientation of the fibres in combination with the external reflectance at the finishing top layer. Analogous effects are present in the hue, especially on the yellow-blue axis, but are almost absent on the red-green axis. The quantitative results reported in this paper can be used for camera-based selection of wood samples and to improve the quality of computer renderings of these natural materials. status: publishe...|$|E

Each ribbon class also had three light blue vertical <b>ribbon</b> <b>stripes</b> {{in the center of the}} ribbon.|$|R
50|$|The medal was {{a bronze}} cross with an {{enamelled}} roundel in the centre bearing a lion's head, suspended from a ribbon. The ribbons of the Bronze Cross differed in colour {{according to the}} service in which the recipient was enlisted; thus Army awards had a red ribbon with three white stripes; Air Force awards a purple <b>ribbon</b> with <b>stripes</b> and Guard Force awards a brown <b>ribbon</b> with <b>stripes.</b> The medal was impressed in small capitals with the recipient's name on the reverse, and was awarded with a case of issue, miniature medal for wear, and an illuminated certificate.|$|R

40|$|Finescale probes of many complex {{electronic}} {{materials have}} revealed a non-uniform nanoworld of sign-varying textures in strain, charge and magnetization, forming meandering <b>ribbons,</b> <b>stripe</b> segments or droplets. We introduce and simulate a Ginzburg-Landau {{model for a}} structural transition, with strains coupling to charge and magnetization. Charge doping acts as a local stress that deforms surrounding unit cells without generating defects. This seemingly innocuous constraint of elastic `compatibility', in fact induces crucial anisotropic long-range forces of unit-cell discrete symmetry, that interweave opposite-sign competing strains to produce polaronic elasto-magnetic textures in the composite variables. Simulations with random local doping below the solid-solid transformation temperature reveal rich multiscale texturing from induced elastic fields: nanoscale phase separation, mesoscale intrinsic inhomogeneities, textural cross-coupling to external stress and magnetic field, and temperature-dependent percolation. We describe how this composite textured polaron concept can be valuable for doped manganites, cuprates and other complex electronic materials. Comment: Preprin...|$|R

50|$|The War Merit Cross Kriegsverdienstkreuz) {{also known}} as the Ernst-Augustkreuz, was a {{military}} decoration of the Duchy of Brunswick. The Cross was established 23 October 1914 by Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick. The cross was awarded to all ranks for distinction in war. On 20 March 1918, a first class of the Cross was created in pinback form, with the existing Cross becoming the second class. This brought the Cross in line with awards of other German States like Prussia with the Iron Cross. The cross was awarded on a blue <b>ribbon</b> with yellow <b>stripes</b> for combatants and on a yellow <b>ribbon</b> with blue <b>stripes</b> for non-combatants.|$|R

(FELICITY: [...] "I wasn't. I didn't think it one bit pretty." [...] CECILY: [...] "Hush!") I hunted everywhere but I couldn't find it. Next day was Sunday and I was running into the house {{by the front door}} and I saw SOMETHING LYING ON THE STEP and I thought it was my ribbon and I made a grab at it as I passed. But, oh, it was A SNAKE! Oh, I can never describe how I felt when I felt that awful thing WRIGGLING IN MY HAND. I let it go and SCREAMED AND SCREAMED, and ma was cross at me for yelling on Sunday and made me read seven chapters in the Bible but I didn't mind that much after what I had come through. I would rather DIE than have SUCH AN EXPERIENCE again.|$|R
