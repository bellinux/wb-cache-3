5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
25|$|During this infant {{commercial}} development, many incorrectly {{predicted that}} the moving images of fluoroscopy would completely replace roentgenographs (radiographic still image films), but the then superior diagnostic quality of the roentgenograph and their already alluded safety enhancement of lower radiation dose via shorter exposure prevented this from occurring. Another factor was that plain films inherently offered recording of the image in a simple and inexpensive way, whereas <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> of fluoroscopy remained a more complex and expensive proposition {{for decades to come}} (discussed in detail below).|$|E
25|$|Delicate {{sounds and}} fine overtones were mostly lost, {{because it took}} a lot of sound energy to vibrate the {{recording}} horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E

25|$|In 1885, {{when the}} Volta Associates were {{sure that they}} had a number of {{practical}} inventions, they filed patent applications and also began to seek out investors. They were granted Canadian and U.S. patents for the Graphophone in 1885 and 1886 respectively. The Graphophone was originally intended for business use as a dictation <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> machine. The Graphophone Company of Alexandria, Virginia, was created on January6,1886 and formally incorporated on February3,1886 by another of Bell's cousins. It was formed to control the patents and to handle the commercial development of their numerous sound recording and reproduction inventions, one of which became the first dictation machine, the 'Dictaphone'.|$|E

500|$|The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. According to film {{historian}} Rachael Low, [...] "Many in {{the industry}} realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable." [...] On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (I Kiss Your Hand, Madame). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{important}} quality advances in recordings specifically made for radio broadcast. In the early 1930s Bell Telephone Laboratories and Western Electric announced the total reinvention of disc recording: the Western Electric Wide Range System, [...] "The New Voice of Action". The {{intent of the}} new Western Electric system was to improve {{the overall quality of}} disc <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback.</b> The recording speed was rpm, originally used in the Western Electric/ERPI movie audio disc system implemented in the early Warner Brothers' Vitaphone [...] "talkies" [...] of 1927.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "high fidelity" [...] {{was coined}} in the 1920s by some {{manufacturers}} of radio receivers and phonographs to differentiate their better-sounding products claimed as providing [...] "perfect" [...] sound reproduction. The term {{began to be}} used by some audio engineers and consumers through the 1930s and 1940s. After 1949 a variety of improvements in <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> technologies, especially stereo recordings, which became widely available in 1958, gave a boost to the [...] "hi-fi" [...] classification of products, leading to sales of individual components for the home such as amplifiers, loudspeakers, phonographs, and tape players. High Fidelity and Audio were two magazines that hi-fi consumers and engineers could read for reviews of playback equipment and recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Many delay {{processors}} {{based on}} analog tape recording, such as Ray Butts' EchoSonic (1952), Mike Battle's Echoplex (1959), or the Roland Space Echo (1973), used magnetic tape as their <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> medium. Electric motors guided a tape loop through a device {{with a variety}} of mechanisms allowing modification of the effect's parameters. In the case of the popular Echoplex EP-2, the [...] play head was fixed, while a combination record and erase head was mounted on a slide, thus the delay time of the echo was adjusted by changing the distance between the record and play heads. In the Space Echo, all of the heads are fixed, but the speed of the tape could be adjusted, changing the delay time. Thin magnetic tape was not entirely suited for continuous operation, however, so the tape loop had to be replaced {{from time to time to}} maintain the audio fidelity of the processed sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Fluoroscopy (...) is an imaging {{technique}} that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope (...) allows a physician to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched. This is useful for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, since the 1950s most fluoroscopes have included X-ray image intensifiers and cameras as well, to improve the image's visibility and make it available on a remote display screen. For many decades fluoroscopy tended to produce live pictures that were not recorded, but since the 1960s, as technology improved, <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>playback</b> became the norm.|$|E
