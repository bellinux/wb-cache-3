50|$|Laurel Hall {{stands on}} the north side of Patton Street, between Main and Dwight Streets just north of Interstate 291. Now {{predominantly}} a commercial area, it was a tree-lined residential street when Laurel Hall and the adjacent Ethel Apartment House were built in the 1910s. It is a four story Classical Revival structure, built using yellow brick (in light and dark shades), with brownstone trim and a decorated metal cornice. The ground floor begins with a half-story of rusticated brownstone, and continues with dark yellow brick with <b>recessed</b> <b>spacing</b> every few rows to provide horizontal emphasis. A brownstone belt-course separates the first floor from those above. Recessed panels of dark brick are set between the windows of the 2nd through 4th floors, and there are vertical dark brick pilasters framing the central bays. Windows are trimmed with brownstone lintels and sills.|$|R

50|$|The {{brightly lit}} interiors, as mentioned, have the {{bedrooms}} on the ‘quiet’ {{side and a}} spacious living-room with {{direct access to the}} balcony; kitchen, separate WC and bathroom give onto this private <b>recessed</b> <b>space.</b> Kitchen and living room are linked by a large serving hatch/dresser with double doors. The sequence of bedroom walls is staggered relative to the bathroom-kitchen-living room side, providing diagonal views that increase the sensation of space. This effect is particularly striking in the direct connection from living room to the third bedroom. Precast concrete window-frames project externally and internally; their bevelled or splayed profile (repeated in the free-standing rectangular 'triumphal arch' at the entry) again accentuates the space and light.|$|E

5000|$|Punchcutting: If the glyph design {{includes}} {{enclosed spaces}} (counters) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief (cameo) onto {{the end of}} a rectangular bar of mild steel using a specialized engraving tool called a graver. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching (tempering), or exposure to a cyanide solution (case hardening). The counterpunch is then struck against {{the end of a}} similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as <b>recessed</b> <b>spaces</b> (intaglio). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive smoke proofs; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.|$|R

40|$|ASHRAE Transactions 2002, Honolulu, HI, 22 - 26 June 2002 This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of {{an investigation into the}} effectiveness of a low-cost measure for mitigating the problem of deteriorated energy performance of air conditioners in high-rise residential buildings that reject condenser heat simultaneously into recessed spaces outside the buildings. The measure involves installing a horizontal plate at mid-height in the <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> to direct the hot air from below to flow outside the <b>recessed</b> <b>space,</b> allowing relatively cool outdoor air to flow into the <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> above the plate, leading to an improvement of the average performance of all air conditioners. The study was performed using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, with reference to a 30 -story residential building in Hong Kong and to the worst scenario in summer with all air conditioners rejecting heat in to the <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> simultaneously under the full-load condition. It was found that the plate would lower the temperature rise of the air, from the fee outdoor condition to the inlet condition at air-conditioner condensers, by around 30 % on average. Furthermore, when the plate is moved closer to the next higher (the 16 th story) condenser, a further reduction in the air temperature rise by 6 % could be achieved.

40|$|Recessed spaces {{formed by}} the {{external}} walls of adjacent residential flats can be found outside many high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. During summer, {{a large number of}} window-type air-conditioners could be rejecting condenser heat into such a <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> at the same time, when a powerful rising hot air stream is formed in this space. This paper describes the findings for recessed spaces of 'l' type for a 30 -story building. Inside the <b>recessed</b> <b>space,</b> one window-type air-conditioner is located per one story with its position that corresponds to the minimum dimensions prescribed by the HK-BEAM (Hong Kong Building Environmental Assessment Method) recipes. Prediction of the temperature and flow field in this space is performed by using FLUENT 5. 0, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The development of detailed flow and temperature field inside the <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> reveals existence of the hot 'Γ' shape bulk air stream together with one strong vortex pair. The mass flow rate and temperature of air inside the <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> increases and entrainment of fresh air decreases with its height. For the highest condenser units at the inlet to the condenser coils, the temperature elevation of the air increases above 8 °C, and its mass flow rate falls up to 40 % below its nominal value. For the lowest units, this mass flow rate may be up to 12 % higher than its nominal value. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of the Byzantine enamel art occurred between the 6th and 12th centuries. The Byzantines perfected a form of enameling called cloisonné, where gold strips are soldered to a metal base plate making the outline of an image. The <b>recessed</b> <b>spaces</b> between the gold filigreed wire are then filled with a colored glass paste, or flux, that fills up the negative space in the design with whatever color chosen. Byzantine enamels usually depict a person of interest, often {{a member of the}} imperial family or a Christian icon. Enamels, because they are created from expensive materials such as gold, are often very small. Occasionally they are made into medallions that act as decorative jewelry or are set in ecclesiastical designs such as book covers, liturgical equipment like the chalice and paten, or in some examples, royal crowns. Collections of small enamels may be set together to make a larger, narrative display, such as in the Pala d'Oro altarpiece. Many of the examples of Byzantine enamel known today have been repurposed into a new setting, making dating particularly difficult where no inscriptions or identifiable persons are visible. The Latin Crusaders, who sacked Constantinople in 1204, took many examples of Byzantine enamel with them back West. The destruction of Constantinople meant that the production of enamel artwork went into downfall in the 13th century. It is possible that many examples left in the city were melted down and repurposed by the Ottoman Empire, who cared little about the religious significance of the art and could reuse the gold but not the glass.|$|R

40|$|Recessed {{spaces are}} {{essential}} for high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. During the summer, they allow the discharge of heat from residential air-conditioners; throughout the year, they enable natural lighting and natural ventilation. Investigations are reported on the dynamic flow inside a 30 -story-high <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> for different amounts of waste heat (different sizes of cooled rooms) by window-type air-conditioners. Predictions based on a computational fluid dynamics code showed that when waste heat per air-conditioner is R = 2 kW, mechanical cooling is efficient (coefficient of performance, COP ≅ 3. 1). However, when the waste heat increases, a buoyant air stream inside the <b>recessed</b> <b>space</b> becomes hotter and more powerful. Condenser units draw hotter air from this air stream, and their efficiency drops. In addition, this air stream strongly obstructs airflows through condenser units and natural ventilation through flats. The usability, efficiency and comfort of buildings will benefit from an enhanced understanding of the dynamic relationships between {{the configuration of the}} recessed exterior space, the amounts of waste heat discharged into it and the configuration of internal rooms.

The predictions by using FLUENT 5. 0, a computational fluid dynamics code, show that presence of one plate inside the space would cause the overall excess temperature at condenser entrance to fall up to 30 %. The presence of two plates would make this figure to be around 40 %. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
