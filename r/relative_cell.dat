40|$|The Producer Price Index (PPI) is {{a monthly}} {{estimate}} of average {{changes in prices}} received by domestic producers {{of goods and services}} in all stages of processing. Each month the PPI requests data for over 100, 000 price quotes. For those data not received, the PPI must estimate a value {{to be used in the}} index. In this paper we investigated whether there is an added advantage in terms of the estimates by using only the weighted relatives of items in a cell with similar products to estimate an item’s missing price, or to use higher aggregate <b>cell</b> <b>relatives</b> comprised of different product cells. We discovered that the proposed method of estimating missing prices using detailed product <b>cell</b> <b>relatives</b> is superior to using the aggregated product <b>cell</b> <b>relatives</b> only in cases where there are enough items, usually greater than 10, in a cell; otherwise, using aggregates of these product <b>cell</b> <b>relatives</b> produces more accurate estimates...|$|R
50|$|The {{category}} of topological spaces, Top, admits a standard model category structure {{with the usual}} (Serre) fibrations and with weak equivalences as weak homotopy equivalences.

This structure is not unique; in general there can be many model category structures on a given category.

(The cofibrations for this model structure {{can be described as}} the retracts of <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> complexes X ⊂ Y.) By definition, a continuous mapping f: X → Y of spaces is called a weak homotopy equivalence if the induced function on sets of path componentsis bijective, and for every point x in X and every n ≥ 1, the induced homomorphismon homotopy groups is bijective.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} if a coculture system of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) with endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVEC) could modulate the phenotype and proliferation of harvested MSCs. In addition to previous investigations on the crosstalk between these two cell types, in the present work different <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> ratios were analyzed for long, therapeutically relevant, culture periods. Moreover, MSCs osteogenic commitment was assessed in a non-osteogenic medium and {{in the presence of}} HUVECs through magnetic cell separation, cell quantification by flow cytometry, morphology by fluorescent microscopy, metabolic activity and gene expression of osteogenic markers. Collectively, the present findings demonstrate that, by coculturing MSCs with HUVECs, there was not only the promotion of osteogenic differentiation (and its enhancement, depending on the <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> ratios used), but also a significant increase on MSCs proliferation. This augmentation in cell proliferation occurred independently of <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> ratios, but was favored by higher relative amounts of HUVECs. Taken together, this data suggests that HUVECs not only modulate MSC phenotype but also their proliferation rate. Therefore, a coculture system of MSCs and HUVECs can a have a broad impact on bone tissue engineering approaches...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{restoration}} {{efforts in}} reclaimed coal mining areas {{have included the}} flooding of shallow strip mines, creating patches of wetland with special chemical characteristics, like Lost Lake in Southern Illinois. Sulfur compounds released from the underlying coal lead to elevated sulfur concentrations in the water as compared to most other freshwater systems. These higher concentrations of sulfur compounds are expected to affect the species distribution, abundance and activity of the biota that inhabit strip mine wetlands. To determine whether sulfur cycling microorganisms affect and are affected by these wetlands, pertinent chemical parameters such as sulfate, sulfide, organic and inorganic carbon, and oxygen were measured, along with fluorescent in situ hybridization to determine <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> abundances of sulfate reducing and sulfide oxidizing microorganisms. More significant differences for <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> abundances were observed between oxic and anoxic samples than with the seasons.

40|$|Background: This {{research}} {{was done to}} study the influence of Acalypha indica Linn root extract towards relative cell viability and proliferation as parameters of neurogenesis in post-hypoxic hippocampal tissue culture. Methods: Experimental in vitro study using 24 primary neuronal cell cultures obtained from adult Sprague Dawley  rat exposed to hypoxia with 5 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 /N 2 balance gas for 24 hours. Post-hypoxia, Acalypha indica Linn root extract was added at doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL to 3 treatment groups. No treatment {{was given to the}} control group.  Each group consists of 6 samples. After 90 hours of incubation, <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> viability was measured by using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) examination, and cell proliferation was measured by using 5 -bromo 2 ’-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) for cell proliferation. Data was analyzed using one way ANOVA parametric tests, then further analyzed with post-hoc analysis. Results: The <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> viability of rat hippocampal tissue culture treated with Acalypha indica Linn root extract with dose of 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL was significantly higher than control (176. 95 %, 220. 62 %, and 386. 02 % vs. 100 %).  Cell proliferation of rat hippocampal tissue culture treated with Acalypha indica Linn root extract with dose of 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL was significantly higher than control (0. 132, 0. 117, 0. 114 vs 0. 096). Conclusion: Acalypha indica Linn root extract with doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL can increase <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> viability and proliferation in post-hypoxic hippocampal tissue culture.
