40|$|Given the {{limitations}} of the present Shuttle manifest, it is necessary for NASA to consider revision of its previous strategy for servicing satellites. This is particularly important in a period of tight budgets, when space assets will be difficult to replace. Therefore on-orbit assets take on additional value and keeping these assets operational will take on added importance. The key to maintaining these assets will be the long term strategy of developing a <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> capability which is space based and has a minimum reliance on the Shuttle. Such a strategy will require that the users of this servicing system design serviceable spacecraft at a high level and that these assets be located in or be capable of reaching orbits that are accessible to or compatible with the proposed servicing infrastructure. The infrastructure required to support this type of <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> architecture and the development of the necessary systems, tools, and procedures required to support a <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> architecture of this type are addressed...|$|E

40|$|The article {{studies the}} current state of the network of banks {{branches}} in Ukraine, identifies main reasons of reduction of the number of branches and branch departments, and identifies positive and negative consequences of this reduction for various subjects. Thus, in the course of recent years the banking system of Ukraine shows gradual reduction of branches and branch departments. Moreover, the number of bank departments reduces faster than the number of bank branches, taking also into account the fact that it is quite popular to transform banks branches into departments on a non-balance basis. In this event the main reasons of reduction of the network of banks branches are the following: tendency to reduce costs and increase the level of profitability of the banking activity, transfer to the <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> of clients, which does not require availability of a significant number of structural subdivisions of banks in the territory of the whole country and others. The author formulates consequences of reduction of the number of banks branches and departments with respect to three groups of subjects – for the banks themselves, for the banks’ clients and for the banks’ employees. It should be noted that the process of reduction of the network of banks branches is important and required today, but it brings negative consequences for some of the subjects. The author studies prospects of development of the network of banks branches in Ukraine and underlines the problem of transition of banks to <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> of clients. In particular, <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> of clients is popular today in the banking practice of developed countries, which requires mandatory introduction of their experience into the domestic practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{optimized}} conceptual {{engineering design}} of a space station tethered elevator is presented. The elevator is an unmanned mobile structure which operates on a ten kilometer tether spanning {{the distance between the}} Space Station and a tethered platform. Elevator capabilities include providing access to residual gravity levels, <b>remote</b> <b>servicing,</b> and transportation to any point along a tether. The potential uses, parameters, and evolution of the spacecraft design are discussed. Engineering development of the tethered elevator is the result of work conducted in the following areas: structural configurations; robotics, drive mechanisms; and power generation and transmission systems. The structural configuration of the elevator is presented. The structure supports, houses, and protects all systems on board the elevator. The implementation of robotics on board the elevator is discussed. Elevator robotics allow for the deployment, retrieval, and manipulation of tethered objects. Robotic manipulators also aid in hooking the elevator on a tether. Critical to the operation of the tethered elevator is the design of its drive mechanisms, which are discussed. Two drivers, located internal to the elevator, propel the vehicle along a tether. These modular components consist of endless toothed belts, shunt-wound motors, regenerative power braking, and computer controlled linear actuators. The designs of self-sufficient power generation and transmission systems are reviewed. Thorough research indicates all components of the elevator will operate under power provided by fuel cells. The fuel cell systems will power the vehicle at seven kilowatts continuously and twelve kilowatts maximally. A set of secondary fuel cells provides redundancy in the unlikely event of a primary system failure. Power storage exists in the form of Nickel-Hydrogen batteries capable of powering the elevator under maximum loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} space {{development}} has been examined {{in the context of}} the infrastructure necessary support it. It is concluded that the selection of propulsion systems for in-orbit transportation requires the development of general computer codes capable of simulating the use of a wide range of propulsion systems on near-Earth missions. It is also concluded that, even if limited infrastructural development occurs, polar orbiting spacecraft will be an important feature of future space activities. Replacing current single-use polar spacecraft with extended-life serviceable platforms is attractive. However, the very limited manned access polar orbits in the mid-term future suggests that such platforms will only be possible if remote telerobotic/autonomous servicing can be carried out. To this extent polar platforms are considered to provide a useful driver and first testbed for the development of technologies designed to extend human capability in those regimes where direct mediation is not possible. Options for such <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> are examined, the concept of performing nodal transfers by enhanced differential nodal drift is introduced and the application of electric propulsion to this discussed. Low-thrust orbital manoeuvres are analyzed in this context and the conditions for optimum nodal transfer defined. Particular service vehicle configurations are then defined against a projected infrastructure and baseline polar platform constellation. A model for the service vehicle is defined and its performance investigated using a number of electric propulsion systems. Simulations of transfer manoeuvres; have been carried out and the effects and relative importance of the various orbit perturbations identified. It is concluded that a service vehicle propelled by a Xenon ion system offers the capability required and two final configurations are identified characterising different servicing mission upload schemes...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{designs of}} nuclear fuel {{recycling}} plants {{are expected to}} include more ambitious goals for aqueous based separations including; higher separations efficiency, high-level waste minimization, and a greater focus on continuous processes to minimize cost and footprint. Therefore, Annular Centrifugal Contactors (ACCs) are destined to play a more important role for such future processing schemes. Previous efforts defined and characterized the performance of commercial 5 cm and 12. 5 cm single-stage ACCs in a “cold” environment. The next logical step, the design and evaluation of remote capable pilot scale ACCs in a “hot” or radioactive environment was reported earlier. This report includes the development of remote designs for ACCs that can process the large throughput rates needed in future nuclear fuel recycling plants. Novel designs were developed for the remote interconnection of contactor units, clean-in-place and drain connections, and a new solids removal collection chamber. A three stage, 12. 5 cm diameter rotor module has been constructed and evaluated for operational function and remote handling in highly radioactive environments. This design is scalable to commercial CINC ACC models from V- 05 to V- 20 with total throughput rates ranging from 20 to 650 liters per minute. The V- 05 R three stage prototype was manufactured by the commercial vendor for ACCs in the U. S., CINC mfg. It employs three standard V- 05 clean-in-place (CIP) units modified for remote service and replacement via new methods of connection for solution inlets, outlets, drain and CIP. Hydraulic testing and functional checks were successfully conducted and then the prototype was evaluated for remote handling and maintenance suitability. Removal and replacement of the center position V- 05 R ACC unit in the three stage prototype was demonstrated using an overhead rail mounted PaR manipulator. This evaluation confirmed the efficacy of this innovative design for interconnecting and cleaning individual stages while retaining the benefits of commercially reliable ACC equipment for remote applications in the nuclear industry. Minor modifications and suggestions for improved manual <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> by the remote handling specialists were provided but successful removal and replacement was demonstrated in the first prototype...|$|E
