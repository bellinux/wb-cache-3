The phase diagrams of two systems, DTA-DNA/MO/water and, for comparison, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) /MO/water, were obtained by visual inspection, microscopic examination under polarized light, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and deuterium NMR ((2) H NMR) at 298 K and normal pressure. The isothermal phase diagram of the DTA-DNA/MO/water system contains four liquid crystalline (LC) phase regions (reversed hexagonal, Pn 3 m, Ia 3 d, lamellar).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) {{is known}} to arrest {{autoimmune}} diabetes development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, CFA alone cannot induce effective remission in diabetic NOD mice. Previously, we reported that anti-CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL 10) antibody can promote beta-cell proliferation in NOD mice. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether anti-CXCL 10 plus CFA treatment can effectively reverse autoimmune diabetes development. METHODS: Systemic supply of anti-CXCL 10 antibody by CXCL 10 DNA vaccination in combination with CFA injection was performed in new-onset diabetic NOD mice. Remission rate of diabetes, histological characteristics of residual insulitis lesions, residual beta-cell mass, and regulatory T cell population in local pancreas were examined. RESULTS: A high frequency of diabetes reversal was observed after combination treatment with anti-CXCL 10 plus CFA. In mice showing diabetes reversal, residual beta-cell mass was significantly increased, and some beta-cells were in a proliferative state. Although systemic cytokine profiles were unaffected, the frequency of "hybrid regulatory T cells", i. e. regulatory T cells expressing CXCR 3, was significantly increased in local pancreatic lesions. This was possibly associated with the regulation of anti-islet autoimmunity.

40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{behavior of}} a cationic surfactant (dodecyltrimethylammonium, DTA) with DNA as counterion in mixtures of water and n-alcohols (decanol, octanol, hexanol, butanol, and ethanol) was investigated. The phase diagrams were established and the {{different regions of the}} phase diagram characterized with respect to microstructure by H- 2 NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and other techniques. The DNA-DTA surfactant is soluble in all of the studied alcohols, showing increased solubility from decanol down to ethanol. All of the phase diagrams are analogous with respect to the occurrence of liquid crystalline (LC) regions, but the area of the LC region increases as one goes from decanol to ethanol. In all phase diagrams, hexagonal phases (of the <b>reversed</b> <b>type)</b> for the alcohol-rich side and lamellar phases for the other side were detected. For balanced proportions of the components, there is a coexistence of the lamellar and the hexagonal phase, here detected with a double quadrupole splitting in the H- 2 NMR spectra. The correctness of the phase diagrams is confirmed by the fact that along the tie-lines the splitting magnitude remains nearly constant. All of the alcohols except for ethanol act as cosurfactants penetrating the DNA-DTA film. Adding salt to the ternary mixtures causes an increase in the unit cell dimension of the lamellar and the hexagonal phases. The phase diagram becomes more complicated when butanol is used for the alcohol phase. Here, there is the occurrence of a new isotropic phase with some properties analogous to those of the disordered sponge (L 3) phase obtained for simple surfactant systems...|$|E

We find that the running timeaveraged torque experienced by a protoplanet embedded in a non-isothermal turbulent disk is in good agreement with laminar disk models with appropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In disks with turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore behaves as in laminar viscous disks and can be responsible for significantly slowing down or <b>reversing</b> <b>Type</b> I migration...|$|R

30|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{potency of}} curcumin has been revealed by {{its ability to}} inhibit NF-κB activation, thus producing anti-catabolic effects. The inhibition of NF-κB by curcumin (50 μM) had significant effect on NF-κB-induced matrix degradation gene products (Csaki et al. 2009). This effect was shown {{in a study of}} a combination treatment with curcumin and resveratrol. Resveratrol or trans- 3, 5, 4 ′-trihydroxystibene is a polyphenolic, antifungal natural phytoalexin found in grapevines (Vitis vinifera) {{and a variety of other}} plants and has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Curcumin alone or in combination with resveratrol <b>reversed</b> <b>type</b> II collagen inhibition induced by IL- 1 β. The combination treatment with resveratrol produced a synergistic effect. Another study revealed that curcumin (50 μM) produced anti-catabolic effect by the inhibition of MMP- 9 through the inhibition of NF-κB activation (Shakibaei et al. 2007). The previously mentioned work with highly bioavailable curcumin (Mathy-Hartert et al. 2009) confirmed the anti-catabolic potency of curcumin in human chondrocytes by the inhibition of MMP- 3, but failed to modify aggrecan production. In addition, curcumin (0.1 - 100 μM) tested on equine cartilage explants stimulated with IL- 1 β (10 – 25 ng/ml) showed the suppression of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release (Clutterbuck et al. 2009). Anti-catabolic effects were also demonstrated in tenocytes (Buhrmann et al. 2011) by the inhibition of several matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) synthesis (MMP- 1, MMP- 9 and MMP- 13) induced by IL- 1 β. Thus curcumin might be able to reverse the imbalance between anabolic and catabolic factors that occur in OA joint tissues by reducing the catabolic part. By this way, curcumin could prevent cartilage degradation and promote the accumulation in the extracellular matrix of newly synthesized matrix components like aggrecan.|$|E

In this study, membrane activity and lipid composition of the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio sp. DSM 14379, grown aerobically in a peptone-yeast extract medium supplemented with 0. 5, 1. 76, 3, 5 or 10 % (w/v) NaCl, was determined. The ability of the membrane to reduce a spin label was studied by EPR spectroscopy under different salt concentrations in cell suspensions labeled with TEMPON. For lipid composition studies, cells were harvested in a late exponential phase and lipids were extracted with chloroform–methanol–water, 1 : 2 : 0. 8 (v/v). The lipid polar head group and acyl chain compositions were determined by thin-layer and gas–liquid chromatographies. 31 P-NMR spectroscopy was used to study the phase behaviour of the cell lipid extracts with 20 wt. % water contents in a temperature range from − 10 to 50 °C. The {{results indicate that the}} ability of the membrane to reduce the spin label was highest at optimal salt concentrations. The composition of both polar head groups and acyl chains changed markedly with increasing salinity. The fractions of 16 : 0, 16 : 1 and 18 : 0 acyl chains increased while the fraction of 18 : 1 acyl chains decreased with increasing salinity. The phosphatidylethanolamine fraction correlated inversely with the lysophosphatidylethanolamine fraction, with phosphatidylethanolamine exhibiting a minimum, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine a maximum, at the optimum growth rate. The fraction of lysophosphatidylethanolamine was surprisingly high in the lipid extracts. This lipid can form normal micellar and hexagonal phases and it was found that all lipid extracts form a mixture of lamellar and normal isotropic liquid crystalline phases. This is an anomalous behaviour since the nonlamellar phases formed by total lipid extracts are generally of the <b>reversed</b> <b>type...</b>|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 749 on 06. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) The role of free radicals and antioxidants in human disease, particularly cardiovascular disease {{is an area}} of intensive research. Diabetes mellitus is the most common condition associated with increased oxidative stress and accelerated atherosclerosis. Increased levels of lipid peroxides and diminished antioxidant vitamin status have been reported in diabetic patients and are also implicated in the chronic complications of diabetes. The autoxidation and glycoxidation reactions of glucose are sources of free radicals in vitro and a preliminary investigation that these reactions may be a source of free radicals in vivo was undertaken in patients admitted to hospital with severe hyperglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. Plasma lipid peroxides were elevated 2 - 7 fold above the reference range, but decreased during the recovery period in these patients. Plasma urate and ascorbate levels decreased rapidly, whilst interestingly, α-tocopherol levels /lipid ratios were preserved. The study indicated the resilient nature of the antioxidant defences in plasma, although further studies are required in order to elucidate fully the role of autoxidation and glycoxidation reactions in vivo. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are also tightly linked with atherogenesis in type II diabetes and weight loss in obese subjects plays an important part in the reversal of insulin resistance. The safety and efficacy of two weight loss interventions - very low calorie diet (VLCD) and intensive conventional dietetic (I CD) therapy - on cardiovascular risk factors and indices of oxidative stress were investigated in obese diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The ICD therapy produced modest weight loss in patients with established diabetes with transient improvements in diastolic blood pressure and plasma ascorbate, but with a reduction in vitamin E / serum lipid ratios. The VLCD produced large and rapid weight loss in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, lipid peroxides and vitamin E / serum lipid ratios, which were maintained after 12 months. Plasma ascorbate concentrations were significantly lower in diabetic patients than non-diabetic patients on the VLCD, indicating that formulated diets may require higher concentrations of vitamin C for diabetic patients and this requires further investigation. The VLCD successfully <b>reversed</b> <b>type</b> II diabetes and normalized plasma lipid peroxide levels in two newly diagnosed patients. South Devon Healthcare, Torbay Hospita...|$|E
