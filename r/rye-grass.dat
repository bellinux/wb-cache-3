60|$|You {{recollect}} the Lombards, of whom Tacitus says, 'Longobardos paucitas nobilitat.' Paulus Warnefrid was one {{of their}} descendants, and his history carries out the exact truth of Tacitus' words. He too speaks of them as a very small tribe. He could not foresee how much the 'nobilitat' meant. He knew his folk as a brave semi-feudal race, who had conquered the greater part of Italy, and tilled and ruled it well; who were now conquered by Charlemagne, and annexed to the great Frank Empire, but without losing anything of their distinctive national character. He did not foresee that they would become the architects, the merchants, the goldsmiths, the bankers, the scientific agriculturists of all Europe. We know it. Whenever in London or any other great city, you see a 'Lombard Street,' an old street of goldsmiths and bankers--or the three golden balls of Lombardy over a pawnbroker's shop--or in the country a field of <b>rye-grass,</b> or a patch of lucerne--recollect this wise and noble people, and thank the Lombards for what they have done for mankind.|$|E

Where the pine (they are all `Douglass' pines) prevails, you have the good soil broken into patches by the croppings of rock, {{producing}} ferns, <b>rye-grass,</b> and some thistles, but very few. This is the Scottish side of the picture. Then you come to the oak region; and here you have clumps, open glades, rows, single trees of umbrageous form, presenting an exact copy of English park scenery. There is no running water, unfortunately, but the meadows and little prairies that lie ensconced within the woods, shew no signs of suffering from lack of water. The nights bring heavy dews, and there are occasional rains, which keep them fresh and green. I am told that in September rains fall which renew the face of nature so suddenly, that it assumes the garb of spring, the flowers even coming out. The winter is a little cold, but never severe. I have heard it complained of as being rather wet and muggy. Frost and snow fall, but do not endure long.|$|E

Even the meadow-grass in some places was killed to the very roots. In the spring appearances were better than we expected. All the early sown grain recovered itself, {{and came up with}} great vigor; but that which was late sown was feeble, and did not promise to resist any blights in the spring, which, however, with all its unpleasant vicissitudes, passed off very well; and nothing looked better than the wheat at the time of blooming;--but at that most critical time of all, a cold, dry east wind, attended with very sharp frosts, longer and stronger than I recollect at that time of year, destroyed the flowers, and withered up, in an astonishing manner, the whole side of the ear next to the wind. At that time I brought to town some of the ears, for the purpose of showing to my friends the operation of those unnatural frosts, and according to their extent I predicted a great scarcity.

It was a hut of the least dimensions, and most miserable description that I ever saw even in the Highlands. The walls of sod, or DIVOT, as the Scotch call it, were not four feet high; the roof was of turf, repaired with reeds and sedges; the chimney was composed of clay, bound round by straw ropes; and the whole walls, roof, and chimney, were alike covered with the vegetation of house-leek, <b>rye-grass,</b> and moss common to decayed cottages formed of such materials. There was not the slightest vestige of a kale-yard, the usual accompaniment of the very worst huts; and of living things we saw nothing, save a kid which was browsing {{on the roof of the}} hut, and a goat, its mother, at some distance, feeding betwixt the oak and the river Awe.|$|E

Verily, again, we are in the Tropics. They are palms, doubtless, some thirty feet high each, with here and there a young one springing up like a gigantic crown of male-fern. The old ones have straight gray stems, often prickly enough, and thickened in the middle; gray last year's leaves hanging down; and feathering round the top, a circular plume of pale green leaves, like those of a coconut. But these are not cocos. The last year's leaves of the coco are rich yellow, and its stem is curved.

"In England, {{from the}} {{restoration}} {{to the middle}} of the eighteenth century, very little improvement took place, either in the cultivation of the soil, or in the management of live stock. Even clover and turnips (the great support of the present improved system of agriculture) were confined to a few districts, and at the close of this period were scarcely cultivated at all by common farmers in the northern parts of the island. From the Whole Art of Husbandry, published by Mortimer in 1706, a work of considerable merit, it does not appear that any improvement was made on his practices till near the end of last century. In those districts where clover and <b>rye-grass</b> were cultivated, they were cut green, and used for soiling as at present.

40|$|A postembedding {{method has}} been {{developed}} for localizing water soluble allergens in <b>rye-grass</b> pollen. This uses dry fixation in glutaraldehyde vapour, followed by 2, 2 -dimethoxypropane, prior to a 100 % ethanol series leading into embedment in LR Gold.

40|$|Activity of antagonists {{in winter}} and early spring {{as well as in}} late summer and autumn plays an {{important}} role in the control of cereal aphid populations. Indeed, parasitoids active early in the year are important to avoid high aphid densities. Late summer and autumn correspond to the transition period between two wheat cultures, and parasitoid activity would thus reduce aphid infestation. During these critical periods, other crops like <b>rye-grass</b> and red clover containing alternative hosts could play the role of parasitoid reservoirs. During 1996, parasitoid activity was measured by trap planting in wheat, <b>rye-grass,</b> red clover and fallow grassland. In each plot, early spring was characterized by an important parasitoid activity, while aphids remained at a low level. Later in spring, activity decreased, and aphid development began even during this period. During the summer, when aphids reached their-population peak, parasitoid activity rose again.

Study of the developmental sequence of the pollen through the microsporocyte, microspore, bicellular and tricellular stages showed that the brassinosteroids were increasingly sequestered in starch granules as the amyloplasts matured, supporting the view that these are storage organelles for these potent plant growth promoters.

The results from high-performance liquid chromatography of dansylaminophenylboronates from partially purified extracts of freshly dehisced tricellular pollen of <b>rye-grass</b> showed 25 -methylcastasterone may be a minor component, together with two unknown peaks.
