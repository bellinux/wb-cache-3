40|$|In {{this letter}} we call into {{question}} the perturbatively parity breakdown at 1 -loop for the massless QED_ 3 frequently claimed in the literature. As long as perturbative quantum field theory is concerned, whether a parity anomaly owing to radiative corrections exists or not will be definitely proved by using a renormalization method independent of any regularization scheme. Such a problem has been investigated in the framework of BPHZL renormalization method, by adopting the Lowenstein-Zimmermann subtraction scheme. The 1 -loop parity-odd contribution to the vacuum-polarization tensor is explicitly computed in the framework of the BPHZL renormalization method. It is shown that a Chern-Simons term is generated at that order induced through the infrared subtractions [...] which violate parity. We show then that, what is called parity anomaly, is in fact a parity-odd counterterm needed for <b>restauring</b> parity. Comment: 4 pages, no figures, to appear in Physics Letters...|$|E

40|$|The provincial decree {{applying}} {{to the construction}} industry in Quebec has created a situation of bilateral monopoly in that segment {{of the labor market}} (unions on the supply side and entrepreneurs on the demand side). If negotiations are undertaken at a time where business conditions are booming, then the unions have a very powerful negotiating power. Since contracts are signed for a three year period, wage increases do not afterwards reflect market conditions. Since wages are fixed by the provincial decree, there is then a quantity adjustment in the construction sector. In this paper, we have specified and estimated a model that allows us to measure the bilateral monopoly impact of wage increases and to compute quantity adjustments in the construction market. It is shown then that the provincial decree adversily affects the competition position of the construction industry in Quebec and that <b>restauring</b> this position involves a severe recession in the construction industry. ...|$|E
