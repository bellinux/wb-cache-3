40|$|In {{the quest}} to develop viable designs for third-generation optical {{interferometric}} gravitational-wave detectors (e. g. LIGO-III and EURO), one strategy is to monitor the relative momentum or speed of the test-mass mirrors, rather than monitoring their relative position. This paper describes and analyzes the most straightforward design for a <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> interferometer that accomplishes this [...] a design (due to Braginsky, Gorodetsky, Khalili and Thorne) that is analogous to a microwave-cavity <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> conceived by Braginsky and Khalili. A mathematical mapping between the microwave <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> and the optical interferometric <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> is developed and is used to show (in accord with the speed being a Quantum Nondemolition [QND] observable) that in principle the interferometric <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> can beat the gravitational-wave standard quantum limit (SQL) by an arbitrarily large amount, over an arbitrarily wide range of frequencies, and can do so {{without the use of}} squeezed vacuum or any auxiliary filter cavities at the interferometer's input or output. However, in practice, to reach or beat the SQL, this specific <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> requires exorbitantly high input light power. The physical reason for this is explored, along with other issues such as constraints on performance due to optical dissipation.

40|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> {{concept has}} been {{identified}} as a technique that can potentially provide laser-interferometric measurements at a sensitivity level which surpasses the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) over a broad frequency range. As with other sub-SQL measurement techniques, losses {{play a central role in}} <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> interferometers and they ultimately determine the quantum noise limited sensitivity that can be achieved. So far in the literature, the quantum noise limited sensitivity has only been derived for lossless or lossy cases using certain approximations (for instance that the arm cavity round trip loss is small compared to the arm cavity mirror transmission). In this article we present a generalised, analytical treatment of losses in <b>speed</b> <b>meters</b> that allows accurate calculation of the quantum noise limited sensitivity of Sagnac <b>speed</b> <b>meters</b> with arm cavities. In addition, our analysis allows us to take into account potential imperfections in the interferometer such as an asymmetric beam splitter or differences of the reflectivities of the two arm cavity input mirrors. Finally,we use the examples of the proof-of-concept Sagnac <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> currently under construction in Glasgow and a potential implementation of a Sagnac <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> in the Einstein Telescope (ET) to illustrate how our findings affect Sagnac <b>speed</b> <b>meters</b> with meter- and kilometre-long baselines.

A challenge with the Sagnac <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> interferometer arises from the intrinsic lack of sensitivity at low frequencies where the velocity-proportional signal is smaller than the noise associated with the sensing of the signal. Using as an example the on-going proof-of-concept Sagnac <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> experiment in Glasgow, we quantify the problem and present a solution involving the extraction of a small displacement-proportional signal. This displacement signal can be combined with the existing velocity signal to enhance low frequency sensitivity, and we derive optimal filters to accomplish this for different signal strengths.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modified}} configuration of an advanced gravitational-wave detector {{that is a}} speed-meter-type interferometer with improved sensitivity with respect to quantum noise. With the addition of polarization-controlling components to the output of an arm cavity Michelson interferometer, an orthogonal polarization state of the interferometer {{can be used to}} store signal, returning it later with opposite phase to cancel position information below the storage bandwidth of the opposite mode. This modification provides an alternative to an external kilometer-scale Fabry-Pérot cavity, as presented in earlier work of Purdue and Chen [Phys. Rev. D 66, 122004 (2002) ]. The new configuration requires significantly less physical infrastructure to achieve <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> operation. The quantity of length and alignment degrees of freedom is also reduced.

40|$|A {{description}} and analysis are given of a ``speed meter'' for monitoring a classical force that acts {{on a test}} mass. This <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> is based on two microwave resonators (``dual resonators''), one of which couples evanescently {{to the position of}} the test mass. The sloshing of the resulting signal between the resonators, and a wise choice of where to place the resonators' output waveguide, produce a signal in the waveguide that (for sufficiently low frequencies) is proportional to the test-mass velocity (speed) rather than its position. This permits the <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> to achieve force-measurement sensitivities better than the standard quantum limit (SQL), both when operating in a narrow-band mode and a wide-band mode. A scrutiny of experimental issues shows that it is feasible, with current technology, to construct a demonstration <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> that beats the wide-band SQL by a factor 2. A concept is sketched for an adaptation of this <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> to optical frequencies; this adaptation forms the basis for a possible LIGO-III interferometer that could beat the gravitational-wave standard quantum limit h_SQL, but perhaps only by a factor 1 /xi = h_SQL/h ~ 3 (constrained by losses in the optics) and at the price of a very high circulating optical power [...] - larger by 1 /xi^ 2 than that required to reach the SQL.

40|$|Choice of vehicle’s {{speed is}} one of the most {{important}} factors for a driver for proper vehicle’s control and selecting a wrong speed results in loss of vehicle’s control; particularly in negotiating road curvatures. Many of such speed related errors could be attributed to inconsistencies in the road alignment, that surprise the driver as a result of sudden change in road characteristics leading to an excess critical speed, hence, losing the vehicle’s control. This inconsistency should be accounted for and controlled by the engineers. This study was carried out to evaluate the speeds of the drivers when negotiating various layouts of road bends, determination of possible factors affecting drivers’ operating speed and development of prediction models for operational 85 th percentile driver’s speed. Speeds of over 4000 vehicles (light and heavy) were collected at 10 road curves of various designs using <b>speed</b> <b>radar</b> <b>meter</b> and video recording system. Speeds were measured at three different points along the curves; the entry, mid and exit points. Preliminary findings from this study revealed that there are some inconsistencies in the features of the existing road curves. The design of the existing curves used in this study can be regarded as fair as the change in the operating speed of light vehicles was found to be higher than 10 km/h; being the established lower limiting value. Likewise, the road curves could also be regarded to fall within a fair and poor design because the average change in operating speed exceeded the limiting value of 20 km/h when compared with the posted speed limit. However, more data would be required to improve the accuracy of the results...|$|R
40|$|In {{the quest}} to develop viable designs for third-generation optical {{interferometric}} gravitational-wave detectors, one strategy is to monitor the relative momentum or speed of the test-mass mirrors, rather than monitoring their relative position. The most straightforward design for a speed-meter interferometer that accomplishes this is described and analyzed in Chapter 2. This design (due to Braginsky, Gorodetsky, Khalili, and Thorne) is analogous to a microwave-cavity <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> conceived by Braginsky and Khalili.

Chapter 3 proposes a more sophisticated version of a <b>speed</b> <b>meter.</b> This new design requires only a modest input power and appears to be a fully practical candidate for third-generation LIGO. It can beat the SQL (the approximate sensitivity of second-generation LIGO interferometers) over a broad range of frequencies (10 to 100 Hz in practice) by a factor h/h SQL √W^(SQL) _(circ) /W circ. Here W circ is the light power circulating in the interferometer arms and W SQL ≃ 800 kW is the circulating power required to beat the SQL at 100 Hz (the LIGO-II power). If squeezed vacuum (with a power-squeeze factor e - 2 R) is injected into the interferometer's output port, the SQL can be beat with a much reduced laser power: h/h SQL √W^(SQL) _(circ) /W circ e - 2 R. For realistic parameters (e - 2 R ≃ 10 and W circ ≃ 800 to 2000 kW), the SQL can be beat by a factor 3 to 4 from 10 to 100 Hz. [However, as the power increases in these expressions, the <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> becomes more narrow band; additional power and re-optimization of some parameters are required to maintain the wide band. ] By performing frequency-dependent homodyne detection on the output (with the aid of two kilometer-scale filter cavities), one can markedly improve the interferometer's sensitivity at frequencies above 100 Hz. Chapters 2 and 3 are part of an ongoing effort to develop a practical variant of an interferometric <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> and to combine the <b>speed</b> <b>meter</b> concept with other ideas to yield a promising third- generation interferometric gravitational-wave detector that entails low laser power. Chapter 4 is a contribution to the foundations for analyzing sources of gravitational waves for LIGO. Specifically, it presents an analysis of the tidal work done on a self-gravitating body (e. g., a neutron star or black hole) in an external tidal field (e. g., that of a binary companion). The change in the mass-energy of the body {{as a result of the}} tidal work, or "tidal heating," is analyzed using the Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor and the local asymptotic rest frame of the body. It is shown that the work done on the body is gauge invariant, while the body-tidal-field interaction energy contained within the body's local asymptotic rest frame is gauge dependent. This is analogous to Newtonian theory, where the interaction energy is shown to depend on how one localizes gravitational energy, but the work done on the body is independent of that localization. These conclusions play a role in analyses, by others, of the dynamics and stability of the inspiraling neutron-star binaries whose gravitational waves are likely to be seen and studied by LIGO. </p...|$|R
