40|$|Energy audit and {{calculation}} {{strategies for}} energy flows in buildings: {{a case study}} of Vallongatan 1   This thesis involves an energy audit of a building with offices and laboratories in Uppsala, Sweden. The calculations are performed in Microsoft Excel and were later used as the basis for developing calculation strategies for similar, future, energy audits.   The building was erected in the early 1990 s and the heating requirement of just above 700 MWh is covered by district heating from the city network. The total gross floor area is about 8400 m 2 and is served by an air conditioning system consisting of seven ventilation units with <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling coils, as well as water radiators throughout the building.   No significant improvement measures have been implemented since the construction, and the building therefore has a potential to improve its energy performance. The report addresses a number of measures that could be taken, as well as an evaluation of each one. The most economically viable of these would be to clean the <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> which is deemed to have a potential to save about 70 MWh or 48   700 SEK annually. In comparison to the estimated cost of between 35   000 and 42   000 SEK this is likely to become profitable as early as the first year.   The calculation templates that were developed cover three different building standards, these are categorized as low, improved and advanced standard. Here, the desired areas and types of activities are typed in easily for either individual rooms or entire offices or buildings.

50|$|During the {{automotive}} industry's interest in gas turbines for vehicle propulsion (around 1965), Chrysler invented a unique type of <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{that consisted of}} a rotary drum constructed from corrugated metal (similar in appearance to corrugated cardboard). This drum was continuously rotated by reduction gears driven by the turbine. The hot exhaust gasses were directed through {{a portion of the}} device, which would then rotate to a section that conducted the induction air, where this intake air was heated. This recovery of the heat of combustion significantly increased the efficiency of the turbine engine. This engine proved impractical for an automotive application due to its poor low-rpm torque. Even such an efficient engine, if large enough to deliver the proper performance, would have a low average fuel efficiency. Such an engine may at some future time be attractive when combined with an electric motor in a hybrid vehicle owing to its robust longevity and an ability to burn a wide variety of liquid fuels.|$|E

Energy recovery is particularly important in buildings with significant outdoor air intake requirements and has recently become widely accepted in applications such as schools and theatres.

These guidelines address evaluation of typical projects for the suitability of energy recovery, selection of appropriate energy recovery ventilation technology, and criteria for successful application of enthalpy wheels.

40|$|Component {{performance}} and seasonal operational experiences have been analysed for desiccant cooling systems powered by solar air collectors. Measurements during the commissioning phase in Spain (public library) and in Germany (production hall) {{showed that the}} dehumidification efficiency of the sorption rotors was 80 % and the humidification efficiency of the contact evaporators was 85 - 86 %. Only in a two-stage desiccant system monitored in China (laboratory building), a dehumidification efficiency of 88 % was reached. The <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> only had 62 - 68 % measured heat recovery efficiency, which is lower than specified. Seasonal performance monitoring {{carried out in the}} German installation showed that average seasonal COP's were close to 1. 0, when related to all operation hours. COP's increase if low regeneration temperatures are used with low dehumidification rates, which is often sufficient for moderate German climatic conditions, but much less so in the humid Chinese climate. Electrical COP's for the German system including air distribution were between 1. 7 and 4. 6 and reach values of 7. 4, when only additional pressure drops of the desiccant unit are considered. It could be shown that conventional control strategies lead to high auxiliary energy consumption, for example if fixed heating setpoint temperatures are used. Furthermore the solar air collector energy yield was very low in the German system, as regeneration was only used when all other options such as humidification at high air volume flows did not reduce the room air temperature enough. The studies showed that the measured auxiliary energy consumption could be reduced to near zero, if regeneration temperature setpoints were not fixed to constant values. The solar air collector efficiency was good at about 50 % both for the flat plate collectors used in Spain and Germany and the Chinese vacuum tube solution.

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of the known methods of calculation of material and heat balances of the <b>rotary</b> kilns with <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> for limestone burning has been done. It is shown that the methods of calculations, proposed by the authors, have restrictions and inaccuracies, associated with both the assumptions made by authors for their conditions and {{the design of the}} units. Based on the made analysis the main provisions of the generalized method of calculation of the material and heat balances, that best describes the process of limestone burning in the <b>rotary</b> kiln with <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> have been developed. As can be seen it is impossible to perform analytical calculation of material and heat balances of the existing rotary kiln without balance test results. Thus, in the material balance calculation, besides of the content of carbonates, hydrated moisture and impurities in the feedstock, the influence of the physical humidity, which may vary depending on season and storage conditions, should be taken into account. The amount and chemical composition of burnt dust carried away from the kiln, may differ significantly from the literature data. The value of the cold air inflow can reach 15 % of the total amount of air entering the kiln, it has a significant impact on fuel consumption for lime burning. When calculating the heat balance needs to know the actual temperature of the heated air and burnt lime, temperature and flue gas composition at the outlet of the heater, the temperature of the flue dust. Determining of the heat loss to the environment through the kiln body is not possible without measuring the temperature of its surface. The accuracy of determining the heat transfer coefficient, depending on the temperature of the surface of the kiln can also {{have a significant impact on}} the calculation result...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{work is a}} first-of-a-kind {{feasibility}} study investigating technology options with gas/gas rotary heat exchangers for the water management in the integration of Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) plants with post-combustion carbon capture, with and without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). A range of configurations are examined for wet and dry cooling of the flue gas entering a post- combustion capture (PCC) absorption system, and regenerative heating of the CO 2 -depleted flue gas prior to the power plant stack. First, this work examines {{the addition of a}} gas/gas <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> to transfer heat from the exhaust gas entering the absorber into the CO 2 -depleted gas stream leaving the absorber. It then investigates the performance of a configuration with an additional air/gas rotary heater to further reduce exhaust flue gas temperature and water consumption, and, eventually, a more compact arrangement which combined the two heaters into a single gas/gas/air heater with a trisector configuration. A thermal performance analysis was conducted for each of the previous configurations, in order to evaluate the dimensions and the operational parameters of the heaters. By replacing the direct contact cooler traditionally used in PCC technology by a dry-cooling system, a significant reduction in the overall process water usage and cooling water consumption associated to the capture plant can be achieved. The second part of this work examines the use of a similar system for NGCC plant with EGR. This strategy increases CO 2 concentration in gas turbine exhaust gases and reduce O 2 induced solvent degradation. In addition to the heat and water balance around the absorber column of the PCC process, an important aspect of EGR is that recirculated gas stream temperature should be as low as possible so that the gas turbine performance is not compromised.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to analyze and balance an {{assembly}} line at Fläkt Woods in Jönköping. The work is going to answer the questions about today’s throughput time, how much waste that occurs, number of staff at the assembly line, how the supply of material works and possible improvements that can be made at the work stations. The work is also going to give a proposal of improve-ments that can be made. The methods used to get the result include observations and measurements, con-versations with technicians and operators and also data from Fläkt Woods’ data-base. Large variations in throughput time are measured during the measure period, from 3 hours up to 5 hours and 35 minutes. These variations depend mainly on the time the air handling unit spends between the stations. The identification of the bottleneck was shown that it occurred in the last station in the assembly line. This results in a pressure from the stations behind with a long throughput time as a con-sequence. The largest source of waste is the operators’ waiting time. The measures that have been made show that the operators wait 33. 4 % on average of the time available. The number of operators varies from ten to twelve during the measure period. This number of operators is too high in consideration of the high waiting times. It results in difficulties for the operators to move between the stations be-cause every station is fully manned. The supply of larger components for example fans, batteries, <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> and dampers for the air handling units are made by a truck driver. This leads to disorder in the work stations and fixed posi-tions for a number of smaller components and tools go missing. The analysis of the result shows that the pressure that occurs in the assembly line results in high throughput time because the units wait a long time between the stations. To eliminate these waiting times, a suction must be created. The difficul-ties for the operators to move between the stations can be solved with a lower number of operators. This makes it easier for the operators to move between the stations and reduce the waiting time for the operators...|$|R

They are {{considered as one}} of the largest energy consumers and also the fastest growing industries in the world. Since data centers consume a significantly large amount of electricity, which results in a large amount of heat that must be dealt with, data center cooling has been a very important topic. Due to such a large-scale system that a data center may require, it is critical to start with meticulously investigating cooling strategies for the data center before it begins to be constructed. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop energy simulation models that can be used to estimate overall data center efficiency for the location of interest. This large-scale modeling can be accomplished by developing several component-level models, which may be built in different modeling tools and interact with each other. This thesis considers four cooling scenarios of a 400 kW data center, and they are as follows: (a) an air cooled data center with a <b>rotary</b> regenerative <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and DX cooling system, (b) a hybrid cooled data center with an air cooled chiller and DX cooling system, (c) a hybrid cooled data center utilizing warm water through a liquid-to-liquid <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and DX cooling system, (d) a hybrid cooled data center that uses rear door <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> and a water cooled chiller.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 This thesis {{examines}} the transient and steady-state temperature {{performance of a}} <b>rotary</b> regenerative <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> In contrast to previous studies on this problem, fluid flow in the circumferential direction was considered. Appropriate modeling was included to measure the effect of carry-over on the differential equations describing mass and energy conservation. The energy equations describing transient temperature profiles in two spatial dimensions were derived from the general case. These energy equations were then non-dimensionalized for the case where both fluids were identical, producing the appropriate parameters for evaluating performance. A step-by-step system was obtained in explicit form for the fluid temperatures and in implicit form for the matrix temperature using upstream differencing methods. The errors for this numerical system were analyzed and {{a necessary condition for}} stability was obtained. Sample problems for balanced and symmetrical cases were solved and the effect of carry-over and matrix rotation speed on performance was discussed. A parameter representing the effects of carry-over was suggested. This thesis treats two conditions not considered previously. These are the effects of carry-over on regenerator performance and the solution of transient temperature profiles in both axial and circumferential directions. Carry-over effects were evaluated to be unimportant, however a more complete description of the temperature field suggests that previous results for unit effectiveness are in error by as much as 13 percent...|$|R
40|$|Ljungström air {{preheater}} is a {{regenerative heat exchanger}} which is mainly used in steam boiler plants for preheating of the combustion air. The hot gas and cold air ducts are arranged {{in such a way}} to allow both to flow simultaneously through the machine. The hot flue gas heats the rotor material and as the rotor rotates, the hot rotor section moves into the flow of the cold air and preheats it. Simulations of regenerative heat exchanger described in open literature are mainly based on the empirical approach where some of the effects to the process are simplified or neglected. Although this may give reasonably good and in many cases acceptable results, a more comprehensive mathematical model based on differential equations of continuity, momentum and energy is applied here for analysis of the flow and heat transfer in such a device for better understanding of its process features.

The reduced fat content would also help to protect the air handling unit, which comprised recovery of heat from the extract air. However, there is a health respect for ozone, which is a highly reactive irritant. Chemical reactions may also lead to the production of nitrogen dioxide, aldehydes and other volatile organic compounds. Concentrations of the compounds mentioned were measured both by passive and active sampling. Measurements were made outdoors and indoors {{as well as in the}} supply, extract and exhaust air streams. With ozone generation the ozone concentration in the extract and exhaust air was higher than 450 µg/m 3. However, no increase of the ozone concentration in the supply or indoor air was observed. There were no observations of any formaldehyde generation. Neither were there any signs of nitrogen dioxide generation influencing the supply or indoor air, although the exhaust air concentration was higher than the extract air concentration. The measurement results point to incomplete chemical reactions still occurring in the exhaust air.

40|$|Reduction of {{the energy}} used to acclimatise {{buildings}} is a huge challenge simultaneously {{with the implementation of}} air tight low energy buildings. In residential buildings with several living units centralised air handling units are the most energy efficient system. However, in a centralised system there is important to avoid leakages of pollutions between the exhaust air and the supply air. This leads to that flat plate heat exchangers are used instead of the more energy efficient <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in these types of buildings. Flat plate heat exchangers will have problems concerning water condensation and frost formation in the exhaust air channels at low supply inlet temperatures. In this thesis a membrane based heat exchanger, which also was able to transfer moisture, was compared to a plastic based heat exchanger to see if the membrane based exchanger had less problems concerning condensation and freezing. In addition a mathematical method was derived to predict the heat and moisture transfer effectiveness in a membrane based heat exchanger. To compare the different heat exchanger plate materials a test rig was built in the laboratory at the Department of Energy and Process Engineering at NTNU. The experiments showed that the plastic based heat exchangers had problems with condensation and freezing in the tested conditions. The membrane based exchanger did not experience the same problems. However, additional problems with expansion of the membrane in high humidity showed that the tested membrane had drawbacks and was not really suitable. The derived mathematical method to predict the moisture transfer effectiveness was shown to correlate very well with the experimental results. The derived method and the developed Microsoft Excel tool called HXcalc may then be used to investigate other membranes moisture transfer effectiveness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Desiccant cooling is a {{technology}} that, {{based on a}} open psychrometric cycle, is able to provide cooling using heat as the main energy carrier. This technology uses a considerably smaller amount of electricity than refrigerators based on the vapor-compression cycle, which is an electricity driven cycle. Electricity is often more expensive than other types of energy and has CO 2 emissions associated with its generation, so desiccant cooling {{has the potential of}} achieving both economic and environmental benefits. In addition to this, the heat the desiccant cooling cycle needs to work can be supplied at relative low temperatures, so it can use heat coming from the district heating grid, from a solar collector or even waste heat coming from industries. The system which will be studied in this report is a desiccant cooling system based on the model designed by the company Munters AB. The systems relies on several components: a desiccant rotor, a <b>rotary</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> two evaporative humidifiers and two heating coils. It is a flexible system that is able to provide cooling in summer and heat during winter. This study performs a deep economic and environmental analysis of the desiccant cooling systems, comparing it with traditional vapor compression based systems: In order to achieve this objective a user-friendly software was created, called the DCSS – Desiccant Cooling Simulation Software – that simulates the operation of the system during a year and performs automatically all the necessary calculations. This study demonstrates that economic savings up to 54 % percent can be achieved in the running costs of desiccant cooling systems when compared to traditional compressor cooling systems, and  reductions up to 39 % in the CO 2 emissions. It also demonstrates that desiccant cooling is more appropriate in dry climate zones with low latent heat generation gains. In addition to that, the DSCC software created will help further studies about the physical, economic and environmental feasibility of installing desiccant cooling systems in different locations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{traditional}} shell-and-tubeheat <b>exchanger,</b> a new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> which applies to phase change thermal storage was proposed. The thermal storage process of new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and shell-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> which use paraffin as phase change material and use water as heat-transfer fluid can be simulated by CFD software, respectively. The changes of liquid fraction and heat flux density along with time have been got by computer stimulation. It {{can be found}} that maximum heat flux of the new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>heating</b> wall is 2. 5 times than shell-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> melting time of the new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is 5 times than shell-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> From the two aspects, the heat storage effect of new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is better than conventional concentric tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R

This HVAC system is made of two heat exchangers: an air-to-air <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (a <b>rotary</b> wheel <b>heat</b> recovery) and a water-to-air <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> First dynamic model of the HVAC system is developed. Then the optimal control structure is designed and implemented. The HVAC system is splitted into two subsystems. By selecting the right set-points and appropriate cost functions for each subsystem controller the optimal control strategy is respected to gaurantee the minimum thermal and electrical energy consumption. Finally, the controller is applied to control the mentioned HVAC system and {{the results show that}} the expected goals are fulfilled. I...|$|R
