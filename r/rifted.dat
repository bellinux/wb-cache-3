5|$|These Precambrian igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a <b>rifted</b> continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was <b>rifted</b> away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{distinct}} <b>rift</b> basins, the East African <b>Rift</b> System extends {{over thousands of}} kilometers. [...] The EAR consists of two main branches. The Eastern <b>Rift</b> Valley (also known as Gregory <b>Rift)</b> includes the Main Ethiopian <b>Rift,</b> running eastward from the Afar Triple Junction, which continues south as the Kenyan <b>Rift</b> Valley. The Western <b>Rift</b> Valley includes the Albertine <b>Rift,</b> and farther south, the valley of Lake Malawi. To {{the north of the}} Afar Triple Junction, the <b>rift</b> follows one of two paths: west to the Red Sea <b>Rift</b> or east to the Aden Ridge in the Gulf of Aden.|$|R
50|$|South of the Ethiopian highlands, the <b>rift</b> valley splits {{into two}} major troughs. The Eastern <b>Rift</b> {{is home to}} the Kenyan <b>Rift</b> Valley lakes, while most of the Central African <b>Rift</b> Valley lakes lie in the Western <b>Rift.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>rift,</b> {{and other}} <b>rifts</b> {{in the area}} such as the Bahr El Arab <b>rift</b> and White Nile <b>rift,</b> {{appears to have been}} {{activated}} several times since the Paleozoic era, which ended about 250 Ma. During periods of rapid uplift and subsidence, the <b>rifts</b> accumulated sediments of different ages, origins and methods of deposition.Late Jurassic <b>rifting</b> occurred in the Blue Nile <b>rift,</b> with east-west half-graben extension connected by large-scale shear zones and pull-apart basins, and early Cretaceous <b>rifting</b> re-activated the Jurassic basin.|$|R
25|$|During this {{rotation}} of the Coast Range the block of continental crust that is now the Blue Mountains (on {{the eastern side of}} the KBML) was also <b>rifted</b> away from the Idaho batholith, and also rotated about 50 degrees, but about a point near the Wallula Gap (or perhaps further east).|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke {{up into the}} {{northern}} supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself <b>rifted</b> apart.|$|E
25|$|In late Devonian {{and in the}} Carboniferous the {{archipelago}} Armorica of southern Europe, which had <b>rifted</b> off Gondwana after Avalonia later in the Ordovician, was pushed into Avalonia, creating a second range, the North American/European Variscan, {{to the east of}} the Caledonide/Appalachian. The collision of Gondwana proper with Laurussia followed in the early Carboniferous, when the Variscan belt was already in place and actively developing.|$|E
40|$|Although Antarctic {{ice shelves}} are {{potentially}} good indicators of climate change, little is currently {{known about the}} underlying mechanisms causing their <b>rifting</b> and breakup. I used hundreds of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images to observe five <b>rifts</b> in the Amery Ice Shelf and two <b>rifts</b> in the Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica from 2002 - 2012. I measured the lengths of these <b>rifts</b> over time to discover that {{although most of the}} <b>rifts</b> were actively propagating during this time series, the <b>rift</b> propagation rates vary between <b>rifts</b> in the same ice shelf as well as between ice shelves. The differences in <b>rift</b> propagation rate indicate that a single environmental factor is not the driving force behind <b>rift</b> propagation, although sea ice concentration seems to inversely correlate with <b>rift</b> propagation of at least one <b>rift</b> in the Amery Ice Shelf. The propagation of one <b>rift</b> may impact the propagation of another in the same ice shelf, as internal stress within the ice seems to be an important factor regarding <b>rift</b> propagation. Interestingly, one <b>rift</b> changes direction to propagate parallel to a suture zone joining two flow bands, then curves to <b>rift</b> across the suture zone, indicating the importance of internal ice shelf stress. Overall, more long-term monitoring of <b>rift</b> propagation and local environmental conditions is needed to determine the ultimate cause of <b>rift</b> propagation...|$|R
50|$|Exploration of the geology of the West Antarctic <b>Rift</b> is difficult, because, {{apart from}} {{peaks of the}} Transantarctic Mountains that {{protrude}} above the ice, the region is covered by the vast West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Thus, the <b>rift</b> is less well known than other major <b>rift</b> valleys. It is known, however, that like the East African <b>Rift,</b> the West Antarctic <b>Rift</b> is actually a number of much shorter <b>rifts</b> that cross Antarctica. There is also a sharp division between older, broader Paleogene <b>rifts</b> including the Ross Sea Basin and the younger, narrower Terror <b>Rift.</b> There are also {{a large number of}} failed <b>rifts</b> extending as far as Berkner Island.|$|R
40|$|The <b>rifting</b> cycle initiates {{with stress}} buildup, release as {{earthquakes}} and/or magma intrusions/eruptions, and visco-elastic rebound, multiple episodes of which combine {{to produce the}} observed, time-averaged <b>rift</b> zone architecture. The aim of our synthesis of current research initiatives into continental rifting-to-rupture processes is to quantify the time and length scales of faulting and magmatism that produce the time-averaged <b>rift</b> structures imaged in active, failed <b>rifts</b> and passive margins worldwide. We compare and contrast seismic and geodetic strain patterns during discrete, intense <b>rifting</b> episodes in magmatic and amagmatic sectors of the East African <b>rift</b> zone that span early- to late-stage <b>rifting.</b> We also examine the longer term <b>rifting</b> cycle {{and its relation to}} changing far-field extension directions with examples from the Rio Grande <b>rift</b> zone and other cratonic <b>rifts.</b> Over time periods of millions of years, periods of rotating regional stress fields are marked by a lull in magmatic activity and a temporary halt to tectonic <b>rift</b> opening. Admittedly, <b>rifting</b> cycle comparisons are biased by the short time scale of global seismic and geodetic measurements, which span {{a small fraction of the}} 102 – 105 year <b>rifting</b> cycle. Within <b>rift</b> sectors with upper crustal magma chambers beneath the central <b>rift</b> valley (e. g., Main Ethiopian, Afar, and Eastern or Gregory <b>rifts)</b> seismic energy release accounts for a small fraction of the deformation; most of the strain is accommodated by magma intrusion and slow-slip. Magma intrusion processes appear to decrease the time period between <b>rifting</b> episodes, effectively accelerating the <b>rift</b> to rupture process. Thus, the inter-seismic period in <b>rift</b> zones with crustal magma reservoirs is strongly dependent upon the magma replenishment cycle. This comparison also demonstrates that intense <b>rifting</b> events, both magmatic and amagmatic, produce the long-term fault displacements and maintain the along-axis <b>rift</b> architecture through repeated episodes. The magmatic events in particular accommodate centuries of inter-seismic strain, implying that inter-seismic-plate opening rates in late stage <b>rifts</b> should be extrapolated to the past with caution...|$|R
25|$|In the Ordovician Period, a land mass, {{which has}} been named Gondwana (present day South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia), straddled {{the space between the}} South Pole and the Equator {{on one side of the}} globe. Off to the west were three other masses: Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica, located as if on the {{vertices}} of a triangle. To the south of them was a large archipelago, the terrane Avalonia, <b>rifted</b> off the north Gondwana margin in early Ordovician.|$|E
25|$|The Cenozoic Era {{covers the}} million {{years since the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event {{up to and including}} the present day. By the end of the Mesozoic era, the continents had <b>rifted</b> into nearly their present form. Laurasia became North America and Eurasia, while Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the Mediterranean sea.|$|E
25|$|Geologically, the Horn and Yemen once {{formed a}} single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the Gulf of Aden <b>rifted</b> and {{separated}} the Horn region from the Arabian Peninsula. The Somali Plate is bounded {{on the west}} by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the triple junction in the Afar Depression, and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore.

40|$|The Venusian <b>rifts</b> of Devana and Ganis Chasmata {{have been}} noted for their similar {{morphology}} to some <b>rifts</b> on Earth (i. e., the East African <b>rift</b> system). These are narrow <b>rifts</b> {{that are associated with}} localized deformation. This thesis aims to explore the link between lithospheric structure and <b>rift</b> style using a force analysis model, following previous work by Buck (1991), in order to determine under what conditions narrow <b>rifts</b> are predicted for Venus conditions. Results for two cases, one using a constant lithospheric thermal conductivity and another using a depth dependent thermal conductivity, are initially determined; Devana and Ganis Chasmata are predicted to be wide <b>rifts</b> rather than narrow <b>rifts.</b> Lithospheric weakening mechanisms (rheological weakening and diking) are implemented to determine their effect on localizing deformation and, thus, forming narrow <b>rifts.</b> Diking did not produce any effect on forming narrow <b>rifts.</b> Rheological weakening, likely due to a combination of melt and a transition to grain size sensitive creep, appears necessary to produce narrow <b>rifts...</b>|$|R
25|$|During the Cretaceous, {{the late}} Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea {{completed}} its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin orogenies {{that had begun}} during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera, as the Nevadan orogeny {{was followed by the}} Sevier and Laramide orogenies. Though Gondwana was still intact {{in the beginning of the}} Cretaceous, Gondwana itself broke up as South America, Antarctica and Australia <b>rifted</b> away from Africa (though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising eustatic sea levels worldwide.|$|E
25|$|During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except {{portions}} of East Asia, were collected {{into a single}} supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent <b>rifted</b> away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts {{seem to have been}} widespread on Pangaea.|$|E
25|$|The {{rocks of}} the Klamath Mountains {{originated}} as island arcs and continental fragments in the Pacific Ocean. The island masses consisted of <b>rifted</b> fragments of pre-existing continents and volcanic island masses created over subduction zones. These island masses contain rocks {{as old as}} 500million years, dating to the early Paleozoic Era. A succession of eight island terranes moved eastward on the ancient Farallon plate and collided with the North American plate between 260 and about 130million years ago. Each accretion left a terrane of rock of a single age. During the accretion, subduction of the plate metamorphosed the overlying rock and produced magma which intruded the overlying rock as plutons. Serpentinite, produced by the metamorphism of basaltic oceanic rocks, and intrusive rocks of gabbroic to granodiorite composition are common rocks within the Klamath terranes.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} that the <b>rift</b> was the result of extensional forces behind the continental collision of the Grenville Orogeny to the east which in part overlaps the timing of the <b>rift</b> development. [...] Later compressive forces from the Grenville Orogeny likely {{played a major role in}} the <b>rift's</b> failure and closure. [...] Had the <b>rifting</b> process continued, the eventual result would have been sundering of the North American craton and creation of a sea. The Midcontinent <b>Rift</b> appears to have progressed almost to the point where the ocean intruded. [...] But after about 15-22 million years the <b>rift</b> failed. [...] The Midcontinent <b>Rift</b> is the deepest closed or healed <b>rift</b> yet discovered; no known deeper <b>rift</b> ever failed to become an ocean.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{regional}} structure is the Guor Linea <b>rift</b> extending to the northwest, with its counterpart, the Virtus Linea <b>rift,</b> trending {{back in a}} southeast direction. Both of these <b>rift</b> zones cut through the plains units but not through Irnini Mons, indicating the Irnini flows postdate these <b>rifts.</b> Badb Linea is the third <b>rift</b> zone and consists of closely spaced, linear grabens trending in a north-south direction.

25|$|The TGB, at 2.7billion years old, {{dates back}} to the {{formation}} of the supercontinent Kenorland between 2.8and 2.6billion years ago. This large landmass consisted of the Baltic and Siberian shields of Eurasia and Archean provinces of North America, including the Superior craton of which the Temagami belt occupies a part. Rifting of Kenorland began 2.45billion years ago in Ontario with the formation of several large igneous provinces. Initial rifting is represented by basal mafic volcanic rocks in the nearby Huronian Supergroup. Final breakup formed a large group of mafic dike and sill swarms in the North American provinces 2.2–2.1billion years ago. By the Paleoproterozoic era Kenorland had already <b>rifted</b> apart, and the TGB formed {{a small part of the}} supercontinent Columbia starting 1.9–1.8billion years ago. Eastern India, Australia, Laurentia, Baltica, North China, the Amazon shield and portions of Antarctica formed the landmass until it ruptured 1.5–1.4billion years ago. In the late Mesoproterozoic era 1.1billion years ago, the Temagami belt was part of another supercontinent. This former supercontinent, known as Rodinia, included Oaxaquia, Rockall, Laurentia, Baltica, Australia, West Africa, South China, Amazonia, Mawson and Río de la Plata cratons, as well as the Pampean terrane. Laurentia, which included the Superior craton and the TGB, is interpreted to have formed the core of Rodinia because it is surrounded by passive margins formed during the breakup of the supercontinent some 750million years ago.|$|E
25|$|After Rodinia broke apart, its {{southern}} half traveled south {{and crossed the}} South Pole while its northern half traveled northward to the North Pole. The two halves of Rodinia eventually collided with the Congo craton to form the supercontinent Pannotia 600million years ago. In contrast to Rodinia, Pannotia was short-lived. It <b>rifted</b> apart 545million years ago, or only 65million years after it formed. This resulted {{in the creation of}} at least four continents, namely Baltica, Siberia, Gondwana and Laurentia. By the Early Cambrian 514million years ago, Laurenta was located on the equator, Baltica was south of Laurenta, Siberia was just south of the equator east of Laurenta, and Gondwana lied mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. Subsequently, Baltica, Laurenta and microcontinent Avalonia collided in the Devonian period (416-359million years ago) to form minor supercontinent Euramerica. This eventually started to collide with Gondwana and other landmasses to form supercontinent Pangaea 255million years ago. In the Late Triassic period some 152million years ago, Pangaea split into two minor supercontinents, namely Gondwana and Laurasia. The TGB represented a minor portion of western Laurasia until it divided into Eurasia and North America about 94million years ago. Since the Middle Miocene 14million years ago, the TGB {{has been part of the}} Americas, a minor north-south trending supercontinent comprising the continents of North America and South America.|$|E
500|$|As {{subduction}} waned so did {{the force}} that had clamped Siletzia against the continent, and the tectonic regime shifted from compressional to extensional. Deposition of sand from the then proximal Idaho Batholith into the Tyee Formation in southern Oregon may have continued as late as 46.5 Ma, but was interrupted when Siletzia <b>rifted</b> from the continent and began rotating away.

500|$|Seeking {{to explain}} the {{observed}} clockwise paleorotation, and noting that Siletzia appeared to have rotated as a rigid block, [...] proposed two models. First was rotation about a southern pivot {{in contact with the}} Klamath Mountains. This has various problems, especially because at the northern end sediments and even boulders from the continent are found {{at the base of the}} Crescent Formation, showing that it was near the continent from the beginning. In the second model (subsequently refined by [...] ), Siletzia was originally adjacent to the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament, then <b>rifted</b> from the continent and rotated about a northern pivot near the Olympic Peninsula. Because sediments also show the Klamaths in close contact from the start, this requires the Klamaths to have moved with Siletzia. Originally there were conflicts in the understanding of when the Klamaths moved, and with the age and amount of rotation of the Clarno Formation in central Oregon. These were largely cleared up in a study of the Clarno Formation by [...] and illustrated with a palinspastic reconstruction as of 38 Ma.|$|E
