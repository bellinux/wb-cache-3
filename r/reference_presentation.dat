Using a sample of 14. 3 fb^- 1 of pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, no significant excess of events over the background expectation is observed. This observation is interpreted as constraining several signal hypotheses beyond the Standard Model and limits are set at 95 % confidence level on relevant parameters of the signal hypotheses.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether unattended visual, auditory and tactile stimuli {{compete for}} capacity-limited early sensory processing across senses. In three experiments, we probed competitive audio-visual, visuo-tactile and audio-tactile stimulus interactions. To this end, continuous visual, auditory and tactile stimulus streams (‘reference’ stimuli) were frequency-tagged to elicit steady-state responses (SSRs). These electrophysiological oscillatory brain responses indexed ongoing stimulus processing in corresponding senses. To induce competition, we introduced transient frequency-tagged stimuli in same and/or different senses (‘competitors’) during <b>reference</b> <b>presentation.</b> Participants performed a separate visual discrimination task at central fixation {{to control for}} attentional biases of sensory processing. A comparison of reference-driven SSR amplitudes between competitor-present and competitor-absent periods revealed reduced amplitudes when a competitor was presented in the same sensory modality as the reference. Reduced amplitudes indicated the competitor's suppressive influence on reference stimulus processing. Crucially, no such suppression was found when a competitor was presented in a different than the reference modality. These results strongly suggest that early sensory competition is exclusively modality-specific and does not extend across senses. We discuss consequences of these findings for modeling the neural mechanisms underlying intermodal attention...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Evaluating {{the reasons}} of {{emergency}} patient dissatisfaction {{and trying to}} eliminate them is a step towards increasing {{the quality of care}} and profitability. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the reasons of patient dissatisfaction in the emergency department of Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was done in the time interval between March 2012 and October 2014. All the patients who had declared their dissatisfaction, whether written, verbal, or by phone, were included. Using a pre-designed checklist, data were gathered regarding characteristics of dissatisfaction including: type, <b>reference,</b> <b>presentation,</b> subject, and outcome and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Significance level was considered as p< 0. 05. Results: 123 cases of dissatisfaction were detected. In 31 (25. 2 %) cases the patient was right, in 41 (33. 3 %) the hospital was right and 51 (41. 5 %) cases had no outcome. The dissatisfactions were written in 23 (18. 7 %) cases, by phone in 17 (13. 8 %), and verbal in 83 (67. 5 %), which showed no significant correlation with the outcome (p= 0. 277). Only 31 (25. 2 %) cases were declared by the patients themselves which had no correlation with the outcome (p= 0. 747). However, there was a significant correlation between the type (p= 0. 025) and subject (p< 0. 001) of dissatisfaction with the outcome. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that most cases of dissatisfaction were assigned to the surgery group and nursing service. Low quality care and bad behavior of the staff were among the most common causes of patients’ dissatisfaction. In all cases of dissatisfaction regarding the neurosurgery service, internal medicine service, and admission unit, the patients have been right. In contrast, in all cases of triage and laboratory unit, the hospital has been right. </p...|$|E

A documentation of this worldwide initiative is at [URL] A <b>reference</b> <b>presentation,</b> prepared by a coordinated pool of leading scientists in the field, was available to speakers. In response to feedbacks and suggestions, we upgraded it to a "Presentation Review" of which we provide here the Explanatory Notes, the link to the. pptx file, and some image of the slides. This Presentation Review is an innovative scientific product to meet the request of information about the phenomenology of the DM mystery at galactic scale. This Review concerns the mass discrepancy phenomenon detected in galaxies, usually accounted by postulating the presence of a non luminous non baryonic component. In the theoretical framework of Newtonian Gravity we recall the properties of Dark Matter halos as emerging from the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations performed in the current Λ CDM scenario. Then, the simple but much-telling phenomenology of the distribution of dark and luminous matter in Spirals, Ellipticals, and dwarf Spheroidals is reported. We show that a coherent observational framework emerges from reliable data of different large samples of objects and it is obtained by different methods of investigation. We then highlight the impressive evidence that the distribution of dark and luminous matter are closely correlated and that have universal features. Hints on the cosmological role of this phenomenological scenario are then given. Finally, we discuss the constraints on the elusive nature of the dark particle that the actual distribution of DM around galaxies pose on its direct and indirect searches.

Evidence from a randomized controlled trial, systematic review or meta- analysis was commonly cited to support claims. However, the more frequent use of data that have not been published and independently reviewed in the US compared to Australia and Malaysia raises questions on the quality of references in the US.

40|$|At Highmark Inc. Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is used {{to provide}} access to large amounts of data stored in Highmark’s data storage system, the “Enterprise Data Warehouse. ” A common actuarial metric is the {{calculation}} of Per Member Per Month cost, or PMPM. The numerator in this ratio is total claims cost in dollars. The denominator is total members enrolled, including members who have no claim costs and are not represented in the numerator. This metric is a challenge in standard OLAP reporting tools because the numerator and denominator represent different populations at different levels of summation. If a user wants to look at the data across various levels of claims dimensions, such as CLAIM TYPE, the numerator will change depending on whether the user is looking at Inpatient, Outpatient, Professional or Drug claims. However, the denominator, the total population of members remains constant across these levels. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the development steps required to generate PMPM using SAS ® OLAP Server and Futrix®.
