5|$|Central to Edward III's {{policy was}} {{reliance}} on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new earls on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded {{the ranks of the}} peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the Order of the Garter, probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the <b>Round</b> <b>Table</b> of King Arthur never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the <b>Round</b> <b>Table</b> project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially {{at the time of the}} institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the <b>Round</b> <b>Table</b> in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter, but the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a <b>round</b> <b>table</b> game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected <b>Round</b> <b>Table</b> fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter. Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her garter at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y pense – shame on him who thinks ill of it.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical {{activities of the}} <b>Round</b> <b>Table</b> members, it was perhaps inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue.

5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British rulers, and too co-operative with them.
