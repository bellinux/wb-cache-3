25|$|An autobiographical {{memory is}} a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to memory of a person's history. An individual does not <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> everything {{that has happened in}} one's past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from memory. Autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical memory is fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.|$|E
25|$|The Karen {{people were}} a primitive, hunted {{minority}} group of ancient Tibeto-Burman ancestry scattered {{in the forests}} and jungles of the Salween River and in the hills along the southeast coast. Judson was the first missionary {{to make contact with}} them in 1827, when he ransomed and freed a debt-slave from one of his early converts. The freed slave, Ko Tha Byu, was an illiterate, surly man who spoke almost no Burmese and was reputed to be not only a thief, but also a murderer who admitted killing at least 30 men, but could not <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> how many more.|$|E
25|$|The book Coleridge {{was reading}} before {{he fell asleep}} was Purchas, his Pilgrimes, or Relations of the World and Religions Observed in All Ages and Places Discovered, from the Creation to the Present, by the English clergyman and {{geographer}} Samuel Purchas, published in 1613. The book contained {{a brief description of}} Xanadu, the summer capital of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan. The text about Xanadu in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, which Coleridge admitted he did not <b>remember</b> <b>exactly,</b> was: In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place.|$|E

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger looked through {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had found the right actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> which was the one he liked. Eichinger looked through the tape and found {{what he thought was a}} suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode {{with a score}} of 9.2 out of 10. He thought that after a [...] "stereotypical, over-the-top" [...] {{characterization}} in past episodes, Gaston [...] "stepped up his portrayal" [...] as Harris and was [...] "annoying... {{in a much more}} believable way." [...] Isler found the revelation surrounding Harris to be [...] "deliciously surprising," [...] and wrote that the [...] "last twenty minutes of the episode really ramped up the suspense and action." [...] However, the IGN reviewer thought that while the conversation with Grayson was an [...] "hilarious homage to Leonard Nimoy, it seemed completely superfluous in terms of the overall storyline." [...] Isler concluded his review on a positive note by focusing on Noble's performance, calling it [...] "one of the best scenes [...] has ever done as Walter Bishop. It was emotional, believable, and perfectly accurate for a character that has a high level of self-loathing and remorse for what he's done, and the hopeless frustration {{of not being able to}} <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> why he did it." ...|$|E

6000|$|The sun {{was shining}} into his bedroom when Philip Romilly was awakened the next morning by a {{discreet}} tapping at the door. He {{sat up in bed}} and shouted [...] "Come in." [...] He had no occasion to hesitate for a moment. He knew perfectly well where he was, he <b>remembered</b> <b>exactly</b> everything that had happened. The knocking at the door was disquieting but he faced it without a tremor. The floor waiter appeared and bowed deferentially.|$|R
60|$|Ruggedo now began pronouncing the Magic Word {{in every}} way he could think of, hoping to hit the right one, and the Fox, hiding in a bush, was {{somewhat}} troubled by the fear that he might succeed. However, the Wizard, who was used to magic arts, remained calm and soon <b>remembered</b> <b>exactly</b> how Kiki Aru had pronounced the word. So he repeated the sentence he had before uttered and Ruggedo the Nome became an ordinary walnut.|$|R
500|$|On the album's {{recording}} sessions, Smith noted [...] "there {{was a lot}} {{of drugs}} involved". The band took LSD and drank a lot of alcohol, and to save money, they slept in the office of their record label. The musicians usually turned up at eight, and left at midday looking [...] "fairly deranged". Smith related: [...] "We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night they would bring in supplies. We decided we weren't going to throw anything out. We built this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew". According to Tolhurst, [...] "we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can't <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> why, but we did". The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, [...] "At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centered". He also noted that with the album, he [...] "channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something".|$|E
500|$|PC Zone {{stated that}} [...] "the taste {{left in the}} mouth is a bitter one", noting that [...] "Opposing Force is a few {{excellent}} ideas strung together by pedestrian Half-Life padding", but concluded that [...] "it was still a good weekend's worth of entertainment". Eurogamer stated that Opposing Force still had similar problems to other expansion packs, commenting that [...] "χ amount of new content has been created {{and it is going}} to be cut into the old content in a linear way to make it look like an all new game", but noted that [...] "fortunately though the new stuff in Opposing Force... is pretty damn good". Although praising the level design as the game's strongest point, the reviewer felt that [...] "towards the end of the game... they were running out of development time". Reviewing for IGN, Vincent Lopez stated that the game [...] "does a fantastic job of making you <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> why you enjoyed the original so much", but criticized this as the biggest drawback, commenting that [...] "you may find yourself wishing for a more original experience", but concluded that [...] "for good, and bad: it's good to be back".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} version of Greed {{has been called}} the [...] "holy grail" [...] for film archivists. Various reports of the {{original version}} proved to be unfounded. Among these [...] "sightings" [...] are a claim that a copy existed in a vault in South America that was only screened once a year for invited guests on New Year's Eve. Another claim was that a copy in the possession of a Texan millionaire was sold to Henri Langlois of Cinémathèque Française. Other claims include that a film society in Boston held a private screening of a print found by a World War II veteran in Berlin from a tip by Emil Jannings, that David Shepherd of the American Film Institute had found a copy at a garage sale, and that the head of a film society in Redwood City, California, owned [...] "the longest existing version of Greed (purchased in Europe)." [...] Stroheim himself once stated that Benito Mussolini owned a personal copy of the film. [...] Stroheim's son Joseph von Stroheim once claimed that {{when he was in the}} Army during World War II, he saw a version of the film that took two nights to fully screen, although he could not <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> how long it was.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "And so they are. And so {{much the}} better! Bring the {{cigarettes}} and the bottle and some glasses here, Nora, and then ask Mr. Ashley to come." [...] She walks away to the window, and hurriedly hums a musical comedy waltz, not quite in tune, as from not <b>remembering</b> <b>exactly,</b> and after Nora has tinkled in with a tray of glasses she lights a cigarette and stands puffing it, gasping and coughing a little, as Walter Ashley enters. [...] "Oh, Mr. Ashley! Sorry to make you wait." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus mused Godfrey, {{trying to}} picture to himself what Isobel looked {{like when she}} had stood by his side on that long-past autumn eve, and only succeeded in <b>remembering</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what she looked like}} when she was kissing a rose with a certain knight in armour in a square garden, since for some perverse reason it was this picture that {{remained}} so painfully clear to his mind. Then he drifted off into speculations upon the general mystery of things of a sort that were common with him, and in these became oblivious of all else.|$|R
500|$|American Graffiti {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Based on 43 reviews {{collected by}} Rotten Tomatoes, 95% {{of the critics}} enjoyed the film with an average score of 8.4/10. The consensus reads: [...] "One {{of the most influential}} of all teen films, American Graffiti is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads' last days of innocence." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and praised it for being [...] "not only a great movie but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie's success in <b>remembering</b> <b>exactly</b> how it was to be alive at that cultural instant".|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{frequently}} mentions E. Nesbit in interview, citing her [...] "very real" [...] child characters. In 2000, she said, [...] "I think I {{identify with}} E Nesbit {{more than any}} other writer", and described Nesbit's The Story of the Treasure Seekers as, [...] "Exhibit A for prohibition of all children's literature by anyone who cannot <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> how it felt to be a child." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There was a National Park out there, but I can't <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> {{where it}} was [...] [...] [...] at least, it wasn't of {{substantial}} significance {{in the scheme of}} things. The thing that was significant was that we had to double the output of power in this state in ten years in order [...] supply the demands of industry and the community. And this was the scheme that looked as though it could do a greater part of [...] job for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy {{as to what}} his exact role was, Page often points {{out that it is}} hard to <b>remember</b> <b>exactly</b> what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview he explained that [...] "I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session... I was able to fit all these different roles." ...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Legion of 3 Worlds" [...] was {{previously}} used by Superman during [...] "Lightning Saga" [...] story arc. Superman {{used the term}} to describe [...] "one of the Legion's greatest adventures." [...] He stated that the full story of this event went undocumented because none of the Legionnaires <b>remembered</b> <b>exactly</b> what had occurred. Brainiac 5 later mentions that the adventure involved the Tornado Twins. The Legionnaire Star Boy (then a present-day member of the Justice Society of America under the name Starman) alludes to this encounter, saying that he met [...] "another Thom and another Thom", and briefly mentions the Post-Zero Hour speedster XS, stating that she harbored a crush on Superman.|$|R
60|$|I <b>remembered</b> <b>exactly</b> what I {{had done}} {{on that day}} long ago. I had half slid on a miry descent; it was still there; a little lower I had knocked {{off the top of}} a thistle; the thistles had not been discouraged, but were still growing. I {{recalled}} it because I had wondered why one knocks off the tops of thistles; and then I had thought of Tarquin; and then I had recited most of Macaulay's VIRGINIA to myself, for I was young. And then I came to a tattered edge where the very tuft had whitened with the sawdust and brick-dust from the new row of houses; and two or three green stars of dock and thistle grew spasmodically about the blinding road.|$|R

60|$|Then, as {{they came}} aft together, Austin also took off his cap, and touched Miss Gascoyne's arm {{as he turned to}} the cleric. The girl rose gravely, with a tinge of {{heightened}} colour in her face and a little inclination, and, though nobody <b>remembered</b> <b>exactly</b> what was said, unless it was the eminent cleric, who was, as usual with his kind, a polished man of the world as well, he moved on with the girl on one side of him and Macallister talking volubly in a most barbarous jargon on the other. Mrs. Hatherly and the little priest took their places behind them, and Austin gathered that as a special favour Macallister was going to show them all his engines. Jacinta leaned back in her seat and laughed musically.|$|R

Then there was a dispute who should have the one that was left. James knew it was his; he said he <b>remembered</b> <b>exactly</b> how his looked; and Rollo knew it was his, for the head and the stars were very bright on his, and they were very bright on this.

40|$|Conventional {{encryption}} technology {{often requires}} users {{to protect a}} secret key by selecting a password or passphrase.

As time passes, the ability to remember the passphrase fades and the user may eventually lose access to the secret key. We propose a scheme whereby a user can protect a secret key using the entropy" in his own life, by encrypting the passphrase using the answers to several personal questions. We designed the scheme so the user can forget answers to a subset of the questions and still recover the secret key, while an attacker must learn the answer to a large subset of the questions in order to recover the secret key...|$|R
