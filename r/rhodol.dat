40|$|A xanthene-forming {{condensation}} reaction yields <b>rhodol</b> and rhodamine dyes {{carrying a}} zinc-binding ligand {{that includes the}} aniline-type nitrogen donor of the fluorophores. Upon zinc coordination in neutral aqueous solution, <b>rhodol</b> RF 3 behaves as a ratiometric sensor, and rhodamine RA 1 acts as a turn-off intensity-based indicator. Both fluorescent compounds bind the divalent zinc cation with micromolar affinity.

40|$|Formazan-based {{colorimetric}} cytotoxicity assays, {{such as the}} MTT assay, {{are typically}} used to assess cell viability with only metabolically active cells reducing tetrazolium salts into the formazans, which is then quantified by absorbance. Fluorescence offers several advantages compared to colorimetric assays and would enable techniques such as flow cytometry and confocal microscopy {{to be used for}} analysis. Here, fluorescent formazans 10, 11 and 12, and their corresponding tetrazolium salts 13, 16 and 24, respectively, were synthesised by incorporation of a known fluorophore backbone (coumarin, fluorescein and <b>rhodol)</b> with disruption of the conjugated system preventing or reducing fluorescence of the tetrazolium salts. The tetrazolium moiety was able to quench the fluorescence of the incorporated fluorescein and O-methyl <b>rhodol,</b> whereas with the coumarin-based tetrazolium salt the fluorescence was only quenched under acidic conditions. These tetrazolium salts were successfully reduced to the fluorescent formazans with cells and offer a step forward in the development of fluorescent cytotoxicity assays.

40|$|Fluorophores are {{potentially}} useful for in vivo cancer diagnosis. Using relatively inexpensive and portable equipment, optical imaging with fluorophores permits real-time detection of cancer. However, fluorophores can be toxic {{and must be}} investigated {{before they can be}} administered safely to patients. A review of published literature on the toxicity of 19 widely used fluorophores was conducted by searching 26 comprehensive biomedical and chemical literature databases and analyzing the retrieved material. These fluorophores included Alexa Fluor 488 and 514, BODIPY FL, BODIPY R 6 G, Cy 5. 5, Cy 7, cypate, fluorescein, indocyanine green, Oregon green, 8 -phenyl BODIPY, rhodamine 110, rhodamine 6 G, rhodamine X, <b>rhodol,</b> TAMRA, Texas red, and Tokyo green. Information regarding cytotoxicity, tissue toxicity, in vivo toxicity, and mutagenicity was included. Considerable toxicity-related information was available for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved compounds indocyanine green and fluorescein, but published information on many of the non-FDA-approved fluorophores was limited. The information located was encouraging because the amounts of fluorophore used in molecular imaging probes are typically much lower than the toxic doses described in the literature. Ultimately, the most effective and appropriate probes for use in patients will be determined by their fluorescent characteristics and the safety of the conjugates...|$|E
