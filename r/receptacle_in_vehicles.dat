Originally developed for holding satellite in bay of Space Shuttle orbiter, concept also adaptable to such terrestrial uses as carrying odd-shaped equipment by truck. Cradle set consists of single prime cradle and several basic cradles. Composed of bar bent into a half circle, each cradle has own keel and longeron trunnions that brace structure by mating with <b>receptacles</b> <b>in</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{and its own}} foam pads, on which load rests. One 548 -lb (249 -kg) cradle supports up to 3, 000 lb (1, 361 kg); thus, 15, 000 -lb (6, 800 -kg) object requires five cradles distributed along its length. Through their trunnions, cradles spread weight of load along vehicle...|$|R

Results of a multiple baseline design across the two departments indicated that the sign prompt increased recycling behavior.
