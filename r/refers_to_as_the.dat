5|$|In {{the final}} {{segment of the}} train's journey around the park, it climbs a two-percent grade through the Tomorrowland section, passes the Space Mountain roller coaster attraction, and travels over a small bridge before it arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station. This completes what the park <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Grand Circle Tour.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Beaumont {{returns to}} his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina, from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. She tells him details about the ear case and a {{suspicious}} woman, Dorothy Vallens, who may {{be connected to the}} case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.|$|E
5|$|When {{the journey}} continues, the train goes across another access road and enters a tunnel {{containing}} the Grand Canyon Diorama {{followed by the}} Primeval World Diorama. As the train runs alongside the Grand Canyon Diorama, the main theme from On the Trail, the third movement of Ferde Grofé's Grand Canyon Suite, can be heard; and as the train runs alongside the Primeval World Diorama, music from the 1961 film Mysterious Island can be heard. Shortly after leaving the tunnel, the train arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station, completing what the park <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Grand Circle Tour.|$|E

25|$|The sonnets' {{contents}} are, as {{is typical}} of Rilke, highly metaphorical. The character of Orpheus (whom Rilke <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “god with the lyre”) appears {{several times in the}} cycle, as do other mythical characters such as Daphne. There are also biblical allusions, including a reference to Esau. Other themes involve animals, peoples of different cultures, and time and death.|$|E
25|$|Effects not {{generally}} associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved. Traditional pen-and-ink {{techniques such as}} stippling and cross-hatching {{can be used to}} create half-tones or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Wow Factor.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Gatorade re-branded {{a number}} of its products. Original Gatorade was {{initially}} re-labeled as Gatorade G. Gatorade Rain was re-labeled as No Excuses. Gatorade AM was re-labeled Shine On; Gatorade X-Factor was relabeled as Be Tough; and Gatorade Fierce was relabeled Bring It. However these names were short-lived, as a two-percent decline in market share in 2009 led to a broader repositioning of the entire line in 2010. Beginning in February 2010, the Gatorade product portfolio was re-positioned around what the company <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> G Series, categorizing varieties of its products into three main segments: before, during, and after athletic events.|$|E

It is listed in their rentals from 1815 (some of those for 1772-1795 exist but don’t mention a bank; those for 1796-1813 are missing). The names applied to the site are sometimes {{a little out of}} date since the list of rented properties was copied from one year <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next.1815: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Aberystwyth Bank; 1816: Rentals missing; 1817-1819: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Banking Company; 1820-1826: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> Davies, Morris and Co; 1826-1835: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> William, Davies and Co; 1834: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Williams, Davies, Benson, Jones and Co on map of Aberystwyth; 1836-1838; <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> Messrs Benson and Co; 1839-1845: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Bank (property leased by Rice Jones Esq); 1846-1853: <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> North and South Wales bank; 1864: the property formerly occupied by {{the bank was}} available for lease.|$|R

25|$|According to American {{fundamentalist}} Protestant author Hal Lindsey, the Third Temple {{could be}} built {{right next to the}} Dome of the Rock. He believes, based on the theory of Dr. Asher Kaufman regarding the location of the Eastern Gate, that the Dome of the Rock was built on what the Bible <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Court of the Gentiles. He states that according to Revelation 11:1–2, the rebuilding of the Third Temple was not to include the section of the temple mount known as The Court of the Gentiles. Therefore, he believes that the Third Temple and the Dome of the Rock could stand side by side.|$|E
25|$|For example: As {{a result}} of heavy traffic, a {{recovering}} alcoholic may decide one afternoon to exit the highway and travel on side roads. This {{will result in the}} creation of a high-risk situation when he realizes he is inadvertently driving by his old favorite bar. If this individual is able to employ successful coping strategies, such as distracting himself from his cravings by turning on his favorite music, then he will avoid the relapse risk (PATH 1) and heighten his efficacy for future abstinence. If, however, he lacks coping mechanisms—for instance, he may begin ruminating on his cravings (PATH 2)—then his efficacy for abstinence will decrease, his expectations of positive outcomes will increase, and he may experience a lapse—an isolated return to substance intoxication. So doing results in what Marlatt <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Abstinence Violation Effect, characterized by guilt for having gotten intoxicated and low efficacy for future abstinence in similar tempting situations. This is a dangerous pathway, Marlatt proposes, to full-blown relapse.|$|E
25|$|The stanza {{begins with}} a celebration of divine power, and then {{abruptly}} shifts to a darker, more allusive train of thought, featuring condemnation of a renowned poet, Archilochus, Grown fat on the harsh words of hate. Archilochus was an iambic poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous versea regrettable tendency {{from the viewpoint of}} Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar's meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron's court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as a pair of ravens (Olympian 2). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of Pythian 2 and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a rolling flood of eloquence and Horace below <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> uncontrollable momentum of a river that has burst its banks. Longinus likens him to a vast fire and Athenaeus refers to him as the great-voiced Pindar.|$|E

500|$|McKinsey has a de-centralized structure, whereby {{different}} offices operate similarly, but independently. Each {{office is}} expected to put the overall organization's best interest before the office's, which McKinsey <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "one firm" [...] principle. Consultants and engagements are often shared across offices. Revenues from all offices are pooled and an individual office's revenue does not directly affect it financially. The company's budgeting is centralized, but individual consultants are given a large degree of autonomy.|$|E
500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{describes}} [...] "Attack on Cloudbase" [...] as [...] "thrilling", opining {{that it is}} [...] "perhaps the highlight" [...] of the series. Like Stansfield, he {{is critical}} of what he <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "lame, 'it was all a dream' ending", judging it to be rendered more frustrating {{by the fact that}} the series' final episode, [...] "The Inquisition", is a clip show that ends ambiguously with regard to the fates of Spectrum and the Mysterons: [...] "Cut the final few minutes from 'Attack on Cloudbase' and imagine what a finale that would have been!" ...|$|E
50|$|Bilevel {{optimization}} is {{a special}} kind of optimization where one problem is embedded (nested) within another.

Everyone realizes {{that this is where}} Kenneth heard the name. Fed up with the chaos, Liz sends the entire show's staff—including Kenneth and Dr. Spaceman—to her office. Liz ponders over a box of matches and thinks of the woman in court, in which she admitted to committing arson as a way of getting back at her out-of-control employees. She accidentally does start a small fire which is quickly put out but scares everyone out of their bad behavior.|$|E

In Hubbard's Scientology: A History of Man, he asserts humans follow his notion of the [...] "genetic line" [...] of the [...] "genetic entity", which include clams (as well as sloths, volcanoes, and a [...] "sense of being eaten"), and certain human psychological problems descend from difficulties these clams experienced.

500|$|Beginning with Jones and {{continuing}} with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ancient art of weaving" [...] responsible {{for part of}} their sound – the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's (Watts). [...] Likewise, Watts is primarily a jazz player {{who was able to}} bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio, the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.|$|E
