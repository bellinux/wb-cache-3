Risk measurement is performed using fuzzy FMEA method then the risk priority level is obtained. The supply chain structure of organic rice product consist of farmers as suppliers, MUTOS as manufacturer, PT Herbal Estate, PPLH Surabaya, Kaliandra, and CV Mandalabimasakti SM as distributors, and Ranch Market Galaxy Mall as retailer and consumer. The distribution network of organic rice product is retail storage with customer pickup network. The priority risk order in this supply chain based on research from the highest risk to the lowest <b>risk</b> are <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> product return, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> damage or loss quality, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> product contamination during process, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> stock, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> competitor existence, quality incompability <b>risk,</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> contain chemical contaminants, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> supply delays, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> processing delays, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> damage during process, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> machine damage during process, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand changing, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> damaged during storage, and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> production decreased...|$|R

40|$|Target of {{the work}} is to study the Latvian trade sector {{external}} and internal risks, perform risk identification, classification and assessment. In the work are used scientific research methods – analysis and synthesis methods, economic analysis method of enterprises, the special coefficient method and the risk ranking method. The authors had studied the Latvian trade sector in the period from 2004 to 2010. In Latvian trade sector from 2004 to 2006 was observed increment of turnover, but from 2007 was observed decline of turnover. In Latvian trade sector is monopolistic competition. Many enterprises offer a market differentiated trade services. Small and medium companies are merging into trade cooperation and chain stores. The authors had studied average financial indexes of the Latvian trade sector enterprises. Average financial <b>risk</b> coefficient <b>of</b> Latvian trade sector enterprises had increased during the period from 2006 to 2009. The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial <b>risks</b> and classification <b>of</b> the trade technological process risks. The authors have created the algorithms of classification and assessment of the trade sector enterprises’ risks. The economic risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the country’s economic slowdown, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> increment <b>of</b> taxes, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> reduction in consumer’s solvency, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand’s instability and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of credit resources. The financial risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unpaid credit, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> financial instability, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of own capital, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> liquidity and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> debtors. The trade technological process risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> organization of selling goods, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accounting, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ordering goods, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acceptance of goods and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> transportation of goods. In order to develop their business strategies, enterprises need to identify, classify and assess the Latvian trade sector risks.

40|$|Minimizing <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{predation}} {{from multiple}} predators can be difficult, {{particularly when the}} <b>risk</b> effects <b>of</b> one predator species may influence vulnerability to a second predator species. We decomposed spatial <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> predation in a 2 -predator, 2 -prey system into relative <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> encounter and, given an encounter, conditional relative <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> being killed. Then, we generated spatially explicit functions <b>of</b> total <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> predation for each prey species (elk [Cervus elaphus] and mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus]) by combining <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> encounter and kill. For both mule deer and elk, topographic and vegetation type effects, along with resource selection by their primary predator (cougars [Puma concolor] and wolves [Canis lupus], respectively), strongly influenced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> encounter. Following an encounter, topographic and vegetation type effects altered the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> predation for both ungulates. For mule deer, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> direct predation was largely a function of cougar resource selection. However, for elk, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> direct predation {{was not only a}} function of wolf occurrence, but also of habitat attributes that increased elk vulnerability to predation following an encounter. Our analysis of stage-based (i. e., encounter and kill) predation indicates that the <b>risk</b> effect <b>of</b> elk shifting to structurally complex habitat may ameliorate <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> direct predation by wolves but exacerbate <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> direct predation by cougars.

40|$|In general, poverty {{measures}} are estimated by applying income information. However, only using income data for calculating relative poverty {{might lead to}} an incomplete view. For example, a household can be under a poverty threshold even if a household member owns real estate or equity. In this thesis, at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty in Germany is estimated. In {{order to get a}} more complete picture <b>of</b> at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty, a multidimensional approach is applied. Not only at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty, also at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty is measured. Moreover, households that are both at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income and wealth poor are analyzed. Furthermore, several poverty groups are identified: twice-poor which are households that are, at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income and wealth poverty; protected-poor, households that are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty but not at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty; vulnerable-poor, households which are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty but not at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty; non-poor, households which are either at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty nor at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty. Poverty profiles in Germany and their changes over time are analyzed for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. In fact, it is investigated to which degree at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty rates differ in socio-economic characteristics. A logit regression is applied for each dimension and each wave for estimation. For robustness checks, 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals are calculated for all results. Findings suggest that young age, region East Germany, single, lone parent, unemployment and low education are factors that condition the at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty rates. The definition of a certain rate influences the percentage of households that are affected by at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty, however, has a limited effect on poverty profiles.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of health behaviour change (HBC) interventions are less rigorously designed than - for example- drug trials. This study presents an approach to clarifying whether this is due to poor trial design, incomplete trial reporting and/or the inappropriateness <b>of</b> commonly applied <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias assessment criteria. First, a framework of key sources of bias and common strategies for reducing bias risk is developed based on a literature review. Second, we describe the design of a multi-site RCT evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an HIV-treatment adherence intervention (case study). The choices made by the multidisciplinary team trying to minimise the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias are compared against the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias framework. Implementation of common strategies for reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias in the case study; alternative or additional strategies applied; a justification for each deviation from the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias framework. Most of the common strategies for reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias could be implemented.

Several additional, domain-specific <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias strategies were implemented. The literature provides useful guidance for reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias in HBC trials. Yet, the case study suggests that HBC trial designers may face specific challenges that require alternative/additional measures for reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias.
