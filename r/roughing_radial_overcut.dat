Wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) is a best alternative for machining of WC-Co composite into intricate and complex shapes. Efficient machining of WC-Co composite on WEDM is a challenging task since it involves large numbers of parameters. Therefore, in present work, experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the influence of important WEDM parameters on machining performance of WC-Co composite. Response surface methodology, which is a collection of mathematical and experimental techniques, was utilised to obtain the experimental data.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{research has}} gone into the field of electrical discharge machining (EDM), analysis related to the machining efficiency of the process with different electrodes has not been adequately made. Copper and brass are frequently used as electrode materials but graphite {{can be used as}} a potential electrode material due to its high melting point temperature and good electrical conductivity. In view of this, the present work attempts to compare the machinability of copper, graphite and brass electrodes while machining Inconel 718 super alloy. Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array has been employed to collect data for the study and analyze effect of machining parameters on performance measures. The important performance measures selected for this study are material removal rate, tool wear rate, surface roughness and <b>radial</b> <b>overcut.</b> Machining parameters considered for analysis are open circuit voltage, discharge current, pulse-on-time, duty factor, flushing pressure and electrode material.

Inconel 718 {{has been used as}} the work material owing to its extensive application in aerospace industries. A Box– Behnken design of response surface methodology (RSM) has been adopted to estimate the effect of machining parameters on the performance measures. The machining efficiency of the process is evaluated in terms of material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR), surface roughness, <b>radial</b> <b>overcut</b> and white layer thickness which are function of process variables viz. open circuit voltage, discharge current, pulse-on-time, duty factor and flushing pressure. In this work, a novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) has been proposed to get the Pareto-optimal solution. Mutation operator, predominantly used in genetic algorithm, has been introduced in the MOPSO algorithm to avoid premature convergence and to improve the solution quality. To avoid subjectiveness and impreciseness in the decision making, the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained through MOPSO have been ranked by the composite scores obtained through maximum deviation theory (MDT). Finally, a thermal model based on finite element method has been proposed to predict the MRR and tool wear rate (TWR) when work piece is machined with variety of electrode materials. A coupled thermo-structural model has been also proposed to estimate the residual stresses. The numerical models were validated through experimentations. Parametric study is carried out on the proposed model to understand the influence of important process parameters on the performance measures.

40|$|In recent times, nickel-based super alloys {{are widely}} used in aerospace, {{chemical}} and marine industries owing to their supreme ability to retain the mechanical properties at elevated temperature in combination with remarkable resistance to corrosion. Some of the properties of these alloys such as low thermal conductivity, strain hardening tendency, chemical affinity and presence of hard and abrasives phases in the microstructure render these materials very difficult-to-cut using conventional machining processes. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} current research is set to improve the productivity and surface integrity of machined surface of Inconel 625 (a nickel-based super alloy) by impregnating powder particles such as graphite, aluminum and silicon to kerosene dielectric during electric discharge machining (EDM). Initially, temperature distribution, material removal rate (MRR) and residual stress were predicted through numerical modelling of powder-mixed EDM (PMEDM) process. In the experimental investigation, particle size analysis of the as-received powder particles was carried out to identify the distribution of particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of particles indicated the presence of various phases including small amount of impurities. An experimental setup was developed and integrated with the existing EDM system for carrying out PMEDM process. The experiments were planned and conducted by varying five different parameters such as powder concentration, peak current, pulse-on time, duty cycle and gap voltage according to the central composite deign (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). Effects of these parameters along with powder concentration were investigated on various EDM characteristics such as material removal rate (MRR), <b>radial</b> <b>overcut</b> (ROC) and surface integrity aspects including surface crack density (SCD), surface roughness (SR), altered layer thickness (ALT), microhardness of surface and sub-surface regions, chemical and metallurgical alterations of the machined surface and residual stress. Results clearly indicated that addition of powder to dielectric has significantly improved MRR and surface integrity compared to pure dielectric. Among the powders used, graphite has resulted in highest MRR, lowest SCD, least ALT, least microhardness of surface and sub-surface regions. Least ROC, lowest surface roughness and least residual stress were obtained using silicon powder. Aluminum performed well in terms of MRR at low concentration range (upto 6 g/l). Therefore, optimal process performance under a given operating condition depends on judicious selection of powder materials, their size, concentration and process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Blast {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} disease in the major pearl millet growing areas in India. The present investigation was undertaken to study cultural, pathogenic and molecular diversity in the M. grisea isolates infecting pearl millet, effect of temperature and leaf wetness duration on blast development and to screen pearl millet lines for resistance to blast disease. Culture characters of four monoconidial isolates of M. grisea MgPM 45, MgPM 53, MgPM 56 and MgPM 118 were tested on OMA and PDA medium at different pH ranging from pH 5. 5 to pH 8. 0 (pH 5. 5, pH 6. 0, pH 6. 5, pH 7. 0, pH 7. 5 and pH 8. 0) and different incubation temperatures 22 oC, 24 oC, 26 oC, 28 oC and 30 oC to select optimum conditions for growth and sporulation of the fungus. Results of this study indicated that pH of 6. 5 and temperature of 28 oC is ideal for the growth and sporulation of M. grisea adapted to pearl millet. Based on these results, variability in the cultural and morphological characteristics of 65 isolates of M. grisea was studied on OMA medium at pH 6. 5 by incubating at 28 oC. Culture morphology varied significantly among isolates. A range of colour variation in the medium was also observed from buff colour to black among field isolates with smooth or <b>rough</b> margin. The <b>radial</b> growth of the M. grisea isolates varied significantly; maximum radial growth of 4. 25 cm was recorded for isolates MgPM 125 and MgPM 162 whereas minimum radial growth of 2. 30 cm was recorded for the pearl millet isolate MgPM 148. Large variation was also observed for sporulation among field isolates. It was observed that isolates with grayish black and brownish black growth with sector formation produced more spores. In majority of the isolates, maximum sporulation was confined to sectored region. These 65 isolates were also tested for pathogenic variation {{on a set of}} 10 host differentials (ICMB 93333, ICMB 95444, ICMB 97222 -P 1, ICMB 01333, ICMB 02444, ICMR 06444, 863 B-P 2, ICMR 06222 ICMR 11003 and IP 21187). The mean blast severity across the differentials was maximum for isolate MgPM 138 and minimum severity was observed for MgPM 132. Based on reaction type (avirulent/virulent), the 65 isolates were grouped into 28 different pathotypes. Pathotype G 22 comprising isolates MgPM 121, MgPM 137, MgPM 138, MgPM 145, MgPM 148 from Rajasthan and MgPM 173 and MgPM 174 from Uttar Pradesh appeared as most virulent as it could infect all the 10 host differentials whereas pathotype G 2 comprising MgPM 127, MgPM 129, MgPM 132, MgPM 149, MgPM 158, MgPM 159 and MgPM 39 was least virulent. These isolates could be grouped in five main clusters {{based on the results of}} molecular diversity study using URP markers. Among them cluster I (32) and III (31) included more than 95 per cent isolates whereas cluster II, IV and V contained 2 - 3 isolates. Studies on the effect of leaf wetness duration on disease development showed an overall increase in leaf blast severity, lesion length (mm), number of lesions per plant, lesion sporulation and leaf sporulation with the increase in leaf wetness duration (LWD). Based on the results it can be concluded, that both leaf wetness duration and temperature were essential for blast on pearl millet which becomes more severe at longer wetness durations beyond 48 hours during optimum day/night with a temperature ranging from 25 ± 1 / 20 ± 1 oC to 30 ± 1 / 22 ± 1 oC. For the identification of blast resistance, 160 designated B-lines of pearl millet were screened under greenhouse conditions against five pathotype-isolates viz., MgPM 45, MgPM 53, MgPM 56, MgPM 118 and MgPM 119. Multiple-pathotype (3 - 5) resistance was found in 23 lines. Eight lines (81 B, ICMB 88004, ICMB 92444, ICMB 97222 -P 1, ICMB 02111, ICMB 07111, ICMB 09333 and ICMB 09999) were found resistant to all the five pathotypes. Similarly for the identification of stable sources of adult plant resistance, 28 lines were evaluated in the disease nursery (PMBVN) at six locations, Aurangabad, Dhule, Durgapura, Gwalior, Jamnagar and Patancheru during 2013 and 2014. None of the entries in the blast nursery was resistant at all the test locations. However, ICMR 06444 was found resistant at three (Gwalior, Jamnagar and Patancheru) locations and showed moderate resistance at other three locations. ICMB 01333, ICMR 11009 and HHB 146 improved (a hybrid) were resistant at Gwalior and Jamnagar. Pearl millet lines identified in this study that are resistant at 2 - 3 locations can be selected for use in pearl millet breeding programs aiming to develop blast resistant hybrids...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study focussed on the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for determining the structural integrity of carbon coatings on ductile substrates. Through elucidation of these mechanisms, two different coating systems are designed; a multilayered coating and a functionally graded coating. While concentrating upon carbon coatings, {{the findings of this study}} are applicable to a broad range of hard coatings on ductile substrates. The thesis concludes with a chapter outlining a brief study of the effects of gold coatings on silicon under contact load at moderate temperatures to complement the major part of the thesis. Carbon coatings with differing mechanical properties were deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), filtered assisted deposition (FAD) and magnetron sputtering deposition methods. Combinations of these techniques plus variation of deposition parameters enabled composite multilayered and functionally-graded coatings to also be deposited. Substrates were ductile metals; stainless steel and aluminium. Characterisation of the coating mechanical properties was undertaken using nanoindentation and nano-scratch tests. The same techniques were used to induce fracture within the coatings to allow subsequent analysis of the fracture mechanism. These were ascertained with the assistance of cross-sectional imaging of indents prepared using a focussed ion beam (FIB) mill and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using specimen preparation techniques also utilising the focussed ion beam mill. A two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model (FEM) was built of the coating systems using the commercial software package, ANSYS. Substrate elastic-plastic properties were ascertained by calibrating load-displacement curves on substrate materials with the finite element model results. Utilising the simulation of spherical indentation, the distribution of stresses and the locations for fracture initiation were ascertained using finite element models. This enabled determination of the influence such factors as substrate mechanical properties, residual stresses in the coatings and importantly the variation of elastic properties of the different coating materials. Based upon the studies of monolithic coatings, simulations were undertaken on multilayer and functionally-graded coatings to optimise design of these coating types. Based on the results of the modelling, multilayered and functionally graded coatings were then deposited and mechanical testing undertaken to confirm the models. Three major crack types were observed to occur as the result of the spherical nanoindentation on the coatings; ring, radial and lateral cracks. Ring cracks were found to initiate from the top surface of the film, usually at some distance from the edge of the spherical contact. Radial cracks usually initiated from the interface between the coating and the substrate directly under the symmetry axis of indentation and propagated outwards in a non symmetrical star-like fashion. Lateral cracks formed either between layers in the multilayer coatings or at the interface with substrate. Ring and radial cracks were found to form upon loading whereas lateral cracks formed upon both loading and unloading depending upon the crack driving mechanism. Pop-in events in the load displacement indentation curve were found to be indicative of the formation of ring cracks, while the formation of the other types of cracks was not signified by pop-ins but rather by variations in the slope of the curve. The substrate yield strength was found to influence the initiation of all crack systems while compressive stresses in the coating were seen to only influence the formation of ring and radial cracks. However, it was also noted that the initiation of one form of crack tended to then hinder the subsequent formation of others. In multilayer coatings, the lateral cracks were suppressed, as opposed to the monolayer coating system, but a ring crack was observed. This drawback in the multilayer system was successfully addressed by the design of a graded coating having the highest Young&# 146;s modulus at the middle of the film thickness. In this coating, due to the graded nature of the elastic modulus, the stresses at the deleterious locations (top surface and interface) were guided toward the middle of coating and hence increased the load bearing capabilities. The effect of substrate roughness upon the subsequent surface roughness of the coating and also upon the fracture process of the coating during indentation was also investigated. For the coatings deposited on <b>rough</b> substrates, the <b>radial</b> cracks were observed to form initially and this eventfully delayed the initiation of ring cracks. Also the number of radial cracks observed at the interface was found to be proportional to the distribution of the interfacial asperities. In summary, the study elucidated the fracture mechanisms of monolayer, multilayer and graded carbon coatings on ductile substrates under uniaxial and sliding contact loading. The effects of the yield strength, surface roughness of the substrate, along with the residual stress and elastic modulus of the coatings on the fracture of coatings were investigated. The study utilised finite element modelling to explain the experiments observations and to design coating systems...|$|R
