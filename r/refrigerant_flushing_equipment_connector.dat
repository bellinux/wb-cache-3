40|$|Policy Statement: TTUHSC – EL PASO is {{committed}} to providing its staff with suitable drenching and <b>flushing</b> <b>equipment</b> in areas where there is potential for exposure to hazardous chemicals that would be harmful to the body. This Standard Practice Policy and Procedure provides minimum requirements for performance, use and testing of equipment that is used for emergency drenching and flushing of eyes and body. Scope and Distribution: This policy applies throughout TTUHSC-El Paso Campus and Off-Site Centers and Clinics. Contractors will be responsible to provide their own suitable drenching and <b>flushing</b> <b>equipment</b> unless an agreement is made with TTUHSC beforehand. This Policy will be reviewed every two (2) years by the Safety Manager of Safety Services, with recommendations and revisions forward through the Director of Facilities Operations and Maintenance to the Associate Dean for Finance and Administration AVP, Fiscal Affairs. Procedure: Immediate and proper use of emergency drenching and flushing is essential to minimizing injury when contact with hazardous chemicals has occurred. The following guidelines will minimize injury: 1. Begin to flush area immediately after exposure, flush eye or skin for at least 15 minutes continuously. 2. Immediately remove contaminated clothing. Do this while under the shower when gross contamination has occurred. Have someone assist with clothing removal when possible. 3. Hold eyelids open with fingers so water can fully irrigate the eyes. 4. Seek medical attention after flushing the areas of contact for at least 15 minutes. 5.

2500|$|The XLR {{connector}} is a {{style of}} electrical connector, primarily found on professional audio, video, and stage lighting <b>equipment.</b> The <b>connectors</b> are circular in design and have {{between 3 and 7}} pins. They are most commonly associated with balanced audio interconnection, including AES3 digital audio, but are also used for lighting control, low-voltage power supplies, and other applications. XLR connectors are available from a number of manufacturers and are covered by an international standard for dimensions, IEC 61076-2-103. [...] They are superficially similar to the older and smaller DIN connector range, but are not physically compatible with them.|$|R
25|$|Wired {{headphones}} {{are attached}} to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35mm (¼″) and 3.5mm phone connectors.

5000|$|The {{connector}} manufacturer Mennekes {{had developed}} a series of 60309-based connectors that were enhanced with additional signal pins - these [...] "CEEplus" [...] connectors {{have been used for}} charging of electric vehicles since the late 1990s. With the resolution of the IEC 61851-1:2001 control pilot function (aligned with the SAE J1772:2001 proposal) the CEEplus connectors were replacing the earlier Marechal couplers (MAEVA / 4 pin / 32 A) as the standard for electric vehicle charging. When Volkswagen promoted its plans for electric mobility Alois Mennekes contacted Martin Winterkorn in 2008 to learn about the requirements of the charging <b>equipment</b> <b>connectors.</b> Based on requirement of the industry led by utility RWE and car maker Daimler a new connector was derived by Mennekes. The state of charging systems along with the proposed new connector were presented at the start of 2009. This new connector would later be accepted as the standard connector by other car makers and utilities for their field tests in Europe. This choice was supported by the Franco-German joint council on E-mobility in 2009. The proposal is based on the observation that standard IEC 60309 plugs are rather bulky (diameter 68 mm / 16 A to 83 mm / 125 A) for higher current. To ensure easy handling by consumers the plugs were made smaller (diameter 55 mm) and flattened on one side (physical protection against polarity reversal). Unlike the Yazaki connector, however, there is no latch, meaning consumers have no exact feedback that the connector is properly inserted. The lack of a latch also puts unnecessary strain on any locking mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Floating grounds {{can cause}} {{problems}} with audio <b>equipment</b> using RCA <b>connectors</b> (also called phono connectors). With these common connectors, the signal pin connects before the ground, and 2 {{pieces of equipment}} can have a greater difference between their grounds than it takes to saturate the audio input. As a result, plugging or unplugging while powered up can result in very loud noises in speakers. If the ground voltage difference is small, it tends to only cause hum and clicks.|$|R
5000|$|However, in 2008 Category 6A was {{ratified}} {{and allows}} 10 Gbit/s Ethernet while still using the traditional 8P8C connector (also called RJ45).

50|$|Some {{miniaturized}} {{electronic devices}} use 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm jacks as serial port connectors for data transfer and unit programming. This technique is particularly common on graphing calculators, {{such as the}} TI-83 series, and some types of amateur and two-way radio, though in some more modern <b>equipment</b> USB mini-B <b>connectors</b> are provided in addition to or instead of jack connectors. The second-generation iPod Shuffle from Apple has one TRRS jack which serves as headphone, USB, or power supply, depending on the connected plug.|$|R
5000|$|Connectors, {{similar in}} purpose {{to the data}} buses inside a {{computer}} CPU, connect the markers to the peripheral <b>equipment.</b> each <b>connector</b> {{is made up of}} large relays of 30 contacts each, to connect all the leads by which the marker would exchange information and control signals. For example, each of the oblong reed packs in an OR would have to be connected by five leads through the originating register marker connector to transmit the two-out-of-five code representing one dialed digit. For speed, transfer is entirely parallel, requiring many large relays to connect so many wires. Connectors that respond to a peripheral circuit's request for action are given the name of the requesting circuit and [...] "marker", as in ORMC or IRMC. Connectors whose use was requested by a marker are named only for the circuit to which they connect, as in outsender connector, line link connector, and trouble recorder connector.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} batten, a.k.a. lighting batten, {{may be a}} single-pipe or truss batten. Electric battens typically incorporate steel straps {{that are}} used as brackets {{for the support of}} electrical <b>equipment</b> such as <b>connector</b> strips (raceways). The same straps supporting electrical equipment may also connect the two-pipe arrangement of a truss batten. The center-to-center spacing of electric truss pipe, often from 1.5 to 2.5 ft, is typically greater than for a standard truss batten to allow for the proper mounting and focusing of lighting instruments. It is typical for an electric batten to support thousands of pounds of live load.|$|R
5000|$|Stereo audio {{applications}} {{use either}} black and red, grey and red or {{white and red}} RCA connectors; in all three cases, red denotes right. White or purple may also be replaced by black. Some older tape recorders, and equipment like receivers designed to connect to them, use a 5-pin DIN connector to connect left and right for record and playback with a single cable. Adapters between this connector and RCA connectors have used white and red for left and right channel recording, and blue (or sometimes black) and yellow for playback, {{but this is not}} universal. Most modern <b>equipment</b> with RCA <b>connectors</b> for recording devices simply uses white and red for all stereo pairs, whether record or playback.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{standard}} definitions {{are not always}} correctly applied, it is often necessary to consult documentation, test connections with a breakout box, or use trial and error to find a cable that works when interconnecting two devices. Connecting a fully standard-compliant DCE device and DTE device would use a cable that connects identical pin numbers in each connector (a so-called [...] "straight cable"). [...] "Gender changers" [...] are available to solve gender mismatches between cables and connectors. Connecting devices with different types of connectors requires a cable that connects the corresponding pins {{according to the table}} above. Cables with 9 pins on one end and 25 on the other are common. Manufacturers of <b>equipment</b> with 8P8C <b>connectors</b> usually provide a cable with either a DB-25 or DE-9 connector (or sometimes interchangeable connectors so they can work with multiple devices). Poor-quality cables can cause false signals by crosstalk between data and control lines (such as Ring Indicator).|$|R
