40|$|Microbial {{systems are}} known to {{elaborate}} intricate metabolic strategies {{in an effort to}} fend the toxic impact of numerous metals. In this study, we show that the exposure of Pseudomonas fluorescens to aluminum (Al) resulted in a metabolic shift aimed at diverting oxaloacetate towards the biogenesis of an aluminophore. This metabolic alteration was characterized by uncoupling of two gluconeogenic enzymes, namely pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). While PC displayed a sharp increase in activity and expression, PEPCK was severely diminished. Malic enzyme (ME) and NAD kinase (NADK), two enzymes involved in maintaining a <b>reductive</b> <b>environment,</b> were markedly increased in the Al-stressed cells. Hence, Al-exposed Pseudomonas fluorescens evoked a metabolic response aimed at generating oxaloacetate and promoting an intracellular <b>reductive</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of cryomaceration and reductive vinification on chemical and physical indices and on antioxidant compounds of Sauvignon blanc wines, four wine-making procedures were applied: traditional white vinification, skin cryomaceration, vinification in a <b>reductive</b> <b>environment,</b> and {{a combination of the}} last two procedures. Significant differences were highlighted by both conventional analyses and NMR spectroscopy. The strongest changes were for organic acid concentrations (tartaric, in particular) and phenolic content. Cryomaceration caused a strong precipitation of tartaric acid, which may be desired if grapes have high acidity values. Cryomaceration protected those fiavans reactive with vanillin from the action of oxidative enzymes. Vinification in a <b>reductive</b> <b>environment,</b> alone or combined with a cryomaceration step, gave wines with the highest solids content and caused a greater extraction of phenolic compounds from skins compared to traditional winemaking or cryomaceration alone, due to SO 2 solubilisation. Grape oenological expression can be strongly affected by the application of the investigated wine-making procedures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Enhancement of the degradability of the new materials by the introduction of disulfide linkages into the polymer backbone has led to a new group of stimulusresponsive sugar-based polyurethanes able to be degraded by tripeptide glutathione under physiological conditions.

The majority of commercialized plasma torches are working in inert or <b>reductive</b> <b>environments.</b> Recent feasibility study demonstrated the economic profitability of the plasma assisted combustion for the start-up of coal and biomass thermal power plants. In order to prove the technical feasibility of this application, a three phase plasma torch working with consumable graphite electrodes and operating with air at 100 kWe, has been developed. Hereafter, the specifications of this plasma torch are detailed along with a briefing on the early CFD simulation and the main technical challenges encountered. A set of experiments are performed to validate the concept and characterize the torch, first, without combustion, and then, with the injection of a biomass sample.

The model is used to investigate the effect of process conditions, catalyst and particle properties, and transport parameters on the performance of the catalyst for alc. oxidn. It is found that the electron cond. of the catalyst support affects the rate of MGP oxidn. esp. at low bulk liq. oxygen concns., while at high bulk liq. oxygen concns., the catalyst support cond. does not play a role.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} shown to both {{suppress}} and promote tumor growth, depending in part on concentration. Exogenous delivery of NO may lead to tumor suppression. Recent studies have proposed ruthenium nitrosyl complexes as catalytic donors of NO in <b>reductive</b> <b>environments.</b> Catalytic donation can provide a long-term, elevated NO flux compared to single use donors. Site-specific delivery is desirable to reduce systemic side effects, such as lowering of blood pressure. Three new ruthenium nitrosyl complexes were synthesized to impart site-specificity through amide coupling to polymers, silica nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles and antibodies. The catalytic activity of new and existing compounds was then assessed. However, upon one-electron reduction of ruthenium nitrosyl complexes, insignificant amounts of NO were detected, suggesting an alternative mechanism than that proposed in prior reports. The mechanism of [Ru(EDTA) NO]²⁻ decay was more thoroughly analyzed. Spectrophotometric decay of [Ru(EDTA) NO]²⁻ indicates that one or multiple nitrogen oxide species are released. Previous studies have suggested a disproportionation mechanism leading to the generation of more highly reduced species such as N₂ and NH₄⁺. Experiments were designed to analyze possible decomposition products such as [Ru(EDTA) NO]⁻ and [Ru(EDTA) H₂O]²⁻. A disproportionation mechanism was determined likely. Decomposition of [Ru(EDTA) NO]²⁻ was also observable following reductive nitrosylation of [Ru(EDTA) H₂O]⁻ in the presence of HNO. The decomposition product, [Ru(EDTA) H₂O]²⁻, was observed through the binding of pyrazine (pz) or dipyridine (bipy) and formation of [Ru(EDTA) pz]²⁻ or [Ru(EDTA) bipy]³⁻. Formation of [Ru(EDTA) bipy]³⁻ or [Ru(EDTA) pz]²⁻ via reductive nitrosylation of [Ru(EDTA) H₂O]⁻ also provides an indirect method of HNO detection that is selective from NO...|$|R

This ratio being larger than 1.5 means strongly oxidizing environment; being in between 1.0 − 1.5 means weakly oxidizing environment; being in between 0.8 − 1.0 means weakly reducing environment; and being less than 0.8 means strongly <b>reductive</b> <b>environment</b> (Huang 1987). The oxidation analysis results of the Yingcheng Formation in the Xujiaweizi depression, Songliao Basin shows that all Fe 2 O 3 /FeO ratios of volcanic rocks are less than 0.8, and some of them even less than 0.1, which indicated that the volcanic eruption in this area was developed in a subaqueous strong <b>reductive</b> <b>environment</b> (Shan et al. 2013).

Moreover, most of the poly(amido amine) s possess buffer capacities in the pH range pH 7. 4 − 5. 1 that are even higher than polyethylenimine (pEI), a property that may favorably contribute to the endosomal escape of the polyplexes.

They are often employed as drug carriers to provide protection to encapsulated therapeutic molecules against premature metabolism, inactivation and clearance, and to reduce drug leakage and burst release, in vivo. Although significant progress in the medical sector has been registered, challenges still abound for the delivery of therapeutics. As such, the development of requisite nanocarriers and improvement of existing ones is crucial. NCA ROP and OCA ROP provide an alternative to solid phase peptide synthesis for the syntheses of polymeric biomaterials that have targeted applicability in drug delivery, in pharmaceuticals and in tissue engineering.

40|$|Therapeutic {{strategies}} aim {{to regulate}} vasculature either by encouraging vessel growth for tissue engineering or inhibiting vascularization around a tumor. We examined three microenvironmental cues for vascular tissue: soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF covalently bound to a surface, and encapsulation in a degradable hydrogel. ^ Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured at confluence {{for up to}} three weeks in either basal medium or medium containing VEGF. In both cases, expression of typical endothelial genes and proteins were elevated compared to proliferating MSCs. Both treatments resulted in cells capable of internalizing acetylated low density lipoproteins. These results indicate that soluble VEGF does not enhance endothelial characteristics in differentiating MSCs. Interestingly, VEGF did enhance the expression of the arterial protein Ephrin-B 1. Thus, exogenous VEGF may prove to be a valuable tool for specification of arterial fate. ^ We developed a method to control the surface density of VEGF that is covalently attached to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and investigated the effect of VEGF surface density on cellular response. Endothelial cells cultured on surfaces of covalently-bound VEGF did not proliferate in response to cues from the surface. Interestingly, in the presence of soluble VEGF, low surface densities (0. 04 ng VEGF/cm 2) enhanced endothelial proliferation whereas high surface densities (5. 9 ng VEGF/cm 2) inhibited proliferation. Surfaces modified with high surface densities (5. 9 ng VEGF/cm 2) also acted in synergy with an inhibitor of VEGF receptors to further suppress endothelial cell proliferation. VEGF surfaces alone exhibited no effect on the endothelial differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the VEGF surfaces acted in synergy with an inhibitor of VEGF receptors to decrease the ability of differentiated cells to form vascular networks. Together, these results suggest that surface density of bound VEGF affects promotion or inhibition of angiogenic responses. ^ We developed degradable hydrogels for use in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications sensitive to reducing environments. Hydrogels of recombinant resilin-based proteins were formed using the amine-reactive crosslinker, 3, 3 ´-Dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate). Hydrogel formation occurred rapidly (within 131 ± 95 s) at 37 °C, which facilitated homogenous cell encapsulation. The crosslinking was cytocompatible, and endothelial cells were cultured within the hydrogel for up to six days. Hydrogels were softer than previously reported for resilin-based hydrogels and had a storage modulus ranging from 71 ± 29 to 262 ± 66 Pa and a compressive modulus of 21. 1 ± 6. 2 kPa, making them suitable scaffolds for brain, adipose, and cochlear tissue replacements. Additionally, the hydrogels were degraded via reduction with physiologically-relevant concentrations of L-glutathione.

The higher uptake of p(CBA-ABOL) /HSA than that of p(BAP-ABOL) /HSA suggests that the mucoadhesive properties of the p(CBA-ABOL) are beneficial to the uptake process. The transported HSA was located within early endosomes, lysosomes and the cytosol. The enhanced uptake of the p(CBA-ABOL) /HSA nanoparticles, observed in the presence of Cyclosporin A, a non-specific Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) blocker, indicates the possible efflux of these nanoparticles through MDR transporters.

40|$|Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB) {{gasification}} is one {{alternative for}} the production of biofuels. In a DFB gasification process, the bed material plays a crucial role. Primary role of the bed material is to provide the heat needed for the gasification reaction. If the bed material, used in the system, is catalytically active it can improve the quality of the produced gas. In addition, inorganics originate from the biomass are retained in the system in the form of ash, which interacts with the bed material, thus representing catalytic potential. As a consequence of being circulated between oxidative and <b>reductive</b> <b>environments,</b> the bed material releases some inorganics into the gas phase, thereby influencing the final composition of the produced gas. The goal of the present work is to increase our understanding as to how changes in the bed material related to reactions with ash components can be utilized to improve the performance of the system. In this way, {{it should be possible to}} optimize the gasification step, thereby decreasing the cost of biofuel production. Moreover, by choosing naturally occurring bed materials not only the cost of the process is decreased, but also negative impact on the environment which comes with the disposal of the material. This work deals with the application of catalytic bed materials in dual fluidized bed systems, both as a primary measure in the gasification process itself and as a secondary measure for the reforming of the raw gas. Applied directly in the gasification step, the bed material interacts with the inorganics derived from the fuel. As a result of this interaction, the bed material changes its physical and chemical properties, which has impacts for the gasification process. In the present study, four naturally occurring materials were evaluated. In the Chalmers 2 – 4 -MWth gasifier, the effects on the gasification process of interactions between the ash and the bed material were studied for quartz-sand and olivine. The effects on the process were evaluated with respect to: 1) the composition of the produced gas; 2) tar content; and 3) the physicochemical properties of the bed material. The studies yield information about the transport of inorganics between the reactors and their influences on the gas composition. Whereas the release of alkali during gasification implies a potential for enhancement of the gas quality, the presence of these same species represents a risk for agglomeration during combustion. In the Chalmers 12 –MWth boiler, ilmenite was tested as the bed material and as an alkali getter material. The adsorption of potassium to the ilmenite is shown to be non-reversible, and ilmenite shows great promise as a material for decreasing bed agglomeration in fluidized bed boilers. As a secondary measure, downstream of the gasifier, manganese ore was evaluated for its tar-reforming capability in a dual fluidized bed reactor system, in a process known as chemical looping reforming. This material has the ability to reduce tar levels by as much as 72 %, while having high activity towards hydrogen production...|$|R

[46] {{examined}} {{the effect of}} four different wine-making technologies (traditional white vinification, skin cryomaceration, vinification in a <b>reductive</b> <b>environment,</b> and {{a combination of the}} last two procedures) on the metabolite profile of Sauvignon blanc wines, reporting strong changes in organic acid concentrations (mainly tartaric acid) and phenolic content. Negroamaro red wines obtained through different wine-making technologies (traditional, ultrasounds, and cryomaceration with dry ice) and two soil management practices (soil tillage and cover crop) were analyzed by 1 H NMR metabolomics and were discriminated using both supervised (OPLS-DA) and unsupervised (PCA) multivariate models [47]. 1 H NMR spectroscopy with PCA analysis was used to study Cabernet Sauvignon wine samples produced with different cultivation techniques and provided information by connecting technological procedures with the composition changes in wine [48]. Recently, Picone et al. [49] showed that the biodynamic and the organic cultivation managements produce grape berries (V. vinifera L. cv. Sangiovese) that can be differentiated using 1 H NMR-based metabolomics.|$|E
30|$|A higher butanol/acetone {{ratio of}} 2.9 : 1 was found when cassava {{was used as}} the {{substrate}} of an in-situ extractive fermentation by C. acetobutylicum. This ratio had a 64 % increment compared to that on corn-based substrate. The metabolic flux and (key enzymes) genes transcriptional analysis indicated that weakened metabolic fluxes in organic acids (especially butyrate) formation and re-assimilation pathways, which associated with lower buk and ctfAB transcriptional levels, contributed to higher butanol and lower acetone production rate in fermentations on cassava. Moreover, NADH generation was enhanced under the enriched <b>reductive</b> <b>environment</b> of using cassava-based substrate, which converted more carbon flux to butanol synthesis pathway, also leading to a higher ratio of butanol/acetone. To further increase butanol/acetone ratio, tiny amount of electron carrier, neutral red was supplemented into cassava-based substrate at 60  h when butonal production rate reached maximal level. However, neutral red addition enhanced NADH production, followed with strengthening the metabolic fluxes of organic acids formation/re-assimilation pathways, resulted in unchanged in butanol/acetone ratio.|$|E
40|$|Heparin (Hep) {{conjugated}} to poly (amidoamine) dendrimer G 3. 5 (P) via redox-sensitive disulfide bond (P-SS-Hep) was studied. The redox and pH dual-responsive nanocarriers {{were prepared}} {{by a simple}} method that minimized many complex steps as previous studies. The functional characterization of G 3. 5 coated Hep was investigated by the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The size and formation were characterized by the dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy. P-SS-Hep was spherical in shape with average diameter about 11 [*]nm loaded with more than 20 % letrozole. This drug carrier could not only eliminate toxicity to cells and improve the drugs solubility but also increase biocompatibility of the system under <b>reductive</b> <b>environment</b> of glutathione. In particular, P-SS-Hep could enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapy after removing Hep from the surface. These results demonstrated that the P-SS-Hep conjugates could be a promising candidate as redox and pH responsive nanocarriers for cancer chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} calorimetric {{measurements}} is established in a 1500 L pilot bioreactor. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, baker’s yeast has three metabolic pathways: 1) purely oxidative, glucose consuming; 2) purely reductive, glucose consuming and ethanol producing and 3) purely oxidative, ethanol consuming. Designing experiments {{to lead the}} yeast to a single pathway, {{the accuracy of the}} calorimetric measurements are verified. Using on-line data of microbial heat production and substrate consumption, the combustion enthalpies of glucose and ethanol in purely oxidative (aerobic) fed batch fermentations are determined as 15900 and 29000 kJ/kg respectively, Combustion enthalpy of glucose in purely <b>reductive</b> (anaerobic) <b>environment</b> is determined as 511 kJ/kg. These values are in good corresponding with literature data. It is now possible to determine the fraction of substrate uptake utilized for energy (catabolism, k) and biosynthesis (anabolism, a) metabolisms on-line. In oxidative (aerobic) fermentations we determined kSox= 0. 45 for glucose, kEox= 0. 63 for ethanol and in reductive (anaerobic) fermentations kSred= 0. 96 for glucose; the anabolism factors are aSox= 0. 55, aEox= 0. 37 and aSred= 0. 04 respectively. The single pathways can occur together so that an experiment is designed with changing environmental conditions to prove the overall calorimetric model. The result is that measured and the calculated microbial heat energy rates are in good accordance. Calorimetric measurements can be used to monitor yeast metabolism on-line, for advanced control strategies or, to predict fermentations or for designing heat exchanger or bioreactor systems...|$|R
40|$|Iron is {{the most}} {{abundant}} metal {{in the human body}} and mainly works as a cofactor for proteins such as hemoglobin and various enzymes. No independent life forms on earth can survive without iron. However, excess iron is intimately associated with carcinogenesis by increasing oxidative stress via its catalytic activity to generate hydroxyl radicals. Biomolecules with redox-active sulfhydryl function(s) (thiol compounds) are necessary for the maintenance of mildly <b>reductive</b> cellular <b>environments</b> to counteract oxidative stress, and for the execution of redox reactions for metabolism and detoxification. Involvement of glutathione S-transferase and thioredoxin has long attracted the attention of cancer researchers. Here, I update recent findings on the involvement of iron and thiol compounds during carcinogenesis and in cancer cells. It is now recognized that the cystine/glutamate transporter (antiporter) is intimately associated with ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of cell death, observed in cancer cells, and also with cancer stem cells; the former with transporter blockage but the latter with its stabilization. Excess iron in the presence of oxygen appears the most common known mutagen. Ironically, the persistent activation of antioxidant systems via genetic alterations in Nrf 2 and Keap 1 also contributes to carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude the role of iron and thiol compounds as friends or foes, which depends on the quantity/distribution and induction/flexibility, respectively. Avoiding further mutation would be the most helpful strategy for cancer prevention, and myriad of efforts are being made to sort out the weaknesses of cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) {{analysis}} {{was employed to}} extract paleoclimatic information from mollusk shells taken from the Luochuan section located on the Loess Plateau of central China. The {{results show that the}} EPR spectrum of Mn 2 + in mollusk shells is complicated and consists of two sets of six hyperfine lines of Mn 2 + that arise from two non-equivalent Mn 2 + sites in aragonite. There is no obvious inconsistency of EPR spectral intensities among different species of modern mollusks at Luochuan area; the magnitude of EPR spectra intensities of mollusk shells is correlative with the Mn 2 + concentration of the environments. The EPR signals from mollusk shells taken from the loess, which is considered to be formed in the cold and dry glacial environment, are stronger than those from the paleosol deposited under the warm and humid interglacial condition sug-gesting that the Mn 2 + available for mollusks in a cold climate is higher than in a warm climate. We propose that during the glacial period, the mollusks lived in a relatively <b>reductive</b> soil <b>environment</b> with more Mn 2 + while during the interglacial period its environment was more oxidizing with less Mn 2 +. This result provides direct evidence that the loess-paleosol interlayers came into being under alternating redox conditions resulting from fluctuating paleoclimate. The analysis of the EPR spectra of mollusk shells serves as a new tool for retrieving climatic information from the mollusk records...|$|R
