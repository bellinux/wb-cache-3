40|$|Background: Reporting {{templates}} {{are increasingly}} common in all fields of pathology. In this paper, we present {{an assessment of}} the impact of a thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) template on diagnostic classification and cytohistologic concordance. Materials and Methods: A thyroid FNAC <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> was developed and introduced at a university teaching hospital. We examined FNAC reports for a five-month period before introduction of the template and compared these to the five month period after the template introduction. We recorded diagnostic categorization as well as cytohistologic correlation. Results: A total of 168 cases were identified in the five month period prior to the introduction of the <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> and 172 cases in the five month period after the introduction of the <b>reporting</b> <b>template.</b> The template appeared to improve the diagnostic precision of benign conditions without altering the proportion of cases classified as unsatisfactory, benign or abnormal. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of cytohistologic concordance before and after the template introduction. Conclusions: The introduction of a <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> for thyroid FNAC improved diagnostic precision of benign conditions and did not alter the general diagnostic classification or cytohistologic concordance...|$|E

A systematic review identified ten existing templates for reporting major incident medical management, but these templates are not in widespread use. We aimed to address this challenge by designing an open access template for uniform {{reporting of}} data from pre-hospital major incident medical management that will be tested for feasibility. Methods: An expert group of thirteen European major incident practitioners, planners or academics participated in a four stage modified nominal group technique consensus process to design a novel <b>reporting</b> <b>template.</b> Initially, each expert proposed 30 variables. Secondly, these proposals were combined and each expert prioritized 45 variables from the total of 270. Thirdly, the expert group met in Norway to develop the template.

Results: The consensus process resulted in a template consisting of 48 variables divided into six categories;pre-incident data, Emergency Medical Service (EMS) background, incident characteristics, EMS response, patient characteristics and key lessons.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that content-based image retrieval (CBIR) {{can be extremely}} useful for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). However, CBIR has not been established in clinical practice yet. As a widely unattended gap of integration, a unified data concept for CBIR-based CAD results and reporting is lacking. Picture archiving and communication systems and the workflow of radiologists must be considered for successful data integration to be achieved. We suggest that CBIR systems applied to CAD should integrate their results in a picture archiving and communication systems environment such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) structured reporting documents.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{educational}} policy proceeds as though teachers are malleable and ever-responsive to change. Some argue they are positioned as technicians who simply implement policy. However, how teachers go about their work and respond to reform agendas may be contingent upon many factors that are both biographical in nature and workplace related. In this paper we discuss the work of middle school teachers in low-socioeconomic communities from their perspectives. Referring to reflective interviews, meeting transcripts and an electronic <b>reporting</b> <b>template,</b> we examine how teacher participants in a school reform project describe their work - what they emphasise and what they down-play or omit. Using Foucaultian approaches to critical discourse analysis and insights from Dorothy Smith's (2005) Institutional Ethnography, we consider the 'discursive economy' (Carlson, 2005) in teachers' reported experiences of their everyday practices in northern suburbs schools in South Australia in which a democratic progressive discourse exists alongside corporate and disciplinary discourses. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Outcome after {{cardiac arrest}} and {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation {{is dependent on}} critical interventions, particularly early defibrillation, effective chest compressions, and advanced life support.

Despite the development of Utstein templates to standardize research reports of cardiac arrest, international registries have yet to be developed.

The task force revised the core <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> and definitions by consensus.

These findings point to newspaper journalists employing a generic <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> at this time to reproduce copy so ordered as to respond consensually to this incident. Newspapers’ performances across this period privilege official responses and collective national reaction to the bombings as they cauterise an identified social wound produced by the incident.
