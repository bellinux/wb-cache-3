2500|$|Following closure BR {{removed the}} single siding and the {{headshunt}} along the old up line formation.

[...] The point rodding, still NER / LNER standard <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> tube coated with tar was simply cut up into short lengths and left where it fell. [...] This presumably helped to support BR's claim {{that the cost of}} reinstating the signalling made re-opening the line too uneconomic.|$|E
2500|$|Rheinmetall {{designed}} an anti-tank cannon {{using their}} [...] "High-Low Pressure System" [...] that fired a standard general-purpose HE 8.1-cm mortar bomb {{which had been}} modified to function as an anti-tank round with a shaped charge. [...] Normally, a mortar bomb cannot be fired from a cannon, because its thin walls can not endure the high stress forces upon firing from a cannon. [...] The 8.1-cm round was mounted on a rod which was fixed to a <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> plate with eight holes in it. [...] A shear pin held the round to the rod. [...] The round and the plate were fitted {{at the mouth of}} a cut-down cannon shell casing which contained two propellant bags. [...] On firing, the pressure would build up in the shell casing, which along with the reinforced breech acted as the [...] "High Pressure Chamber" [...] and bled out the steel plate holes at half the pressure to the thinner walled cannon barrel which acted as the [...] "Low Pressure Chamber". [...] Unlike standard cannon, in which the propellant [...] "kicks" [...] the projectile out the barrel with an almost instant acceleration to maximum muzzle velocity, the Rheinmetall concept [...] "shoved" [...] the projectile out the barrel at a constantly increasing muzzle velocity. [...] There was recoil, but nowhere near the recoil of the 5-cm and 7.5-cm anti-tank cannons being used at that time by the German forces, which required a heavy constructed carriage, and both a heavy and complex hydraulic recoil-mechanism as well as a muzzle brake to contain the massive recoil on firing. The Rheinmetall solution required only a lightweight recoil-unit and muzzle brake.|$|E

2500|$|For platinum, gold, {{and silver}} jewellery, {{there are many}} {{techniques}} to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery {{is the most common}} and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving [...] "brush strokes". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a <b>rounded</b> <b>steel</b> hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.|$|R
