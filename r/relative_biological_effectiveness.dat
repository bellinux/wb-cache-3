The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher <b>Relative</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> (RBE).

25|$|In {{addition}} to the possible in-flight performance and motor skill changes that were described above, the immediate CNS effects (i.e., within 24 hours following exposure to low-LET radiation) are anorexia and nausea. These prodromal risks are dose-dependent and, as such, can provide {{an indicator of the}} exposure dose. Estimates are ED50 = 1.08 Gy for anorexia, ED50 = 1.58 Gy for nausea, and ED50=2.40 Gy for emesis. The relative effectiveness of different radiation types in producing emesis was studied in ferrets and is illustrated in figure 6-7. High-LET radiation at doses that are below 0.5 Gy show greater <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> compared to low-LET radiation. The acute effects on the CNS, which are associated with increases in cytokines and chemokines, may lead to disruption in the proliferation of stem cells or memory loss that may contribute to other degenerative diseases.|$|E

[...] The rationale is that tumours containing hypoxic cells (cells with enough oxygen concentration to be viable, yet not enough to be X-ray-radiosensitive) and cells deficient in oxygen are resistant to killing by X-rays. [...] Thus, the lower Oxygen Enhancement Ratio (OER) of neutrons confers an advantage. [...] Also, neutrons have a higher <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (RBE) for slow-growing tumours than X-rays, allowing for an advantage in tumour cell killing.|$|E

This issue must be resolved to en-able proper evaluation of radiation risks from breast screen-ing. Here a definitive assessment of the <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of 29 kVp X rays compared {{to the quality of}} radiation to which the atomic bomb survivors were exposed is presented for the first time. The standard radiation sources used were (a) an atomic bomb simulation spectrum and (b) 2. 2 MeV electrons from a strontium- 90 /yttrium- 90 (90 Sr/ 90 Y) radioac-tive source. The biological end point used was neoplastic transformation in vitro in CGL 1 (HeLa 3 human fibroblast hybrid) cells. No significant difference was observed for the <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the two high-energy sources for neo-plastic transformation. A limiting <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> effective-ness (RBEM) of 4. 42 6 2. 02 was observed for neoplastic trans-formation by 29 kVp X rays compared to these two sources. This compares with values of 4. 67 6 3. 93 calculated from previously published data and 3. 58 6 1. 77 when the reference radiation was 200 and 220 kVp X rays. This suggests that the risks associated with mammography screening may be ap-proximately five times higher than previously assumed and that the risk–benefit relationship of mammography exposures may need to be re-examined. q 2004 by Radiation Research Societ...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{alternative}} beams being recently considered for external cancer radiotherapy, C- 9 has received some attention {{because it is}} expected that its <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> could be boosted by the beta-delayed emission of two alpha particles and a proton that takes place at the ion-stopping site. Experiments have been performed to characterise this exotic beam physically and models have been developed to estimate quantitatively its biological effect. Here, the particle and heavy-ion transport code system (PHITS) is used to calculate energy-deposition and linear energy transfer distributions for a C- 9 beam in water and the results are compared with published data. Although PHITS fails to reproduce some of the features of the distributions, it suggests that the decay of C- 9 contributes negligibly to the energy-deposition distributions, thus contradicting the previous interpretation of the measured data. We have also performed a microdosimetric calculation to estimate the biological effect of the decay, which was found to be negligible; previous microdosimetric Monte-Carlo calculations were found to be incorrect. An analytical argument, of geometrical nature, confirms this conclusion and gives a theoretical upper bound on the additional <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the decay.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade short interfering RNA (siRNA) became an {{important}} means for functional genomics {{and the development of}} gene-specific drugs. However, major technical hurdles in the application of siRNA include its cellular delivery followed by its intracellular trafficking and its release in order to enter the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. The novel phosphorothioate-stimulated cellular uptake of siRNA contrasts other known delivery systems because it involves a caveosomal pathway in which large amounts of siRNA are delivered to the perinuclear environment, leading to measurable though moderate target suppression. Limited efficacy seems to be related to intracellular trapping of siRNA. To study the role of intracellular trafficking of siRNA for <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> we studied whether a signal peptide for trans-membrane transport of bacterial protein toxins, which is covalently attached to siRNA, can promote its release from the perinuclear space into the cytoplasm and thereby enhance its <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> We show that attachment of the peptide TQIENLKEKG to lamin A/C-directed siRNA improves target inhibition after its PS-stimulated delivery. This is related to increased efflux of the siRNA–peptide conjugate from the ER-specific perinuclear sites. In summary, this study strongly suggests that intracellular release of siRNA leads to increased <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Thus covalent peptide–siRNA conjugates are proposed as new tools to study the relationship between intracellular transport and efficacy of siRNA...|$|R

40|$|Among {{various types}} of ion species, carbon ions are {{considered}} {{to have the most}} balanced, optimal properties in terms of possessing physically and biologically effective dose localiza-tion in the body. This {{is due to the fact}} that when compared with photon beams, carbon ion beams offer improved dose distribution, leading to the concentration of the sufficient dose within a target volume while minimizing the dose in the surrounding normal tissues. In addition, carbon ions, being heavier than protons, provide a higher <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the beam’s range. This is practically an ideal property from the standpoint of cancer radiotherapy. Clinical studies have been carried out in the world to confirm the efficacy of carbon ions against a variety of tumors as well as to develop effective techniques for delivering an efficient dose to the tumor. Through clinical experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences and Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung, a significant reduction in the overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities has been obtained in almost all types of tumors.

50|$|Since {{irradiation}} {{increases with}} {{proximity to the}} source of radiation, and as it is impossible to distance or shield an internal source, radioactive materials inside the body can deliver much higher doses to the host organs than they normally would from outside the body. This is particularly true for alpha and beta emitters that are easily shielded by skin and clothing. Some have hypothesized that alpha's high <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> might be attributable to cell's tendency to absorb transuranic metals into the cellular nucleus where they would be in very close proximity to the genome, though an elevated effectiveness can also be observed for external alpha radiation in cellular studies.
