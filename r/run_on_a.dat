5|$|From 1956 to 1979, the top open wheel racing {{series in}} North America was the USAC National Championship.

However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E

5|$|Tennis for Two is {{considered}} under some definitions {{to be the}} first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, {{with the exception of the}} non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.|$|E

5|$|Currently under {{construction}} are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate {{as part of}} the new urban rapid transit network (bus rapid transit). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking on the bus. The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground station at the University of Jordan. The second corridor connects Sport City with Downtown Amman at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, a bypass of {{downtown}} South Haven was built; the former route of US31 {{through the heart}} of the city was designated Bus. US31 at that time. After the war, the route of US31 north of Charlevoix was realigned to follow the shoreline; this section opened by the middle of 1949. The route of the highway between Holland and West Olive was changed to <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more angular course northwesterly in 1950. A few years later, a bypass to the south and east of Holland opened and the former route through down was redesignated as a business loop in 1954.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the season, Wensloff {{remained}} a major part of the starting rotation. His losses included a 10 defeat in which he only allowed one unearned <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wild throw against the St. Louis Browns. During the season, Wensloff added a knuckleball to his selection of pitches, which he threw regularly during the season. As the end of the season approached, Wensloff was being promoted as a rookie of the year candidate, due to being second on the team in strikeouts, as well as his 13 wins. Wensloff finished the season with a 13–11 record and a 2.54 ERA in 29 games, 27 of them starts. He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series, though he was on the roster.|$|E
5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> finite set {{of cells}} with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive {{states of the}} majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{started the}} season with 13 {{consecutive}} saves but blew his first save of the season on May 27 by giving up a three-run inside-the-park home <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> misplayed fly ball by teammate Delmon Young; however, Nathan got two outs to end the 9th inning and the Twins {{went on to win}} the game. By converting 27 of 29 save opportunities prior to the All-Star break, Nathan was selected as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Nathan finished the year with 39 saves and a career best 1.33 ERA. He also had a career high six blown saves and surrendered his first career walk-off home run to Victor Martinez on September 16. Nathan ranked seventh in the majors in saves and had the lowest ERA of the top 30 save leaders in 2008.|$|E

Brett Gardner replaced Cabrera in center field as a defensive substitution {{in the bottom of}} the sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third solo home run of the series {{in the bottom of the}} seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
