40|$|Abstract—Sparse signal {{recovery}} is often performed over an estimation grid whose choice affects the recovery performance. The grid mismatch effect is posed {{as a total}} least squares problem based on the errors in variables (EIV) model. An existing ap-proach to model the mismatch namely the interpolation approach is interpreted as an EIV model. The grid mismatch is solved by an alternating descent algorithm, which alternates between basis-pursuit (BP) and least squares (LS) {{as well as its}} extension wherein BP is solved by a Bayesian algorithm. These algorithms are compared with respect to the SNR and grid offset for the Nyquist and upsampled grids.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the error recovery mechanisms {{in the system}} handling the Grid-based workflow within the Service Level Agreement (SLA) context. It classifies the errors into two main categories. The first is the large-scale errors when one or several Grid sites are detached from the Grid system at a time. The second is the small-scale errors which may happen inside an RMS. For each type of error, the chapter introduces a recovery mechanism with the SLA context imposing the goal to the mechanisms. The authors {{believe that it is}} very useful to have an error recovery framework to avoid or eliminate the negative effects of the errors.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{potential}} use {{of health care}} {{as a metaphor for}} landscape-scale conservation. In human health-care provision, a range of care options is generally available to cover the various levels of treatment required and the degree of urgency of that treatment. The concept of triage is frequently used in emergency situations where many people may be injured and decisions have to be made on the relative urgency of treatment for different individuals versus the relative likelihood of the success of that treatment. Indeed, the need to decide on level and type of care extends throughout health-care provision, and the array of health-care options available can be displayed on a grid that considers relative level of need or threat and the probability of <b>recovery.</b> A similar <b>grid</b> can be constructed for landscape management, which considers level of threat and the probability of system persistence or <b>recovery.</b> The <b>grid</b> differentiates between a variety of scenarios ranging from the need for prompt management action to protect or restore important habitat through to preventative threat minimization. We suggest that the broad concept of triage goes beyond the simple allocation of patients, landscapes or species into urgent, not urgent, and terminal categories and, instead, offers a rational basis for considering allocation of appropriate levels of management to different situations. We also suggest that the practice of restoration has much to learn from health care, where decisions are made daily on the allocation of appropriate levels of care...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} wind power penetration into utility grids, system operators have instituted stringent standards for ride-through compliance of grid-connected wind turbines.

The analysis is extended to include the effects of generic series voltage compensation. A new control scheme is then described and analyzed, which allows relatively low-energy ratings in the series compensator, thereby significantly lowering the overall system cost.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability of}} wind {{power park modules}} to control their {{response}} to transmission network faults allows for specification of new control features directed at stabilising the power system response during and after disturbances. However, the ‘effectiveness’ of these features in situations where wind power park modules are connected to ‘weak’ systems needs further clarification. The objective of the paper is to study the response of wind power park modules in distribution systems to transmission network faults during reverse power flows. The focus lies on the ‘effectiveness’ of their fast voltage control. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the differences made by the pre-fault operating point, the wind power park module’s fault and post-fault control modes and their settings, and the load modelling. The results show that correct load modelling is very important, the post-fault transmission system voltage recovery is worsened during reverse power flows, and that reactive current injection significantly affects the post-fault voltage <b>recovery.</b> Certain <b>grid</b> connection requirements worsened voltage recovery or even caused instability for some control settings...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT [...] - There {{has been}} quite some {{research}} {{on the development of}} tools and techniques for grid systems, yet some important issues, e. g., grid service reliability and task scheduling in the grid, have not been sufficiently studied. This paper examines methods for providing fault-tolerant real-time communication in wide area networks and their related resources and works. An algorithm is introduced for selecting a recovery node which minimizes the requirements while maintaining negotiated traffic characteristics. The End-to-End Recovery source node gives the most efficient use of resources since the backup path is chosen overall possible paths between source and destination with no cycles.

The connection of a wind {{energy conversion system}} to the grid requires a robust phase locked loop (PLL) and continuous monitoring of the grid conditions such as overvoltage, undervoltage, overfrequency, underfrequency, and grid outages. This paper describes a flexible control operation to operate a small wind turbine in both stand-alone mode via planned islanding and grid connected mode as well.

Rats received a midthoracic contusion lesion of moderate severity and were randomly divided into 2 groups, with one group receiving staircase ascent training for up to 8 weeks and the other receiving no training.

The grid codes typically prescribe broad envelopes of transient voltage profiles for which generation must remain connected while supporting the <b>recovery</b> of the <b>grid</b> by injecting reactive power. Rigorously proving compliance via {{a finite number of}} deterministic simulation studies is cumbersome, if not impossible, due to the infinite number of conceivable events within the prescribed curves. ^ This dissertation sets forth a reachability analysis approach to tackle this problem. The advantage of the method is that it permits the study of systems with unknown-but-bounded uncertainties. In particular, the technique yields state-space sets that are guaranteed to contain all possible trajectories of a dynamic system that originate from a set of prescribed initial conditions and/or driven by unknown-but-bounded disturbances. The method is applied to study the voltage ride-through capability of two common converter-based wind turbine systems, which employ permanent magnet synchronous generators and doubly fed induction generators, respectively. ^ In addition, this dissertation contributes a novel reachability analysis framework for studying linear dynamic systems with uncertain initial conditions and inputs. The proposed method accepts uncertain inputs that are constant, arbitrary, or ramp limited. A distinctive characteristic of this method is that reachability analysis is conducted using the modal information of the system dynamics. The method is applied on a notional shipboard power system with uncertain pulsed loads. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} meet the low voltage ride-through {{requirement}} in a grid code, a wind power plant (WPP) has to stay connected to a grid, supporting the voltage <b>recovery</b> for a <b>grid</b> fault. To do this, a plant-level controller as well as a wind generator (WG) controller is essential. The dynamic response of a WPP should be analyzed in order to design a plant-level controller. The dynamic response of a WPP for a grid fault is the collective response of all WGs, which depends on the wind speed approaching the WG. Thus, the dynamic response of a WPP should be analyzed by taking the wake effect into consideration, because different wind speeds at WGs will result in different responses of the WPP. This paper analyzes the response of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) -based offshore WPP with a grid fault taking into account the wake effect. To obtain the approaching wind speed of a WG in a WPP, we considered the cumulative impact of multiple shadowing and the effect of the wind direction. The voltage, reactive power, and active power at the point of common coupling of a 100 MW DFIG-based offshore WPP were analyzed during and after a grid fault under various wind and fault conditions using an EMTP-RV simulator. The results clearly demonstrate that not considering the wake effect leads to significantly different results, particularly for the reactive power and active power, which could potentially lead to incorrect conclusions and / or control schemes for a WPP...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{significance}} of crowbar switching time, various switching schemes are proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In [5], switching-off before fault recovery is recommended to reduce the crowbar operation time and quickly restore {{the control of the}} RSC, but the risk of DC-link over voltage still exists. The switching scheme proposed in [6] activates the crowbar both at the occurrence and <b>recovery</b> of the <b>grid</b> fault respectively, and each time the crowbar operation is limited by a minimum current threshold to reduce the total operation time. The switching schemes proposed in [7, 8] enable multi-switching of the crowbar, and the activation and the deactivation of the crowbar are dependent on the rotor current [7] or the DC-link voltage [8]. The crowbar only operates for several times when the current or voltage exceeds the pre-set threshold to limit the total operation time. According to the codes of the power grid, if a grid fault is very severe, the time for the wind turbines maintaining their connection is relatively short. Hence some other schemes for short fault conditions, such as [9, 10, 11], suggest switching-off after the voltage recovery. Due to the relatively short crowbar activation time, these schemes can obtain preferable transient performance at the acceptable cost of reactive power consumption. Reference [9] reveals that the switching-off after the voltage recovery for 1 or 2 cycles could obtain ideal dynamic performance. And different switching schemes are compared in [10]. In order to further reduce reactive power consumption, the grid side converter (GSC), together with DC-link, can supply reactive power supply during the crowbar operation [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in the applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A set of sensor nodes is deployed in order to collectively survey an area of interest and/or perform specific surveillance tasks in some of the applications, such as battlefield reconnaissance. Due to the harsh deployment environments and limited energy supply, nodes may fail, which impacts the connectivity of the whole network. Since a single node failure (cut-vertex) will destroy the connectivity and divide the network into disjoint blocks, most of the existing studies focus on the problem of single node failure. However, the failure of multiple nodes would be a disaster to the whole network and must be repaired effectively. Only few studies are proposed to handle the problem of multiple cut-vertex failures, which is a special case of multiple node failures. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive solution to address the problems of node failure (single and multiple). Collaborative Single Node Failure Restoration algorithm (CSFR) is presented {{to solve the problem of}} single node failure only with cooperative communication, but CSFR-M, which is the extension of CSFR, handles the single node failure problem more effectively with node motion. Moreover, Collaborative Connectivity Restoration Algorithm (CCRA) is proposed on the basis of cooperative communication and node maneuverability to restore network connectivity after multiple nodes fail. CSFR-M and CCRA are reactive methods that initiate the connectivity restoration after detecting the node failure(s). In order to further minimize the energy dissipation, CCRA opts to simplify the <b>recovery</b> process by <b>gridding.</b> Moreover, the distance that an individual node needs to travel during recovery is reduced by choosing the nearest suitable candidates.

30|$|Other {{solutions}} {{such as the}} {{one from}} [87] use reliability-related methods such as checkpointing to decrease application failures, but in this particular case, for instance, the performance implications of having these mechanisms is not fully appreciated. The I/O cost in terms of storage and time to implement checkpointing are far from negligible. Still on reliability, [124] state that the main two strategies to calculate reliability factors is to either establish a reputation threshold or to treat nodes independently and multiply their probability of success. Still, the reliability approach proposed by the authors does not address measurable metrics to calculate these factors. Moreover, on one side there are the solutions only address failures after their occurrence, not before. For instance, [86] uses checkpointing to recover from failures but there is no mechanism in place to calculate the probability of failures and attempt to avoid nodes with higher probability of failure, or at least designate a smaller portion of tasks to this node. On the other side, solutions calculate reliability factors based on theoretical metrics that might not reflect the specificities of each node and there are no clear mechanism to combine prevention and recovery. In that sense, [49] provides a deeper analysis of fault-tolerance techniques for grid computing that could be applied to cloud computing. The authors clearly state that the requirements for implementing failure <b>recovery</b> mechanisms on <b>grids</b> comprise support for diverse failure handling strategies, separation of failure handling policies from application codes, and user-defined exception handling. In terms of task-level failure handling techniques the authors consider retrying (straightforward and potentially least efficient of the enlisted techniques), replication (replicas running on different resources), and checkpointing. Checkpointing is actively used in real scientific scenarios while replication usually leads to prohibitive costs, as in several cases running one replica is expensive enough in terms of resource demand. In addition, in terms of workflow-level failure handling, the authors propose mechanisms such as alternative task (try a different implementation when available), workflow-level redundancy, and user-defined exceptions that are able to fallback to reliable failure handling. In terms of evaluation the authors propose parameters such as failure-free execution time, failure rates, downtime, recovery time, checkpointing overhead, among others. These are measurable metrics {{that can be used to}} model and represent the failure behavior of systems and workflows.|$|R
40|$|Natural hazards {{can affect}} the {{electricity}} supply and result in power outages which can trigger accidents, bring economic activity {{to a halt and}} hinder emergency response until electricity supply is restored to critical services. This study analyzes the impact of earthquakes, space weather and floods on the power <b>grid</b> <b>recovery</b> time. For this purpose, forensic analysis of the performance of the power grid during 16 earthquakes, 15 space weather events and 20 floods was carried out. The study concluded that different natural hazards affect the power grid in different ways. Earthquakes cause inertial damage to heavy equipment and brittle items, and ground failure and soil liquefaction can be devastating to electric infrastructure assets. Recovery time is driven by the balance of repairs and capabilities. Poor access to damaged facilities, due to landslides or traffic congestion, can also delay repairs. In this study, recovery time ranged from a few hours to months, but more frequently from 1 to 4 days. Floods are commonly associated with power outages. Erosion due to the floodwaters and landslides triggered by floods undermine the foundations of transmission towers. Serious, and often explosive, damage may occur when electrified equipment comes in contact with water, while moisture and dirt intrusion require time-consuming repairs of inundated equipment. Recovery time was driven by the number of needed repairs, and site access, as repairs cannot start until floodwaters have receded. In this study, power was back online from 24 hours up to 3 weeks after the flood. However, longer recovery times (up to 5 weeks) were associated with floods spawned by hurricanes and storms. Space weather affects transmission and generation equipment through geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). In contrast to earthquakes and floods, GICs have the potential to impact the entire transmission network. Delayed effects and the potential for system-wide impact were the main drivers of recovery time in this study. When damage is limited to tripping of protective devices, restoration time is less than 24 hours. However, repairs of damaged equipment may take up to several months. The study concludes with a number of recommendations related to policy, hazard mitigation and emergency management to reduce the risks of natural hazards to electric infrastructure and to improve crisis management {{in the aftermath of a}} natural disaster.

40|$|Increasing {{demand of}} {{the oil and gas}} have given rise to surge in {{drilling}} and exploration activities to recover oil from other unexplored oil-bearing formations (such as offshore) {{as well as in the}} efforts to improve and/or modify the existing methods of the enhanced oil recovery to recover the residual oil left-behind by the applied EOR method. Nearly one-third volume of the original oil in place (OOIP) is left-behind by the current EOR technologies. Estimated 2 trillion barrels of this volume is lucrative to cater the energy needs of the respective countries. Gas injection EOR method is a major contending process in exploitation of this resource, and its application is on the rise since last decade. Continuous gas injection (CGI) and water-alternating gas (WAG) injection are the most notable and commonly field-implemented horizontal displacement type gas injection EOR processes. The limitations of CGI are the severe gravity segregation and poor sweep efficiencies. Although the reservoir sweep efficiencies are improved with the WAG, review of 59 field projects suggest that they yield only maximum of 10 % incremental oil recoveries due to the detrimental effects of increased water saturation to diminish gas injectivity, reducing oil mobility, decreased oil relative permeability and oil bypassing due to gravity segregation. Conversely, vertical downward oil-displacement gas driven gravity drainage EOR methods uses the gravity forces to its advantage for enhancing the oil recovery. Gravity drainage EOR methods have been applied to dipping and reef type reservoirs in the field projects and reported to yield high incremental oil recoveries. In this study, the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage EOR method is investigated in the non-dipping reservoir through the 3 D reservoir simulations and scaling and the sensitivity analysis. Both the compositional and pseudomiscible black-oil numerical reservoir simulations are conducted in the 50 and 35 °API gravity oil-reservoirs respectively. Main objectives of this research are to (i) develop a better production strategy for the oil recovery optimization (ii) investigate the options to optimize oil recovery in the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage EOR process (numerical simulation studies) (iii) to develop a set of scaled models sufficient to completely scale the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage EOR process through the scaling and sensitivity studies. Original contributions of this research are (i) First comprehensive demonstration of the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage EOR method application in 50 °API gravity oil-reservoir, (ii) Development and verification of a new hypothesis of the horizontal gas floodfront in the top-down CO₂-assisted gravity drainage EOR process, (iii) Development of a general process selection map for the preliminary choice between the immiscible and miscible process, (iv) Grid size effect studies: Changes in both the x and y grid-dimensions has no impact on the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage oil <b>recovery,</b> (v) <b>Grid</b> thickness effect studies: Thin layers, even in the upper layers, facilitates the optimum CO₂-assisted gravity drainage oil recovery (vi) Heterogeneity in permeability effect: Presence of heterogeneity in permeability (kv / kv = 0. 001) improves the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage oil recovery performance (95. 5 % incremental oil recovery) thereby reducing the number of pore volumes and the operational time. It has been found that recovery further improves when the molecular diffusion effects are taken into account, (vii) Heterogeneity in porosity: Porosity values increasing downwards, such as in the overturned faults, promotes the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage mechanism to yield better oil recovery performance, (viii) Clear identification of the overall mechanisms and the supporting micro-mechanisms through the parametric analysis of the reservoir simulation results, (ix) Development of a new correlation (combination number, NJadhawar and Sarma) that encompasses the traditional process affecting multiphase operational parameters in the form of the dimensionless groups. It is further validated using the field projects including the data from the Oseberg field, Norway. Excellent logarithmic correlation match is obtained between the new combination number, NJadhawar and Sarma, and the oil recoveries from both the immiscible and miscible reservoir simulations as well as the field projects. New combination number, NJadhawar and Sarma, is a useful tool to predict CO₂-assisted gravity drainage oil recoveries, and (x) Development of a set of the additional scaled models sufficient to completely scale the CO₂-assisted gravity drainage EOR process are proposed and validated.

40|$|Nickel {{metal hydride}} (NiMH) {{batteries}} are used today for applications that {{can assist in}} the adaptation toward carbon-neutral energy sources (i. e. hybrid vehicles and smart <b>grids).</b> <b>Recovery</b> of metals such as nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements (REEs) from discarded NiMH batteries is important for economic and/or technological reasons. Recirculation of valuable materials back into society {{can be achieved by}} the production of pure concentrates of elements from waste, or by regenerating and reusing materials. Recycling of NiMH batteries can be done through pyro- and hydrometallurgical methods, which produces pure and valuable metal fractions. The current work focuses on the separation of three different types of material from NiMH waste: (1) metallic nickel powder, (2) reusable hydrogen storage alloy (i. e. AB 5) and (3) cobalt-enriched surface compounds. Bipolar NiMH batteries were investigated in this work, which are different in design compared to previous investigations on recycling of batteries. In these batteries the conductive nickel network is made up of nickel powder, instead of conventional nickel foam grids. Previous investigations suggest that spent electrode materials are not completely degraded. Reusing parts of the discarded NiMH battery has however not yet been commercially realized. For the current work spent NiMH batteries were characterized separately. Corrosion products form on the anode particles during battery cycling, and in this work rare earth hydroxides (i. e. REE(OH) 3) were identified. The hydrogen storage alloy can potentially be reused if corrosion products are removed. In the current work it was re-confirmed that nickel, even in powder form, can be recovered by dissolution of the waste matrix using hydrochloric acid. Cyanex 923 was briefly considered for treating the leachate solution. The extraction of REEs and aluminum from the leachate was affected by the amount of acid present, which was attributed to preferential extraction of acid. Controlling the acid in the dissolution step is therefore important in order to further treat leachate solutions. The relatively novel recycling approach of recovering AB 5 alloy using carboxylic (malonic, maleic, acetic and citric) acid was considered. An interesting result was that REE(OH) 3 could be removed using acetic and citric acid, without dissolving much of the remaining spent AB 5 alloy. The practical uses were otherwise limited due to similar dissolution rates of the AB 5 alloy and other waste matrix. A novel recycling approach of using ascorbic acid was suggested and tested. Separation of the cobalt layers from the cathode hydroxide particles is possible because these cobalt layers have different oxidation states (higher than 2) compared to the waste matrix. The ascorbic acid treatment does not dissolve the anode material. Ascorbic acid can therefore potentially be used as a pre-step to chemically separate the anode material from the cathode material in a mixed electrode waste flow...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous {{generators}} {{have always}} been the dominant generation type in the grid. This fact affected both planning and operation of power systems. With the fast increase of wind power share in the grid in the last decade, the situation is changing. In some countries wind power represents already a consistent amount of the total generation. Wind turbines can be classified as non-synchronous generation and they behave differently than synchronous generation under many circumstances. Fault behavior is an important example. This thesis deals with the behavior of wind turbines during faults in the grid. The first part focuses on the fault currents delivered by wind turbines with Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG). The second part investigates the impact of faults below the transmission level on wind turbine grid fault ride-through and the voltage support that wind turbines can provide in weak grids during faults. A wide theoretical analysis of the fault current contribution of DFIG wind turbines with crowbar protection is carried out. A general analytical method for fault current calculation during symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in the grid is proposed. The analytical method can be used to find the maximum fault current and its AC or DC components without the need to actually perform detailed simulations, which is the method used today. DFIG wind turbines may also be protected using a chopper resistance on the DC-link. A method to model the DC-link with chopper as an equivalent resistance connected to the generator rotor during symmetrical grid faults is presented. This allows to calculate the short-circuit currents of a DFIG with chopper protection as an equivalent DFIG with crowbar protection. This is useful since fault current calculation methods for DFIG with crowbar are available in the literature. Moreover, power system simulation tools include standard models of DFIG wind turbines with crowbar protection, but often not with chopper protection. The use of an aggregate model to represent the fault current contribution of a wind farm has been analyzed through simulations. It has been found that the aggregate model is able to reproduce accurately the total fault current of the wind farm for symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults. The use of aggregate models simplifies simulation models and saves simulation time. The Swedish grid code requires wind turbines at all voltage levels to ride through faults at the transmission network. For faults at voltage levels below transmission level fault clearing times are often longer and this could impact on fault ride-through of wind turbines. Simulation of study cases with faults at sub-transmission level, performed using the standard Nordic 32 test system, show that wind turbines should still be able to ride through such faults. Only in case of high dynamic load scenarios and failure of the protection system, wind turbines could disconnect from the grid. Load modelling is important when carrying out this analysis. Faults on adjacent MV feeders seriously endanger grid fault ride-through (GFRT) of wind turbines. Finally, an investigation on the voltage support of wind turbines in weak networks during faults has been carried out. A simplified model of the power system of the Danish island of Bornholm {{has been used as a}} test system. It has been found that the minimum requirements for voltage support set by grid codes do not result in satisfactory voltage <b>recovery</b> in weak <b>grids</b> after fault clearing. However, if properly controlled, wind turbines are able to provide a voltage support comparable to that supplied by power plants with synchronous generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to widen the applicability of gas flooding to shallow oil reservoirs by reducing the pressure required for miscibility using gas enrichment and increasing sweep efficiency with foam. Task 1 examines the potential for improved oil recovery with enriched gases. Subtask 1. 1 examines the effect of dispersion processes on oil recovery and the extent of enrichment needed in the presence of dispersion. Subtask 1. 2 develops a fast, efficient method to predict the extent of enrichment needed for crude oils at a given pressure. Task 2 develops improved foam processes to increase sweep efficiency in gas flooding. Subtask 2. 1 comprises mechanistic experimental studies of foams with N{sup 2 } gas. Subtask 2. 2 conducts experiments with CO{sup 2 } foam. Subtask 2. 3 develops and applies a simulator for foam processes in field application. Regarding Task 1, several key results are described in this report relating to subtask 1. 1. In particular, we show how for slimtube experiments, oil recoveries do not increase significantly with enrichments greater than the MME. For field projects, however, the optimum enrichment required to maximize recovery on a pattern scale may be different from the MME. The optimum enrichment is likely the result of greater mixing in reservoirs than in slimtubes. In addition, 2 -D effects such as channeling, gravity tonguing, and crossflow can impact the enrichment selected. We also show the interplay between various mixing mechanisms, enrichment level, and numerical dispersion. The mixing mechanisms examined are mechanical dispersion, gravity crossflow, and viscous crossflow. UTCOMP is used to evaluate the effect of these mechanisms on <b>recovery</b> for different <b>grid</b> refinements, reservoir heterogeneities, injection boundary conditions, relative permeabilities, and numerical weighting methods including higher-order methods. For all simulations, the reservoir fluid used is a twelve-component oil displaced by gases enriched above the MME. The results for subtask 1. 1 show that for 1 -D enriched-gas floods, the recovery difference between displacements above the MME and those at or near the MME increases significantly with dispersion. The trend, however, is not monotonic and shows a maximum at a dispersivity (mixing level) of about 4 ft. The trend is independent of relative permeabilities and gas trapping for dispersivities less than about 4 ft. For 2 -D enriched gas floods with slug injection, the difference in recovery generally increases as dispersion and crossflow increase. The magnitude of the recovery differences is less than observed for the 1 -D displacements. Recovery differences for 2 -D models are highly dependent on relative permeabilities and gas trapping. For water alternating gas (WAG) injection, the differences in recovery increase slightly as dispersion decreases. That is, the recovery difference is significantly greater with WAG at low levels of dispersion than with slug injection. For the cases examined, the magnitude of recovery difference varies from about 1 to 8 percent of the original oil-in-place (OOIP). Regarding Task 2, three results are described in this report: (1) New experiments with N{sup 2 } foam examined the mobility of liquid injected following foam in alternating-slug (SAG) foam processes. These experiments were conducted in parallel with a simulation study of foam for acid diversion in well stimulation. The new experiments qualitatively confirm several of the trends predicted by simulation. (2) A literature study finds that the two steady-state foam-flow regimes seen {{with a wide variety of}} N{sup 2 } foams also appears in many studies of CO{sup 2 } foams, if the data are replotted in a format that makes these regimes clear. A new experimental study of dense CO{sup 2 } foam here failed to reproduce these trends, however; the reason remains under investigation. (3) A number of published foam models were examined in terms of the two foam-flow regimes and using fractional-flow theory. At least two of the foam models predict the two foam-flow regimes. Fractional-flow theory predicts that large-scale simulation using one of the models would lead to numerical artifacts, however...|$|R
