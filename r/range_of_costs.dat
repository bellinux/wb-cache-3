In toque monkeys subordinates are often displaced from feeding sites by dominant males.

A fully compliant DIR based system costs more than a simple recreational setup, meaning that moving through the phases of kit acquisition focused on DIR approval leads to having less personally owned equipment for much of the acquisition period. It has been argued that the lack of necessity to purchase a dive computer reduces DIR costs(Jablonski: [...] "Dive computers are expensive, and prevent divers with limited resources from purchasing truly useful equipment" [...] "), it has also been argued that the lack of a dive computer adds to the risk of diving for recreational divers.

40|$|Functional {{connectivity}} {{in human}} brain {{can be represented}} as a network using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Network representation of EEG time series can be an efficient vehicle to understand the underlying mechanisms of brain function. Brain functional networks whose nodes are brain regions and edges correspond to functional links between them are characterized by neurobiologically meaningful graph theory metrics. This study investigates {{the degree to which}} graph theory metrics are sex dependent. To this end, EEGs from 24 healthy female subjects and 21 healthy male subjects were recorded in eyes-closed resting state conditions. The connectivity matrices were extracted using correlation analysis and were further binarized to obtain binary functional networks. Global and local efficiency measures as graph theory metrics were computed for the extracted networks. We found that male brains have significantly greater global efficiency (i. e., global communicability of the network) across all frequency bands for a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> values in both hemispheres.

40|$|Elsevier use only: Received date here; revised date here; {{accepted}} date here Cost {{estimates for}} CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) systems typically focus on {{details of the}} CO 2 capture process and make simplistic assumptions about the <b>cost</b> per ton <b>of</b> CO 2 for the transport and storage components of the system. These ad hoc assumptions ignore the large variability in the storage cost from site-to-site caused by variation in storage reservoir characteristics. Moreover, the typical <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> storage that are widely applied in CCS cost estimates do not fully consider the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> site characterization and operational monitoring. To address this problem, we have recently developed an engineering-economic model for geological storage in deep saline formations. In this paper we briefly describe the newly-developed performance and cost models for CO 2 storage in deep saline formations, and use these models to develop a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> for CO 2 storage.

Using a case study of the Myponga catchment, South Australia, this paper presents results of a cost-effectiveness risk analysis of 13 catchment- and treatment-based water quality management alternatives for mitigating Cryptosporidium risk. A <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits including set-up and operating costs, farm business costs and benefits, and environmental service benefits are considered in comparing the net cost associated with each management alternative. Considering the broader <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits changes the relative cost-effectiveness of water quality management alternatives significantly. Combinations of catchment- and treatment-based management alternatives proved to be relatively more cost-effective at mitigating Cryptosporidium risk. Specifically, the combination of spatially targeted water course management upstream of the catchment with reservoir treatment by ultra-violet radiation provides a cost-effective Cryptosporidium risk mitigation strategy especially when the adoption of dung beetles and treatment by enhanced coagulation are included as complementary low cost alternatives. Considering the broader <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits enhances the potential to increase the cost-effectiveness of investment in Cryptosporidium risk mitigation as well as produce a range of significant secondary benefits for water quality, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
