5|$|The {{study of}} cuticle {{hydrocarbons}} {{has also been}} applied to the <b>reproductive</b> workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant Platythyrea punctata, the presence of CHCs in new <b>reproductive</b> workers triggered aggressive behavior {{from the rest of}} the colony, often between new and old <b>reproductive</b> workers. Specifically, the old <b>reproductive</b> workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the antennae of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.|$|E

50|$|Normally, {{only the}} king and queen termite reproduce; the other castes are all sterile. There are two classes of reproductives: primary <b>reproductives</b> and neonetic <b>reproductives.</b> The primary <b>reproductives</b> class is {{responsible}} for colony creation and is characterized by compound eyes, wing marks (spots where wings once were before shedding), and defined sclerotization. Neonetic <b>reproductives</b> can develop from within the colony usually when one of the primary <b>reproductives</b> has died, or can develop in addition to the queen. Neonetic <b>reproductives</b> can experience two different phenotypes one with wings and one without. If neonetics are winged they will fly away from the parental colony, pair up and form a new colony, however if they are wingless they will remain within the parental colony. The different developmental routes taken by these two morphs are usually dependent upon food availability in the colony, or varying levels of parasitism within the colony. The caste into which any particular nymph will develop begins to become apparent among the late instars; at this time, potential <b>reproductives</b> will begin to show an increase {{in the size of the}} gonadal region.|$|R
50|$|The {{resource}} allocation of F. truncorum ants {{to the formation}} of new <b>reproductives</b> was compared between monogynous and polygynous colonies by measuring the colony’s productivity and mating structure. Monogynous colonies with a high productivity would have excess resources, and they invested these excess resources in{{to the formation of}} more <b>reproductives.</b> Monogynous colonies typically had a higher ratio of sexuals per adult worker. When they had excess resources, polygynous colonies did not invest in the formation of more <b>reproductives,</b> indicating that the allocation of resources to the formation of <b>reproductives</b> is controlled by the workers.|$|R
40|$|Soldier caste is {{the oldest}} altruistic caste in termites, highly {{specialized}} for defensive tasks. Therefore, a number of adaptations in anatomy and behaviour {{can be observed in}} soldier, lacking in other termite castes. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the hypothesis that in disturbed groups the soldiers will prefer to stand by and defend the <b>reproductives,</b> the most valuable individuals. Therefore, I studied in two species of the genus Prorhinotermes (P. simplex and P. canalifrons) the ability of soldiers to discriminate neotenic <b>reproductives</b> and provide them with defence. In agreement with the initial hypothesis, the soldiers of both species prooved to be able of an instantaneous recognition of <b>reproductives</b> and remained close to them. In P. simplex, the neotenic female was the most attractive individual, while in P. canalifrons, neotenics of both sexes were equally attractive. The observed preference of <b>reproductives</b> appears to occur only with a certain age of the <b>reproductives</b> in incipient colonies, along with their sexual maturation. Caste specificity of cuticular lipids supports the presumption that the caste recognition is based on olphactoric cues in the cuticle of <b>reproductives...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{coexistence}} of multiple unrelated <b>reproductives</b> within social insect colonies decreases the relatedness among colony members and therefore challenges kin selection theory. This {{study investigated the}} colony genetic structure of a French introduced population of the American subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes by analyzing genotypes at eight microsatellite loci and at one mtDNA region. Results revealed that all colonies contained numerous related secondary <b>reproductives,</b> and that 31 % of colonies possessed more than two unrelated <b>reproductives.</b> The presence of several unrelated <b>reproductives</b> within colonies of this species is commonly assumed to result from colony fusion. Although such a high occurrence of colony fusion is the highest ever observed in a termite population, {{it is probable that}} the available methodology underestimated the detection of colony fusion in French populations. Overall, these results suggest that French colonies might differ strongly from the great majority of American colonies in their capacity to produce secondary <b>reproductives</b> as well as in their ability to merge. The nature and evolutionary origin of these population differences are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Termites {{are social}} insects with a caste system and {{individuals}} are either <b>reproductives,</b> workers, or soldiers. The <b>reproductives</b> have eyes, a brown chitinised exterior, {{and may have}} wings. Two of these <b>reproductives</b> are the queen and king, and these remain in the nest and produce and fertilise eggs. The workers and soldiers are blind, have soft unpigmented bodies and no wings, and normally remain under cover in dark, moist environments. The workers build the nest, create underground passages and mud-roofed runways, and go out to forage. They care for the young and feed the <b>reproductives</b> and the soldiers. The soldiers guard the colony, attacking intruders with their powerful jaws. The nest of C. frenchi is normally in the root crown of a living tree and is composed of mud and masticated wood pulp. It has a fragile outer layer and a softer interior mass of passages and chambers.|$|R

40|$|Social insect colonies are self-organized {{systems that}} respond {{to changes in}} {{environmental}} conditions by altering the relative proportions of certain castes or individuals engaged in specific tasks. While termites are known to regulate the ratio of morphologically specialized soldiers {{in response to the}} proportion of nestmate castes, soldier-differentiation process requires a relatively long time to be accomplished. Consequently, other plastic and flexible mechanisms are considered to be employed as one of the various defensive strategies in termites. In this study, the defensive behaviours of soldiers, pseudergates (workers) and <b>reproductives</b> of the damp-wood termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti were quantified. When individuals of the caste were exposed to an intruder, soldiers exhibited the most vigorous defensive behaviour, followed by pseudergates and then <b>reproductives.</b> While the aggression levels of soldiers and <b>reproductives</b> were independent of the accompanying castes, pseudergate aggression was more plastic and depended on the other castes present. When paired with <b>reproductives,</b> pseudergates exhibited high levels of aggression toward enemies. However, pseudergate aggression levels remained low when they were paired with soldiers, suggesting that pseudergates moderated their defensive behaviour depending on social context. Plasticity with respect to social behaviours may facilitate rapid and flexible responses required for colony defence...|$|R

During transition from 4 th to 5 th larval instar, the lobes acquire the typical structure of the follicle testes of insects. In primary <b>reproductives,</b> the testes are voluminous and all four regions with peculiar patterns of germ cells differentiation increase their size.

5|$|Proposed {{mechanisms}} for {{the recognition of}} worker-laid eggs or active <b>reproductive</b> workers include marker hydrocarbons {{on the surface of}} queen-laid eggs, cuticle hydrocarbons on <b>reproductive</b> workers, and recognition of nest-mates.

5|$|<b>Reproductive</b> mimicry {{occurs when}} {{the actions of the}} dupe {{directly}} aid in the mimic's reproduction.

5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} <b>reproductive</b> isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of <b>reproductive</b> isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that <b>reproductive</b> isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create <b>reproductive</b> isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the sibship of primary <b>reproductives</b> on mate {{mortality}} and the survivorship and growth of incipient colonies was studied in the dampwood termite Zootermopsis angusticollis. Males and females paired with nonsibling mates had higher mortality during the first 10 - 40 days after pairing, although male and female <b>reproductives</b> showed similar patterns of mortality after colony establishment. The source of mortality appeared to be fungal and/or bacterial pathogens. There were no overall differences {{in the number of}} eggs and larvae produced by sibling and nonsibling pairs, and no differences in colony size and biomass 4 years after colony establishment. We therefore could not identify any negative effect of inbreeding in the early phases of colony development. Our results suggest that the risk of exposure to pathogens and the ability of termites to locally adapt to disease could influence the genetic identity of primary <b>reproductives</b> and the extent of inbreeding in termite populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} the social organization of Reticulitermes flavipes, we studied three populations in undisturbed wooded areas of North Carolina- {{one in each}} of the Piedmont, the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Coastal Plain regions. We collected workers from natural wood debris, genotyped 20 workers per colony at eight microsatellite loci, and obtained mitochondrial DNA sequence data for individuals from each colony in the Piedmont population. We estimated the coefficient of relatedness (r) and F-statistics to infer basic features of social organization. Analysis of the genotypes within colonies showed that 32 (36 %) of the 90 colonies were simple (Mendelian) families, and estimates of r and F-statistics suggest that these Mendelian colonies are headed by single pairs of outbred <b>reproductives</b> in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont sites, while colonies in the Blue Ridge Mountains site showed some signs of inbreeding. With one excep-tion, the remaining 58 (64 %) colonies appeared to have been founded by single pairs of <b>reproductives</b> with some level of inbreeding developing subsequently, presumably through the production of neotenic repro-ductives. Values of r and F-statistics for these non-Mendelian colonies suggest that they contain only a few neotenic <b>reproductives</b> inbred for only a couple of generations.
