2500|$|The Crystal Falls Dam and Power Plant is {{a utility}} {{located on the}} Paint River off Powerplant Road. The section of the Paint River where the dam is now located was once a series of falls and rapids that gave Crystal Falls its name. [...] In 1891, the village of Crystal Falls {{constructed}} the Crystal Falls dam and power plant, effectively submerging the rapids. [...] In 1902-1903, a new power plant was constructed. [...] The plant was expanded in 1907, and new generators were installed in 1914 and 1924. [...] The plant was expanded several times, including a 1931 installation of a new concrete dam installed containing the <b>rollway</b> and tainter gates and a 1996 resurfacing of the spillway. The Crystal Falls Power Plant is still operational, and is likely the oldest hydro-electric plant still in operation in the Upper Peninsula. [...] It provides roughly 1/3 of the power demanded by the residents of Crystal Falls.|$|E

60|$|The day in {{the lumber}} camp was all too short {{for all of the}} boys, but {{especially}} for Sparrer, to whom the cutting of the great trees and the hauling of the logs and piling of them on the <b>rollways</b> {{on the banks of the}} river ready for breaking out on the high water of the spring was of absorbing interest. Hal and Upton were familiar with logging operations, having visited logging camps many times during their summers in the woods. The only novelty to them lay in the changed setting of the scenes produced by the snow.|$|R
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at <b>Rollways</b> Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Rollway</b> Bearing Company {{was founded}} in 1895 as Department of the Railway Roller Bearing Company.

500|$|The scenic byway {{starts at}} the {{intersection}} of M-65 and <b>Rollways</b> Road and runs eastward along M-65 near Loud Dam Pond. The road runs through the Huron National Forest [...] and along the Five Channels Dam Pond to a junction with River Road. There, the byway leaves M-65 to follow River Road eastward along the south bank of the Au Sable River. The road passes the Canoer's Memorial, the Kiwanis Monument and the Lumberman's Monument near Cooke Dam Pond. River Road runs away from the river, cutting across forest land near a bend in the Au Sable. Near the Old Orchard Park, the byway follows the southern shore of Foote Dam Pond. From here east, the roadway continues along the south bank of the river, across from Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport, as it runs into Oscoda. The eastern terminus of the byway is at a junction with US23 in town, a few blocks from Lake Huron. The segment of the byway that follows M-65 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), while River Road is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Iosco County Road Commission (ICRC).|$|R

50|$|The river {{starts at}} Ralph Bice Lake (formerly Butt Lake) in {{northern}} Algonquin Provincial Park in the geographic township of Butt in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. It flows south to Daisy Lake then east to Big Trout Lake. The river heads north out the lake over Big Trout Lake Dam, {{takes in the}} left tributary Tim River, flows over the Portal Rapids, Cedar Rapids, Snowshoe Rapids, Catfish Rapids, and Stacks Rapids to reach Cedar Lake, {{the location of the}} community of Brent, where it takes in the left tributary Nipissing River. The river exits the lake over a dam, heads through the Devil's Chute, reaches Radiant Lake, where it takes in the left tributary North River and right tributary Little Madawaska River, and passes through the Squirrel Rapids, Big Sawyer Rapids, Battery Rapids Cascade Rapids and White Horse Rapids, and takes in the right tributary Crow River. The river then continues through a series of rapids including the Devil's Cellar Rapids, passes the Algonquin Radio Observatory, and reaches Lake Travers. The Petawawa River enters a canyon and passes through numerous rapids including the Big Thompson Rapids, Little Thompson Rapids, Grillade Rapids, Crooked Chute, <b>Rollway</b> Rapids, The Natch, Schooner Rapids, Five Mile Rapids to arrive at Whitson Lake adjacent to the Petawawa Hills. It leaves Algonquin Provincial Park and enters the municipality of Laurentian Hills in Renfrew County, continues southeast past CFB Petawawa, passes through the Crooked Rapids, Race Horse Rapids, White Horse Rapids and Halfmile Rapids, and reaches Lac du Bois Dur, where it takes in the right tributary Barron River.
