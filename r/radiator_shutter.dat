2500|$|The {{engine oil}} tanks {{were in the}} engine nacelles. Each nacelle {{contained}} a [...] oil tank, including a [...] air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant <b>radiators</b> <b>shutters</b> in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators, which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters</b> directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Cooling System: The famous Rolls-Royce {{radiator}} with triangular {{top with}} vertical louvres, {{the angle of}} which can be adjusted to control engine cooling. To begin with, the <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters</b> were operated manually via a lever on the dash; after 1931 cars were fitted with automatic control via a thermostat. Engine driven centrifugal pump and belt-driven fan.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a version}} of CLA 180 with reduced fuel consumption. Cd value was reduced to 0.22 via low A-pillar {{shoulder}} with adapted A-pillar geometry, aerodynamically optimised exterior mirror housings and rear shape, optimised diffuser, optimised underbody and rear axle panelling, <b>radiator</b> <b>shutter,</b> aero wheel trims and serrated wheel spoilers {{on the front and}} rear wheel arches.|$|E
50|$|The grille {{became more}} massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became {{rectangular}} and {{were included in}} the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. The nose on the hood louvers were more rounded.Unlike other Cadillacs the fender treatment remained unchanged. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped pull handle. <b>Radiator</b> <b>shutter</b> control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.|$|E

50|$|The fiscal {{horsepower}} {{had been}} dropped to 13.9 from 14.9. To achieve this the engine capacity was trimmed by a reduction of 2.25mm in the bore so that bore and stroke became 61.25 x 102mm giving a cubic capacity of 1803cc. This reduced size six-cylinder engine had a four-bearing crankshaft an air-cleaner-heater and a fume-consumer head. Other standard features now included chrome finished automatic <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters,</b> a four-speed twin-top gearbox, Lockheed hydraulic brakes and a wide 52 inch track.|$|R
5000|$|Raymond Loewy heavily {{influenced}} {{the look of}} the unit, which emphasized sloping lines and accented such features as the <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters</b> and headlight mounting, as is found on CNJR #1501 and KCS #40. The cab-side window assembly incorporated [...] "half moon"-shaped inoperable panes which resulted in an overall oblong shape. The platform (underframe) was shared with F-M's [...] end cab road switcher, the FM H-20-44, as was the carbody to some extent. The platform and carbody was also utilized by the H-15-44's successor, the FM H-16-44.|$|R
25|$|Externally, the FA-1/FB-1 {{could be}} {{distinguished}} from the FA-2/FB-2 (FPA-2/FPB-2) by {{the position of the}} <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters</b> â€“ the FA-1/FB-1's shutters were {{at the far end of}} the carbody, whereas on the FA-2/FB-2 they were further forward, the design having been modified to allow the installation of a steam generator behind the radiator. The FPA-4/FPB-4 were visually different due to the additional radiator space that was positioned below the shutters. These Canadian variants were intended and used for high-speed passenger service, and remained in use into the 1990s on Via Rail Canada.|$|R
50|$|The grille {{became more}} massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became {{rectangular}} and {{were included in}} the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. Fenders were rounded and longer. Front fenders extended into the front doors. Rear fenders extended forward into the rear doors. The new fenders had heavy moldings along the sides. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped pull handle. <b>Radiator</b> <b>shutter</b> control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{army general}} staff was {{amazed by the}} flight {{characteristics}} of the plane, which surpassed the Hiens in all but maximum speed (degraded by a maximum of 29 km/h mph by the larger area of the radial engine's front cowling), and the model was ordered {{to be put in}} production as the Goshikisen (Go = five; shiki = type; sentoki = fighter) or Army Fighter Type 5. The company's name was Ki-100-1-Ko. All of the airframes were remanufactured from Ki-61-II Kai and Ki-61-III airframes; the integral engine mount/cowling side panel was cut off the fuselage and a tubular steel engine mount was bolted to the firewall/bulkhead. Many of the redundant fittings from the liquid-cooled engine, such as the ventral <b>radiator</b> <b>shutter</b> actuator, were still kept. The first 271 aircraft, or Ki-100-1-Ko, with the raised [...] "razorback" [...] rear fuselage were rolled out of the factory between March and June 1945. A further 118 Ki-100 I-Otsu were built with a cut-down rear fuselage and new rear-view canopy from May through to the end of July 1945. This version also featured a modified oil cooler under the engine in a more streamlined fairing.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were some}} options for this chassis {{introduced}} later in production to improve fuel consumption and vehicle heating. This included {{the replacement of}} the underfloor radiator and its constantly engine driven fan by a front-mounted radiator with [...] "Varivane" [...] wax capsule operated <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters</b> backed up with a thermostatically controlled electric fan. The provision of an [...] "exhaust-boiler" [...] was also available. This had a temperature controlled valve which could divert the exhaust gas from the exhaust pipe through a heat exchanger incorporated into the engine cooling system, thus allowing quicker heating up to engine operating temperature and assisting passenger comfort in colder weather when the engine was not providing enough waste heat in the normal way.|$|R
25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a 24 volt DC {{generator}} on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters,</b> supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|R
2500|$|Models popularly {{termed the}} PA-3/PB-3 {{were in fact}} only an upgrade of the PA-2/PB-2. The true PA-3/PB-3 model would have boasted , though none were ever built. Aside from the small power {{increase}} between the PA-1 and the PA-2, differences were minor. Externally PA-2s could be distinguished {{by the absence of}} the [...] "eyebrow" [...] trim piece on the grille behind the cab and the porthole window behind the <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters.</b> Internally, later PA-2 and PB-2 production featured a water-cooled turbocharger and other engine compartment changes, but these were frequently added to older models undergoing major repairs or overhauls. Four PA-1s were upgraded by Morrison-Knudsen in 1974-75 for passenger service on the Delaware & Hudson and became the PA4. These were eventually used by Amtrak for the [...] "Adirondack" [...] train and then by the Mass Bay Transit Authority before being sold to Mexico.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with many}} of their F - M contemporaries, the H-16-44s {{produced}} through 1954 (ATSF #3010 for example) featured numerous Raymond Loewy design touches, in this case largely manifested {{in the form of}} sloping body lines and a noticeable protrusion in the long hood around the <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters.</b> Cab side window units include inoperable [...] "half moon"-shaped panes, resulting in an oblong-shaped assembly. To reduce manufacturing costs, the curved window panes were eliminated from later models, and from 1953 onward the raised, elongated headlight mounting was omitted. Units built in the [...] "Spartanized" [...] fashion can be spotted by their straight ends, coupled with the lack of superfluous trim. Ventilation slots were added at the battery box to reduce the possibility of explosions. The final production phase, which commenced in March 1955, turned out units that most closely resembled the Fairbanks - Morse [...] "Train Master" [...] series.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{would be}} started on {{gasoline}} and the tractor {{would then be}} worked until the engine was sufficiently warm to change over. At that point, the fuel valve would be turned to switch the fuel supply from the gasoline tank to the fuel tank and the heavy fuel would flow to the carburetor. <b>Radiator</b> <b>shutters</b> or curtains were typically used to keep the engine sufficiently hot for efficient operation. Coolant temperatures in the 200 degree F range were normal. John Deere two-cylinder all-fuel tractors worked well on heavy fuel, as their long piston strokes, slow engine speeds and low compression ratios allowed for efficient operation. Most were also equipped with thermosiphon cooling systems that used no water pumps. Natural convection allowed the water to flow {{up and out of}} the engine block and into the top of the radiator, where it cooled and dropped and fell to continue the cycle.|$|R
5000|$|The 1931 Reo Royale was a trendsetting design, {{introducing}} design {{elements that}} were a precedent for true automotive streamlining in the American market. The 8-cylinder model was sold through 1933 with minor updates. The name was used on a lower-priced 6-cylinder mode through 1935. Beverly Kimes, editor of the Standard Catalog of American Cars, terms the Royale [...] "the most fabulous Reo of all". In addition to its coachwork by Murray designed by their Amos Northup, the Royale also provided buyers with a [...] straight-eight with a nine-bearing crankshaft, one-shot lubrication, and thermostatically-controlled <b>radiator</b> <b>shutters.</b> The Royale rode upon factory wheelbases of 131 in (Model 8-31) and 135 in (Model 8-35); a 1932 custom version rode upon a 152 in wheelbase (Model 8-52). As many as 3 Dietrich coachbuilt bodies were built on 148 in wheelbases in 1931. Beginning in 1933, the Royale also featured as an option REO's semi-automatic transmission, the Self-Shifter. The Model 8-31 was priced at $2,145. The model 8-35 was priced from $2,745 for the sedan to $3,000 for the convertible coupe. The coachbuilt cars were priced close to $6,000. A convertible victoria was listed at $3,195 but only one {{is known to have}} been built. The 8-35 & 8-52 are considered full CCCA classics.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was likewise {{a standard}} rectangular section wooden girder structure, fabric covered except around {{the engine and}} a wood upper decking around the open, tandem cockpits for pilot and for the observer, who sat under the wing trailing edge. It tapered to a knife-edge at the tail. At the front the [...] Mercedes water-cooled upright inline engine was enclosed in a rectangular cross-section metal cowling which tapered vertically, exposing the upper cylinders, to a two blade propeller.

The Schoettler had a conventional fixed undercarriage, with the mainwheels on a rigid axle mounted on V-struts.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1917, the Sopwith chief engineer, Herbert Smith, began {{designing}} a new fighter (internal Sopwith designation 5F.1) {{powered by the}} geared 200hp Hispano-Suiza 8B. The resulting Dolphin was a two-bay, single-seat biplane, with the upper wings attached to an open steel cabane frame above the cockpit. To maintain the correct centre of gravity, the lower wings were positioned [...] forward of the upper wings, creating the Dolphinâ€™s distinctive negative wing stagger. The pilot sat with his head through the frame, where he had an excellent view.

500|$|A final {{alteration}} was to fit {{a simpler}} <b>shutter</b> (<b>radiator</b> vent) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine. For McCudden this aspect was very important. At high altitude McCudden was to spend {{long periods of time}} in an extremely chilly environment. Operating the D.H.2 in 1916, he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to his muscles once he reached [...] McCudden reported few general side-effects from high flight. Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of anoxia. High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness. Aviation medicine was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves. Only the high-altitude bombers were equipped with oxygen equipment to assist with breathing. Despite his circulation difficulties, McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen.|$|R
