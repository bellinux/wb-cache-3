50|$|The console {{can either}} be {{connected}} to the Mix Rack, which contains all FOH I/O, DSP and stage I/O in one rack, or to the combination of an FOH rack and a Stage Rack. The FOH rack contains the DSP and a small amount of inputs and outputs, and the Stage Rack contains the main stage I/O. They are linked using a digital snake cable, with an option to use a redundant cable in parallel. There can be a maximum of two Stage <b>Racks</b> <b>linked</b> to one FOH rack.|$|R

40|$|Supplementary MaterialSupplementary Material Figure S 1. System for murine {{exposure}} to concentrated ambient PM 2. 5. Mice {{were exposed to}} concentrated ambient PM in a Versatile Aerosol Concentration and Enrichment System (VACES), which concentrates particles to levels � 10 fold higher {{than those in the}} ambient air. The system is comprised of a pump that draws ambient air (100 L/min) from the third floor of an alley in close proximity to several major roadways (Arrow 1 is just distal to the pump). A detailed map of the location can be found using the link below, the closest major roadway prohibits truck traffic. Particles are condensed from the ambient air and resuspended at a higher concentration using the principle of virtual impactors through a 2. 5 µm filter (Arrow 2) before being passed through two dessicators (5 L/min total) into identical murine chambers (food and water available ad libitum) 1, 2. Control animals are housed in an identical chamber where a teflon filter has been placed in the inlet to the chamber (Arrow 3). Particleconcentrations in the chambers are measured using a TSI 3775 particle counter (Arrow 4). Between exposures, mice are housed in microisolation cages in HEPA filtered ventilated <b>racks.</b> <b>Link</b> to map of laboratory location...|$|R

50|$|Collectors {{display and}} store their keychains in several {{different}} ways. Some collections are small enough that the collector can place all of their keychains on their standard key ring. Some larger collections can be stored and displayed on dowels, cork boards, tool <b>racks,</b> on large <b>link</b> chains, in display cases, hung on walls, displayed on Christmas trees. Some collections are large enough that entire rooms are dedicated to the keychain collection.|$|R

In 1912 Ferdinand Mülhens bought the property and the hotel was converted into a spa. Terraces to overlook the Rhine and a new access road were built in the 1930s, whilst the railway closed in 1958.|$|R

After closure and modernisation, the line reopened in 2008 as the rubber-tired Line M2 of the Lausanne Metro which included an extension to Épalinges in the north.|$|R
50|$|The Series 200 {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1987 and featured the VL2 and VL3 luminaires, controlled by the Artisan console, with power and data distributed to dumb repeater boxes by an ACS Rack. The repeaters gained three more outputs, making nine in total. Up to seven repeater boxes (63 luminaires) could be supplied by one ACS rack. Multiple ACS <b>racks</b> could be <b>linked</b> together, data-wise, with one acting as a master and the other as slaves.|$|R

40|$|We generalize {{the notion}} of a crossed module of groups to that of a crossed module of racks. We {{investigate}} the relation to categorified racks, namely strict 2 -racks, and trunk-like objects in the category of racks, generalizing the relation between crossed modules of groups and strict 2 -groups. Then we explore topological applications. We show that by applying the rack-space functor, a crossed module of racks gives rise to a covering. Our main result shows how the fundamental <b>racks</b> associated to <b>links</b> upstairs and downstairs in a covering fit together to form a crossed module of racks.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{design of a}} data center (DC) using free space optical (FSO) technology. The {{proposed}} FSO-DC design is based on fixed, non-mechanical, FSO links facilitating the realization of fully connected FSO racks and rows/columns of racks. Each rack becomes a point of intersection of three fully connected sub-networks. We investigate requirements, advantages and challenges of the proposed design. We develop and analyze a switch-free, fully connected FSO <b>rack,</b> present its <b>link</b> budget analysis and validate it by simulation. Results establish the feasibility of a switch-free FSO rack based on the proposed FSO-DC design. A cost estimate for the proposed FSO-DC design is also presented and compared to three well-known conventional DC designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{receptor}} for activated C-kinase (RACK 1) is a scaffold {{protein that}} {{is able to}} interact simultaneously with several signalling molecules. It binds to protein kinases and membrane-bound receptors in a regulated fashion. Interestingly, RACK 1 is also a constituent of the eukaryotic ribosome, and a recent cryo-electron microscopy study localized it to the head region of the 40 S subunit {{in the vicinity of}} the messenger RNA (mRNA) exit channel. RACK 1 recruits activated protein kinase C to the ribosome, which leads to the stimulation of translation through the phosphorylation of initiation factor 6 and, potentially, of mRNA-associated proteins. <b>RACK</b> 1 therefore <b>links</b> signal-transduction pathways directly to the ribosome, which allows translation to be regulated in response to cell stimuli. In addition, the fact that RACK 1 associates with membrane-bound receptors indicates that it promotes the docking of ribosomes at sites where local translation is required, such as focal adhesions...|$|R
40|$|The time {{transfer}} {{method of}} using passive listening and detection of SDH frame headers in fiber-optical networks {{has been presented}} earlier. Previous results, using commercialized equipment and commercial fiber-links, have shown that time transfer with a precision {{of the order of}} a few nanoseconds is possible over links with network distances exceeding 1100 km. The motivation of the work has been to develop an alternative and complementary time transfer method using existing infrastructure and to make it accessible to regular users of time keeping equipment. All previous reported experimental results were performed by SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden in commercial data communication networks in Sweden and Finland. This paper will report on the recent results from an experimental fiber test network implemented at the U. S. Naval Observatory. The fiber network is in a loop-back configuration with the two node elements in the same <b>rack.</b> The fiber <b>link</b> that connects the nodes is in an environmental chamber that allows a means to apply controlled fiber length fluctuations to the link. The performance of the Time Transfer Unit (TTU) was evaluated in this setting. This will be the first independent evaluation of the TTU equipment...|$|R
