Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E

5|$|Ettore Fieramosca had a {{relatively}} uneventful career; her first decade in service {{was confined to}} the normal peacetime <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> training with the Italian fleet. She thereafter {{spent most of her}} career abroad, including a deployment to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and tours in African and North American waters in the mid-1900s. She was stricken from the naval register in July 1909 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Upon her return, Minnesota was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet. She spent the following three years on the eastern coast of the United States conducting a peacetime <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> training cruises, apart from one voyage to the English Channel. Starting in 1912, the ship began to operate in the Caribbean, particularly after unrest began to break out in several countries in the region. For {{the first six months of}} 1912, she patrolled Cuban waters; she went to the US base at Guantanmo Bay to support the suppression of an insurrection on the island from 7 to 22 June. In mid 1913, she patrolled the eastern coast of Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. She returned in 1914, with stints there from 26 January to 7 August and 11 October to 19 December. During the first period, the United States occupied Veracruz to protect US interests. In 1915, Minnesota returned to the United States and resumed her previous <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> training exercises with occasional cruises to the Caribbean. In November 1916, she was placed in reserve as the flagship of the Reserve Force, Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, North Dakota was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet; she participated in the normal peacetime <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> training cruises, fleet maneuvers, and gunnery drills in the Atlantic and in the Caribbean Sea. On 2 November 1910, she crossed the Atlantic for the first time, on a good-will visit to Britain and France. Fleet maneuvers followed in the Caribbean the next spring. Midshipmen training cruises for cadets from the Naval Academy occupied North Dakotas time in the summers of 1912 and 1913. On 1 January 1913, she joined the honor escort for the British armored cruiser , which was carrying the remains of Whitelaw Reid, the United States Ambassador to Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the review, Rhode Island steamed to New York for an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. During the overhaul, on 8 March, the ship was assigned to the 3rd Division, 1st Squadron. After emerging from the dry dock, she resumed her normal peacetime <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} squadron, gunnery practice, and training cruises. In February 1910 she was sent on a cruise in the Caribbean. The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division, 1st Squadron on 20 October, and two weeks later she and the rest of the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to visit European ports; Rhode Island went to Gravesend. During the cruise, the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training. Rhode Island and the rest of the ships recrossed the Atlantic and stopped in Guantanamo Bay on 13 January 1911.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio both cruised in {{the eastern}} Mediterranean after the war, and both were {{involved}} in postwar disputes over control of various cities. Caio Duilio was sent to provide {{a show of force}} during a dispute over control of İzmir in April 1919 and Andrea Doria assisted in the suppression of Gabriele D'Annunzio's seizure of Fiume in November 1920. Caio Duilio cruised the Black Sea after the İzmir affair until she was replaced in 1920 by the battleship Giulio Cesare. Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio were present during the Corfu incident in 1923 as part of the naval demonstration protesting the murder of General Enrico Tellini and four other Italians. In January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon, Portugal, to represent Italy during the celebration marking the 400th anniversary of the death of explorer Vasco da Gama. The two ships performed the normal <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> peacetime cruises and goodwill visits throughout the 1920s and early 1930s; both were placed in reserve in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Black Prince {{was ordered}} on 6 October 1859 from Robert Napier and Sons in Govan, Glasgow {{for the price}} of £377,954. The ship was laid down on 12 October 1859 and {{launched}} 27 February 1861. Her completion was delayed by a drydock accident at Greenock while fitting out, which damaged her masts. She steamed to Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was commissioned in June 1862, but was not completed until 12 September 1862. Black Prince was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1866, then spent a year as flagship on the Irish coast. Overhauled and rearmed in 1867–68, she became guardship on the River Clyde. The <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> that duty was interrupted in 1869 when she and Warrior towed a large floating drydock from Madeira to Bermuda.|$|E

LAPACK, in contrast, was designed to effectively exploit the caches on modern cache-based architectures, and thus can run orders of magnitude faster than LINPACK on such machines, given a well-tuned BLAS implementation. LAPACK has also been extended to run on distributed-memory systems in later packages such as ScaLAPACK and PLAPACK.|$|R
5|$|Both Regina Margherita and Benedetto Brin {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} {{for the first few}} years of their careers, and participated in the peacetime <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> fleet training. Regina Margherita frequently served as the fleet flagship before the completion of the new s. On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the Italo-Turkish War. The two ships saw action during the war in the 3rd Division in the 2nd Squadron. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Germany's African colonies and in Asia and the Pacific. Their service lives were generally uneventful, apart from the normal <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> colonial policing. They were both sent to German East Africa to help put down the Abushiri Revolt in 188990, and Schwalbe joined the Eight Nation Alliance against the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. Both ships were decommissioned by 1911 and were thereafter used for secondary roles: Schwalbe as a training ship and Sperber as a target ship. After World War I, both vessels were sold and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E

With stand-to over, {{it was time for}} the men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> their court. It was {{no coincidence that the}} chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E

She arrived on 29 March 1912, and was made the flagship of the 1st Battleship Division (BatDiv). For the next two years, she participated in the normal <b>routine</b> <b>of</b> peacetime exercises with her division and squadron and with the entire Atlantic Fleet.
