[...] Marilyn was made into something not human in a way, and I can <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> Her sexuality was something everyone was obsessed with and that I can relate to. And there were certain things about her vulnerability that I'm curious about and attracted to.|$|E

500|$|Minogue thought {{people liked}} Charlene {{because she was}} portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that if she were in trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would probably get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Grenade" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Smeezingtons (Mars, Phillip Lawrence, Ari Levine) with additional songwriting by Brody Brown, Claude Kelly, and Andrew Wyatt. The song was recorded at Larrabee Recording Studios and Levcon Studios in Los Angeles, California. In {{an interview with}} Idolator, Mars revealed the song's conception and inspiration, {{saying that he was}} with his friend Benny Blanco and he was playing a couple of songs to Mars, including one which lyrics were similar to the ones in [...] "Grenade". Blanco added that the band to which the song belonged was not signed, and that the CD was not released. Mars replied [...] "I can <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> so much, I want to take that and make it my own". Mars confessed that the song was inspired by [...] "his love for a girl who did not love him back". He admitted to be [...] "a bit of a drama queen in that song" [...] and that the track was therapeutic to him. Afterwards, Blanco contact the dude, and Mars started writing his version.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

500|$|Loyalty to Loyaltys title {{comes from}} a paper {{of the same name}} by American philosopher Josiah Royce, in which he {{challenged}} Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas about [...] "will to power" [...] and the übermensch, [...] "saying that the ultimate pursuit of mankind should be to live in community and embrace each other, not to try to trample each other and rise to the top." [...] Maust said that he could <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> phrase with the band saying that it's [...] "very similar to how [...] conduct ourselves, the way that [...] write songs and the way that [...] view each other in the band. No one person is writing for the other person, but we are loyal to each other. We're loyal to loyalty." [...] For the recording process, Maust explained that they took four months to experiment with deeper and grittier sounds they were comfortable with, compared to the first record that took eight days to create that carried [...] "a much more polished, for-radio sound." [...] He also commented that the overall dark tone throughout the album was the cause of constant touring across Europe, but said that it did more good than harm for the band because it led to them crafting songs that weren't written from the perspective of being on the road.|$|E

[...] "Our sound {{is a little bit}} different from our old sound, [...] it's like something that we would have done but on another level. Like the new version of who we are [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Departed" [...] chronicle a woman's talks about mutual support with loved ones. Recorded with therapeutical background, Norwood has noted the fatal 2006 car accident, in which she was involved, as a reason for its inclusion on the album. [...] "To know that you have somebody by your side who is gonna always be there for you, that comforts you in a way and that kinda gives you an extra confidence about yourself," [...] she said, [...] "And that's what I love about it: It's first the message and than you get into the beat and the whole musical part of it. I think everyone's gonna be able to <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> [...] It's universal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Playing what [...] "sounded good" [...] {{violated}} the established ethos of modes that the Greeks had {{developed by the}} time of Plato: a complex system of relating certain emotional and spiritual characteristics to certain modes (scales). The names for the various modes derived from the names of Greek tribes and peoples, the temperament and emotions of which were said to be characterized by the unique sound of each mode. Thus, Dorian modes were [...] "harsh", Phrygian modes [...] "sensual", and so forth. In his Republic, Plato talks about the proper use of various modes, the Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, etc. It is difficult for the modern listener to <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> concept of ethos in music except by comparing our own perceptions that a minor scale is used for melancholy and a major scale for virtually everything else, from happy to heroic music. (Today, one might look at the system of scales known as ragas in India for a better comparison, a system that prescribes certain scales for the morning, others for the evening, and so on.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. It takes all the pressure out {{of being in a}} recording studio. We were able to take our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
