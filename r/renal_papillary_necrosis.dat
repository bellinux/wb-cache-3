40|$|Abstract. A 13 -year-old, spayed, female Australian Cattle Dog had {{at least}} a 10 -year history of {{numerous}} subcutaneous nodules for which fine-needle aspiration and cytologic evaluation were nondiagnostic. Abdominal ultrasound 3. 5 months before necropsy detected a small left kidney but no cysts or neoplasms. At gross necropsy, innumerable, firm, round to oval, white, 0. 25 to 2 cm masses were detected throughout the subcutaneous tissues of the axial and appendicular skeleton, epimysium of numerous muscles, and parietal peritoneum of the lateral abdominal body wall. The left kidney was approximately {{half the size of}} the right, and there was severe bilateral <b>renal</b> medullary (<b>papillary)</b> <b>necrosis.</b> Histologically, the subcutaneous nodules were well-demarcated masses of mature, hypocellular collagen that were consistent with previous reports of nodular dermatofibrosis and renal cystadenomas or cystadenocarcinomas. In addition to diffuse acute medullary necrosis, both kidneys were affected by severe chronic lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis. This is the first known report of nodular dermatofibrosis in a dog without renal cysts, cystadenoma, or cystadenocarcinoma.

25|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs are inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases. In the kidney, this {{inhibition}} results in decreased PGE2 concentration causing {{a reduction in}} blood flow. Because {{blood flow to the}} kidney first reaches the renal cortex (outside) and then the renal medulla (inside), the deeper structures of the kidney are most sensitive to decreased blood flow. Thus the innermost structures of the kidney, known as the renal papillae, are especially dependent on prostaglandin synthesis to maintain adequate blood flow. Inhibition of cyclooxygenases therefore rather selectively damages the renal papillae, increasing the risk of <b>renal</b> <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis.</b>|$|E

His spleen was swollen to twice the normal size and he had portal hypertension, all consistent with end-stage liver failure.

40|$|Background. To {{determine}} whether classic analgesic nephropathy with <b>renal</b> <b>papillary</b> and urothelial capillary sclerosis {{could still be}} detected at autopsy {{in the beginning of}} the 21 st century, the present study which is similar to a previous one performed in 1980 was undertaken as suggested by the Ad Hoc Committee of the International Study Group on Analgesics and Nephropathy. Methods. Consecutive autopsies of 616 adults performed at the Basle Institute of Pathology between November 2000 and February 2002 were analysed. Tissue samples of renal cortex and papilla of 1220 kidneys and of each ureter and main renal artery available were subjected to a very careful and meticulous study using classical histopathological methodology. Results. A number of lesions was found macroscopically but not a single case of <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> or analgesic nephropathy could be detected preceding histological analysis. Histologically, the most frequent lesions were vascular in 57. 8 % of kidneys followed by glomerular lesions in 13. 1 % (mostly diabetic glomerulosclerosis). Tubulo-interstitial lesions, mostly pyelonephritis were detected in 9. 3 % with only a single case of classic analgesic nephropathy with bilateral complete <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> and ureteral capillary sclerosis in a female who had received a renal transplant 14 years before her demise at the age of 67. In another five cases, complete <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was detected associated with pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis or in completely shrunken kidneys. However, in the absence of capillary sclerosis, a histopathological diagnosis of classic analgesic nephropathy could not be made in any of these five cases. Conclusions. The Basle autopsy prevalence of analgesic nephropathy decreased continuously from some 3 % in 1980 to 0. 2 % in 2000 as shown by the present study. Similarly, capillary sclerosis of the urinary tract, the initiating event in the pathophysiology of <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> and analgesic nephropathy and the histological hallmark of the effect of toxic metabolites of phenacetin in analgesic abusers decreased from 4 % of autopsy cases between 1978 and 1980 to the single case of the present study observed at the end of 2000. Thus, the classic analgesic nephropathy has disappeared some 20 years after the removal of phenacetin from the analgesic market despite the fact that mixed analgesics containing paracetamol, the main metabolite of phenacetin, have continued to be popular and widely used drug...|$|R

40|$|From about 1950, {{doctors in}} Switzerland were {{becoming}} {{aware that the}} pattern of renal disease was changing. In 1953, Spühler and Zollinger described 44 cases of chronic interstitial nephritis [1]. <b>Papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was observed in 22 cases, and {{it was noted that}} many of the patients had taken antibiotics and/or an analgesic containing phenacetin. Subsequently, it became clear that a pathologic entity of chronic interstitial nephritis with <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was associated with long-standing abuse of analgesics [2, 3]. Spühler and Zollinger's necropsy cases had bilateral contracted kidneys with surfaces presenting extensive areas of atrophy with some intervening nodular areas. Although the <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> was thought to be ischemic in origin. Gloor [4], as early as 1960, pointed to some special features of this lesion and suggested that papillary changes preceded the chronic interstitial nephritis. Reported from Switzerland were many cases, commonly linked with the consumption of a mixture of phenacetin, caffeine, isopropyl-antipyrine, and pyrithildion. It then became apparent that this form of kidney disease, which was associated with the phenacetin in the mixtures taken, was common in Scandinavia [5], where a popular mixture contained phenacetin, caffeine, and phenazone (antipyrine) [6], In 1957, Schourup made a clear distinction between the classical acute type of <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis,</b> seen with diabetes or obstruction and infection, and the new chronic and insidious form associated with analgesic abuse [7]. With the exception of Gloor, European pathologists tended to believe that the <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> resulted from compression of vasa recta in the outer medulla, as an expression of a cortical and outer medullary inflammatory process.
