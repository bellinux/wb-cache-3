25|$|Since the {{positive}} and negative electrodes (or simply positrode and negatrode, respectively) of symmetric supercapacitors consist of the same material, theoretically supercapacitors have no true polarity and catastrophic failure does not normally occur. However reverse-charging a supercapacitor lowers its capacity, so it is <b>recommended</b> <b>practice</b> to maintain the polarity resulting from the formation of the electrodes during production. Asymmetric supercapacitors are inherently polar.|$|E

An SAE committee {{is currently working}} to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of PHEVs. The Toronto Atmospheric Fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008, which was considered below the technology's potential.|$|E
25|$|Both SAAU and HFAU contain similar {{volumes of}} {{hydrocarbon}} with similar risks, but {{the risks associated}} with each acid are quite different. HF requires much stricter precautions because of its greater potential for harm (this is due to its lower boiling point and higher harmful potential). In light of this high risk, the American Petroleum Institute has issued a <b>Recommended</b> <b>Practice</b> specifically for HF alkylation units (API RP 751). This publication recommends that access to an HF alkylation unit be strictly limited due to the potential hazards of HF. No similar, specific safety document is required for sulfuric acid alkylation.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (adhan), although {{it is supposed to}} be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a <b>recommended</b> <b>practice</b> or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the four}} {{children}} deemed {{too young to}} require seats of their own ("lap children"), one died from smoke inhalation. The NTSB added a safety recommendation to the FAA on its [...] "List of Most Wanted Safety Improvements" [...] in May 1999 suggesting a requirement for children under 2 to be safely restrained, which was removed in November 2006. The accident sparked a campaign led by United Flight 232's senior flight attendant, Jan Brown Lohr, for all children to have seats on aircraft. [...] Though {{it is no longer}} on the [...] "most wanted" [...] list, aircraft restraints for children under 2 is still <b>recommended</b> <b>practice</b> by the NTSB and FAA, though it is not required by the FAA as of May 2016.

2500|$|It is now <b>recommended</b> <b>practice</b> for any new runway {{to have a}} {{clear area}} at least [...] long at each end, called a 'runway safety area', to allow {{additional}} space for an aircraft that overruns the runway to decelerate and stop in relative safety. [...] As Midway was constructed before these rules were put in place, it does not have this safety area. The accident renewed debates on the need for, and feasibility of, an engineered materials arrestor system, or EMAS, at Chicago Midway, given the lack of adequate overrun areas, and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Additionally, actions taken by the city to acquire land for a buffer zone around the airport (in apparent recognition of the hazard) came to light after the crash. In 2007, installation began on modified, short-length arrestor beds. The first one was completed at the end of Runway 31C by summer 2007. EMAS beds have also been installed at the end of 04R, 13C and 22L.|$|E

I have not leisure myself in general to answer letters of inquiry, however much I may desire to do so; but Mr. Ward has always the power of referring any question to me when he thinks it necessary.
