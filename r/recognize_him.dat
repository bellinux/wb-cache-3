5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy.

He sent letters to the Komnenoi, suggesting a division of authority over the imperial territory, with the Balkans remaining under Komnenian control and himself keeping Asia Minor, although he also emphasized that the Byzantine Empire should remain united. In reply, the Komnenoi offered to <b>recognize</b> <b>him</b> as Caesar – the second highest dignity after the imperial title itself – and {{to give him the}} governance of Thessalonica – the Empire's second-most important city – if he would submit to them. Melissenos initially refused to accept this offer, but as the Komnenoi {{were on the verge of}} taking Constantinople and might refuse to make similar concessions later, he eventually agreed.|$|E

5|$|After sending Meg out on {{an errand}} {{to pick up her}} grandfather, Lois {{continues}} to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since Peter had begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to the Jolly Farm studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to <b>recognize</b> <b>him,</b> he forgets that he is not dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona.

Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270.

5|$|During {{his absence}} in Baghdad {{in his final}} years from 920/921 on, Abdallah relegated {{authority}} over Mosul to Hasan. After Abdallah's death, however, al-Muqtadir {{took the opportunity to}} avenge himself upon the Hamdanids, and appointed an unrelated governor over Mosul, while Abdallah's domains were divided among his surviving brothers. Faced with the claims of his uncles, Hasan was left in charge of a small portion, on the left bank of the Tigris. In 930, after the caliph's governor died, Hasan managed to regain control over Mosul, but his uncles Nasr and Sa'id soon removed him from power and confined him to the western parts of the Diyar Rabi'a. In 934, Hasan again recovered Mosul, but Sa'id, residing in Baghdad and supported by the caliphal government, evicted him again. Hasan fled to Armenia, from where he orchestrated Sa'id's murder. Only then did his troops occupy Mosul and establish him permanently as its ruler. Finally, after defeating caliphal forces under the wazir Ibn Muqla and the Banu Habib, his rivals among the Taghlib, in late 935 the Caliph al-Radi was forced to formally <b>recognize</b> <b>him</b> as governor of Mosul and the entire Jazira, in exchange for an annual tribute of 70,000 gold dinars and supplies of flour for the two caliphal capitals of Baghdad and Samarra.|$|E
5|$|Following Galerius' {{recognition}} of Constantine as caesar, Constantine's portrait {{was brought to}} Rome, as was customary. Maxentius mocked the portrait's subject {{as the son of}} a harlot, and lamented his own powerlessness. Maxentius, envious of Constantine's authority, seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306AD. Galerius refused to <b>recognize</b> <b>him,</b> but failed to unseat him. Galerius sent Severus against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned. Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307AD. He offered to marry his daughter Fausta to Constantine, and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted, and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307AD. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius political recognition.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not <b>recognize</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
