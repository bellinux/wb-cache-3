50|$|The YD22DDT {{is used in}} the X-Trail, N16 Almera. It {{features}} the VP44 electronic <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> system and wastegated turbochargers. The VP44 pump models are easily spotted due to a flat acoustic cover over the engine.|$|E
50|$|A direct-injection turbo version (101 bhp) {{with four}} valves per cylinder, called the DiTD was {{introduced}} in the June 1998 Mazda 626 Wagon 2.0 DiTD. Engine has SOHC valve train with rocker arms and mechanically adjusted screws (no hydraulic valve lifters), with Denso V5 <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> pump and Denso PCM.|$|E
50|$|Some later {{versions}} of the 2.9 L capacity unit use a Bosch VE-style <b>rotary</b> distributor <b>injection</b> pump with electronic control and have a significantly different combustion chamber as they use direct injection.|$|R
50|$|The model {{description}} YD25DDTi technically {{refers to}} the YD25 engines which use the VP44 <b>rotary</b> electronic <b>injection</b> pump and run injection lines to each cylinder.This DDTi engine was last used in the Presage/Bassara and the D22 navara.|$|R
50|$|The H1 {{test cell}} is {{equipped}} with a multiple-strut, programmable <b>rotary</b> model <b>injection</b> system capable of positioning one to seven test models sequentially into the test free jet for preset dwell times. Transient calibration probes of various configurations are available to define heat flux and pressure conditions inside the test jet.|$|R
50|$|This engine {{features}} the VP44 <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> pump and is turbocharged and intercooled. In the Presage/Bassara it is fitted sideways with a variable vane turbocharger (garrett GT1749V) and torque {{is limited to}} approximately 280 Nm accommodate the 4 speed automatic gearbox attached.In the D22 Navara/Kingcab/Frontier the engine {{is essentially the same}} other than modifications to accessories, mounts and plumbing to accommodate the longitudinal engine layout. The turbo is a wastegated IHI RHF4 which is also intercooled. The stronger gearbox allows it to produce more torque than the Presage/Bassara version.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} Isuzu Elf {{appeared in}} July 1993, with more sculpted headlights. The 2.8 4JB1 and 4JB1T are standard on both Elf 150 10ft/14ft. and Elf 250 along with 3.6 4BE1. The non turbo 4JB1 features a new VE <b>Rotary</b> <b>injection</b> pump which increase power to 90ps and euro emission. In May 1995 it received a minor change, including upgraded, cleaner diesel engines.The H series 4.0-liter 4HE1 and 4.3-liter 4HF1. The 16ft. Chassis with H series engine are standard while the 14ft. Version {{are still in}} production. OEM deal with Nissan led to the Elf also being sold badged as a Nissan Atlas and a Nissan Diesel Condor 20/30/35 beginning at this time, followed by the Nissan Atlas Max from 1996 until 2000. The Atlas Max {{was based on the}} new, lighter duty Elf 100 (June 1995) which was available with a 2-liter petrol or a 2.5 or 2.7-liter diesel engine.|$|E
5000|$|Midway through {{model year}} 1998, the Dodge Ram {{switched}} from the 6BT to the ISB to meet updated emissions requirements. Like other ISB's, these engines started out using the Bosch VP44 <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> pump. The VP44 setup meant that timing and fuel could be precisely controlled, {{which led to}} cleaner emissions. However, VP44 failure rates were higher than the older P7100 injection pump. The compression ratio in these engines was 17.2:1. The 1998-2000 ISB was rated at [...] and [...] when equipped with the 47RE automatic transmission. The 1998 ISB was rated at [...] and [...] when equipped with the manual transmission. The 1999-2000 ISB was rated at [...] and [...] when equipped with a manual transmission. For the 2001-2002 model years, a standard output and a high output ISB Cummins engine were offered. The standard output, which {{was the same as}} the previous engines was rated to [...] and [...] when equipped with either a manual transmission or automatic. The high output ISB was rated at [...] and , with only a NV5600 six-speed manual transmission available. The high output engine was different in a few ways from the standard output engine; it had higher compression (17.1:1), powdered metal valve seat inserts, a larger flywheel, the Bosch fuel system was reworked to allow higher fuel flows, and fuel-injection timing was altered.|$|E
50|$|BL {{collaborated with}} Perkins Engines of Peterborough {{to develop the}} engine. Both {{naturally}} aspirated and turbocharged versions were produced, both using a Stanadyne <b>rotary</b> mechanical fuel <b>injection</b> system. Power outputs of around 100 (naturally aspirated) and 150 (turbocharged) horsepower were achieved.|$|R
50|$|Engine {{sizes were}} {{determined}} by IMSA officials, who had devised {{a set of rules}} to determine fair competition, using a displacement versus minimum weight formula. Turbochargers were taken into account as well as <b>rotary</b> power, fuel <b>injection,</b> and many other engine features.|$|R
5000|$|It has a diesel-powered, {{turbocharged}} {{internal combustion}} engine with a displacement of 1.5 L. Despite the small displacement it delivers 100 kilowatts (136 hp) with 250 NÂ·m of torque at 1900 rpm. The engine is of the common rail type, which is more efficient and quieter than the conventional <b>rotary</b> pump <b>injection</b> systems. It {{is equipped with a}} particulate matter filter. The engine is linked to a Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) with 7 gears, and is a mid-mount in front of the rear axle ...|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{because it}} is {{indirect}} injection, with a slower combustion burn time than direct injection, is suitable to run on SVO (pure vegetable oil). A feature of the Ricardo Comet pre-chamber design {{is that it makes}} the engine tolerant of low Cetane value fuels such as SVO. The viscosity of vegetable oil when cold is too great for <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> pumps, (in particular the weaker Lucas CAV pump, the Bosch VE fuel pump is superior), preventing it from acting as a lubricant and increasing the workload on the distributor/rotary injection pump and damaging it. The Lucas EPIC pump fitted to the 2.1 L 12 valve turbodiesel engine after 1995 is the weakest pump of all. Different fresh vegetable oils have different viscosities: thinnest are; sunflower, rapeseed (often only labelled vegetable oil, but with pictures of distinctive yellow flowers), then soya and corn oil, but palm oil (may be only marked vegetable oil) is thickest and may be solid at room temperature. Vegetable oils thicken when used for cooking, so used oils can be much thicker than any fresh oil, they may even solidify at room temperature. It is necessary for used oil to be very well filtered (ideally cold filtered to 1 micron), to avoid filter plugging and/or injection pump damage. Heavily used oil may be highly acidic and corrode the inside of the injection pump. Such oil can only be used as fuel without the risk of damage, if it has been chemically processed into bio-diesel. The open market price for used oil is often quite close to special offer supermarket prices for new oil, which can be used straight away. In order to reduce the viscosity of the SVO, it should be heated to engine coolant operating temperature, typically with a two tank system, in order to start and shutdown on diesel or bio-diesel. Versions of this engine from the early '90s onward, are typically fitted with a Peugeot-type coolant heated fuel filter that helps heat fuel and reduce viscosity. Fuel / engine coolant heat exchangers, usually required for straight vegetable oil conversions, are still needed for long term life expectancy, or there will be accelerated wear of the fuel injection pump. Heated vegetable oil is a good injection pump lubricant. This is especially important in cold weather ambient temperatures. Mixing with major oil company brand diesel, (which in winter is thinner and contains anti-waxing winterising agents) to thin the vegetable oil fuel, choosing a thin vegetable oil, winterising additive, or electric heating, or a combination of these are helpful especially when starting and warming up, as coolant heating will not yet be at operating temperature. The difference between the use of good quality fuel and supermarket diesel, in a diesel / vegetable oil fuel mix, will be very noticeable, especially at lower temperatures. The fuel systems used on this engine return heated fuel to the fuel tank. Running with half a tank of fuel instead of fully filling up, will allow the tank to be heated more effectively by this warmed fuel in low ambient temperatures. Due to different calorific values some oils will give less mpg and some more.|$|E
40|$|Two gas {{dilution}} methods were evaluated {{for use in}} the calibration of analytical instruments used in air pollution studies. A dual isotope fluorescence carbon monoxide analyzer was used as the transfer standard. The methods are not new but some modifications are described. The <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> gas dilution method was found to be more accurate than the closed loop method. Results by the two methods differed by 5 percent. This could not be accounted for by the random errors in the measurements. The methods avoid the problems associated with pressurized cylinders. Both methods have merit and have found a place in instrument calibration work...|$|E

The matrix exchange is made {{without the need}} for additional <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> valves or peristaltic pumps, keeping the original mechanical components of the sequential injection apparatus: one syringe pump (or peristaltic pump) and one selection valve. The system was tested constructing analytical curves for sulfide exploring the formation of the methylene blue dye. The proposed method has a detection limit of 60 Âµg L- 1 S 2 -, with a linear dynamic range between 0. 10 and 4. 0 mg L- 1 S 2 - concentrations, with a sampling frequency of 20 h- 1...|$|E

US-market B2200 and Ford Ranger trucks - {{and possibly the}} others as well - had <b>rotary</b> Bosch VE-style <b>injection</b> pumps, built by Diesel Kiki under license from Bosch.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz OM604 is a 2.0 and 2.2 litre {{inline-four}} cylinder (R4/I4) double {{overhead camshaft}} (DOHC) diesel engine with indirect injection manufactured by Mercedes-Benz between 1993 and 1998. It replaced the single overhead camshaft (SOHC) OM601 engine.Unlike other Mercedes Benz diesels {{at the time that}} used a Bosch inline injection pump the OM604 used the Lucas electronically controlled <b>rotary</b> distributor <b>injection</b> pump (EVE) which is less reliable.The seals of the Lucas injection pumps become brittle over time and leak. Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced.|$|R
50|$|A tuned intake {{manifold}} {{was used in}} a Wankel engine {{for the first time}} with the 13B-RESI. RESI = <b>Rotary</b> Engine Super <b>Injection.</b> The so-called Dynamic Effect Intake featured a two-level intake box which derived a supercharger-like effect from the Helmholtz resonance of the opening and closing intake ports. The RESI engine also featured Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection. Output was much improved at 135 hp (101 kW) and 180 NÂ·m (133 lbÂ·ft).|$|R

40|$|A {{proof of}} concept study {{involving}} the online coupling of automatic dispersive liquidâliquid microextraction (DLLME) to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) with direct introduction {{and analysis of the}} organic extract is herein reported for the first time. The flow-based analyzer features a lab-in-syringe (LIS) setup with an integrated stirring system, a Meinhard nebulizer in combination with a heated single-pass spray chamber, and a <b>rotary</b> <b>injection</b> valve, used as an online interface between the microextraction system and the detection instrument. Air-segmented flow was used for delivery of a fraction of the nonwater miscible extraction phase, 12 Î¼L of xylene, to the nebulizer. All sample preparative steps including magnetic stirring assisted DLLME were carried out inside the syringe void volume as a size-adaptable yet sealed mixing and extraction chamber. Determination of trace level concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, and silver as model analytes has been demonstrated by microextraction as diethyldithiophosphate (DDTP) complexes. The automatic LIS-DLLME method features quantitative metal extraction, even in troublesome sample matrixes, such as seawater, salt, and fruit juices, with relative recoveries within the range of 94 â 103 %, 93 â 100 %, and 92 â 99 %, respectively. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences at the 0. 05 significance level were found between concentration values experimentally obtained and the certified values of two serum standard reference materials.

50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne <b>Rotary</b> Distributor <b>Injection</b> pump at low pressure. The distributor injection pump controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of injection pumps in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series injection pump can be found on some 6.5L marine engines.|$|R
50|$|Technologies that {{developed}} during the post-war era, such as disc brakes, overhead-cam engines and radial tires, had become cheap enough {{to be used in}} economy cars at this time (radials began to be adopted in the 1950s and 1960s, and front disc brakes in the 1960s, towards the bottom of the market in Europe). This led to cars such as the 1974 Mk 1 Volkswagen Golf designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, Fiat 128 and 1972 Honda Civic. Some previously exotic technology, electronic fuel injection, became affordable, which allowed the production of high-performance hot hatch sport compacts like the 1976 Volkswagen Golf GTI. This car combined economy of use and a practical hatchback body, with the performance and driving fun that kicked off the hot hatchback boom. Also introduced in 1976, was the 1.5 L VW Golf dieselâthe first small diesel hatchback. It used new Bosch <b>rotary</b> mechanical diesel <b>injection</b> pump technology. Also in that year, Ford of Europe (produced by the merging of Ford national operations in Europe) launched their first front-wheel-drive small car, the Ford Fiesta, having gained experience from the Ford of Germany 1960s European midsized Ford Taunus P4 and Ford of Brazil Ford Corcel.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this computational study is to investigate the optimum injection and spark parameters for the direct injection spark ignition (DISI) Wankel rotary engine using diesel fuel. Currently only port fuel injected gasoline rotary engines {{are available in the}} automotive industry. Compared to reciprocating type engines rotary engine is mechanically simple, less vibrate, have higher power to weight ratio and achieve better performance at high rpm. Due to the inherent low fuel efficiency of rotary engine and increasing gas prices, application of the rotary engine in conventional automobiles is decreasing. This project seeks to introduce DISI technology to the rotary engine thus increase the fuel efficiency allowing it to be another efficient power source option for aero and automotive applications. DISI technology is the latest trend in the automobile manufacturing. This technology helped to combine benefits of both compression ignition (CI) and spark ignition (SI) engines into a single efficient internal combustion process. Multi-fuel capabilities, reduced operating pressures, and reduced compression ratios make this technology applicable for rotary engines. In this study diesel fuel, as opposed to gasoline, is introduced into the rotary engine using DISI technology. Due to high technological advancements used in DISI engines, it is expensive to experimentally incorporate this technology to a new engine. Accurately designed computational analyses can reduce both time and cost by cutting extra experimental test trials. For this computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study ANSYS FLUENT commercial software was used to integrate the DISI technology into a rotary engine model which was designed in Solidworks and meshed in GAMBIT. When creating the engine model, many parameters have to be considered. Engine geometry, injectors, and spark plugs were identified as the most important components needed to be investigated when integrating DISI technology into the rotary engine. By using a readily available rotary engine, direct injector, and spark plug, the number of parameters for the optimization process were reduced. The most important parameters were picked to evaluate the optimum single injection and spark locations. Full factorial experimental design was used to estimate the sensitivity of different combinations of parameters. This was followed by a statistical sensitivity study using JMP 800 commercial software to determine the most and least sensitive parameters to analyze for the optimum setup of single <b>injection</b> <b>rotary</b> engine combustion. Contour plots of fuel consumption, CO 2 generated, equivalence ratio, average temperatures, and pressures were used to support the results. The feasibility of multiple injections was also studied by means of their power outputs and fuel efficiencies. Optimum locations, amounts of fuel, number of orifices and orientations of orifices were included when evaluating optimum lead (second) injector. Similar studies were carried out to check the applicability of a third injector. From the results it can be observed that a dual injection setup provided optimum performance from the DISI rotary engine...|$|R
