5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation.

Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had <b>recorded</b> <b>surface</b> winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore.

50|$|On its inception, Tomas {{turned toward}} the {{northwest}} and decelerated within a region of low wind shear and high tropical moisture - two of the prime prerequisites of rapid intensification. A misalignment between the cyclone's low- and upper-level circulations impeded this strengthening potential, however, {{and at that time}} the NHC did not expect Tomas to attain hurricane status until 36 to 48 hours later. Steered along high pressure to its north, the storm retraced slightly west-northwestward on its approach to the Windward Islands. Despite the prior forecasts of moderated strengthening, Tomas' winds sharply increased to 60 mph (95 km/h) by late October 29; moreover, the outflow aloft became well established in all quadrants as the convection consolidated into a prominent rain band. The center of the intensifying storm crossed southern Barbados the next morning, around 09:00 UTC.

40|$|An {{expression}} for the output voltage for periodic saturation pulse recording is derived via the Reciprocity Principle {{and is based}} on superposition of isolated magnetisation transitions described by the function arctan (x/a) where a is a transition length parameter; this function having been found, for thin <b>recording</b> <b>surfaces,</b> to be close to the actual recorded distributions as determined both analytically and computationally for <b>recording</b> <b>surfaces</b> having a variety of hysteresis characteristics. The same function is used to describe the transition in thicker <b>recording</b> <b>surfaces</b> and provision is made for finding the replay signal from magnetisation components both parallel and perpendicular to the <b>recording</b> <b>surface.</b> Values for the transition parameter are obtained from measurements on the spectrum of a periodic waveform since the usual methods for measuring this quantity - from the width of the replayed isolated pulse - are not valid for the thicker <b>recording</b> <b>surfaces</b> used here. Attempts to compare the performance of the theoretical model with actual measured waveforms for a finite train of transitions are hampered by a lack of knowledge of the actual depth of recording (or any independent means of assessing this quantity) and of the magnitude of y-components of magnetisation and by an increasing spread in calculated values of the transition parameter from the spectrum of the isolated pulse, particularly for higher recording currents and for tapes whose recorded magnetisation levels change {{as a result of the}} replay process. Using averaged values for the transition width parameter, unknown quantities are inferred by comparison of computed and measured waveforms and, although this process can give only approximate results, qualitative conclusions can be drawn about the effect of y-components of magnetisation on the output wavetrain. By Fourier analysis, the model derived in this study for pulse recording is related to more general analyses for sinusoidal recording and from this, reasons for the spread in calculated values for the transition parameter are suggested. The Fourier expansion of the output voltage is used to try to elucidate the mechanism of high density recording, the reasons why output voltages may differ from those given by superposition and the way in which record current and y-components of magnetisation can affect the validity of superposition. The possibility of shaping the overall frequency response curve for a particular head-tape combination using y-components of magnetisation and of doubling output voltages at the cost of some distortion of the replay voltage waveforms is worth further investigation. These are opportunities not afforded by thinner <b>recording</b> <b>surfaces.</b> (author) SIGLEAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC:DX 212128 / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
