5|$|In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held {{just before}} the armistice, Republicans {{narrowly}} {{took control of the}} Senate. Harding was appointed to the Senate Foreign <b>Relations</b> <b>Committee.</b> Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, confident that he could force what became the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate by appealing to the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round-robin letter opposing the League. When Wilson invited the Foreign <b>Relations</b> <b>Committee</b> to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated President in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.|$|E

5|$|The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, {{presented}} to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly {{defeated by the}} Senate and the claims remained unresolved.

In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign <b>Relations</b> <b>Committee,</b> and the door was open for renewed negotiations with Britain.|$|E

5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward.

In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human <b>Relations</b> <b>Committee.</b> In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news.
