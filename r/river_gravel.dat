25|$|The {{building}} lies on a gently sloping <b>river</b> <b>gravel</b> terrace, {{a common}} {{feature of the}} Thames Valley. The land immediately to the east was further eroded by the River Brent, which flows along its eastern perimeter. At its southern boundary is the Grand Union Canal and a flight of six locks. Both the southern wall of the old asylum and the flight of locks have been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the evidence for Lower and Middle Palaeolithic occupation in East Anglia survives as redeposited flakes and tools recovered from <b>river</b> <b>gravel</b> deposits. These river gravels were laid by the ancestral Thames and Bytham River systems. Large quantities of artefacts were identified from gravel quarries during the 19th and early 20th century due to the increased demand for gravel {{in the construction industry}} and the hand sorting of this gravel.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} parts of Odisha, in the Puri District, <b>river</b> <b>gravels</b> and slits may be {{included}} among the various Pleistocene formations. But no formation of this period has so far yielded any type of pre-historic stone tool though they are found in a large number from similar formations (<b>river</b> <b>gravels,</b> secondary laterite pits and murrams) in the districts of Dhenkanal, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Sundargarh. So whatever information we have regarding the pre-historic cultures of this districts are mainly derived from different types of stone tools collected from the surface.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} June 2010, six appeals of the {{decision}} had been lodged with the Environment Court. Central Plains Water Trust lodged one of the appeals as applicant in order to change some consent conditions which limit the taking of water to 12 hours a day. Christchurch City Council's appeal was because it considered to much water would be taken from the Waimakariri River which may affect Christchurch's water supply. Fish and Game's appeal was motivated by concern over the Waimakariri River take and 'inadequate' fish screening conditions. Ngāi Tahus appeal concerned the Waimakariri River take and {{the legality of the}} change in scope of the consents granted from what had been applied for. Other appellants were a member of the Deans family and some extractors of <b>river</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mining {{activity}} was initially {{concentrated in the}} eastern (upper) valleys of the Trinity River around Weaverville, as the hostile Native Americans and treacherous gorges around Burnt Ranch precluded the transport of rations and equipment to places further west. For about two decades the area was extremely productive, {{second only to the}} Sierra Nevada (the Mother Lode) itself. The rate at which gold was extracted, and new methods pioneered to access the harder to reach deposits, was feverish. Author James Hilton remarked that Weaverville was a [...] "Shangri-La, that strange and wonderful somewhere which is not a place but a state of mind." [...] The area was soon profiting $1.5 million a year, with hundreds of claims along the Trinity River equipped with flumes, waterwheels and other apparatus to separate fine gold from <b>river</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the 12th century, {{the castle}} {{would have been}} defended on its south side by a steep slope and the marshy ground running along the river. It was {{designed}} as an oval ringwork, which today is around [...] by [...] across and [...] high, protected by a ditch [...] wide and [...] deep. The Roman fort in this corner was only visible as earthworks in the 12th century, and the builders used part of these {{in the construction of}} the ringwork. The ringwork was made up of a core of <b>river</b> <b>gravel</b> and coarse sand, with finer sand and clay forming the surface layer. The ringwork had a protective wicker fence around the top of the earthworks and possibly some form of early stone or wooden tower, with a gateway just to the north side of it. It is unclear what kind of buildings were constructed inside the ringwork, although a kitchen was certainly built on the east side of the enclosure.|$|E

500|$|Thirty Mile Drome, {{also known}} as Rorona, and renamed Rogers Drome on 10 November after Major Floyd (Buck) Rogers, the {{commander}} of the 8th Bombardment Squadron, whose [...] A-24 Banshee dive bomber was shot down over Gona on 29 July. The site on Galley Reach, an inlet [...] north west of Port Moresby was accessible by water transport through a channel through the coral reef. A dry weather airstrip was constructed by Company E, 43rd Engineer General Service Regiment, with help from large numbers of Papuan labourers who loaded the <b>river</b> <b>gravel</b> into trucks. This was ready for use on 20 July, but to make it into an airbase required the construction of two docks on Galley Reach. In September, work was halted by the tactical situation, with Japanese patrols reported not far from Rorona. Air warning equipment was removed, and Marston Mat earmarked for Thirty Mile was allocated to other projects. By the end of November, the runway had been extended to , with [...] sections at each end topped with Marston Mat. Work continued on all the other airfields in 1943, but Rogers was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|The Walla Walla AVA was {{established}} in 1984 with its boundaries amended in 2001. Mostly contained within Washington, a portion of this appellation does extend south into Oregon. Of the region's , nearly [...] were planted as of 2008. Along with its wine, Walla Walla {{is known for its}} sweet onions, which is a local food and wine pairing favorite, especially the Merlot grown within the appellation. The region is generally wetter {{than the rest of the}} Columbia Valley, receiving more than 20inches (50 centimeter) of rain on average each year. The area between the town of Walla Walla east to the Blue Mountains is the wettest with each mile from the city eastward to the mountains seeing an addition inch of average rainfall. The Walla Walla AVA contains at least four distinct soil profiles scattered across the valley-slackwater terrace, loess, <b>river</b> <b>gravel</b> and flood plain silt. The majority of Walla Walla's vineyards are located on a combination of slackwater terrace and loess. The silt and volcanic ash that make up the region's loess soils contain remnants from the eruption of Mount Mazama (which also formed the Crater Lake nearly [...] away in Oregon).|$|E
2500|$|Leaving Company A {{behind to}} secure the MACV Compound, the Marine {{battalion}} commander took Company G, reinforced by the three M-48 tanks from the 3rd Tank Battalion and a few ARVN light M-24 tanks from the 7th Armored Squadron, and attempted to cross the Trường Tiền Bridge, the main bridge over the Perfume <b>River.</b> <b>Gravel</b> left the armor behind on the southern bank to provide direct fire support. As he remembered, the American M-48s were too heavy for the bridge and the ARVN tankers [...] "refused to go." [...] As the Marine infantry started across, an enemy machine gun {{on the other end}} of the bridge opened up, killing and wounding several Marines. One Marine, Lance Corporal Lester A. Tully, later awarded the Silver Star for his action, ran forward, threw a grenade, and silenced the gun. Two platoons successfully made their way to the other side. They turned left and immediately came under automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from the Citadel wall. The Marines decided to withdraw. This was easier said than done. The enemy was well dug-in and firing from virtually every building in Huế city north of the river. The number of wounded was rising, the Marines commandeered some abandoned Vietnamese civilian vehicles and used them as makeshift ambulances to carry out the wounded. Among the casualties on the bridge was Major Walter M. Murphy, the 1st Battalion S-3 or operations officer, who later died of his wounds.|$|E

5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the <b>river's</b> <b>gravel</b> used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|R

50|$|Telford was {{appointed}} to design the bridge in 1823, following a dispute between the bridge trustees and their existing architect, who had proposed a bridge with three shorter iron arches. Telford changed the scheme to a single span so as to reduce interference with navigation of the river, and also to eliminate the expense of constructing foundations in the <b>river</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Targets {{are divided}} into two general {{categories}} of materials: placer deposits, consisting of valuable minerals contained within <b>river</b> <b>gravels,</b> beach sands, and other unconsolidated materials; and lode deposits, where valuable minerals are found in veins, in layers, or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock. Both types of ore deposit, placer or lode, are mined by both surface and underground methods.|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis on the}} structural performance of reinforced Self Compacting High Strength Fiber Reinforced Concrete members. Particularly, it summarizes {{the results of an}} experimental investigation aimed at analyzing the tension stiffening behavior of concrete mixtures produced with different kinds of natural aggregates: crushed granite and two types of amazon <b>river</b> <b>gravels</b> (derived from two different Brazilian regions). The mixtures were proportioned in order to achieve 60 MPa of compressive strength and, moreover, beyond three plain concrete mixtures, 35 mm length steel fibers were added to these mixtures, as spread reinforcing element, in volumetric fractions equal to 0. 5 % and 1. 0 %. The results derived from this type of test furnish a comprehensive analysis on the crack formation and propagation on concrete elements as well as distributed cracking mechanisms. The results indicate that the adherence between the steel bar and the concrete is not affected by the presence of the <b>river</b> <b>gravels</b> and that the fiber reinforcement controls crack width leading to a great number of cracks and, this effect is more pronounced for higher volume fractions...|$|R
50|$|This <b>river</b> mussel needs <b>gravel</b> <b>river</b> {{beds and}} swift-flowing, well-oxygenated water. The {{reduction}} in range {{seems to be}} principally due to damming and the consequential silting up of rivers below the dam and competition from zebra mussels.|$|R
