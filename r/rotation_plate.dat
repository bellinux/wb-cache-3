Previous work in this field has resulted in devices that are either costly or too complicated for general (especially elderly) patients to operate. RMAIS provides a practical and economical means for ordinary patients to easily manage their own medications, taking the right dosage {{of medicine at the}} prescribed time in a fully automatic way. The system design has the following features: (1) fully automatic operation for easy medication by using the built-in scale for dosage measurement and a motorized <b>rotation</b> <b>plate</b> to deliver the right medicine container in front of a patient, (2) various medication reminder messages for patients, and noncompliance alerts for caregivers (such as doctors, relatives or social workers who take care of the patients), and (3) incremental and economical adoption by pharmacies, patients, and insurance companies.

40|$|The Laser Geodynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) was {{launched}} on May 4, 1976 to provide geophysical measurements {{by means of}} laser ranging techniques. To date, over twelve years of laser range measurements have been collected from various tracking stations located around the world. Laser range measurements to LAGEOS have contributed to studies of earth <b>rotation,</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics, global baseline, and the gravity field {{as well as many}} other areas. Some of these studies are based upon the determination of a single, continuous orbit for LAGEOS for time spans on the order of several years. Current studies at the University of Texas Center for Space Research include the precision orbit determination of LAGEOS for arc lengths of up to 12. 8 years which represents over 31, 000 orbital revolutions. These long arc studies have led to the implementation of Encke's method to improve the convergence of the batch filter while reducing numerical integration errors. While the technique has been successfully applied to arc lengths of up to 12. 8 years, the results presented focus on the solution of a six-year arc...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to fabricate and characterize vertically aligned silicon nanowire gas sensors. Silicon nanowires are very attractive for gas sensing applications and vertically aligned silicon nanowires are preferred over horizontal nanowires for gas sensing due to the high density of nanowire arrays and the increased nanowire surface area per substrate area. However, the development of such devices has been limited by a number of challenges. Two of the key challenges in fabricating vertical silicon nanowire sensors are the difficulty of making electrical contact to the tops of the wires and the large serial resistance of the substrate. In this thesis, highly ordered, dense arrays of vertically aligned silicon nanowires in patterned areas have been fabricated utilizing metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) in combination with interference lithography. In addition, we report a novel and simple approach for making reliable top electrical contacts by using tilted electron beam evaporation with a custom-built <b>rotation</b> <b>plate.</b> A suspended metal top contact layer was formed on vertically aligned silicon nanowires using this approach. We have also systematically investigated the contact behavior between silicon nanowires and metal electrodes with different nanowire doping and contac...|$|E

Structure from Motion {{is one of the}} image-based methods implemented in commercial software. In this paper, a low-cost and portable system for 3 D modelling of texture-less objects is proposed. This system includes a rotating table designed and developed by using a stepper motor and a very light <b>rotation</b> <b>plate.</b> The system also has eight laser light sources with very dense and strong beams which provide a relatively appropriate pattern on texture-less objects. In this system, regarding to the step of stepper motor, images are semi automatically taken by a camera. The images can be used in structure from motion procedures implemented in Agisoft software. To evaluate the performance of the system, two dark objects were used. The point clouds of these objects were obtained by spraying a light powders on the objects and exploiting a GOM laser scanner. Then these objects were placed on the proposed turntable. Several convergent images were taken from each object while the laser light sources were projecting the pattern on the objects. Afterward, the images were imported in VisualSFM as a fully automatic software package for generating an accurate and complete point cloud. Finally, the obtained point clouds were compared to the point clouds generated by the GOM laser scanner.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this biomechanical study was to {{determine}} the effect of shortened clavicle malunion on the center of rotation of the glenohumeral (GH) joint, and the capacity of repair to restore baseline kinematics. Six shoulders underwent automated abduction (ABD) and abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) using a 7 -DoF automated upper extremity testing system in combination with an infrared motion capture system to measure the center of rotation of the GH joint. ATM was defined as pure lateral abduction and late cocking phase to the end of acceleration. Torsos with intact clavicle underwent testing to establish baseline kinematics. Then, the clavicles were subjected to midshaft fracture followed by kinematics testing. The fractured clavicles underwent repairs first by clavicle length restoration with plate fixation, and then by wiring of fragments with a 2 -cm overlap to simulate shortened malunion. Kinematic testing was conducted after each repair technique. Center of rotation of the GH joint was plotted across all axes to outline 3 D motion trajectory and area under the curve. Throughout ABD, malunion resulted in increased posterior and superior translation compared to baseline. Plate fixation restored posterior and superior translations at lower abduction angles but resulted in excess anterior and inferior translation at overhead angles. Throughout ATM, all conditions were significantly anterior and superior to baseline. Translation with malunion was situated anterior to the fractured and ORIF conditions at lower angles of external <b>rotation.</b> <b>Plate</b> fixation did not restore baseline anteroposterior or superoinferior translation at any angle measured. This study illustrates the complex interplay of the clavicle and the GH joint. While abnormal clavicle alignment alters shoulder motion, restoration of clavicle length does not necessarily restore GH kinematics to baseline. Rehabilitation of the injured shoulder must address the osseous injury and the dynamic forces of the shoulder girdle...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of cell culture time on bone formation by rat bone marrow cells seeded in titanium fiber mesh. As a seeding technique, a high cell suspension was used (3 x 10 (6) cells/mL). Therefore, 30 meshes were repeatedly rotated in a 10 mL tube (containing 30 x 10 (6) cells) on a <b>rotation</b> <b>plate</b> (2 rpm) for 3 h. Osteogenic cells were cultured for 1, 4, and 8 days on titanium fiber mesh and finally implanted subcutaneously in rats. Meshes without cells were also implanted subcutaneously in rats. DNA and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses and calcium measurements determined cellular proliferation and differentiation during the in vitro incubation period of the mesh implants. Four weeks after implant insertion, the animals were sacrificed. The implants, with their surrounding tissue, were retrieved and prepared for histologic evaluation and calcium measurements. DNA analysis of the in vitro experiment showed a lag phase from day 1 through day 4, but a 42 % increase in DNA between days 4 and 8. SEM and calcium measurements indicated an increase in calcium from day 1 to day 4, yet only a small but significant increase from days 4 to 8. Histologic analysis demonstrated that bone was formed in all day 1 and day 4 implants, and that the bone-like tissue was present uniformly through the meshes. The bony tissue was morphologically characterized by osteocytes embedded in a mineralized matrix, with a layer of osteoid and osteoblasts at the surface. The day 8 implants showed only calcium phosphate deposition in the titanium fiber mesh. Calcium measurements of the implants revealed that calcification in day 1 implants was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) compared to day 4 and day 8 implants. No significant difference in calcium content existed between day 4 and day 8 implants. On the basis of our results, we conclude that 1) bone formation was generated more effectively in osteogenic cells by a short culture time after seeding in titanium fiber mesh; 2) dynamic cell seeding is probably more effective than static cell seeding; and 3) selection of the right cells from the heterogenous bone marrow population remains a problem...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} control and {{operation}} of an inertial reference unit (IRU) based on vibratory gyroscopes provides for continuously repeated cycles of tuning and calibration. The method is intended especially for application to an IRU containing vibratory gyroscopes that are integral parts of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and that have cloverleaf designs, as described in several previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. The method provides for minimization of several measures of spurious gyroscope output, including zero-rate offset (ZRO), angle random walk (ARW), and rate drift. These benefits are afforded both at startup and thereafter during continuing operation, {{in the presence of}} unknown rotation rates and changes in temperature. A vibratory gyroscope contains a precision mechanically resonant structure containing two normal modes of vibration nominally degenerate in frequency and strongly coupled via a Coriolis term. In the case of the cloverleaf design MEMS gyro, these normal modes of vibration are plate rocking modes. The rocking motion of the plate is described by giving two angles, theta(sub 1) and theta(sub 2). A proof mass consisting of a post orthogonal to the plate ensures a high degree of Coriolis coupling of vibratory energy from one mode into the other under inertial <b>rotation.</b> The <b>plate</b> is driven and sensed capacitively across a few-microns-wide gap, and the normal mode frequencies can be tuned electrostatically by DC voltages applied across this gap.

40|$|AbstractA coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics–Rigid Body Dynamics (CFD–RBD) {{model is}} presented, which {{is capable of}} {{modelling}} the 3 D flight of plate-type windborne debris. The RBD model is based on rotational quaternions, which means that complex spinning modes of flight can be modelled accurately and robustly. For debris that is free to fly {{in the absence of}} obstructions, it is shown that, depending on the initial plate orientation, a number of distinct flight modes are observed. When the plate is aligned at right angles to the flow, the flight mode depends critically on the initial angle of attack. The plate may wobble or flutter as it flies, never completing a full rotation, or it may enter an autorotational flight mode. Depending on the direction of <b>rotation,</b> the <b>plate</b> is capable of flying faster than the wind. It does this by converting some of its potential energy into rotational energy. The <b>rotation</b> of the <b>plate</b> causes the forces acting on the plate to further accelerate or decelerate it, depending on the rotation direction. When the plate is not aligned at right angles to the flow, the plate always enters a complex 3 D spinning mode, with significant crosswind motion, which is absent when the plate is aligned at right angles to the flow. This spinning mode is more typical of plates flying in real wind storms. In addition, using a porous region to represent a simple double-eaved building, plates are launched from the roof and their trajectory is simulated. The complex flow fields around the building result in more realistic plate trajectories. For this particular scenario, large suctions on the windward slope of the roof produce large amounts of lift in the plates released from that position, causing them to fly well above the building, never entering the wake of the building...|$|R
