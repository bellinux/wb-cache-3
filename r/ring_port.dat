40|$|We {{propose a}} new class of compact {{integrated}} optical circulators providing a large isolation level while maintaining a straightforward technological feasibility. Their layout is based on a nonreciprocal radial Bragg cavity composed of concentric magneto-optical <b>rings.</b> The circulator <b>ports</b> are standard rib waveguides, butt-coupled to the cavity by cutting through its outer rings. The device is specifically designed for operation in a uniform external magnetic field. Using a coupled-mode description of the complete cavity/waveguide-port system, we explore the rich behaviour of cavity circulators in presence of varying levels of direct port-to-port coupling. We demonstrate numerically a strongly miniaturized two-dimensional cavity circulator, with a total footprint of less than (10 λ) ^ 2, achieving a 20 -dB isolation level at telecom frequencies over a bandwidth of 130 GHz. The device is found to be very tolerant with respect to fabrication imperfections. We finish with an outlook on three-dimensional versions of the proposed nonreciprocal cavities.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} spatial {{evolution}} of inter-Korean maritime connections {{for the last}} two decades. Based on the circulation pattern and capacity of trading vessels ‟ movements, it applies the Gini coefficient to the <b>ring</b> of external <b>ports</b> connecting North Korea to the outside world. Results show the gradual isolation of North Korea and the increased importance of neighboring transit ports through three main stages. First, traffics concentrate in global hub ports (Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japanese ports). Second, traffics split and spread to closer and smaller transit ports (Busan, Dalian, Nakhodka). Third, traffics re-concentrate upon Incheon, South Korea, which has become the dominant load center of the North in recent years. One difficulty is therefore whether such spatial shift should be attributed to the betterment of inter-Korean relationships (e. g. 2000 summit, maritime agreement) or to the internal problems of North Korea in terms of infrastructure decay and lacks of handling capacity at its ports. Such research allows complementing port concentration studies by analyzing external hub dependence {{in the case of a}} collapsing and increasingly isolated economy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBefore IS- 1 (3. 2 mm) {{standardization}} of pacemaker leads and connectors, 5 / 6 mm connector ports accomodated 5 mm or 6 mm diameter lead connector pins. Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker. Pulse generator reached ERI in 2006, with change {{out to a}} Medtronic Sigma SSR 306 (5 / 6 mm connector port) and preservation of the 5 mm lead. She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing <b>ring</b> at the <b>port</b> entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm lead connector pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice kits (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor kits or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker header connector port allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|R
40|$|Background. Laparoscopic {{adjustable}} gastric banding (LAGB) is {{a popular}} method {{for the treatment of}} morbid obesity. One of the most feared complications is gastric band erosion which occurs with a reported incidence of 0. 3 to 14 %. Intragastric migrated bands are best managed by endoscopic removal. Recent case studies reported successful endoscopic removal of intragastric migrated bands, but it is not always possible. We report our first experience with a transgastric removal of eroded bands using a Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) device. Methods. A patient who underwent gastric banding in the past (2007) presented with symptoms of epigastric pain and weight gain. Preoperative gastroscopy revealed stomach wall erosion with the gastric band partially (2 / 3) migrated into the gastric lumen. Attempts to remove the band by endoscopy were not successful. A laparoscopy was performed and multiple adhesions with evidence of inflammation was seen in the upper abdomen around the band. A SILS port was inserted through a 2 [*]cm incision in the left hypochondrium with the internal <b>ring</b> of the <b>port</b> placed into the stomach through a small anterior gastrotomy. The band was cut in the stomach and removed. The anterior gastrotomy was closed. We had a perfect intragastric view of the gastric banding. Results. There were no intra- or postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day on a gastric adapted diet. Conclusion. Removal of a gastric band after gastric erosion by SILS is feasible, safe, and effective. This is the first reported case of transgastric removal of eroded bands using an SILS device...|$|R
40|$|Silicon ring {{resonators}} {{are used}} as photon pair sources {{by taking advantage of}} silicon's large third order nonlinearity with a process known as spontaneous four wave mixing. These sources are capable of producing pairs of indistinguishable photons but typically suffer from an effective 50 % loss. By slightly decoupling the input waveguide from the <b>ring,</b> the drop <b>port</b> coincidence ratio can be significantly increased with the trade-off being that the pump is less efficiently coupled into the ring. Ring resonators with this design have been demonstrated having coincidence ratios of ∼ 96 % but requiring a factor of ∼ 10 increase in the pump power. Through the modification of the coupling design that relies on additional spectral dependence, it is possible to achieve similar coincidence ratios without the increased pumping requirement. This can be achieved by coupling the input waveguide to the ring multiple times, thus creating a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This coupler design can be used {{on both sides of the}} ring resonator so that resonances supported by one of the couplers are suppressed by the other. This is the ideal configuration for a photon-pair source as it can only support the pump photons at the input side while only allowing the generated photons to leave through the output side. Recently, this device has been realized with preliminary results exhibiting the desired spectral dependence and with a coincidence ratio as high as ∼ 97 % while allowing the pump to be nearly critically coupled to the ring. The demonstrated near unity coincidence ratio infers a near maximal heralding efficiency from the fabricated device. This device has the potential to greatly improve the scalability and performance of quantum computing and communication systems. Comment: 6 pages, 8 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Midwest Express Airlines {{began to}} create a new identity, as the first Boeing 717's were being delivered, and the DC-9 {{aircraft}} were being retired. The company started with removing the [...] "Express" [...] from its name (and thus, off the fuselage), and it designed a new logo that would help point it out as a representative of Milwaukee. The result was a logo that looked much like a wing, with a small 'M' inside of it. However, if the logo is turned on its side, it bears a resemblance to the Milwaukee Art Museum, designed by Santiago Calatrava, which was being constructed at the same time. The Art Museum has risen as an icon of Milwaukee, and so the new Midwest Airlines felt {{this would be a good}} representation. Along with this new identity came a new livery. The bottom of the aircraft remained grey, while the top was repainted in a deeper blue, with essentially the same gold, white, and red cheatlines separating the two. On the lower half, there was also a blue swoop, starting at the front (looking much like another stripe), getting larger as it went back, until it covered the entire rear fuselage. The engines on these planes were painted in the same blue color, with four gold <b>rings</b> on the <b>port</b> engine, and three on the starboard. This was meant to represent the ranking of Captain and First Officer, along with where they sit. Only three MD-80 aircraft, registered N813ME, N822ME, and N823ME ever wore the full new livery; all other MD-80s wore a hybrid livery until retirement, combining the second Midwest Express livery with the current logo and titling of Midwest Airlines. In the transitional period, some MD-80s also received the new titles before the new tail logo, resulting in another variation on the livery.|$|R
40|$|Work {{to define}} and develop a full scale Space Station Freedom (SSF) mockup with the {{flexibility}} to evolve into future designs, to validate techniques for maintenance and logistics and verify human task allocations and support trade studies is described. This work began in early 1985 and ended in August, 1991. The mockups are presently being used at MSFC in Building 4755 as a technology and design testbed, {{as well as for}} public display. Micro Craft also began work on the Process Material Management System (PMMS) under this contract. The PMMS simulator was a sealed enclosure for testing to identify liquids, gaseous, particulate samples, and specimen including, urine, waste water, condensate, hazardous gases, surrogate gasses, liquids, and solids. The SSF would require many trade studies to validate techniques for maintenance and logistics and verify system task allocations; it was necessary to develop a full scale mockup which would be representative of current SSF design with the ease of changing those designs as the SSF design evolved and changed. The tasks defined for Micro Craft were to provide the personnel, services, tools, and materials for the SSF mockup which would consist of four modules, nodes, interior components, and part task mockups of MSFC responsible engineering systems. This included the Engineering Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) testbed. For the initial study, the mockups were low fidelity, soft mockups of graphics art bottle, and other low cost materials, which evolved into higher fidelity mockups as the R&D design evolved, by modifying or rebuilding, an important cost saving factor in the design process. We designed, fabricated, and maintained the full size mockup shells and support stands.

40|$|At the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the D&D task is enormous. Tons of {{plutonium}} has been processed {{over the years}} in approximately 1, 000 gloveboxes, This represents nearly half of the gloveboxes in the DOE complex. In addition, more than a thousand tanks of various designs, with miles of associated piping, supported the processes. A wide variety of operations were performed at RFETS, including aqueous processing, pyrophoric processing, hydriding and dehydriding, metal casting, and machining {{of plutonium}}. Various materials have been handled at the facility, including plutonium, uranium, americium, tantalum, beryllium, chloride salts, and various acids and solvents. Significant amounts of plutonium residues remain in inaccessible equipment in the facilities, which create criticality safety issues. Some of the plutonium has been at RFETS for many years, and there is significant in-growth of americium, a decay product that emits gamma radiation, which potentially increases exposure to the workers. The size reduction portion of the D&D will be difficult and costly. The gloveboxes and tanks are constructed of stainless steel, frequently with lead shielding or double walls that hold water for neutron shielding. Window mountings, glove <b>port</b> <b>rings,</b> site gages, bolted flanges, and various penetrations reinforce the walls. Tanks may be filled with berated glass rings for criticality control, or double walled to hold the process fluid in the space between walls. The gloveboxes and tanks are generally tall enough to require workers to stand on scaffolding or platforms to perform D&D. Gloveboxes and tanks were individually constructed over a span of many years with evolving design specifications; therefore, most gloveboxes are unique and few tank designs are duplicated in more than pairs. This paper describes the cultural transition and technical approaches taken for D&D at RFETS to achieve 2006 closure. Specific emphasis is placed on critical issues such as, workforce safety and retention, strategies for schedule acceleration, and technological breakthroughs for D&D of nuclear facilities...|$|R
