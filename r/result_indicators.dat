ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The team acknowledges the support, cooperation, effort, and enthusiasm that AVSC contributed to this evaluation. AVSC/New York worked with the team for four days at the onset of the evaluation and concluded the evaluation with two debriefings in Washington. A considerable portion of this time was devoted to the enjoyable and exciting, but risky, task of developing <b>results</b> and <b>indicators</b> for the follow-on Cooperative Agreement. It is noteworthy that AVSC suggested to USAID that the evaluation include work on developing these <b>results</b> and <b>indicators</b> and that AVSC actively seeks results that will have a significant impact. In particular, the team thanks Evie Landry, who managed and led this evaluation effort. The team also thanks the staff of AVSC/Kenya, AVSC/India, and AVSC/Nepal for graciously hosting us for three weeks and sharing their programs with us. We particularly acknowledge their contribution to the recommended <b>results</b> and <b>indicators.</b> Although these <b>results</b> and <b>indicators</b> were tentatively drafted with New York staff, AVSC field staff were the testing ground. In response to the team's question as to whether it is realistic for AVSC to strive to have an impact at the level connoted by those <b>results</b> and <b>indicators</b> and whether field staff were willing to be measured and held accountable at that level, field staff enthusiastically said yes.
