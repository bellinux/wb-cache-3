25|$|The {{key event}} in the journey is the meeting of Ra and Osiris. In the New Kingdom, this event {{developed}} into a complex symbol of the Egyptian conception of life and time. Osiris, relegated to the Duat, is like a mummified body within its tomb. Ra, endlessly moving, is like the ba, or soul, of a deceased human, which may travel during the day but must return to its body each night. When Ra and Osiris meet, they merge into a single being. Their pairing reflects the Egyptian vision of time as a continuous repeating pattern, with one member (Osiris) being always static and the other (Ra) living in a constant cycle. Once he has united with Osiris' <b>regenerative</b> <b>power,</b> Ra continues on his journey with renewed vitality. This renewal makes possible Ra's emergence at dawn, which {{is seen as the}} rebirth of the sun—expressed by a metaphor in which Nut gives birth to Ra after she has swallowed him—and the repetition of the first sunrise at the moment of creation. At this moment, the rising sun god swallows the stars once more, absorbing their power. In this revitalized state, Ra is depicted as a child or as the scarab beetle god Khepri, both of which represent rebirth in Egyptian iconography.|$|E
40|$|There is now good {{evidence}} {{that in the}} Vertebrata peripheral nerves exert an important trophic effect on the regeneration of the structures which they innervate (Millot, 1931; Needham, J. 1942; Ham-burger, 1944). In invertebrates the nervous system is not always necessary; Millot (1931, p. 117) con-cluded that in types where <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers</b> are comparatively limited (e. g. Mollusca, some Nemer-tinea), the nervous system is necessary, while in types with extensive <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers</b> (Tunicata, many Platyhelmia) it may be unnecessary. Some of the Crustacea are outstanding among the higher invertebrates for their extensive <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers,</b> and from the evidence available in 1927 (Korschelt, 1927, pp. 600 - 1) it seemed probable that in thi...|$|R

500|$|He located two {{designs for}} the Bustum Caesaris Augusti, {{concluding}} that they were based upon sexual ritual, with [...] "two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula". [...] Piranesi believed {{that the purpose of}} the phallic designs were to celebrate virility and male <b>regenerative</b> <b>power.</b> Other commentators such as Carl August Ehrensvärd also provided illustrations and analysis of Priapic temples and the meaning of phallic architecture. A work of note to this effect is Neoclassical Temple of Virility and the Buildings with a Phallic Shaped Plan (1977) of the Institute for Art History of the University of Lund, Sweden.|$|E
500|$|In {{books for}} adults, birds may have {{symbolic}} or psychological significance. For instance, Paul Gallico's 1940 [...] was a parable about the <b>regenerative</b> <b>power</b> of friendship in wartime; the goose symbolises both the hero, Rhayader, a wounded artist, {{and the world}} wounded by war. T. H. White's 1951 The Goshawk describes the author's [...] "monstrous and often cruel battles" [...] to train his bird of prey, while Helen Macdonald's 2014 H is for Hawk, which references White's book, tells how her obsession with the same species as a falconer helped her through {{the loss of her}} father.|$|E
2500|$|In Mawdryn Undead, it {{is first}} stated that a Time Lord can {{transfer}} his regenerative life essence to another being. In that story, the Fifth Doctor is coerced by Mawdryn {{to give up}} his future regenerations in order to cure Nyssa and Tegan Jovanka from Mawdryn's disease. Although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart), the Doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease to be a Time Lord. It is not until [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, River Song sacrifices her own <b>regenerative</b> <b>power</b> in order to revive the dead Eleventh Doctor. The favour is returned in [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] in which River's wrist is repaired by the Doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy.|$|E

5000|$|With Edward Beals, {{which may}} have been another pseudonym, Atkinson wrote the {{so-called}} [...] "Personal Power Books"—a group of 12 titles on humanity's internal powers and how to use them. Titles include Faith Power: Your Inspirational Forces and <b>Regenerative</b> <b>Power</b> or Vital Rejuvenation.Due to the lack of information on Edward Beals, many believe this is also a pseudonym.|$|E

The story features Hemingway's recurrent autobiographical character Nick Adams and explores the <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers</b> of nature and the joy of skiing.|$|R

But immediately after blooming, it turns into a giant killer cactus. From this giant Queen Cactus, small killer cactuses were generated. They started swallowing the people one after the other. All the terrified people started running, with the cactuses chasing them and eating them up. The town was getting destroyed.The cactus researcher, Ikegamino, said that cactuses have a strong <b>regenerative</b> <b>power</b> and {{it would be difficult to}} destroy them.|$|E

Utsutsu, instead of turning into a monster, gains <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers.</b> In order for the virus to be suppressed in Yume, Utsutsu must take a drug and have Yume feed on his flesh.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps Hernández's {{best known}} poem is [...] "Nanas de la cebolla" [...] ("Onion Lullaby"), a reply in verse {{to a letter}} from his wife in which she {{informed}} {{him that she was}} surviving on bread and onions. In the poem, the poet envisions his son breastfeeding on his mother's onion blood (sangre de cebolla), and uses the child's laughter as a counterpoint to the mother's desperation. In this as in other poems, the poet turns his wife's body into a mythic symbol of desperation and hope, of <b>regenerative</b> <b>power</b> desperately needed in a broken Spain.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Amara {{possesses}} certain regenerative powers when {{in contact}} with the ground. Even when she was once affected by Selene's life-draining touch, she recovered quickly enough to aid the New Mutants in battle. If she is not {{in contact with}} the ground or the physical shock to her system from a single injury is too great, the <b>regenerative</b> <b>power</b> is no longer in effect and she may die. Dr. Nemesis discovered that Magma is also able to recover from laceration wounds in her human form by changing to her energized form, the intense heat cauterizing and sealing any wounds.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the pilot}} episode, Vasco discovers {{that she has}} superhuman {{abilities}} — supernormal <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers</b> bordering on invulnerability. This is realized when she is pushed through a forty story window and falls to her apparent death, only to later revive and recover completely. However, she still feels the pain of her injuries before they heal. The team's doctor, Seth Carpenter, identifies her abilities as not {{like those of the}} neuros they track, but [...] "something else".|$|R
50|$|Plant {{stem cells}} are {{characterized}} by two distinctive properties, which are: {{the ability to create}} all differentiated cell types and the ability to self-renew such that the number of stem cells is maintained. Plant stem cells never undergo aging process but immortally give rise to new specialized and unspecialized cells, and they have the potential to grow into any organ, tissue, or cell in the body. Thus they are totipotent cells equipped with <b>regenerative</b> <b>powers</b> that facilitate plant growth and production of new organs throughout lifetime.|$|R

Kitty, possessing an ability to send a mutant's consciousness back in time, suggests altering history to prevent Trask’s assassination.
