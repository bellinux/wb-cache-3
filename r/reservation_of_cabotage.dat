40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{conditions for}} carrying out cabotage in road freight transport, in comparison to current and past development at the EU level, and in transport policy of the EU described in the primary law. The most current changes at the field <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> are a good precondition for the future growth {{of this type of}} transport. The issue <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> could be described in three groups of topics, the first being the unified EU regulations <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> and conditions set {{for carrying out}} cabotage, the second concerns topics, that are similar in every EU country due to harmonization of national law, for example the payment of VAT, admission to the occupancy of road haulier or technical conditions for vehicles. The third group deals with matters that are different in every EU country, e. g. toll systems. Carrying out cabotage is therefore to be adjusted to all aforesaid conditions, which have a direct influence to the economical background <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> transports...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, the United States has {{aspired to}} the {{operation}} of its industries {{in a system of}} free enterprise. One of the oldest instances of government intervention in shipping - the cabotage law- was designed to preserve for domestic vessels all trade between domestic points. Recently, however, developments in maritime commerce have led United States courts to an examination <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> legislation. The result has noticeably limited the scope of United States coast-wise laws. Specifically, questions have arisen over: 1) the eligibility for coastwise trade of vessels which have been reconstructed from parts of two other ships, 2) the application <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> legislation to cargo which returns to the United States after having been processed or refined abroad, 6 and 3) the entry into coastwise trade of federally subsidized vessels. After discussing the purpose and scope <b>of</b> the <b>cabotage</b> law, this Note will discuss these issues and their significance in the overall scheme of United States shipping...|$|R
50|$|Cabotage rights remain rare in {{passenger}} aviation. The Chicago Convention prohibits {{member states}} from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations. Cabotage is not granted under most open skies agreements.|$|R
40|$|The term air {{cabotage}} {{refers to the}} carriage of air traffic between two points within {{the territory of the}} same state. This carriage is generally reserved to the aircraft of the territorial state and is thus inaccessible to foreign carriers. This thesis gives a brief account of the origins of the concept <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> in maritime law and of its introduction in the early international air law conventions. The thesis then proceeds to focus on the problem <b>of</b> air <b>cabotage</b> in the North-American context and particularly on the current bilateral negotiations between the USA and Canada at which cabotage rights in the USA are being sought by Canada. It further projects on the EEC context, where air transport liberalization measures toward the completion of a single integrated market will eventually (perhaps very soon) lead to the availability for Community carriers <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> rights within any EEC Member State. The creation <b>of</b> a "Community <b>cabotage</b> area" where only Community carriers would be able to carry Community traffic is also analyzed. Finally, the consequences of these developments are examined as far as EEC Member States' obligations under the Chicago Convention and relations with third states are concerned.

5000|$|In the 1990s, [...] "open skies" [...] {{agreements}} {{became more}} common. These agreements take {{many of these}} regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> restrictions.|$|R
50|$|From {{the end of}} March 2014, {{the airline}} withdrew its Ancona-Roma Fiumicino and Trapani-Roma Fiumicino routes, as a result <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> restrictions, which prevent Swiss {{aviation}} companies from operating domestic flights in the European Union. It was previously possible for Darwin Airline to fly these routes thanks to a derogation from the Italian Civil Aviation Authority, however, this was not renewed. In January 2014, Darwin Airline cancelled its Aosta-Roma Fiumicino route before it had commenced; a result <b>of</b> the same <b>cabotage</b> and the European Union's refusal to make an exception for a Swiss company.|$|R
50|$|When it was {{completed}} by 1630, the cannons of San Ignacio pointed towards the Bay of Las √Ånimas, {{the same one that}} today receives the traffic <b>of</b> <b>cabotage,</b> and that then it extended by all the beach. Therefore, its mission was to discourage any attempt against the pier or against the banks and to contribute to the covering of Bocagrande (another entrance to the Bay of Cartagena).|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of offshore trade with North America is carried in 20 and 40 foot marine containers. It would appear logical to use empty international marine containers in domestic service if controlled by a Canadian carrier. Until recently this form <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> was restricted by Canadian customs regulations. This paper examines the environmental impact <b>of</b> the <b>cabotage</b> regime on the movement of international containers in Canadian domestic service and how these regulations influenced supply chain efficiencies. The discussion begins with a historical perspective and theoretical underpinning, followed by a comparison of North American container regulations. A review of global reforms and contemporary perspectives on cabotage regulations is provided, followed by a chronology of Canadian container regulatory reform. An economic framework and method of analysis is presented and three case studies are examined to illustrate the environmental and economic impact <b>of</b> a liberalized <b>cabotage</b> regime...|$|R
50|$|In 1762, {{the year}} of the capture of Havana by the British, a suburb of this name already existed. After 1763 navigators <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> and {{carpenters}} who repaired merchant ships lived there, and the carpenters established several workshops, in addition to the workshop that was created for the arsenal of the square. In 1846 it had 894 inhabitants and 120 houses. In 1858 its population had already reached 1,061 persons.|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} {{located at the}} {{crossroads}} between Europe and Asia Minor and the Near East {{as well as between}} Europe and Africa. In antiquity, when navigation consisted only <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> and sailors sought never to lose sight of land, they played an essential role as a stopover. Into the 20th century, this situation made their fortune (trade was one of their chief activities) and their misfortune (control of the Cyclades allowed for control of the commercial and strategic routes in the Aegean).|$|R
50|$|In an April 1967 {{speech to}} the United States Merchant Marine Academy alumni association, Kahn {{advocated}} for rules to benefit the domestic shipping industry, including retention <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> laws that require domestic shipping be by ships owned and built in the United States and manned by American crews. He also pushed for a requirement that all foreign aid shipments be on American ships. that the United States Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service use American-flagged vessels exclusively and that {{at least half of}} oil imported into the United States be on American-flagged ships.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the primary}} sector, private sector {{initiatives}} were less numerous. There were several reasons for this: issues with the soil and climate, as well as transport and commercialisation roblems. The communication network remained inadequate. Under Tsiranana {{there were only three}} railway routes: Tananarive-Tamatave (with a branch leading to Lake Alaotra), Tananarive-Antsirabe, and Fianarantsoa-Manakara. The 3,800 km of roads (2,560 km of which were asphalted) mostly served to link Tananarive to the port cities. Vast regions remained isolated. The ports, although poorly equipped, enabled some degree <b>of</b> <b>cabotage.</b>|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{argues that}} by {{adopting}} a two-stage common maritime policy, with a gradual liberalization <b>of</b> <b>cabotage,</b> the European Community took the right {{course of action}} {{in view of the}} prevailing internal and international conditions of the maritime market. Part I defines the basic concepts concerning the maritime industry and policy. Part I also presents the legal framework within which the European Community adopts measures on maritime policy. Part II discusses the 1986 Legislative Package, marking the first stage {{in the development of the}} Community common maritime policy. Part II then reviews the provisions and impact of Regulation 3577 / 92 which continued and complemented the development of the EC common shipping policy initiated by the 1986 Legislative Package. Part III maintains that the European Community has succeeded in establishing a common maritime policy, leading not only to the full liberalization of maritime trade between Member States and among Member States and third countries, but also, to the gradual opening up <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> routes. Part III further maintains that by tackling the external and internal issues confronting the EC maritime policy separately and in stages, the European Community has acted in its best long-term commercial and strategic interests. This Comment concludes that the European Community has successfully forged a common maritime policy as one of the vehicles towards achieving the single internal market...|$|R
50|$|Livy {{mentions}} the natural {{division between the}} Ager and the Saltus Vasconum, i.e. between the fields of the Ebro basin and {{the mountains to the}} north. It has been held by historians that Romanisation was significant in the fertile Ager but almost null in the Saltus, where Roman towns were scarce and generally small. However, the latest 21st century findings have called into question that assumption, highlighting the importance of fishing (fish processing factories, caetariae) and mining sector on the Atlantic arch (the Atlantic route <b>of</b> <b>cabotage),</b> as well as other settlements dotting the Atlantic basin.|$|R
