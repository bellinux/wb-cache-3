5|$|In May 2009, Obama {{delivered}} the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her <b>relatable.</b> Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote {{that there was}} chemistry between Obama and the students.|$|E
5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a <b>relatable</b> {{character}} who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him <b>relatable,</b> the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more <b>relatable</b> and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|The special {{featured}} {{songs from}} Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, and duets with the guest stars. Critics gave the special mixed reviews, with some praising Gaga for being <b>relatable</b> in the show. Other reviewers were disappointed with {{its lack of}} production ideas, other than as a promotion for Artpop. It had lower ratings than other Thanksgiving specials, {{with a total of}} 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18–49 demographic.|$|E
5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more <b>relatable</b> to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, <b>relatable</b> plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|Truman Burbank is {{the unsuspecting}} star of The Truman Show, a reality {{television}} program which is broadcast live {{around the clock}} and across the globe. His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed {{to them by the}} show's creator and executive producer, Christof, who seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior, give audiences a <b>relatable</b> everyman, and protect him from the outside world with a sense of normalcy.|$|E
5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most <b>relatable</b> {{character}} in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E
5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did not promote this fluidity or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more <b>relatable</b> character.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and <b>relatable</b> for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu Weekly {{found the}} story enjoyable, though noted {{that those who}} had played Destiny would get more {{enjoyment}} out of it, and praised the voice acting. They also found the gameplay and pacing enjoyable, positively noting the option to auto-battle. The game ranked as the 89th all-time favorite game in a 2006 Famitsu readers poll. Japanese website Game Impress Watch found the story impressive, citing its use of time travel and the continued use of Destinys world and lore. The gameplay, mini-games and customization options was also generally praised, with the reviewer recommending the title to players of the series. RPGFan's Woojin Lee was also positive, praising the gameplay despite the very high encounter rate, and was pleased that an auto-battle option was included. One point that received a more mixed response was the game's music, {{with the exception of}} the opening song. In a preview for IGN, David Smith was generally positive about the game. While he disliked the art style and its low-tech look compared to its hardware, he found the gameplay enjoyable and the opening parts of the story fairly <b>relatable.</b> He ended by hoping that Namco would put the effort into localizing the title.|$|E
25|$|Narrative: The images {{combine with}} other news {{elements}} to make facts <b>relatable</b> to audiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} of Heart and Brain are considered very <b>relatable,</b> as they cover well-known dichotomies such as introversion and extroversion, and logic and emotion. Seluk's {{degree in psychology}} benefited him in reinforcing these aspects. The characters were metaphorically inspired by the concept of Id, Ego and Superego, represented by the heart, Lars, and the brain respectively. In November 2015, Seluk published a collection of Heart and Brain comics in a book.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these public}} {{reactions}} {{have been criticized}} for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account intersectionality and the increased obstacles that women of color face. Intersectional feminists often find that white feminists attempt to speak for all women when relaying their experiences of the gender pay gap, when in reality their problems are not <b>relatable</b> to women of color who face an additional barrier of racism.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} planned by Chiyomaru Shikura, the CEO of 5pb., {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo and Zizz Studio, written by Naotaka Hayashi {{along with other}} writers, and features character designs by artists including Mutsumi Sasaki, Huke, and Tomonori Fukuda. The developers aimed to make the series set within reality, as Shikura felt it made it more <b>relatable</b> and believable. The series has been commercially and critically successful, selling more than expected for the genre and helping establishing 5pb. as a game developer.|$|E
25|$|Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona {{runs the}} gamut from {{friendly}} charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. His charm can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually reads as plausible and <b>relatable</b> to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have studied his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures across the globe.|$|E
25|$|Anime News Network {{reviewed}} the series {{and gave a}} story rating of A-, stating a similar basis of Sword Art Online with improved characters. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the anime for its well-thought out story, <b>relatable</b> main character, and great villain protagonist, but criticizes the anime for its third arc. At the end, {{he says that the}} anime starts out strong, but ends on a weak note. Nifrigel declared great things about the anime in terms of soundtrack, characters, and story, but strongly criticized Reki Kawahara's lack of knowledge in the subject of virtual reality.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna {{was created}} as a Kurd because {{director}} Seiji Mizushima wanted to explore the situation people in the Middle East go through which forces {{them to participate in}} wars. He was also made to contrast previous Gundam characters who were <b>relatable</b> with the audience. Setsuna has been a popular character in Japan, where voice actor Mamoru Miyano received an award for the role, and within the Gundam fanbase, ranking highly in various polls. However, critical reception to Setsuna's character from English-language publications for anime, manga and other media has been mixed, criticizing his silent personality but praising his growth across the series.|$|E
25|$|The Hybrid III {{dummy for}} three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, {{and does not}} provide the same {{physical}} outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When {{using data from the}} real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily <b>relatable</b> to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.|$|E
500|$|... “The Princess and the Pea” spurred on {{positive}} criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard {{pointed out}} the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily <b>relatable</b> to all people. He believed that [...] "the world Andersen witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil, and man's follies—is reflected in his tales," [...] and most evidently in [...] "The Princess and the Pea." [...] Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that “since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering, and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes, and genders.” Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized {{that one of the}} things that makes this story so appealing and <b>relatable</b> is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.|$|E
500|$|Eisenberg {{played the}} supervillain Lex Luthor in , which was {{released}} in March 2016, to mixed reviews. Eisenberg's performance in particular was criticized [...] by comic book fans and film reviewers, later earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor. He would defend himself by saying he attempted to [...] "make these people real and <b>relatable</b> and interesting and engaging, not just, you know, a surface bad person." ...|$|E
500|$|Suanshu Khurana and A. Kameshwari of The Indian Express {{praised the}} music and {{respectively}} said, [...] "A fresh and enthusiastic set, with life's tales told in a breezy fashion. The album lacks variance, yet, it manages to have many sparkling moments." [...] and, [...] "Sensible and <b>relatable</b> songs making the album simplistic that automatically gets registered {{at the back of}} your mind, a poetic version of our exact feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Guardian, Hadley Freeman {{describes}} Adams' personality as [...] "extremely engaging, serious {{but with}} a hint of a straight-talking broad once she gets going". Carl Swanson of New York magazine considers her to be [...] "suspiciously unnarcissistic for a Hollywood star, gracious, hardworking, and decent to the point of almost not being a celebrity". Alex Bilmes of Esquire believes that her ability to be [...] "both glamorous movie star and <b>relatable</b> normal person is key to her success".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the 2016 {{election}} cycle, Romney expressed sympathy toward Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton since she had also experienced claims of not being <b>relatable.</b> She was also puzzled by Republican front-runner Donald Trump's success despite touting his wealth whereas the Romneys had not, yet still were criticized for not relating to common voters because of theirs. Though highly critical of her husband after he spoke negatively of the Trump candidacy in March 2016, Trump praised Ann Romney as [...] "a lovely woman".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{describes}} herself as a [...] "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [...] and maintains that honest songwriting {{is very important to}} her. She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more <b>relatable</b> when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are <b>relatable</b> with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Betsy Sharkey {{reviewed}} for the Los Angeles Times, [...] " [...] {{elevate the}} movie beyond ordinary biography or overplayed tragedy, and give Oscar-worthy {{performances in the}} process." [...] Sharkey expressed her compliments about Leto's performance, [...] "Leto's performance, though, is the revelation. ... It's a hauntingly authentic performance; the tailored suit he puts on to meet with his disapproving father {{is one of the}} film's most moving scenes." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety said, [...] "Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give terrific performances in this riveting and surprisingly <b>relatable</b> true story." ...|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's {{reviews of}} Rozen Maiden: Zurückspulen was {{generally}} positive. Carl Kimlinger described {{the characterization of}} the adult Jun as a [...] "highly believable mixture of bruised pride, desperate loneliness, and downtrodden numbness" [...] and praised how <b>relatable</b> the character is compared to his younger self. He also praised the scripting for Jun's life and the scene where Jun's personality is being dissected by his boss to be intelligently written. Bamboo Dong praised Zurückspulens introduction for revitalizing the series. Both reviewers praised the art and dolls' designs and expressed concerns about the confusing plot.|$|E
500|$|... "More than ever, though, [...] "Power" [...] has Kanye internalizing his {{multiple}} {{minds and}} coming to an ecstatic peace with them. [...] "Power" [...] is not a bitchfest. It's an exaltation. All of his various guises-- King of the Assholes, drama queen, Red Bull'd 12-year-old, Next Chappelle, strangely <b>relatable</b> Megaman-- are mashed up in this proudly schizoid roll call. Every sound {{is ready for the}} arena, and every couplet is ready for the 140 character treatment, including this one: [...] "I don't need yo pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick/ I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?" [...] He knows the answer, and so do we." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{wrote that}} this episode [...] "turned {{out to be}} an {{absolute}} winner". He concluded that [...] "with its more <b>relatable</b> storylines and moments like the eerie-voiced guy at the hospital, Liz tipping tables for her mac and cheese, and watching an entire sandwich be eaten in real time in the airport security line, 'Sandwich Day' was a definite highlight in the post-writers' strike season." [...] Erin Fox of TV Guide said that [...] "the minor story of the episode was probably the funniest". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that this episode [...] "was nothing more than...eh". He called this episode a [...] "weak link".|$|E
500|$|Several film {{executives}} later made efforts {{towards the}} project, including Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, Dick Zondag, Glen Keane, and Dave Goetz. In 2011, director Chris Buck {{began work on}} another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow Queen character. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily because she was not <b>relatable</b> and too isolated, having no personal connections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations. After several changes were proposed, someone on the writing team suggested making the Snow Queen Anna's sister. [...] "Once we realized that these characters could be siblings and have a relationship, everything changed," [...] Del Vecho relayed.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus and DeLonge {{took the}} songwriting {{for their first}} {{legitimate}} release very seriously. The two strove for perfection writing songs that they felt would be <b>relatable.</b> Blink also recorded joke tracks, as they felt that, {{in addition to the}} serious songs, [...] "it was almost as important to make people laugh." [...] DeLonge recalled that the band spent more time at the end of production on Buddha trying to perfect the joke songs rather than their serious tracks. The band's main influence on Buddha, according to DeLonge, was the Descendents. [...] "I was trying to emulate that band. Really punchy guitars, fast, simple and formulaic nursery rhyme love songs," [...] he said in 2012.|$|E

Jack McBrayer, who plays NBC page Kenneth Parcell, {{in regards to the}} environmental theme, said [...] "It's something that is <b>relatable</b> and is something {{that a lot of people}} are doing. Everybody is on board with greening up the place and being more environmentally friendly in real life. Every now and then people need to be reminded of things that can be done."

500|$|Warren {{also added}} that the song's message was {{universal}} in nature and <b>relatable</b> to any loss faced in life. Gaga, who herself {{is a victim of}} rape, revealed during the Producers Guild of America Awards 2015, that the song's theme was important to her family as well. Her father's sister Joanne had been sexually assaulted while attending college, and the subsequent torment worsened her prevailing lupus, resulting in her death and profoundly affecting Gaga's family. The singer became involved with New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo's push for new legislation to help eradicate [...] "rape culture" [...] in American universities, signing a letter supporting it. Titled [...] "Enough Is Enough", the legislation went into effect in July 2015.|$|E
500|$|When Vince Gilligan wrote [...] "Hungry," [...] {{he wanted}} to try a [...] "different" [...] {{approach}} to The X-Files. Accordingly, he decided to write an episode that featured Mulder and Scully as the antagonists, as viewed {{through the eyes of}} the monster. Series creator Chris Carter applauded this idea and called it a [...] "really great monster show." [...] Gilligan's intention was for the monster to resonate with the audience. He wrote the part specifically so that the monster would be <b>relatable.</b> He later said, [...] "My intention [...] was that at the end, when Mulder and Scully show up and kill the monster, to have the audience out there hoping that they would not show up." ...|$|E
