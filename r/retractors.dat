The post-op patient’s arms were strapped to the bed for the first night after the procedure. The drain was removed 48 hours after surgery, the catheter four days, and the stent eight. The new vagina was managed by frequent or daily insertion of fingers or <b>retractors,</b> and the new urethra was kept open by the daily introduction of the catheter, ensuring against neomeatal stenosis. Most patients spent two weeks in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|Interventionalists {{require a}} {{floating}} tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, {{but based on}} their interventional experience in angiography {{may be used to}} having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like <b>retractors</b> or limb holders should be available for the table.|$|E

500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as <b>retractors.</b> [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E
2500|$|An {{incision}} is made {{to access}} the surgical site. [...] Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and <b>retractors</b> {{may be used to}} expose the site or keep the incision open. [...] The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum. [...] In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in surgery aseptic technique is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the patient's body that will be operated on.Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mini-open {{carpal tunnel}} release has become {{increasingly}} popular {{for the treatment of}} carpal tunnel surgery. The main advantages are shortening recovery time and return-to-work time. However, the risk of neurovascular injury still remains worrisome. Methods In this study, we developed a new <b>retractor</b> (herein called the PSU <b>retractor)</b> modified from the widely used Senn <b>retractor,</b> with the aim of decreasing the risk of neurovascular problems from normal procedure. 3 -Dimensional computer design software (SolidWorks ® Office Premium 2007 SP 3. 1) was used to construct a 3 -D PSU <b>retractor</b> prototype. An amputated arm from a 30 -year-old woman diagnosed as synovial sarcoma at the shoulder was used to test the maximal visual length. A mini-surgical incision was performed at 3 cm distal to the transverse wrist crease and a tiny flexible ruler was inserted through the tunnel beneath the skin to measure the maximal visual length. Results Our new <b>retractor</b> showed significantly better maximal visual length compared to the Senn <b>retractor</b> (47. 7 (8. 1) mm vs. 39. 2 (6. 5) mm). In addition, most assessors expressed a higher satisfaction rate with the PSU <b>retractor</b> than with the Senn <b>retractor</b> (7. 3 (1. 9) vs. 6. 3 (1. 1)). Conclusion In conclusion, we have developed a promising new <b>retractor</b> using a computer design program, which appears to be an improvement on the currently available equipment used for mini-open carpal tunnel surgery.

40|$|Evolutionary {{changes in}} the {{development}} of shell-attached <b>retractor</b> muscles in gastropods are of fundamental importance to theories about the early evolution and subsequent diversification of this molluscan class. Development of the shell-attached <b>retractor</b> muscle (columellar muscle) in a caenogastropod has been studied at the ultrastructural level to test the hypothesis of homology with the post-torsional left <b>retractor</b> muscle (larval velar <b>retractor)</b> in vetigastropod larvae. The vetigastropod muscle has been implicated in the generation of ontogenetic torsion, a morphogenetic twist between body regions that is important to theories about early gastropod evolution. Two shell-attached <b>retractor</b> muscles develop sequentially in the caenogastropod, Polinices lewisii, which is a pattern that has been also identified in previous ultrastructural studies on a vetigastropod and several nudibranch gastropods. The pattern may be a basal and conserved characteristic of gastropods. I found that the first-formed <b>retractor</b> in larvae of P. lewisii is comparable to the larval velar <b>retractor</b> that exists at the time of ontogenetic torsion in the vetigastropod, Haliotis kamtschatkana. However, the post-metamorphic columellar muscle of P. lewisii is derived exclusively from part of the second-formed muscle, which is comparable to the second-formed pedal muscle system in the vetigastropod. I conclude that the post-metamorphic columellar muscle of P. lewisii, is not homologous to the larval velar <b>retractor</b> of the vetigastropod, H. kamtschatkana...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel force-sensing silicone <b>retractor</b> {{that can be}} attached to a surgical suction pipe to improve the usability of the suction and retraction functions during neurosurgery. The <b>retractor</b> enables simultaneous utilization of three functions: suction, retraction, and retraction-force sensing. The <b>retractor</b> also reduces the number of tool changes and ensures safe retraction through visualization {{of the magnitude of}} the retraction force. The proposed force-sensing system is based on a force visualization mechanism through which the force is displayed in the form of motion of a colored pole. This enables surgeons to estimate the retraction force. When a fiberscope or camera is present, the <b>retractor</b> enables measurement of the retraction force with a resolution of 0. 05 N. The <b>retractor</b> has advantages of being disposable, inexpensive, and easy to sterilize or disinfect.

50|$|A {{retractor}} is {{a surgical}} instrument with which a surgeon can either actively separate {{the edges of}} a surgical incision or wound, or can hold back underlying organs and tissues, so that body parts under the incision may be accessed. The two are each available in many shapes, sizes, and styles. The general term retractor usually describes a simple handheld steel tool possessing a curved, hooked, or angled blade fitted with a comfortable handle, that when in place maintains the desired position of a given region of tissue. These simple <b>retractors</b> may be handheld, clamped in situ, or suspended {{at the end of}} a robotic arm. <b>Retractors</b> can also be self retaining and not need to be held once inserted by having two or more opposing blades or hooks which are separated via spring, ratchet, worm gear or some other method and pull on opposite sides of a wound. The term retractor is also used to describe the distinct, hand-cranked devices such as rib spreaders (also known as thoracic <b>retractors,</b> or distractors) with which surgeons may forcefully drive tissues apart to obtain the exposure. For specialized situations such as spinal surgery <b>retractors</b> have been fitted both with suction and with fiberoptic lights to keep a surgical wound dry and illuminated.|$|E
50|$|These scores {{can tell}} about the traits of the individual. Many qualifiers suggest a lack of decisiveness, use of <b>retractors</b> {{indicate}} an individual who will reconsider, use of <b>retractors</b> and negatives indicates {{a large amount of}} impulsivity, a combination of using I, me, explainers, negatives, and qualifiers, suggest anxiousness (and a less likely change of being the leader of a country), moodiness is identified by high I/we ratio, direct references, expression of feelings, and adverbial intensifiers. Other traits include an angry disposition, evidenced by high negatives, rhetorical questions, and direct references. Impulsive speakers use negatives more than any other group, controlling speakers use low qualifiers, steer the conversation, and use very few feelings. Histrionic individuals use adverbial intensifiers and exaggeration. Passivity is categorized by the extensive use of me. Domineering individuals use lots of qualifiers, <b>retractors,</b> and explainers as well as interruptions. Familiar behavior (establish report) is not surprising evidenced by the use of first names and high direct references. A resilient speaker will lose their verbal style during a crisis and then afterward resume it.|$|E
