40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux is the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> stomach <b>contents</b> {{into the}} esophagus. It is normal in the newborn {{due to an}} {{immature}} gastroesophageal sphincter. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition found in 3. 3 % of the pediatric population that occurs when the physiological barrier of the esophageal sphincter opens during a transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) period (Rinsma et al., 2016) resulting in complications like mucosal erosion, bleeding, dysphagia or failure to thrive (Quitadamo, Ummarino, Saiano, 2015). GERD in children can be directly related to late maturation of the gastroesophageal (GE) sphincter or an impaired hormonal or neurotransmitter response. A high pressure gradient surrounding the GE sphincter aides in maintaining forward flow of food and stomach content. When either {{the position of the}} sphincter or the thick mucosal lining of the GE sphincter are affected, GERD is likely to occur.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to develop new methodologies to assess upper gastro-intestinal function in health and disease. Several different technologies were studied {{in a range of}} upper gastro-intestinal diseases and adapted to try and provide more meaningful insights. The thesis has three main sections. In the first section, High Resolution Oesophageal Manometry (HRM) was used to assess unexplained upper gastro-intestinal symptoms in a group of patients referred to a tertiary centre. 46 patients were diagnosed with rumination syndrome following HRM. A retrospective review was completed of these patients case notes and HRM data. The predominant aim of this section was to identify if common mechanisms exist within rumination and its variations and to establish if the variety of presenting symptoms is due to different underlying problems or a common behavioural response to a variety of stimuli, with symptoms being dependent on the circumstance the behaviour exists in. This would support a generic biofeedback technique being useful regardless of presenting complaint. Comparing the variety of symptoms, exhibited behaviour and manometric findings, a new classification system for rumination was then developed; 1. 	Primary or “classical” rumination a. 	Increase in abdominal strain with corresponding rise in intra-gastric pressure and <b>return</b> <b>of</b> gastric <b>contents</b> to the mouth 2. 	Secondary or reflux-related rumination a. 	Reflux event causes the patient to respond with increase in intra-abdominal muscle strain and subsequent rumination 3. 	Supra-gastric belching independent of meals. a. 	Rise in intra-gastric pressure whilst a closed gastro-oesophageal junction, therefore producing rapid belching of air from the oesophagus without any <b>return</b> <b>of</b> gastric <b>contents</b> Generic biofeedback therapy was used (regardless of presenting symptoms) to control the abnormal behavioural response to symptoms. 20 / 46 patients reported full resolution of their symptoms and a further 13 / 46 reported improvement in their symptoms with this, while underlying mechanisms were targeted e. g. reflux with proton pump inhibitors, pain in functional dyspepsia. In the second main section of this thesis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is considered. GORD is currently diagnosed by 24 hour pH studies. These are often difficult for patients to tolerate and require time off medication. A more attractive method would be for diagnosis to occur {{at the same time as}} gastroscopy. A novel instrument is the EndoFLIP® device. This measures cross-sectional area (CSA) and distensibility at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) via a long catheter with a balloon at the end that straddles the GOJ. It has been hypothesised that these measurements will be increased in those with GORD, as the GOJ is more distensible, allowing more retrograde movement <b>of</b> gastric <b>contents.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this section of the thesis was to establish if GOJ CSA and distensibility differentiate between healthy volunteers (HV) and GORD patients based on i) symptoms and ii) prolonged oesophageal acid exposure. 21 HV and 18 patients with GORD (based on symptoms) had EndoFLIP® measurements and wireless pH studies to assess this. 14...|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{building}} query-oriented routing indices {{has changed the}} way of improving routing efficiency from the basis as it can learn the content distribution during the query routing process. It gradually improves routing efficiency with no excessive network overhead of the routing index construction and maintenance. However, the previously proposed mechanism is not practically effective due to the slow improvement of routing efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for queryoriented routing indices which quickly achieves high routing efficiency at low cost. The maintenance method employs reinforcement learning to utilize mass peer behaviors to construct and maintain routing indices. It explicitly uses the expected value <b>of</b> <b>returned</b> <b>content</b> number to depict the content distribution, which helps quickly approximate the real distribution. Meanwhile, the routing method is to retrieve as many contents as possible. It also helps speed up the learning process further.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{snapshot}} {{object is}} an abstraction {{of the fundamental}} problem of obtaining a consistent view <b>of</b> the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the shared memory in a distributed system while other processes may concurrently update those contents. A snapshot object stores an array of m components and can be accessed by two operations: an UPDATE that changes {{the value of an}} individual component and a powerful SCAN that <b>returns</b> the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the entire array. This paper proves time-space tradeoffs for fault-tolerant implementations of a snapshot object from registers that support only read and write operations. For anonymous implementations (where all processes are programmed identically), we prove that a SCAN requires Ω (n/r) time, where n is the number of processes in the system and r is the number of registers used by the implementation. For the general non-anonymous case, we prove that, for any fixed r, the time required to do a SCAN grows without bound as n increases. These tradeoffs hold even in the case where the snapshot object has just two components. This is the first time a lower bound on the tradeoff between time complexity and the number of registers has been proved for any problem in asynchronous shared-memory systems. We introduce a new tool for proving distributed lower bounds: the notion of a shrinkable execution, from which an adversary can remove portions as necessary...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} way Lustmord (sexual murder) {{is represented in}} popular fiction and non-fiction in the period from 1900 to 1933. During the Weimar Republic, Lustmord attained a surprising prominence in cultural life, recurring {{in a variety of}} genres and registers. The dissertation attends to popular representations of Lustmord, as well as to representations of the popular response to Lustmord’s ubiquity. It identifies certain recurring rhetorical elements, tracing similarities between fictional and non-fictional representations and from Weimar back to the fantastic fiction of the fin-de-siècle. Primary sources are drawn from true-crime newspaper articles, psychiatric and psychoanalytic reports (Theodor Lessing), fantastic fiction (Hanns Heinz Ewers and Karl Hans Strobl), detective novels (Hugo Bettauer), and film (Fritz Lang). 	In these texts, Lustmord is figured as both a disaster and as an object of lurid fascination. This ambivalence is paralleled by a seemingly intractable paradox: the killer is represented at once as an outsider beyond the pale of society and, as a figure of illicit identification and public concern, as absolutely central to it. The dissertation uses the Freudian concepts the uncanny and the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the repressed {{to come to terms with}} this paradox. The uncanny marks an unsettling moment in which what had been overcome and made other than the self returns to reveal itself as still a constituent part of the psyche. In a similar manner, the Lustmörder is continuously recalled into society in these representations by the very gestures that attempt to cast him out. 	The dissertation calls this <b>return</b> <b>of</b> unsettling <b>content</b> and unsettled form an uncanny collapse. Each chapter deals with an aspect of this uncanny collapse by linking a reading of a true-crime depiction of the late-Weimar Lustmörder Peter Kürten with a fictional representation. Fictional representations are more apt to evince a fascination with the killer than are non-fiction representations—but both share similar concerns and similar patterns of narrative or representation. What finally emerges from a consideration of all these popular representations is the idea that the public sphere of orderly life was endangered by Lustmord and its uncanny returns...|$|R

The monolayers demonstrated a TEER of 14 +/- 1 omega X cm 2 at confluence. No difference {{was seen in the}} transport of low density lipoproteins (LDL) across endothelial cell monolayers obtained from normal or Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, indicating that the LDL receptor was not involved in the LDL transport. TEER was inversely correlated with 22 Na transport (r 2 = 0. 93, P = less than 0. 001) but not with 125 I-LDL transport. The amount of LDL transported at 15 degrees C or across glutaraldehyde-fixed monolayers was half that of the controls at 37 degrees C. Preincubation of the monolayers with rabbit beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) increased cholesterol content by 65 %, and the transport of albumin and LDL doubled without a change in TEER. Removal of beta-VLDL from the culture medium resulted in the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> cellular cholesterol <b>content</b> and LDL transport to control values.
