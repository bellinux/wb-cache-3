This sector serves as a departure and arrival sector for North Atlantic JFK departures, departure and arrival sector for Long Island and southern Connecticut airports, arrival sector for White Plains airport, and an en <b>route</b> <b>sector</b> for north/south low altitude overflights. The departures are handed off by N90 (JFK and ISP areas), and the arrivals are handed off to New York TRACON (ISP area) or New York TRACON Rober arrivals. JFK arrivals overhead CCC are potentially in conflict with VFR parachute operations at Skydive Long Island which operate over the CCC VOR.

40|$|Under ideal weather conditions, each en <b>route</b> <b>sector</b> in an {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) system has a certain maximum operational traffic density that its controller team can safely handle with nominal traffic flow. We call this the design capacity of the sector. Bad weather and altered flow often reduce sector capacity by increasing controller workload. We refer to sector capacity that is reduced by such conditions as dynamic capacity. When operational conditions cause workload to exceed the capability of a sector’s controllers, air traffic managers can respond either by reducing demand or by increasing design capacity. Reducing demand can increase aircraft operating costs an...|$|E
40|$|The En-route Descent Advisor (EDA) is a {{suite of}} {{decision}} support tool (DST) capabilities for en <b>route</b> <b>sector</b> subject to metering restrictions such as those generated by the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) Traffic Management Advisor. EDA assists controllers with high-density arrival metering by providing fuel-efficient metering-conformance advisories, integrated with conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) capabilities, to minimize deviations from the user s preferred trajectory. These DST capabilities will enable controllers to change their procedures from ones that are oriented towards sector management to procedures oriented towards trajectory management. Although adaptable to current procedures and airspace structure, EDA is intended {{as a tool for}} transitioning traffic from a Free Flight environment to an efficiently organized flow into terminal airspace. This paper describes the transition airspace problem and EDA concept, defines the key benefit mechanisms that will be enabled by EDA capabilities, and presents a traffic scenario to illustrate the use of the tool...|$|E

40|$|Air {{traffic flow}} {{management}} in Europe {{has to deal}} as much with capacity constraints in en route airspace as with the more usual capacity constraints at airports. The en <b>route</b> <b>sector</b> capacity constraints, in turn, generate complex interactions among traffic flows. We present a deterministic optimization model for the European air traffic flow management (ATFM) problem. The model designs flow management strategies involving combinations of ground and airborne holding. The paper illustrates the complex nature of European (EU) ATFM solutions, the benefits that {{can be obtained by}} purposely assigning airborne holding delays to some flights, and the issues of equity that arise {{as a result of the}} interactions among traffic flows. In particular, we show that, in certain circumstances, it is better, in terms of total delay and delay cost, to assign to a flight a more expensive airborne holding delay than a ground delay. We also show that in the EU ATFM context, fundamental conflicts may often arise between the objectives of efficiency and equity (or "fairness"). This finding may have profound implications for the possibility of developing a "collaborative decision-making" environment for air traffic flow management in Europe...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{airspace}} configuration concept {{strives to}} remove today’s rigid structure of navigation aids, airways, pre-defined sectors of airspace, and special-use airspace to provide traffic managers with more flexibility to reconfigure airspace to address convective weather and meet fluctuations in user demand. The impact of increasing levels of {{air traffic management}} automation on controller workload and airspace capacity is analyzed. The automation levels represent a current operations baseline; seamless, integrated datalink operations; and automated airspace operations in which separation, merging and spacing guidance is provided for 33, 000 ft and above without human controller involvement. Denver Center traffic and airspace for a good weather day are modeled to predict the effect of increased controller productivity on airspace configuration strategies. Results indicate that integrated datalink operations enable {{the high and low}} altitude feeder sectors for Denver arrivals to be combined into a single sector for the selected traffic demand, facilitating more uninterrupted descents than possible under current operations.

The focus of this paper is on how uncertainties in the study's trajectory predictions impacted the controllers ability to perform their duties. Of particular interest is how the controllers interacted with the delay information displayed in the meter list and data block while managing the arrival flows. Due to wind forecasts with 30 -knot over-predictions and 30 -knot under-predictions, delay value computations included errors of similar magnitude, albeit in opposite directions. However, when performing their duties in the presence of these errors, did the controllers issue clearances of similar magnitude, albeit in opposite directions...|$|R
40|$|A 2012 Human-In-The-Loop {{air traffic}} control {{simulation}} investigated a gradual paradigm-shift in the allocation of functions between operators and automation. Air traffic controllers staffed five adjacent high-altitude en <b>route</b> <b>sectors,</b> and {{during the course of}} a two-week experiment, worked traffic under different function-allocation approaches aligned with four increasingly mature NextGen operational environments. These NextGen time-frames ranged from near current-day operations to nearly fully-automated control, in which the ground systems automation was responsible for detecting conflicts, issuing strategic and tactical resolutions, and alerting the controller to exceptional circumstances. Results indicate that overall performance was best in the most automated NextGen environment. Safe operations were achieved in this environment for twice todays peak airspace capacity, while being rated by the controllers as highly acceptable. However, results show that sector operations were not always safe; separation violations did in fact occur. This paper will describe in detail the simulation conducted, as well discuss important results and their implications...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a simulation {{model of the}} flight of aircraft through an en <b>route</b> <b>sector.</b> We used the model in two experiments. The first studied the effect of directional clumping on risk. The second was a full factorial design with replication, which simulated {{a large number of}} scenarios {{to assess the impact of}} key input factors on free flight risk measures. We measured risk for a given flight by the mean distance of closest approach to other aircraft and the mean number of approaches closer than a specified distance. Using analysis of variance and regression analysis, we determined the most important influences on blind collision risk. The most important factors were time of entry into the sector and number of aircraft. Also influential were certain orientations of flight paths and the distribution of airspeeds. The least important factor was altitude. The relationship between number of aircraft and the two risk measures could be quantified in regression relationships. 3 Overview The airspace over the US is congested, with a high and growing volume of traffic. In the interests of safety, the congestion is made worse by the constraint that aircraft be routed through a series of pre-established airways where they can be subject to the positive control of air traffi...|$|E
40|$|Air {{traffic is}} widely {{known as a}} complex, task-critical techno-social system, with {{numerous}} interactions between airspace, procedures, aircraft and air traffic controllers. In order to develop and deploy high-level operational concepts and automation systems scientifically and effectively, {{it is essential to}} conduct an in-depth investigation on the intrinsic traffic-human dynamics and characteristics, which is not widely seen in the literature. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-layer network to model and analyze air traffic systems. A Route-based Airspace Network (RAN) and Flight Trajectory Network (FTN) encapsulate critical physical and operational characteristics; an Integrated Flow-Driven Network (IFDN) and Interrelated Conflict-Communication Network (ICCN) are formulated to represent air traffic flow transmissions and intervention from air traffic controllers, respectively.

40|$|A {{human-in-the-loop}} simulation {{conducted in}} the Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) at NASA Ames Research Center explored the feasibility of a Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) solution to address airspace and airport capacity limitations {{in and around the}} New York metropolitan area. A week-long study explored the feasibility of a new Optimal Profile Descent (OPD) arrival into the airspace as well as a novel application of a Terminal Area Precision Scheduling and Spacing (TAPSS) enhancement to the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) arrival scheduling tool to coordinate high volume arrival traffic to intersecting runways. In the simulation, four en <b>route</b> <b>sector</b> controllers and four terminal radar approach control (TRACON) controllers managed traffic inbound to Newark International Airport's primary runway, 22 L, and its intersecting overflow runway, 11. TAPSS was used to generate independent arrival schedules for each runway and a traffic management coordinator participant adjusted the arrival schedule for each runway 11 aircraft to follow one of the 22 L aircraft. TAPSS also provided controller-managed spacing tools (slot markers with speed advisories and timelines) to assist the TRACON controllers in managing the arrivals that were descending on OPDs. Results showed that the tools significantly decreased the occurrence of runway violations (potential go-arounds) when compared with a Baseline condition with no tools. Further, the combined use of the tools with the new OPD produced a peak arrival rate of over 65 aircraft per hour using instrument flight rules (IFR), exceeding the current maximum arrival rate at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) of 52 per hour under visual flight rules (VFR). Although the participants rated the workload as relatively low and acceptable both with and without the tools, they rated the tools as reducing their workload further. Safety and coordination were rated by most participants as acceptable in both conditions, although the TRACON Runway Coordinator (TRC) rated neither as acceptable in the Baseline condition. Regarding the role of the TRC, the two TRACON controllers handling the 11 arrivals indicated that the TRC was very much needed in the Baseline condition without tools, but not needed in the condition with tools. This indicates that the tools were providing much of the sequencing and spacing information that the TRC had supplied in the Baseline condition...|$|E
