25|$|Residential towers {{were common}} {{before the advent}} of the bergfried in German-speaking countries, too; a {{precursor}} is found, for example, in the wooden tower of the motte-and-bailey castle. Donjons combine the two contrasting functions of a stately, comfortable residence and a fortification. The bergfried, however, dispenses with the keep's <b>residential</b> <b>function</b> in favour of its defensive purposes. At the same time, new forms of unfortified residential building became popular, the palas, for example, was incorporated into castle construction. The emergence of the bergfried is thus clearly related to the differentiation of living and fortification within a castle. In Western Europe however, the donjon or keep, with their combination of domestic and defensive functions, continued to be predominant {{during the course of the}} Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{structure}} in the new town's town centre is Brooke House, a 14-story residential tower block that fronts {{the west side of}} the town centre's East Square. Dating from 1962, it was designed by Sir Basil Spence and Anthony B Davies, with Ove Arup and Partners as the structural engineers. It has a 1960s Brutalist design, elevated on 8 massive V-shaped concrete pylons. The building was chosen to have a <b>residential</b> <b>function,</b> as opposed to commercial office space, to retain life in the town centre after the shops had closed. Shops were positioned to the rear of the building, with Brooke House acting as a covered forecourt. It was conceived as a structure to define Basildon's urban status and to act as marker to identify the town centre's location within a largely low-rise settlement set in a flat landscape. It was named after the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Henry Brooke MP.|$|E

While the <b>residential</b> <b>function</b> of the palace continued until the 12th century, the facilities built for grand state ceremonies began to fall into disuse by the 9th century. This was due to both the abandonment of several statutory ceremonies and procedures and the transfer of several remaining ceremonies into the smaller-scale setting of the Inner Palace.|$|E

50|$|The palace {{dates back}} to the mid sixteenth century, when the aristocratic Cicala family.

50|$|Although {{called a}} fort, Samaipata had also a religious, ceremonial, and <b>residential</b> <b>function.</b> Its {{construction}} was probably begun by the Chané, a pre-Inca people of Arawak origin. There are also ruins of an Inca plaza and residences, {{dating from the}} late 15th and early 16th centuries as the Inca empire expanded eastward from the Andes highlands into the sub-tropical foothills. Chané, Inca, and Spanish all suffered raids from Guarani (Chiriguano) warriors who also settled in the region. The Guarani conquered the plains and valleys of Santa Cruz and occupied the Samaipata area. The Guaranis dominated the region well into the Spanish colonial period.|$|E

An old wooden building in the palace complex known as [...] "Sanggar" [...] was demolished {{to make way for}} the Puri Bhakti Renatama building, and was used as a museum to store valuable artifacts, artwork and gifts from foreign emissaries.

50|$|After the {{extinction}} of religious orders in 1834, the building was incorporated into the National Treasury and used as a warehouse until it was acquired by João Maria Correia Ayres de Campos, 1st Count of Ameal. In 1895, architect Silva Pinto was hired to adapt it to its new <b>residential</b> <b>function</b> using a neoclassical revivalist design, but most of its significant original features, including its cloister, several of its vaulted late-Gothic interiors and its Renaissance-style portico, were maintained. The latter, which included a significant sculpture group {{in the style of}} João de Ruão, figured in the Count's bookplate, designed around 1900. Ayres de Campos famously used the complex to display his vast art collection and to house his library, both of which were among the most important in Portugal at the time.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also called}} a bergried. It {{is a well}} {{preserved}} stone object with a floor plan of square of side 8m. The tower {{is one of the}} oldest parts of the castle, dated to the period of emergence of the object at the beginning of the 14th century. Originally, it was a 5-storey building with wooden beam floors connected with the wooden ladders. The entrance was located at second floor level through the gothic pointed-arch shaped portal accessible through the small wooden bridge. On the bottom floor is located circular entrance to the 8 meters deep prison cell. The tower was primarily conceived as a guard and a defensive tower. This fact is proven by the location of the entrance on the second floor and also by the low number of small windows. A <b>residential</b> <b>function</b> was provided by small building in the courtyard.|$|E
50|$|The town lies {{mostly in}} the Messeler Hügelland, {{a part of the}} Lower Main Plain with gentle hills. Differences in {{elevation}} are slight, reaching from about 130 m above sea level on the Rodau riverside flats east of Ober-Roden up to about 200 m above sea level on the Bulau. Rödermark is surrounded by greenbelts, found mainly {{in the area of the}} river Rodau. The Rodau crosses the municipal area from west to east. The northern areas of Bulau, Messenhausen and Waldacker have a mainly <b>residential</b> <b>function,</b> whereas the main centres of Ober-Roden and Urberach offer a complete infrastructure. The nearest Autobahn interchanges are ten kilometres away, and Frankfurt Airport some 25 km away. Rödermark lies within the area covered by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund, and on the grounds of Ober-Roden railway station’s favourable location, it is the terminus of Rhine-Main S-Bahn line S1 and a station on RMV line 61.|$|E

The large site is formed into a raised and terraced urban garden, with the transit centre and retail shopping precinct housed below this landscaped roof. Towering above this ‘hill’ are five building blocks housing the commercial and residential accommodations. These environmentally low-impact buildings are topped with a high-tech greenhouse roof or photovoltaic cells...|$|R

5000|$|The Leverett Towers (commonly {{referred}} to as F- and G-Tower since the entryways in McKinlock span A-E), on the other hand, serve a primarily <b>residential</b> <b>function.</b> Each tower consists primarily of singles and doubles and holds approximately 150 students. The top floors of the towers - especially those facing south - boast outstanding views of the Boston skyline and the Charles River for the students lucky enough to live there. The ground floor of G-Tower features a common area that house residents have nicknamed the [...] "G-spot," [...] although the space goes largely unused due to its poor design. The ground floor of F-tower includes class and meeting spaces {{as well as several}} house offices. Between the towers and McKinlock sits the Leverett Library, which was constructed along with the towers and has won awards for its innovative design. The ground floor of the library building houses the superintendent's office.|$|E
50|$|For a long time, {{the castle}} lost its <b>residential</b> <b>function,</b> {{with only the}} family of Cossé-Brissac using it on rare occasions. However, François de Cossé died in the castle in 1651 and his body was buried within the grounds. During the 17th and the 18th centuries, some rooms were still inhabitable, since several people were {{mentioned}} as residing inside: a gardener in 1620, a lieutenant of bailliage died there in 1671, and an officer dwelled there between 1756 and 1767. A tax office was situated in a lower room of the castle {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century. However, many of the officers in charge of the administration of the seigneury were living outside of the walled city of Pouancé, inside their own residences. As early as 1541, the ancient ramparts were partially in disrepair and largely abandoned. During the 18th century, inhabitants of Pouancé were allowed to use the stone for their houses if they owned them.|$|E
