Operation with inert gas in the fuel reactor showed that the material released significant amounts of gas-phase oxygen, indicating CLOU properties. Stable operation with fuel was performed during 29 hours with performance superior to previously tested oxygen carriers like ilmenite. A slight deterioration of the conversion was detected during the experiments, which {{can be attributed to}} the accumulation of sulphur in the oxygen carrier.

The desulfurization test from a gas containing 100 vol % H 2 S was carried out over attapulgite supported Fe 2 O 3 in a fixed-bed system at atmospheric pressure and room. The effects of the chemical nature of Fe 2 O 3 on desulfurization capacity were studied. Materials {{before and after the}} desulfurization test were characterized using FTIR and XRD.

40|$|The {{viability}} of base-treated juniper fiber (BTJF) media for removing toxic heavy metals (Cd 2 +, Cu 2 -, Pb 2 +, Zn 2 +) in stormwater runoff was investigated. The sorption {{ability of the}} BTJF for all metals was much {{higher than that of}} untreated juniper. The affinity sequence of both materials, BTJF and untreated juniper, was Pb> Cu> Zn≥ Cd. This order is explained by the hydrolysis constants for each metal. A metal desorption and column <b>regeneration</b> <b>test</b> using 0. 1 M nitric acid showed that the metal sorption capacity declined slightly from 136. 3 to 119. 2 μmole/g in the first two cycles and then more significantly at the third and fourth regeneration, 72. 3 and 83. 1 μmole/g, respectively. Based on the hydraulic conductivity test of BTJF of different size classes, it can be deduced that there is no major headloss-related disadvantage in using BTJF instead of sand as stormwater filter media if the particle size of the BTJF is similar to that for sand...|$|E

The reduction/sulfidation tests examined {{the behavior of}} six cerium oxide sorbents from different sources with reaction variables of temperature, pressure, gas composition and flow rate. Most significantly, steam {{was added to the}} sulfidation feed gas for the first time.

Prebreakthrough H{sub 2 }S concentrations less than 10 ppmv were obtained over a range of reaction conditions with prebreakthrough concentrations as low as 1 ppmv achieved at the most favorable conditions. The general response to reaction variables was as expected except when feed rate was varied. In some of these cases the FPD breakthrough time did not correspond to expectation.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) {{have been reported}} to be responsible for many acute and chronic health effects and environmental degradations. In this study, coconut shell based porous carbon was produced through chemical activation with potassium hydroxide (PHAC) and chemically treated with ammonia (PHAC-AM) to improve the adsorption of benzene and toluene. The porous carbons were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption tests. Removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities of the activated carbon samples for benzene and toluene were carried out through batch studies. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms were tested for the adsorption process and the experimental data were best fitted by Langmuir model. Pseudo-second-order kinetic model best described the adsorption kinetics for the two VOCs on PHAC and PHAC-AM. The removal of benzene and toluene by PHAC are; 82. 5 and 85. 6 %, while that of PHAC-AM are; 91 and 92. 3 % respectively with approximately 10 % increase in the uptake after the ammonia treatment.

40|$|Hot gas {{particulate}} filtration is a {{basic component}} in advanced power generation systems such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC). These systems require effective particulate removal to protect the downstream gas turbine and also to meet environmental emission requirements. The ceramic barrier filter {{is one of the}} options for hot gas filtration. Hot gases flow through ceramic candle filters leaving ash deposited on the outer surface of the filter. A process known as surface regeneration removes the deposited ash periodically by using a high pressure back pulse cleaning jet. After this cleaning process has been done there may be some residual ash on the filter surface. This residual ash may grow and this may lead to mechanical failure of the filter. A High Temperature Test Facility (HTTF) was built to investigate the ash characteristics during surface regeneration at high temperatures. The system is capable of conducting surface <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> of a single candle filter at temperatures up to 1500 F. Details of the HTTF apparatus as well as some preliminary test results are presented in this paper. In order to obtain sequential digital images of ash particle distribution during the surface regeneration process, a high resolution, high speed image acquisition system was integrated into the HTTF system. The regeneration pressure and the transient pressure difference between the inside of the candle filter and the chamber during regeneration were measured using a high speed PC data acquisition system.

Both catalysts were prepared by impregnation of Co and Mo onto ZnO or ZnO-AZ powder then followed by calcination at 400 °C for 5 h under N 2 stream. The BET method and pyridine adsorption {{were used for}} catalysts characterization. The study of activation, deactivation, and regeneration of catalysts were conducted by using steam reforming method in the semi flow reactor.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate the regeneration of trichloroethylene (TCE) spent activated carbon using persulfate oxidation and iron activated persulfate (IAP) oxidation. Both processes resulted in decreases in the adsorbability of regenerated activated carbons. IAP was shown to rapidly degrade the aqueous TCE and causes a significant mineralization of the TCE. The release of chloride ions provided evidence of this. Persulfate oxidation mainly resulted in desorption of TCE from the activated carbon and only partial mineralization of the TCE through a carbon activated persulfate reaction mechanism. Concerning destruction of the TCE, in the <b>regeneration</b> <b>test</b> using persulfate, 30 % of the original TCE was present in the solution and 9 % remained on the activated carbon after the first regeneration cycle. In contrast, in the test that used IAP, it was observed that no TCE was present in the solution and only approximately 5 % of the original TCE remained on the activated carbon after the first regeneration. Following the regeneration cycles, elemental analysis was carried out on the samples BET surface area and EDS analysis showed some effects on the physico-chemical properties of the activated carbon such as a slight decrease in the surface area and the presence of iron precipitates on the carbon.

The aim was {{to determine whether or not}} implants associated with GBR due to peri-implant defects show the same survival and success rates as implants placed in native bone without defects. Material and Methods: Patients with a minimum of two submerged dental implants: one suffering a dehiscence or fenestration defect during placement and undergoing simultaneous guided bone <b>regeneration</b> (<b>test</b> group), versus the other entirely surrounded by bone (control group) were treated and monitored annually for three years. Complications with the healing procedure, implant survival, implant success and peri-implant marginal bone loss were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric tests setting an alpha value of 0. 05. Results: Seventy-two patients and 326 implants were included (142 test, 184 control). One hundred and twenty-five dehiscences (average height 1. 92 ± 1. 11) and 18 fenestrations (average height 3. 34 ± 2. 16) were treated. At 3 years post-loading, implant survival rates were 95. 7 % (test) and 97. 3 % (control) and implant success rates were 93. 6 % and 96. 2 %, respectively. Mean marginal bone loss was 0. 54 (SD 0. 26 mm) for the test group and 0. 43 (SD 0. 22 mm) for the control group. No statistically significant differences between both groups were found.

40|$|Crambe abyssinica is a {{dedicated}} oilseed crop suitable for production of industrial feedstocks. Genetic modification of crambe has progressed substantially {{in the last}} few years, but the transformation efficiency needs to be further improved. Meanwhile, developing a reliable molecular system including Southern blot and qRT-PCR analyses is desired for effectively evaluating transgenic lines and gene expression levels of both endogenous and transgenes. In this study, we have developed an efficient transformation protocol with hygromycin as the selective agent for crambe transformation. In the <b>regeneration</b> <b>test,</b> addition of hygromycin at concentration of 5 mg L- 1 resulted in 18 % of shoot regeneration using crambe hypocotyls as explants, while no regeneration occurred when the hygromycin concentration reached 10 mg L- 1. Based on this result, the hygromycin concentration up to 10 mg L- 1 was used in the subsequent transformations. The results showed that the transformation efficiency under constant low selection pressure (H 3 -H 3) was similar to that under higher selection pressure first followed by transfer to lower selection pressure (H 10 -H 3). The PCR, Southern blot and fatty acid composition analyses confirmed the integration of transgenes in the crambe genome. We have also optimised the Southern and qRT-PCR methods for future studies on crambe or related species. For Southern blot analysis on crambe, more than 50 &# 181;g DNA is required for a clear band.

40|$|Experimental effort {{during the}} past quarter was {{restricted}} to the fixed-bed reactor. Effort during April was devoted to the sulfidation and regeneration of cerium oxide. Sulfidation tests were plagued by over-sulfidation, i. e., the quantity of H{sub 2 }S removed from the gas phase exceeded the stoichiometric amount associated with the conversion of CeO{sub 2 } to Ce{sub 2 }O{sub 2 }S. This was initially attributed {{to the formation of}} Ce{sub 2 }S{sub 3 } which was found to be thermodynamically possible in the highly reducing feed gas. However, the addition of steam to the feed gas to prevent Ce{sub 2 }S{sub 3 } formation did not eliminate the over-sulfidation problem. Later tests indicated that the apparent over-sulfidation was due to reaction between H{sub 2 }S and the walls of the reaction vessel. Apparently the alonizing treatment to passivate the reactor walls was either ineffective at the reaction conditions or had deteriorated with use to the point that protection was no longer viable. Limited Ce{sub 2 }O{sub 2 }S regeneration results, although very qualitative, were quite favorable. In one <b>regeneration</b> <b>test</b> in an O{sub 2 }-N{sub 2 } atmosphere, no SO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }S were detected by the chromatograph in the regeneration product. Significant amounts of total sulfur were detected, and the test had to be terminated prematurely when elemental sulfur caused the product line leading to the chromatograph to plug. Experimental tests during May and June examined the regeneration of FeS as a function of temperature, gas feed composition, and gas flow rate. Complete regeneration was achieved with as much as 75 % of the sulfur liberated in elemental form. Low regeneration temperature and large ratios of H{sub 2 }O to O{sub 2 } in the feed gas promote the formation of elemental sulfur.

40|$|The {{development}} of a shape optimization solver using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes is taken up as topic of research in this thesis. A shape optimizer was initially developed based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) coupled with a CFD solver in an earlier work. The existing CFD solver is based on Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting and uses least squares discretization. This solver requires a cloud of points and their connectivity set, hence this CFD solver is a meshless solver. The advantage of a meshless solver is utilised in avoiding re-gridding (only connectivity regeneration is required) after each shape change by the shape optimizer. The CFD solver is within the optimization loop, hence evaluation of CFD solver after each shape change is mandatory. Although the earlier shape optimizer developed {{was found to be}} robust, but it was taking enoromous amount of time to converge to the optimum solution (details in Appendix). Hence a new evolving method, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), is implemented to replace GA. A shape optimizer is developed coupling ACO and the meshless CFD solver. To the best of the knowledge of the present author, {{this is the first time}} when ACO is implemented for aerodynamic shape optimization problems. Hence, an exhaustive validation has become mandatory. Various test cases such as regeneration problems of (1) subsonic - supersonic nozzle with a shock in quasi - one dimensional flow (2) subsonic - supersonic nozzle in a 2 -dimensional flow field (3) NACA 0012 airfoil in 2 -dimensional flow and (4) NACA 4412 airfoil in 2 -dimensional flow have been successfully demonstrated. A comparative study between GA and ACO at algorithm level is performed using the travelling salesman problem (TSP). A comparative study between the two shape optimizers developed, i. e., GA-CFD and ACO-CFD is carried out using <b>regeneration</b> <b>test</b> case of NACA 4412 airfoil in 2 -dimensional flow. GA-CFD performs better in the initial phase of optimization and ACO-CFD performs better in the later stage. We have combined both the approaches to develop a hybrid GA-ACO-CFD solver such that the advantages of both GA-CFD and ACO-CFD are retained with the hybrid method. This hybrid approach has 2 stages, namely, (Stage 1) initial optimum search by GA-CFD (coarse search), the best members from the optimized solution from GA-CFD are segregated to form the input for the ﬁne search by ACO-CFD and (Stage 2) final optimum search by ACO-CFD (fine search). It is observed that this hybrid method performs better than either GA-CFD or ACO- CFD,	i. e., hybrid method attains better optimum in less number of CFD calls. This hybrid method is applied to the following test cases: (1) regeneration of subsonic-supersonic nozzle with shock in quasi 1 -D flow and (2) regeneration of NACA 4412 airfoil in 2 -dimensional flow. Two applications on shape optimization, namely, (1) shape optimization of a body in strongly rotating viscous flow and (2) shape optimization of a body in supersonic flow such that it enhances separation of binary species, have been successfully demonstrated using the hybrid GA-ACO-CFD method. A KFVS based binary diffusion solver was developed and validated for this purpose. This hybrid method is now in a state where industrial shape optimization applications can be handled confidently...|$|E

Variações alélicas também são conhecidas para genes CrtR-b e PSY 1. white flower (wf) é o alelo de CrtR-b que produz pétalas brancas e yellow flesh (r) é o alelo de PSY 1 que produz frutos amarelos. Os alelos wf e Rg 1 com r foram introgredidos na cultivar Micro-Tom (Solanum lycopersicum L). Através da transferência sequencial de explantes de SIM para MB e de RIM para SIM, verificou-se que MT-Rg 1 reduz o tempo necessário para a indução de gemas em um dia (6 dias em SIM para MT), devido a redução no tempo necessário para a aquisição de competência em um dia (2 dias para MT). Foram obtidos 30 possiveis recombinantes advindos do cruzamento Rg 1 /rg 1 Wf/wf x rg 1 /rg 1 wf/wf, baseados nas características de pétala branca (efeito do alelo wf) e maior ramificação (efeito do alelo Rg 1). Todos os possíveis recombinantes foram testados in vitro quanto à capacidade de formar gemas caulinares em SIM e raízes em RIM. Com isso, 7 linhagens recombinantes foram confirmadas e utilizadas para o mapeamento fino da região na qual o gene RG 1 está localizado no cromossomo 3. Para o mapeamento foram testados marcadores do tipo CAPS e SCAR, sendo utilizado o DNA genômico extraído de S. pennellii, S. peruvianum, Micro- MsK, MT, MT-Rg 1, MT-wf e das 7 linhagens recombinantes, constatando-se que alguns marcadores moleculares desenhados para S. pennellii podem ser utilizados para S. peruvianum. Estas análises também evidenciaram que o segmento de introgressão de MT-Rg 1 está entre o marcador P 5 e o gene CrtR-b, totalizando 136 genes, entre os quais GRAS 10 destacou-se como principal candidato para a função gênica de Rg 1. Complementarmente, foi realizada a análise de RNA-Seq (plataforma SOLiD) para a identificação de genes diferencialmente expressos entre MT e MT-Rg 1. Com isso, observou-se que existem mais genes regulados negativamente do que positivamente durante a aquisição de competência. Devido ao grande número de genes diferencialmente expressos, alguns parâmetros foram utilizados para classificar os genes que poderiam ser quantificados por qRT-PCR em um experimento de regeneração in vitro. Entre os 361 genes classificados, 5 foram selecionados para a quantificação de sua expressão. Destes 5 genes, GRAS 10 e Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 7 foram os que apresentaram-se mais positivamente expressos e aparentemente são os que estão mais intimamente ligados a fase de aquisição de competência. Como existem muitos genes GRAS, foi feita uma árvore filogenética para posicioná-lo e identificar genes homólogos a ele. Com base na análise filogenética foi possível identificar o gene GRAS 10 como homológo ao gene SCL 8 já identificado em Arabidopsis. Porém, pouco se sabe a respeito de SCL 8. Desse modo, ainda é necessário confirmar a identidade do gene RG 1, o que possibilitará a compreensão do processo de aquisição de competência. The dominat allele Rg 1 {{is related to}} the greater in vitro regeneration capacity of Solanum peruvianum L. The Rg 1 gene is required for shoot formation from roots and others explants and was mapped on chromosome 3 between BETA-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE (CrtR-b) and PHYTOENE SYNTHASE (PSY 1) genes. Allelic variants are also known for the genes CrtR-b and PSY 1. white flower (wf) is the allele of CrtR-b that produces white petals and yellow flesh (r) is the allele of PSY 1 that produces yellow fruits. The alleles wf and Rg 1 with r were introgressed into the Micro-Tom cultivar (Solanum lycopersicum L). Through the sequential transfer of explants from SIM to BM and RIM to SIM, we found that MT-Rg 1 reduces the time required for the induction of shoots in one day (6 days on SIM for MT), due the reduction of the time required for competence acquisition in one day (2 days to MT). It was obtained 30 putative recombinants from crossing Rg 1 /rg 1 Wf/wf x rg 1 /rg 1 wf/wf. The recombinant lines were scored based on the presence of white petals (wf alleleś effect) and increased shoot branching (Rg 1 alleleś effect). All putative recombinant lines were tested in vitro for their capability to form shoots in SIM and roots in RIM. Thus, 7 recombinant lines were selected and used to fine mapping the region where RG 1 gene is located. CAPS and SCAR markers designed to S. pennellii were tested to fine-mapping, using as template genomic DNA samples from S. pennellii, S. peruvianum, Micro-MsK, MT, MT-Rg 1, MT-wf and the 7 recombinant lines. These results confirmed that the molecular markers designed for S. pennellii can be successfully used for S. peruvianum. These analyzes also suggest that the introgressed segment of MT-Rg 1 is located between the P 5 marker and the CrtR-b gene. Within this region, there are 136 genes, including the GRAS 10 gene whichis the main candidate to RG 1 gene function. In addition, we performed RNA-Seq analysis (SOLiD platform) to identify genes differentially expressed in MT and MT-Rg 1. It was observed more down-regulated than up-regulated genes in the competence acquisition stage. Due to the large number of differentially expressed genes, some parameters were used for selection of genes that would have their expression validated by qRT-PCR in an in vitro <b>regeneration</b> <b>test.</b> Five genes among 361 genes differentialy expressed were selected to test their expression. Of these 5 genes, GRAS 10 and Serine / threonine protein phosphatase 7 were the most up-regulate genes and showed to be closely related to the stage of competence acquisition. Since there are many GRAS genes, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to identify homologous genes. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, GRAS 10 was identified as homologous to SCL 8, a gene already identified in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about SCL 8. Thus, it is still necessary to confirm the RG 1 gene identity. This approach will provide a better understanding of competence acquisition process...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of diesel particulate filters wash-coated with highly dispersed nano-metric ceria particles for continuous regeneration has been investigated. To this end, catalytic filters were prepared, soot-loaded (avoiding {{the formation of}} the cake layer), and regenerated—under isothermal conditions—at temperature ranging from 200 – 600 °C. Results have shown that catalytic oxidation of soot starts from 300 °C and, at all temperatures, the selectivity to CO 2 is higher than 99 %. 475 °C is the minimum temperature at which the filter is regenerated via catalytic path. At this temperature, the catalytic filter maintains substantially the same performance over repeated cycles of soot loading and regeneration, indicating that the thermal stability of ceria is preserved. This has been further confirmed by comparison between the outcomes obtained from characterization (X-ray powder diffraction, N 2 adsorption at 77 K, Hg intrusion porosimetry, and scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray analysis) of fresh filter and filter subjected to repeated <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of various Ca-based sorbent materials in pelletized form with H 2 S or CO 2 was investigated at high temperatures (750 [...] 880 °C). An extensive {{study was conducted}} to compare the performance of sorbent pellets derived from plaster of Paris and limestone. Multicycle absorption and <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> showed that plaster-based pellets out performed the limestone-based pellets primarily due to a higher surface area and mesoporosity.;The effect of pore-modifiers on the {{reactivity of}} limestone with H 2 S was investigated by incorporating additives such as cornstarch, graphite and polyvinylalcohol (PVA) in the sorbent. Multicycle sulfidation and <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> of the modified sorbent showed that starch did not improve the reactivity of the limestone, graphite reduced the reactivity, while PVA improved it.;The effect of the chemical additives MgO and SrO on the performance of CaO-based sorbent pellets was investigated. The effect of MgO was tested by starting with materials that contained MgCO 3 in a natural form, such as dolomite. The effect of SrO was tested by starting with SrCO 3 either co-precipitated with CaCO 3 or by wet-mixing SrCO 3 with limestone in slurry form. The MgO was found to improve the thermal stability of the CaO-based sorbent but lowered the overall absorption capacity of the material when reacted with CO 2 or H 2 S, while SrO decreased the thermal stability of the sorbent when it was reacted with CO 2; no absorption tests were run with H 2 S.;A study of the performance of pelletized CaO-based cores coated with a refractory material such as alumina and limestone or alumina and kaolin was conducted. The reactivity of the core and shell pellets with H 2 S was determined. The strength and durability of the pellets were determined by using crushing strength analysis and abrasion resistance tests. Pellets coated with either alumina and limestone or alumina and kaolin proved to be strong and adequate for use in industrial reactors.;A semi-empirical mathematical model was developed to represent the reaction of H 2 S with a sorbent pellet. The model was based on the well-known shrinking core model and it was applied successfully for the analysis of both pellet cores and core and shell pellets reacting with H 2 S...|$|R
40|$|Mixed {{manganese}} oxide sorbents {{have been investigated}} for high-temperature removal of hydrogen sulfide (the primary sulfur bearing compound) from hot coal gases. The sorbents were screened by thermodynamic equilibrium considerations for sulfidation. Preliminary experimental work using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated titania to be a superior substrate than alumina. Four formulations showing superior reactivity in a TGA were then tested in an ambient pressure fixed-bed reactor to determine steady state H 2 S concentrations, breakthrough times and effectiveness of the sorbent when subjected to cyclic sulfidation and <b>regeneration</b> <b>testing.</b> Eight tests were conducted with each test consisting of five cycles of sulfidation and regeneration. Sulfidation occurred at 600 o C using a simulated coal gas at an empty-bed space velocity of approximately 12, 000 per hour. Manganese-based sorbents with molar ratios > 1 : 1 Mn:Substrate were effective in reducing the H 2 S concentration in simulated coal gases to less than 100 ppmv over five cycles. Actual breakthrough time for formulation C 6 - 2 - 1100 was as high as 73 % of breakthrough time based on wt% Mn in sorbent at 600 o C. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> determined that loaded pellets can be essentially completely regenerated in an air/steam mixture at 750 o C with minimal sulfate formation. The leading formulation (designated C 6 - 2) from the fixed-bed tests was then further tested under varying sorbent induration temperature, sulfidation temperature and superficial gas velocity. Four tests were conducted with each test consisting of four cycles of sulfidation and regeneration. Results showed that the induration temperature of the sorbent and the reaction temperature greatly affected the H 2 S removal capacity of the sorbent while the superficial gas velocity between 1090 and 1635 cm/min had minimal affect on the sorbent's breakthrough capacity. Testing showed that the sorbent's strength was a strong function of the sorbent induration temperature. Sorbent also showed 30 to 53 % loss of its strength over four cycles of sulfidation and regeneration. The former being sorbent indurated at 1115 o C and the prior being sorbent indurated at 1100 o C. A mathematical model was developed to describe the reaction of H 2 S with the mixed metal oxide in a fixed-bed reactor, where the individual pellets react according to the shrinking core model. The effective diffusivity within a single pellet was estimated by adjusting its value until a good match between the experimental and model H 2 S breakthrough curves was obtained.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} our work was to {{evaluate}} separately the absorption and regeneration performances {{of different types of}} amine(s) based solvents (primary, secondary and tertiary alkanolamines, sterically hindered amines, non-cyclical tetramine and cyclical absorption activators) by carrying out screening tests using small scale apparatus: a gas-liquid contactor for absorption, namely a double-stirred cell, and a regeneration cell. Absorption and regeneration performances of the solvents were compared thanks to calculated absorption and regeneration efficiencies. Concerning the absorption results, the positive effect of an activator, and especially the cyclical di-amine piperazine (PZ), on the absorption performances of the different simple amine solutions was clearly highlighted. The activation of the secondary amine MMEA by PZ gives also higher absorption efficiencies. Regarding the <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests,</b> the better <b>regeneration</b> performances of tertiary and sterically hindered amines(MDEA and AMP) were confirmed. For the amines blends, higher regeneration performances were observed with PZ activated solutions than with PIP activated solutions. These absorption and regeneration results will be taken into account in the solvent selection for future combined absorption-regeneration tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} work and economic analyses {{required for a}} preliminary evaluation of EIC's Copper Sulfate Process {{for a range of}} geothermal steam conditions have been completed. A series of six scrubbing runs was carried out over a range of steam conditions and scrub solution compositions expected to represent the extremes likely to be encountered in practice and high degrees of H{sub 2 }S removal were obtained in all cases. Solids produced in these runs were subjected to liquid-solid separation and <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> to determine the influence of scrubbing conditions on the kinetics of subsequent steps, and capital and operating cost estimates were developed for the extremes of conditions evaluated. Test results show, as expected, that the kinetics and stoichiometry of the scrubbing reactions are complex: the rates and extent of the primary and secondary reactions are functions of scrubber operating temperature (pressure), scrub solution pH and copper content, and solids residence time. Relative to The Geysers' average conditions, operation at higher pressures leads to increased H{sub 2 }S and decreased NH{sub 3 } removal efficiencies. At lower pressures, higher pH's and/or copper contents or longer vapor-liquid contact times are required to obtain comparable H{sub 2 }S removal efficiencies, while NH{sub 3 } removal efficiencies are improved at comparable pH's. The solids obtained from each scrubbing run were produced under a range of conditions since scrub solution compositions were varied, as was solids residence time throughout. Within the range of variables tested, the trend is toward improved liquid-solid separation behavior for solids produced at higher pressures. Even though the range of compression times varied by a factor of two, the solids produced at the lowest pressures still settled rapidly enough and with sufficient overflow clarity to indicate that simple decantation would be the optimum approach for this step. The results of <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> on these solids were much more variable, however, showing a definite correlation between scrubbing conditions and regeneration kinetics: solids produced at lower pressures were more readily regenerated than those produced at higher pressures. While complete regeneration was obtained in all cases, the times required varied by a factor of five at equal reaction temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. We believe that both liquid-solid separation and regeneration kinetics are determined {{by the nature of the}} solids formed in the scrubber, particularly the specific surface or average particle size, as well as their chemical composition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the absorption-regeneration performances {{of different types of}} amine(s) based solvents (primary, secondary and tertiary alkanolamines, sterically hindered amines, non-cyclical tetramine and cyclical absorption activators), previously selected thanks to a methodological study and separate laboratory absorption and <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests.</b> In this work absorption-regeneration experiments were carried out using a newly developed CO 2 capture laboratory micro-pilot and applying a high gaseous CO 2 content (from 20 % to 30 %) representative of cement plant flue gases. The different experiments allowed us to compare a large number of solvents (simples and blends) by weighing absorption and regeneration performances measured in our plant. The positive effect of an activator (especially the cyclical di-amine piperazine, from 5 to 10 %) on the absorption-regeneration performances of the different solutions (especially on the sterically hindered amine 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol and on the secondary amines diethanolamine and methylmonoethanolamine, 30 % solutions) was clearly highlighted.

40|$|Wastewater {{effluents}} from {{textile industry}} mainly contain dyes {{used in the}} dyeing or printing of textiles yarns or fabrics. A lot of technologies can be adopted for dye removal from wastewaters, including biological treatments based on activated sludge, adsorption on activated carbon, or membrane processes. Nevertheless, none of these methods is performing toward all classes of dyes; treatment plants of great dimensions and difficult handling can be required, while cost can be prohibitive. In the present study, dye adsorption was performed on low cost fibrous cellulose materials, submitted to a cationization process using a quaternary ammonium reagent. These materials were characterized by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, while the treatment efficiency was investigated through exhaustion and kinetic adsorption tests toward anionic dyes, such as acid, direct, reactive, and a cationic dye. Comparisons were carried out between treated and untreated samples, and with activated carbon. Best results were obtained with cationized cotton, both in linters or ‘‘tulle'' fabric form, showing good performance toward all the investigated dyes. Tests in continuous flow confirmed the good behavior of these materials, but tulle fabric was better as filtration medium for a lower pressure drop.

The research was carried out in continuous system. The characteristics of graded clinoptilolite from Semnan (one of the central provinces in Iran) mines were determined and then <b>regeneration</b> <b>tests</b> were done by contacting of 1 N NaCl solution with given weights of ammonium saturated zeolite. Then the brine of column was transferred to the air stripping column for regeneration. The pH of brine solution before entrance to a stripping column was increased to 11.

The results showed that the cation exchange capacities were 17. 31 to 18. 38 mg NH 4 +/g of zeolite weight. Regeneration efficiency of zeolite by NaCl solution and air stripping was in the range of 92 %- 97 % under various operational conditions. However, the efficiency of acid absorption of released ammonia in stripping process was 55 % with a major rejection of the surplus ammonia to the atmosphere.
