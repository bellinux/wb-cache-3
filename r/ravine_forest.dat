40|$|This paper {{deal with}} the coenological {{features}} and the distributional pattern of the broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> in southern Europe (Apennine-Balkan biogeographical province). The initial data set of 2189 relevés was stratified geographically and phytosociologically; 614 relevés remaining after stratification were classified with a TWINSPAN and cluster analysis, wich resulted in four clusters and eight subclusters. Average Pignatti indicator values for relevés of each subcluster were subjected to PCA to show ecological relationships among the clusters. The spectra of geoelements and sociological species groups of individual subclusters were calculated to show phytogeographical and sociological relationships between them. The diagnostic species combination was calculated by a fidelity measure (?-coefficient) and presented in a synoptic table. The results {{have shown that the}} broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> in southeastern Europe form a separate group within the European broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests.</b> They are well differentiated by the species with a southeast European distribution, as well as by many other species that reflect their different ecological affinities. The phytosociological and phytogeographical relationships between the Apennines and the Balkan peninsula that have already been recognized for other vegetation types have been confirmed for broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests.</b> According to the numerical analysis, two suballiances of broad-leaved <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> in southeastern Europe are proposed, both belonging to the alliance Tilio-Acerion: an amphi-Adriatic xerothermophilous suballiance Ostryo-Tilienion platyphylli suball. nova and a mesophilous suballiance Lamio orvalae-Acerenion suball. nova, the latter appearing only on the Balkan Peninsula...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the forest {{vegetation}} of {{the lower part of}} the dolines in Mecsek Mts. (South Hungary). In order to char acterize this vegetation type, samples were compared to the 6 plant communities occurring in the neighbourhood of the dolines. Considering the vegetation texture and species com position, the vegetation of the dolines resembles mainly the extrazonal beechwoods (Helleboro odori-fagetum) and local <b>ravine</b> <b>forests</b> (Scutellario altissimae-Aceretum) that preserve several mountain, subatlantic relict species in this area. Our study revealed that the plant communities characteristic of the karst surface of Western Mecsek are arranged along a moisture and nutrient gradient. In this system, the habitat conditions of the dolines are similar to those of the beech forests and the lo cal <b>ravine</b> <b>forests,</b> fresh and relatively rich in nutrients. In the karst, dominated by oak-hornbeam and beech forests, effects of the thermal inversion are the most spectacular where beech forests follow turkey oak-sessile oak forests and oak-hornbeam forests on {{the lower part of the}} doline slopes.

40|$|The article {{shows the}} results of {{agroforestry}} mapping of a Dobrinka basin catchment, which {{is located in the}} Volgograd region. The mapping is {{made on the basis of}} a high-resolution space images interpretation. Dobrinka river is the left inflow of the Medveditsa river, it belongs to the basin of Don. The length of the river makes about 36 km, the area of a catchment basin – 455, 3 km 2. The author applies the method of isoline mapping of woodiness, which allows receiving the average background surface transferring the largest regularities of spatial placement of forest plantings within a catchment. The author evaluates the features of spatial localization of natural and artificial plantings in the borders of Dobrinka catchment according to the isolinear maps of woodiness. The author establishes that there are two areas with the maximum values of natural woodiness within Dobrinka catchment, which are located in the floodplain forest of estuarial part of the basin and in <b>ravine</b> <b>forest</b> of upper part of Dobrinka river. The artificial woodiness within the whole catchment is very low and does not exceed 5 %. The existence in the central part of the catchment of an area with low indicators of natural and artificial woodiness contributes to the necessary development of the agroforestry arrangement project for this part of a basin catchment. The presented technique allows conducting the preliminary estimate of agroforestry arrangement of the catchments territory without financial expenses on reconnaissance...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{heterogeneity}} of tropical forest epiphytes {{has rarely been}} quantified in terms of biomass. In particular, the effect of topographic variation on epiphyte biomass is poorly known, although forests on ridges and ravines can differ drastically in stature and exposure. In an Ecuadorian lower montane forest we quantified epiphytic biomass along two gradients: (1) the twig-branch-trunk trajectory, and (2) the ridge-ravine gradient. Twenty-one trees were sampled in each of three forest types (ridge, slope, ravine positions). Their epiphytic biomass was extrapolated to stand level based on basal area-epiphyte load relationships, with tree basal areas taken from six plots of 400 m 2 each per forest type. Our results document the successional addition and partial replacement of lichens by bryophytes, angiosperms and finally dead organic matter along the twig-branch-trunk trajectory. Despite having the highest tree basal area, total epiphytic biomass (mean ± SD) of <b>ravine</b> <b>forest</b> was significantly lower (2. 6 ± 0. 7 Mg ha - 1) than in mid-slope forest (6. 3 ± 1. 1 Mg ha - 1) and ridge forest (4. 4 ± 1. 6 Mg ha - 1), whereas maximum bryophyte water storage capacity was significantly higher. We attribute this pattern to differences in forest dynamics, stand structure and microclimate. Although our study could not differentiate between direct effects of slope position (nutrient availability, mesoclimate) and indirect effects (stand structure and dynamics), it provides evidence that fine-scale topography {{needs to be taken}} into account when extrapolating epiphytic biomass and related matter fluxes from stand-level data to the regional scale. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011...|$|E
40|$|Southern Mali mainly {{belongs to}} the Sudanian savanna {{bioclimatic}} zone, but forest patches showing botanical affinities with Guinean humid forest remain as gallery forests or ravine forests. To characterize the rodent diversity of this area and check {{for the presence of}} some species of Guinean affinities in this group, rodent assemblages were sampled in four regions of southern Mali, using trapping and observational data in forest and surrounding habitats. Twenty-four species were recorded, comprising a representative sample of the expected overall diversity in this group according to rarefaction curves. Praomys rostratus was the dominant species in the most humid, closed lowland forest. Praomys daltoni was also present in this habitat type, being all the more abundant as habitat degradation was apparent. It became the dominant species in <b>ravine</b> <b>forest</b> on rocky substrate where P. rostratus was completely absent. In Sudanian savanna habitats and in herbaceous and cultivated areas, Mastomys erythroleucus dominated a diverse rodent community. A few species were found that testified for Guinean affinities of the most humid forest patches, especially in the extreme southeast of the country (region of Sikasso). Rodent assemblages of the Bafing and Mts Mandingues areas, {{in the western part of}} the study area, showed the highest similarity, in relation with environmental characteristics of this region representing an extension of the Fouta Djallon plateau in Guinea.

40|$|Localized {{ecological}} conditions {{have the potential}} to induce variation in population characteristics such as size distributions and body conditions. The ability to generalize the influence of ecological characteristics on such population traits may be particularly meaningful when those traits influence prospects for successful management interventions. To characterize variability in invasive Brown Treesnake population attributes within and among habitat types, we conducted systematic and seasonally-balanced surveys, collecting 100 snakes from each of 18 sites: three replicates within each of six major habitat types comprising 95 % of Guam's geographic expanse. Our study constitutes one of the most comprehensive and controlled samplings of any published snake study. Quantile regression on snake size and body condition indicated significant ecological heterogeneity, with a general trend of relative consistency of size classes and body conditions within and among scrub and Leucaena forest habitat types and more heterogeneity among <b>ravine</b> <b>forest,</b> savanna, and urban residential sites. Larger and more robust snakes were found within some savanna and urban habitat replicates, likely due to relative availability of larger prey. Compared to more homogeneous samples in the wet season, variability in size distributions and body conditions was greater during the dry season. Although there is evidence of habitat influencing Brown Treesnake populations at localized scales (e. g., the higher prevalence of larger snakes-particularly males-in savanna and urban sites), the level of variability among sites within habitat types indicates little ability to make meaningful predictions about these traits at unsampled locations. Seasonal variability within sites and habitats indicates that localized population characterization should include sampling in both wet and dry seasons. Extreme values at single replicates occasionally influenced overall habitat patterns, while pooling replicates masked variability among sites. A full understanding of population characteristics should include an assessment of variability both at the site and habitat level...|$|E
