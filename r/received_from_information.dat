In addition to experts’ consensus, it is desirable to define ontological relations between any two concepts in a scientific ontology based on scientific evidence. To address this issue, we can relate ontological relations to different research results obtained from various studies. To implement this solution, our envisaged evidence/discovery-based methodology integrates a higher-level ontology (systematic review ontology) into a systematic review agent which employs a Fuzzy Inference System in order to automatically modifyontological relations of a domain ontology based on the evidence <b>received</b> <b>from</b> <b>information</b> resources. The evidence/discovery-based methodology will further use the domain ontology to discover novel connections between distinct literatures, thereby, enrich its conceptualization...|$|E

The paper {{deals with}} {{mathematical}} model for assessment calculation of information risks arising during transporting {{and distribution of}} material resources in the conditions of uncertainty. Meanwhile information risks imply the danger of origin of losses or damage {{as a result of}} application of information technologies by the company. Method. The solution is based on ideology of the transport task solution in stochastic statement with mobilization of mathematical modeling theory methods, the theory of graphs, probability theory, Markov chains. Creation of mathematical model is performed through the several stages. At the initial stage, capacity on different sites depending on time is calculated, on the basis of information <b>received</b> <b>from</b> <b>information</b> and logistic system, the weight matrix is formed and the digraph is under construction. Then there is a search of the minimum route which covers all specified vertexes by means of Dejkstra algorithm. At the second stage, systems of differential Kolmogorov equations are formed using information about the calculated route. The received decisions show probabilities of resources location in concrete vertex depending on time. At the third stage, general probability of the whole route passing depending on time is calculated on the basis of multiplication theorem of probabilities. Information risk, as time function, is defined by multiplication of the greatest possible damage by the general probability of the whole route passing. In this case information risk is measured in units of damage which corresponds to that monetary unit which the information and logistic system operates with. Main results. Operability of the presented mathematical model is shown on a concrete example of transportation of material resources where places of shipment and delivery, routes and their capacity, the greatest possible damage and admissible risk are specified. The calculations presented on a diagram showed that risk value under the specified conditions becomes lower than permissible if the demanded time of material resources transportation determined by the customer is more than 50 minutes. This calculation provides additional information for the person making the decision about the offer acceptance or refusal on transportation of material resources to the specified points. Practical significance. Results of work are usable in the fully functional information and logistic systems for calculation of the information risks arising during the transporting or distribution of material resources. It will increase competitiveness of the logistic companies operating in the conditions of the modern market relations...|$|E
40|$|The French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan (1901 - 1981) {{broke the}} rule that psychoanalytic sessions need to last 50 minutes. This regulation had been established by the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in the late 1920 s in order to standardize the quality of therapies and training analyses. Lacan considered it a mere formality: he believed that as a talking cure, psychoanalysis should depend on the discourse of the patient, not on the clock. Hence, from 1947 onwards, when ending a session Lacan took his cue from what the analysand said replacing the formal criterion of time by one based on content. This led to fierce disputes between French psychoanalysts, culminating in two institutional ruptures in 1953 and 1963. Lacan and his supporters paid dearly for his unwillingness {{to give up his}} practice of variable-length sessions: the IPA refused them recognition and legitimation. 	The dissertation in hand aims at a reconstruction of the theoretical background of Lacan's position through which Lacan's practice becomes intelligible and broadly contextualizes this subject matter within the history of medicine and the history of ideas. For this purpose, the two traditions in which Lacan, as a medical student in the 1920 s and 1930 s, came across the question of temporality as a problem of psychopathology are discussed: the "sciences of memory" (including psychoanalysis) and phenomenological psychiatry and philosophy. It is demonstrated that Lacan took up the "primacy of the future" as proposed by Heidegger and Minkowski, which prompted him to dissociate himself from the "sciences of memory" in this respect: in contrast to Freud, he did not regard the unconscious as the medium of a determination by the past, but as the inexhaustible source of novelty in life. Lacan's reinterpretation of psychoanalysis following the linguistic turn is discussed in so far as Lacan regarded the termination of the session as a meaningful "punctuation" of the discourse of the analysand. In the context of his notion of the unconscious as a symbolic machine, it will be examined which impulses he <b>received</b> <b>from</b> <b>information</b> theory, cybernetics, and computer technology since he considered memory as analogous to digital memory devices. This model served as the basis of Lacan's assumption that the history of the patient, including his traumatic memories, could be rewritten by helping him to interpret his past anew in looking forwards. However, by emphasizing an orientation toward the future, Lacan stressed a dimension of temporality that is characteristic of human subjectivity. The other specifically human aspect in Lacan's model is inherent in the intersubjective process unfolding between analyst and patient {{in the course of the}} analysis. In Lacan's eyes, the progress of the treatment was based on the dynamics of this so-called transference relationship and not, as in Freud, on the completion of the anamnesis. The purposes of Lacan's analysis are explicated. In contrast to Freud, Lacan did not aim at helping his patients to obtain normality, i. e. health, but authenticity. The author proposes that the way in which Lacan dealt with the overall length of the analysis was complementary to his way of handling the duration of single sessions: the individual session was terminated by the analyst, but the analysis as a whole was brought to a conclusion by the analysand himself. In both cases, the choice of the right moment to end the analysis was based on its content and not on the clock or the calendar. Lacan's practice of variable-length sessions, which is described on the basis of reports of Lacan's former analysands and that is contextualized in the history of psychoanalysis, is made intelligible and available to critical discussion within its theoretical framework...|$|E
