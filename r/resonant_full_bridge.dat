40|$|The Series <b>Resonant</b> <b>Full</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{operating}} in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) at fixed frequency, SRFB-DCM, {{is an interesting}} topology to provide isolation in the interface to main buses while having high efficiency thanks to Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) and Zero Current Switching (ZCS). As this converter cannot be regulated, usually, it is more interesting for regulated buses or in case there is post-regulation. This converter finds application in Power Processing Units for Electrical Propulsion and in any secondary high power front-end converter. Despite its simple design without regulation, in general, the dynamic behaviour of resonant converters is difficult to predict. A model is necessary to predict compatibility with input and output interfaces (stability, output impedance, start-up in-rush,…), avoiding late discovery of oscillations, for example. This paper presents a method to obtain the theoretical dynamic model of the SRFB-DCM with fixed frequency and duty cycle which seems easier to understand but surprisingly not treated in literature.

40|$|<b>Full</b> <b>bridge</b> dc/de {{converter}} topology is extensively {{applied in}} medium to high power conversion. In a power level up to 3 kW, the <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter now employs MOSFET switches. High efficiency, high power density, high reliability and low EMI {{are some of}} the most desirable features in these applications, particularly for computer and telecom systems. To achieve these features, soft switching techniques are normally employed. However, the conventional soft switching <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter topologies would either lose the soft switching at some operating conditions, or become rather complex in design and implementation for a few kilo watts applications. This thesis presents and analyzes an improved zero voltage switching dc/dc <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter topology. The proposed topology employs asymmetrical auxiliary circuits that consist of only a few passive components. However, the advantage of the proposed topology is significant: it achieves soft switching independent of line and load conditions.
