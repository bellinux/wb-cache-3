While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E
25|$|No {{data have}} been {{compiled}} showing the susceptibility {{of the sheep}} to disease, although tests have been run on similar species of sheep and the data may be similar. Since Marco Polo sheep are reluctant to approach people, {{it is not likely}} that they can catch diseases common to domestic flocks, although some domestic sheep are allowed to <b>run</b> <b>wild</b> over the mountains, and it is unknown if they come into contact with Marco Polo sheep. However, the shepherds in the area do not generally have access to veterinary care for their animals, and it is possible that these could transmit diseases to the wild sheep.|$|E

He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered his face with white chalk and let his hair <b>run</b> <b>wild.</b> He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was so grateful to be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E

It was made by The Ren & Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi and his company Spümcø. Boo Boo <b>Runs</b> <b>Wild</b> originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 24, 1999, along with A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith, a similar Yogi Bear-themed stand alone special. Despite Boo Boo being the arguable star of this short, it is title carded as [...] "A Ranger Smith Cartoon". The short is dedicated to Ed Benedict, the original character designer for The Yogi Bear Show and other Hanna-Barbera properties of the 1950s-1960s.Since its original debut in 1999, Boo Boo <b>Runs</b> <b>Wild</b> has aired multiple times on Cartoon Network's late night programing block, Adult Swim. From January 2006 until April 2006 Boo Boo <b>Runs</b> <b>Wild</b> aired every single Sunday on Adult Swim. On April 1, 2006, following the normal Neon Genesis Evangelion bump Adult Swim aired Boo Boo <b>Runs</b> <b>Wild</b> as an April Fool's Day joke, despite all TV listings showing Evangelion in its normal time slot. Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo <b>Runs</b> <b>Wild</b> on Halloween night, October 31, 2008, {{as part of an}} advertised [...] "Halloween Stunt" [...] night, where obscure or randomly seen shows preempted the usual programming for that Friday night.

25|$|In 1949, Brodovitch collaborated in the {{production}} of the revolutionary publication Portfolio. It has been widely acknowledged as perhaps the definitive graphic design magazine of the twentieth century. The idea for the publication came from art director Frank Zachary. He wanted to put out a magazine that focused solely on art and design, but was at the same time an outstanding example of design itself. Brodovitch was intrigued by the concept. Although he enjoyed his work at Harper's Bazaar, the limitations of space and subject matter often cramped his creative style. Portfolio freed him from the practical and aesthetic restraints to which he had grown accustomed. The pages of the publication were space for his graphic imagination to <b>run</b> <b>wild.</b> George S. Rosenthal, whose family owned a printing company dedicated to mass-market pictorial paperbacks, signed on too.|$|E
25|$|The primary corroborative sighting, however, {{occurred}} {{ten days}} later (July 4) when a United Airlines crew over Idaho en route to Seattle also spotted five to nine disk-like objects that paced their plane for 10 to 15 minutes before suddenly disappearing. The next day in Seattle, Arnold met with the pilot, Cpt. Emil J. Smith, and copilot and compared sighting details. The main difference in shape was that the United crew thought the objects appeared rough on top. This {{was one of the}} few sightings that Arnold felt was reliable, most of the rest he thought were the public seeing other things and letting their imaginations <b>run</b> <b>wild.</b> Arnold and Cpt. Smith became friends, met again with Army Air Force intelligence officers on July 12 and filed sighting reports, then teamed up again at the end of July in investigating the strange Maury Island incident.|$|E

The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve located in the Western Ghats and Nilgiri Hills comprises part of adjoining states of Kerala and Karnataka. The Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve is in the south west of the state bordering Kerala in the Western Ghats. Tamil Nadu is home to five declared National parks located in Anamalai, Mudumalai, Mukurithi, Gulf of Mannar and Guindy located in the centre of Chennai city.

25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Bahrag and the Bohrok's return to their nests, the Toa Nuva collect their new Kanohi Nuva masks and return to their villages to help in the {{reconstruction}} after the damage the swarms caused. However, six new elite Bohrok - the Bohrok-Kal - appear with the intention of releasing the Bahrag so the Bohrok may swarm again. Each Kal steals a Nuva symbol tablet, robbing the heroes of their command of the elements. Relying solely on their mask powers and combat skills, the Toa Nuva chase the Bohrok-Kal all over Mata Nui and eventually find them in the Bahrag's underground nest. The Kal defeat the Exo-Toa guards with ease before attempting to fit all six plaques onto the Nuva cube in order to re-awake the swarm queens. Before the tablets join, Tahu unleashes a secret weapon: the Kanohi Vahi - the legendary Mask of Time - to slow down time around them. Though unable to directly attack the Kal, the gambit buys the Toa time to devise a new strategy. Using their connections to their tablets, they feed energy into the elite Bohrok, making them believe that their power alone can cleanse the island. However, the Kal's powers soon <b>run</b> <b>wild</b> and destroy them. The Toa Nuva exit the nest, and after hiding their tablets in secret locations, enjoy a new time of peace on Mata Nui.|$|E

500|$|On 8 July {{they stopped}} at St. Helena for six days. Darwin took lodgings near Napoleon's tomb, and when writing to Henslow asking to be {{proposed}} for the Geological Society, mentioned his suspicions [...] "that differently from most Volcanic Islds. its structure is rather complicated. It seems strange, that this little centre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of recent elevation." [...] With a guide he wandered over the island, noting its complex sloping strata showing fault lines, interlaced with volcanic dykes. He examined beds high on the hill which had been taken as seashells showing that St. Helena had risen from the ocean in recent times, but Darwin identified them as extinct species of land-shells. He noted that woodland had been destroyed by goats and hogs which had <b>run</b> <b>wild</b> since being introduced in 1502, and native vegetation only predominated on high steep ridges, having been replaced by imported species.|$|E
500|$|Wilderness {{protection}} and the conservation movement, led by {{figures such as}} John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, also began to appear at this time. By {{the turn of the}} century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir. Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing cult of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts. Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic evolution. In 1837, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary that [...] "If we choose to let conjecture <b>run</b> <b>wild,</b> then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Hundred Years War of the 14th–15th centuries, the English {{government}} {{banned the}} export of horses in times of crisis; in the 16th century, Henry VII passed a number of laws relating to the breeding and export of horses {{in an attempt to}} improve the British stock, under which it was forbidden to allow uncastrated male horses to be turned out in fields or on common land; they had to be [...] "kept within bounds and tied in stalls." [...] This ruling caused inconvenience, and the practice of gelding horses became widespread. In 1535, Henry VIII passed the Breed of Horses Act aimed at improving the height and strength of horses; no stallion under [...] and no mare under 13hands (52inches, 132cm) was permitted to run out on common land, or to <b>run</b> <b>wild,</b> and no two-year-old colt under 11.2hands (46inches, 117cm) was allowed to run out in any area with mares.

500|$|Legend {{states that}} Chincoteague ponies descend from Spanish horses shipwrecked off the Virginia coast {{on their way}} to Peru in the 16th century. Another story holds that they descend from horses left on the island by pirates. Both of these {{theories}} are unlikely, as no documentation has been found to show horses inhabiting the island this early, and no mention of horses already existing on the island was made by colonists on either the mainland or the island in the mid-to-late 1600s. Evidence points, however, to their ancestors actually being horses brought to the islands in the 17th century by mainland farmers. [...] Livestock on the islands were not subject to taxes or fencing laws, and so many animals, including hogs, sheep, cattle and horses, were brought to the islands. While the National Park Service holds to the theory that the horses were brought to the island in the 17th century, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, which owns the ponies on the Virginia side of Assateague, argues that the Spanish shipwreck theory is correct. They argue that horses were too valuable in the 17th century to have been left to <b>run</b> <b>wild</b> on the island, and claim that there are two sunken Spanish galleons off the Virginia coast in support of their theory. The National Chincoteague Pony Association also promotes the shipwreck theory. In the early 1900s, they were described as having been on the islands since well before the American Revolution, and were described at that time as [...] "very diminutive, but many of them are of perfect symmetry and extraordinary powers of action and endurance."
