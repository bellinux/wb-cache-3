40|$|Knowledge-based recommenders support {{users in}} the {{identification}} of interesting items from large and potentially complex assortments. In cases where no recommendation could be found for a given set of requirements, such systems propose explanations that indicate minimal sets of faulty requirements. Unfortunately, such explanations are not personalized and do not include <b>repair</b> <b>proposals</b> which triggers a low degree of satisfaction and frequent cancellations of recommendation sessions. In this paper we present a personalized repair approach that integrates the calculation of explanations with collaborative problem solving techniques. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we present the results of an empirical study that show significant improvements in the accuracy of predictions for interesting repairs. ...|$|R
40|$|Users {{interact}} with recommender systems to obtain useful information about {{products or services}} that may be of interest for them. But, while users are interacting with a recommender system to fulfill a primary task, which is usually the selection {{of one or more}} items, they are facing several other decision problems. For instance, they may be requested to select specific feature values (e. g., camera’s size, zoom) as criteria for a search, or they could have to identify features to be used in a critiquing based recommendation session, or they may need to select a <b>repair</b> <b>proposal</b> for inconsistent user preferences when interacting with a recommender. In all these scenarios, and in many others, users of recommender systems are facing decision tasks. The complexity of decision tasks, limited cognitive resources of users, and the tendency to keep the overall decision effort as low as possible is modeled by theories that conjecture “bounded rationality”, i. e., users are exploiting decision heuristics rather than trying to take an optimal. Furthermore, preferences of users will likely change throughout a recommendation session, i. e., preferences are constructed in a specific decision context and users may not fully know their preferences beforehand. Within the scope of a decision process, preferences are strongly influenced by the goals of the customer, existing cognitive constraints, and the persona...|$|E

In all these scenarios, users have {{to solve a}} decision task. The complexity of decision tasks, limited cognitive resources of users, and the tendency to keep the overall decision effort {{as low as possible}} lead to the phenomenon of bounded rationality, i. e., users exploit decision heuristics rather than trying to take an optimal decision. Furthermore, preferences of users will likely change throughout a recommendation session, i. e., preferences are constructed in a specific decision environment and users do not know their preferences beforehand. Decision making under bounded rationality is a door opener for different types of non-conscious influences on the decision behavior of a user. Theories from decision psychology and cognitive psychology are trying to explain these influences, for example, decoy effects and defaults can trigger significant shifts in item selection probabilities; in group decision scenarios, the visibility of the preferences of other group members can {{have a significant impact on}} the final group decision. The major goal of this workshop was to establish a platform for industry and academia to present and discuss new ideas and research results that are related to the topic of human decision making in {{recommender system}}s.

However, under sunlight, photosynthetic organisms are unavoidably exposed to potentially harmful levels of ultraviolet and visible light radiation. Consequently, plants have developed many mechanisms for the avoidance and dissipation of excess light energy. The growth of crops under increased solar irradiance during sub- and supra-optimal temperature conditions is an obstacle for increasing seasonal crop {{production in the}} transition zone. New methods for reducing the photoinhibitory effects of solar irradiation have been observed {{in the field of}} turfgrass.

40|$|A word like Huh? [...] used as {{a repair}} {{initiator}} when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said [...] is found in roughly the same form and function in spoken languages across the globe.

In support of the first, we show that the similarities in form and function of this interjection across languages are much greater than expected by chance. In support of the second claim we show that it is a lexical, conventionalised form that has to be learnt, unlike grunts or emotional cries. We discuss possible reasons for the cross-linguistic similarity and propose an account in terms of convergent evolution. Huh? is a universal word not because it is innate but because it is shaped by selective pressures in an interactional environment that all languages share: that of other-initiated <b>repair.</b> Our <b>proposal</b> enhances evolutionary models of language change by suggesting that conversational infrastructure can drive the convergent cultural evolution of linguistic items...|$|R

40|$|The human {{lymphoblastoid}} MT 1 B-cell {{line was}} previously isolated {{as one of}} a series of mutant cells able to survive the cytotoxic effects of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). MT 1 cells nevertheless remain sensitive to mutagenesis by MNNG and display a mutator phenotype. These phenotypes have been attributed to a single genetic alteration postulated to confer a defect in strand-specific mismatch <b>repair,</b> a <b>proposal</b> that attributes the cytotoxic effect of DNA alkylation in wild-type cells to futile attempts to correct mispairs that arise during replication of alkylated template strands. Our results support this view. MNNG-induced mutations in the HPRT gene of MT 1 cells are almost exclusively G. C [...] >A. T transitions, while spontaneous mutations observed in this mutator cell line are single-nucleotide insertions, transversions, and A. T [...] >G. C transitions. In vitro assay has demonstrated that the MT 1 line is in fact deficient in strand-specific correction of all eight base-base mispairs. This defect, which is manifest at or prior to the excision stage of the reaction, is due to simple deficiency of a required activity because MT 1 nuclear extracts can be complemented by a partially purified HeLa fraction to restore in vitro repair. These findings substantiate the idea that strand-specific mismatch repair contributes to alkylation-induced cytotoxicity and imply that this process serves as a barrier to spontaneous transition, transversion, and insertion/deletion mutations in mammalian cells...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} about what computational processes the P600 may be triggered by. Because it often happens {{in response to}} grammatical violations or garden path sentences, one {{theory is that the}} P600 reflects processes of revision (i.e., trying to [...] "rescue" [...] the interpretation of a sentence that can't be processed normally because of structural errors) and reanalysis (i.e., trying to rearrange the structure of a sentence that has been interpreted incorrectly because of a garden path). [...] On the other hand, other models suggest that the P600 may not reflect these processes in particular, but just the amount of time and effort in general it takes to build up coherent structure in a sentence, or the general processes of creating or destroying syntactic structure (not specifically because of <b>repair).</b> [...] Another <b>proposal</b> is that the P600 does not necessarily reflect any linguistic processes per se, but is similar to the P300 in that it is triggered when a subject encounters [...] "improbable" [...] stimuli - since ungrammatical sentences are relatively rare in natural speech, a P600 may not be a linguistic response but simply an effect of the subject's [...] "surprise" [...] upon encountering an unexpected stimulus.|$|R

Building integrated vegetation (BIV) offers many ecological benefits and {{an increasing number of}} local authorities, urban planners and architects are aware of these.

Their environmental properties are remarkable, for these cities encouraging architects to use them. Nevertheless technical standards dealing with design, construction and maintenance of LWSs are rarely available. The objective of the research is to stimulate the LWSs development providing a technical standard proposal with information, and specifications. It tackles some aspects that should be considered significant in a standard such as: design guidelines; maintenance procedures; requirements and indicators for assessing the expected performances.

40|$|Maintaining the {{integrity}} of the genome is critical for the survival of any organism. To achieve this, many families of enzymatic repair systems which recognize and repair DNA damage have evolved. Perhaps most intriguing about the workings of these repair systems is the actual damage recognition process. What are the chemical characteristics which are common to sites of nucleic acid damage that DNA repair proteins may exploit in targeting sites? Importantly, thermodynamic and kinetic principles, as much as structural factors, make damage sites distinct from the native DNA bases, and indeed, in many cases, these are the features which are believed to be exploited by <b>repair</b> enzymes. Current <b>proposals</b> for damage recognition may not fulfill all of the demands required of enzymatic repair systems given the sheer size of many genomes, and the efficiency with which the genome is screened for damage. Here we discuss current models for how DNA damage recognition may occur and the chemical characteristics, shared by damaged DNA sites, of which repair proteins may take advantage. These include recognition based upon the thermodynamic and kinetic instabilities associated with aberrant sites. Additionally, we describe how small changes in base pair structure can alter also the unique electronic properties of the DNA base pair π-stack. Further, we describe photophysical, electrochemical, and biochemical experiments in which mismatches and other local perturbations in structure are detected using DNA-mediated charge transport. Finally, we speculate as to how this DNA electron transfer chemistry might be exploited by repair enzymes in order to scan the genome for sites of damage...|$|R

The seven men were {{employees}} of the Railway Department who were, along with another 50 men in 3 gangs, working in the tunnel on draining and concreting the lines. Two trains passed through the tunnel going in both directions, the men were warned of their approach by the watchman. The trains left dense smoke in the tunnel which has electric lights along the walls. Visibility in the tunnel was poor due to the train engines’ smoke. A few minutes later a goods train travelling from Enfield to Broadmeadow entered from the Hawkesbury end, the seven men were not aware that this train was approaching {{and it was on}} them before they could jump to safety. The driver of the goods train did not see the men, a man's cap was found {{on the front of the}} engine at Woy Woy Station. Those killed were: Michael Shelley (aged 47), married of Punchbowl suffered decapitation and a severed leg; John Dillon (aged 37), married of South Woy Woy suffered a broken neck, Lynton Munce (aged 44) of Paddington suffered decapitation and Andrew Jack Blackie (aged 41), married of West Wallsend. The injured were: William Whitten (aged 31) of Cardiff who suffered a fractured skull, severe abrasions and lacerations all over his body; Andrew J Blackie (aged 41) of West Wallsend who suffered a fractured skull and internal injuries; Reginald Mason (aged 28) of Adamstown who suffered a fractured skull and ribs and Angus Blakely (aged 41) of West Wallsend who suffered a fractured skull and severe lacerations. With the exception of Blackie, all were married. Andrew Jack Blackie died in Newcastle Hospital approximately 24 hours after the incident. Men engaged on railway repairs in the tunnel decided at a meeting to refrain from working in the tunnel until visibility at either end was clear.
