5|$|The menu {{is created}} by Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included <b>roast</b> <b>chicken</b> with an onion fondue and licorice, and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E
5|$|While {{overseen by}} Heston Blumenthal, the head chef {{in the kitchen}} is Ashley Palmer-Watts. Palmer-Watts has {{previously}} worked with Blumenthal since 1999, and for five years was head chef at Blumenthal's other restaurant, the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck. The two chefs researched historical menu choices {{with help from the}} British Library and food historians. Blumenthal's first experience of historical cuisine was in 2000 when he discovered a recipe for <b>roast</b> <b>chicken</b> which required the bird to be plucked alive, and then cooked with a small volume of mercury. This was further enhanced as he filmed Heston's Feasts for Channel 4, in which he created a variety of feasts from different historical eras including Tudor, Medieval and Victorian. Despite being called Dinner, the restaurant is also open for lunch as the meaning of the name is intended to be the main meal of the day, regardless of the time at which it is eaten.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and <b>roast</b> <b>chicken.</b> Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and puréed bean soup.|$|E

Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a <b>roasted</b> <b>chicken</b> line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the <b>roasted</b> <b>chicken</b> market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994.

500|$|In the 1950s some British pubs {{started to}} offer [...] "a pie and a pint", with hot {{individual}} steak and ale pies made easily {{on the premises}} by the landlord or his wife.

[...] "Pub grub" [...] expanded to include British food items such as steak and ale pie, steak and kidney pudding, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, and pasties. The gastropub movement of the 21st century, on the other hand, seeks to serve restaurant-quality food, cooked to order from fresh ingredients, in a pub setting. In 1964, pubs were serving 9.1% of meals eaten outside the home; this rose rapidly to 37.5% by 1997.|$|E

500|$|Borscht's westward {{expansion}} {{was less}} successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup {{along with other}} East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France.

In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant [...] dish {{with an air of}} eastern exoticism.

2500|$|Due to {{the wide}} range of styles, Chardonnay has the {{potential}} to be paired with a diverse spectrum of food types.
