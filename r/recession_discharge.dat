40|$|Streamflow {{time series}} in arid and {{semi-arid}} regions {{can be characterized}} as a sequence of single discrete flow episodes or clusters of hydrographs separated by periods of zero discharge. Here, two point process models are presented for the joint occurrence of flow events at neighbouring river sites. The first allows for excess clustering by adding autocorrelated errors to an empirically derived seasonally varying probability of an event and is extended to the case of the joint occurrence of flow events in two catchments. The second approach is to explicitly model the occurrences of clusters of events and the bivariate point process of event occurrences within them at both sites. For the two models, the magnitude of event peaks are assumed to be drawn from continuous distributions with seasonally varying parameters.

40|$|A {{catchment}} {{study was}} conducted between January 1990 and April 1992 to quantify the impact of harvesting a mature Pinus caribaea plantation forest on total runoff, baseflow <b>recession,</b> peak <b>discharge,</b> stormflow volume and sediment concentration. As rainfall differed between pre- and post-harvesting periods, a streamflow prediction model (HBV) and statistical methods were used to evaluate observed changes and to test if these were significant. Most runoff occurred as baseflow (64 - 74 % of total runoff). Baseflow increased significantly after harvesting, from 10 % to 16 % of rainfall. The minimum daily flow increased by 70 % after harvesting, in spite of lower rainfall in that period. Stormflow volumes and peak discharges also increased significantly {{as a result of}} Horton overland flow generation on new road and log-landing surfaces and a higher wetness of the catchment due to lower evapotranspiration. Stormflow volume doubled from 2. 7 % to 5. 5 % of rainfall after harvesting. The combined effect amounted to estimated increases in flows from 252 mm under forest to 580 mm after harvesting for the 324 -days period of 1990 (total rainfall of 1613 mm) and from 90 mm to 194 mm for the drier 309 -days period in 1991 / 1992 (total rainfall of 992 mm). Sediment concentrations increased significantly during stormflow events after harvesting, but not under baseflow conditions. Harvesting of the pine plantation therefore increased stormflow, baseflow and total water yield significantly. Stormflow water quality was affected negatively, though, through increased sediment concentrations. These aspects are important for water resources management considerations related to plantation forestry in areas with a distinct dry season. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Baseflow {{recession}} {{analysis and}} groundwater dating {{have up to}} now developed as two distinct branches of hydrogeology and {{have been used to}} solve entirely different problems. We show that by combining two classical models, namely the Boussinesq equation describing spring baseflow recession, and the exponential piston-flow model used in groundwater dating studies, the parameters describing the transit time distribution of an aquifer can be in some cases estimated to a far more accurate degree than with the latter alone. Under the assumption that the aquifer basis is sub-horizontal, the mean transit time of water in the saturated zone can be estimated from spring baseflow recession. This provides an independent estimate of groundwater transit time that can refine those obtained from tritium measurements. The approach is illustrated in a case study predicting atrazine concentration trend in a series of springs draining the fractured-rock aquifer known as the Luxembourg Sandstone. A transport model calibrated on tritium measurements alone predicted different times to trend reversal following the nationwide ban on atrazine in 2005 with different rates of decrease. For some of the springs, the actual time of trend reversal and the rate of change agreed extremely well with the model calibrated using both tritium measurements and the <b>recession</b> of spring <b>discharge</b> during the dry season. The agreement between predicted and observed values was however poorer for the springs displaying the most gentle recessions, possibly indicating a stronger influence of continuous groundwater recharge during the summer months...|$|R
40|$|With {{fresh water}} {{becoming}} more valuable of a resource, {{the protection of}} the sources is critical. The Cordillera Blanca mountain range in Peru has the highest density of glaciers in the tropics and is a significant source of water {{to the people of the}} Upper Santa River watershed, a large part of the Ancash region, which is home to roughly 270, 000 (Mark et al., 2010). A general trend of temperature increase has been observed since 1939 in the tropical Andes. This rate of warming has increased by three fold over the last 25 years to 0. 32 to 0. 34 ºC per decade (Vuille and Bradley, 2000). Along with the increase in temperature trends, the glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca are retreating and have been doing so at different rates since the 1930 s and continue to do so (Georges, 2004; Mark and Seltzer, 2003). Due to the continual glacier <b>recession,</b> glacial stream <b>discharge</b> is likely to decrease and become more variable, with less in the dry season when it is needed most (Mark and Seltzer, 2003). In addition to the loss of water from the finite source, a retreating glacier has several implications on the quality of its water runoff. The pyrite (FeS 2) baring Chicama formation is the leading source of sulfate to the steams of the Cordillera Blanca. Increased concentrations of sulfate are caused by the recession of the glaciers which expose fresh lithologies of the Chicama formation.

40|$|Rainfall-runoff {{modelling}} in ungauged basins {{is still}} one of the greatest challenges in hydrological research. The lack of discharge data necessitates the establishment of new innovative approaches to guide hydrological modelling in ungauged basins. Besides the transfer of calibrated parameters from similar gauged catchments, the application of distributed data as a hydrological response in addition to discharge seems to be promising. A new approach to guide hydrological modelling based on explicit simulation of the spatial stream network was tested in four different catchments in Germany. In a first step we used a simplified version of the process-based model Hill-Vi together with regional climate normals to simulate stream networks. The calculation of gravity driven lateral subsurface and groundwater flow is used to identify patterns of stream cells, which were compared to reference stream networks and their degree of spatial agreement was evaluated. Significant differences between good and poor simulations could be distinguished and the corresponding parameter sets relate well with the hydrogeological properties of the catchments. The optimized parameters were subsequently used to simulate daily discharge using an observed time series of precipitation and air temperature. The performance was evaluated against observed discharge and water balance. This approach shows some promising results but also some limitations. Although the model's parsimonious model structure could be further improved regarding <b>discharge</b> <b>recession</b> and evapotranspiration, the performance was similar to regionalisation methods. Stream network modelling, which has minimal data requirements, seems to be a reasonable alternative for model development and parameter evaluation in ungauged basins...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} simple connections between observations of hydrological processes at the hillslope scale and observations of the response of watersheds following rainfall, with a view to building a parsimonious model of catchment processes. The focus is on the well-studied Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), Georgia, USA. <b>Recession</b> analysis of <b>discharge</b> Q shows that while the relationship between dQ/dt and Q is approximately consistent with a linear reservoir for the hillslope, there is a deviation from linearity that becomes progressively larger with increasing spatial scale. To account for these scale differences conceptual models of streamflow recession are defined at both the hillslope scale and the watershed scale, and an assessment made as to whether models at the hillslope scale can be aggregated to be consistent with models at the watershed scale. Results from this study show that a model with parallel linear reservoirs provides the most plausible explanation (of those tested) for both the linear hillslope response to rainfall and non-linear recession behaviour observed at the watershed outlet. In this model each linear reservoir is associated with a landscape type. The parallel reservoir model is consistent with both geochemical analyses of hydrological flow paths and water balance estimates of bedrock recharge. Overall, this study demonstrates that standard approaches of using recession analysis to identify the functional form of storage–discharge relationships identify model structures that are inconsistent with field evidence, and that recession analysis at multiple spatial scales can provide useful insights into catchment behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of nitrogen (N) and suspended solids (SS) were investigated in stream water during four storm events in 2003 at the Shibetsu watershed, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. Analysis showed that total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-N (NO^[-]_[3] -N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), particulate nitrogen (PN), and SS concentrations all peaked sharply during the rising limb of the discharge hydrograph, but peaks in PN and SS were {{more significant than}} that of dissolved N. PN and SS consistently displayed clockwise hysteresis with higher concentrations during rising flows, whereas NO^[-]_[3]-N and DON showed different patterns among storms depending on the antecedent soil moisture. An M (V) curve, defined as the nutrient mass distribution vs. the volume of discharge, showed that a "first flush" of PN, NO^[-]_[3]-N, DON and SS was observed, however, the distribution of nutrient loads in the discharge was different. PN and SS had a shorter flushing characteristic time constant (t_[1 /e], defined as the time interval required for a decline in nutrient concentrations in discharge water to e^[- 1] (37 %) of their initial concentrations) but contributed 80 % of fluxes during the first 50 % of the discharge, while longer flush time (t_[1 /e]) of NO^[-]_[3]-N and DON with slowly decreased concentrations led to half loads during the <b>recession</b> of the <b>discharge.</b> These data indicate that the flush mechanisms might be distinguished between particulate nutrients and dissolved N.

40|$|Strontium and {{particularly}} 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in stream water {{have often been}} used to calculate weathering rates in catchments. Nevertheless, in the literature, discharge variation effects on the geochemical behavior of Sr are often omitted or considered as negligible. A regular survey of both Sr concentrations and Sr isotope ratios of the Strengbach stream water draining a granite (Vosges mountains, France) has been performed during one year. The results indicate that during low water flow periods, waters contain lower Sr concentrations and less radiogenic Sr isotope ratios (Sr= 11. 6 ppb and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 7246 as an average, respectively) than during high water flow periods (Sr= 13 ppb and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 7252 as an average, respectively). This is contrary to expected dilution processes by meteoric waters which have comparatively lower Sr isotopic ratios and lower Sr concentrations. Furthermore, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in stream water behave in 3 different ways depending on moisture and on hydrological conditions prevailing in the catchment. During low water flow periods (discharge < 9 l/s), a positive linear relationship exists between Sr isotope ratio and discharge, indicating the influence of radiogenic waters draining the saturated area during storm events. During high water flow conditions, rising discharges are characterized by significantly less radiogenic waters than the <b>recession</b> stages of <b>discharge.</b> This suggests a large contribution of radiogenic waters draining the deep layers of the hillslopes during the recession stages, particularly those from the more radiogenic north-facing slopes. These results allow one to confirm the negligible instantaneous incidence of rainwater on stream water chemistry during flood events, {{as well as the}} existence in the catchment of distinct contributive areas and reservoirs. The influence of these areas or reservoirs on the fluctuations of Sr concentrations and on Sr isotopic variations in stream water depends on both moisture and hydrological conditions. Hence, on a same bedrock type, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in surface waters can be related to flow rate. Consequently, discharge variations must be considered as a pre-requisite when using Sr isotopes for calculating weathering rates in catchments, particularly to define the range of variations of the end-members...|$|R
40|$|In {{carbonate}} reservoir, {{the flow}} patterns are conditioned {{by the degree}} of karsification of the main conduit networks and by the lower permeability microfractured blocks. To quantify patterns and nature of discontinuities in the rock mass is the main goal in the fluid circulation researches. Indeed fractures such as joint and bedding planes control infiltration, percolation and migration of groundwater into a reservoir. In the Umbria-Marche Apennine the Lower Jurassic limestones represents the basal reservoir where the larger hydrogeological structures are locate. The stratigraphic and structural setting forces a parallel-to-the ridge circulation of groundwaters, and the ridge itself {{can be considered as}} an isolated hydrogeological system. A quantitative fractures analysis was been considerate through the whole anticline, from the gently deep SW limb, in the weakly deformed hinge zone to the subvertical and much more deformed NE external side. The prevalent joint systems are oriented N 55 and N 295, located in the fold limbs and in the hinge zone. Besides, N 15 and N 345 joint systems are predominant only in western and eastern limbs of the anticline. In the hinge zone the fractures seem to be linked to a normal faults oriented at NW and SE, in correspondence of the crestal area; possibly these shear structures are responsible both for new systems development and for pre-existent sets partial reorientation. Dip discontinuities distribution gave remarkable about water process once infiltration inside the system. The high dips strongly contributed to increase groundwater percolation velocity coming both from direct infiltration areas in the upper hydrogeological complexes. Finally, spacing and frequency fracturation analysis identify rock mass properties from a quantitative point of view; these structural parameters allowed to obtained important considerations about both mechanical and hydrogeological features of a reservoir. The Giordano karst spring drains the SW limb of the M. Nerone anticline with an average discharge of more than 0, 1 m 3 /sec and with a catchment area of about 4 km 2. A deterministic approach for the hydrostructural characterization of the spring was adopted using discharge, temperature and water conductivity. The analysis of the hydrographs show that the base flow represent only the 30 % and in the <b>recession</b> curve the <b>discharge</b> is controlled by the karst conduits drainage. The recession curves show different steps with a depletion constant of about 10 - 3 day- 1, while the water temperature and electrical conductivity show variations where prevails the conduits drainage respect the fractured matrix.

40|$|There is {{on-going}} {{need for}} reliable estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) at catchment scales to support objective decision-making for managing water supplies, and enhancing understanding of processes and modelling. Without reliable estimates of ET, {{water supply and}} catchment management agencies are exposed to significant economic, social and even environmental risks. This thesis focuses on identifying possible methodologies for estimating ET in a catchment dominated by eucalypt forest and woodland. More specifically, this thesis tests the hypothesis that different methods of deriving daily, catchment ET for a headwater in Australia meet underlying assumptions and yield similar results. The hypothesis was tested by using three approaches to estimate catchment ET: soil moisture changes (point scale), satellite imagery of leaf area index (MODIS, hillslope scale), and discharge (streamflow) and the storage-discharge relationship (catchment scale). Data from Corin Catchment, an unregulated catchment vital to the Australian Capital Territory and the surrounding region, {{is the basis of}} this study. After the General Introduction (Chapter 1), methods for estimating ET in eucalypt communities throughout Australia at various temporal and spatial scales are systematically reviewed (Chapter 2). Of the 1614 original research papers investigated, 52 were included for further investigation. A clear outcome is that transpiration by the overstorey, measured using sap flow, is the most frequently measured component of ET, and that physiological studies dominate estimates of ET. Very few studies were conducted at the catchment scale. Further, scaling ET from tree to catchment scales was rarely attempted, and the effect of scaling for water resource management is mostly unquantified and requires attention. The first method used to calculate catchment ET is based on up-scaling of soil moisture changes {{on the basis of a}} digital soil map (Chapter 4). The data presented here rejects the hypothesis that ET (derived from soil moisture) and overstorey transpiration (derived from sap flow) are well correlated. Instead, the data suggest that soil moisture-derived ET and overstorey transpiration obtained water from different sources. The key findings of this chapter are that this approach is not suitable for estimating ET at catchment scales because it is restricted to drier periods, and because trees did not solely rely on the defined root-zone for water supply. The second method to calculate catchment scale ET (Chapter 5) tests if hillslope-scale satellite imagery (MODIS leaf area index) can be up-scaled to estimate catchment ET. An outcome of this work is that caution is needed when using MODIS leaf area index for water resource planning in evergreen forests across the globe, particularly for forests with significant understorey and a relatively open overstorey canopy at some periods of the year. This method is deemed not suitable for estimating ET over the study area. The third method to calculate catchment scale ET (Chapter 6) is based on integrating discharge using a single non-linear equation to characterise the study area. This method yielded catchment ET far greater (18 times larger) than the largest observed measure of potential ET. As with the method based on soil moisture changes, it was restricted to drier periods. This method was clearly unsuitable for estimating ET over the study area due to relatively quick recession, large range in hourly discharge and significant scattered <b>recession</b> at low <b>discharge.</b> Overall, this thesis rejects the hypothesis that different methods of deriving daily, catchment ET for a headwater in Australia meet underlying assumptions and yield similar results. An important limitation identified through this research is the ability to determine a ‘correct’ estimate of catchment ET. Further research should focus on enhancing understanding of scaling ET within and beyond Australia, generating more daily catchment ET from up-scaled soil moisture changes, further evaluating ET from up-scaled satellite imagery, and identifying catchment characteristics to allow ET to be derived from discharge. Water resource managers must be diligent when selecting and applying a method to estimate catchment ET...|$|R
