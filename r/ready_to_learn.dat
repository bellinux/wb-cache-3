40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we discuss}} using a student model in a web-based course to {{sequence}} the curriculum. Since the {{teaching in a}} web-based course is usually non-linear, dynamic curriculum sequencing is important as {{there is not a}} linear path that will be appropriate for all students. Thus a student model needs to be constructed which can guide students through the non-linear curriculum. This student model is built on the student’s quiz performance and on how well he studies the material. The student model is used to judge how well a topic has been “learned”, which can then be used to determine which other topics are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>learned.</b> In this paper, we discuss how the student model is constructed and used for curriculum sequencing. ...|$|R
