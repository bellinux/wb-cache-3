40|$|The {{conceptual}} understandings of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral were examined for first-year {{junior high school}} students by analyzing concept maps, a test on <b>rock</b> names <b>and</b> a questionnaire on <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. Their understandings of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral were categorized into four groups defined by correct and incorrect understandings of the material and terminological structures of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. The students of the group defined by correct understanding of the material structure and incorrect understanding of the terminological structure think the terminological structure of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral as same as the material structure. Because minerals are materially included in rocks, they regard minerals {{as a sort of}} rocks. This misconception was possibly acquired through the lesson on the material structure of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. For correct understanding of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral, students have to learn both the material and terminological structures of <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. 中学 1 年生の岩石・鉱物の理解の仕方を岩石名調査，コンセプトマップ調査及びアンケート調査により調べた．その結果，生徒たちの岩石・鉱物に対する理解は，岩石・鉱物の物質的な構造の理解・不理解とそれらの用語の構造の理解・不理解の組み合わせで定義される四つのグループの中に位置づけられることが分かった．そして，そのうち，岩石・鉱物の物質的な構造の理解と用語の構造の不理解で定義されるグループに属する生徒の多くは，用語の構造を物質的な構造と同様に理解していることが分かった．そのような理解は岩石と鉱物の物質的な構造の学習により強化されたものと考えられる．学習者が岩石と鉱物を正しく理解するため，岩石と鉱物を混同しないためには，物質的な構造の学習のみでは不十分であり，岩石と鉱物の用語の構造の学習を伴わなければならない...|$|R
