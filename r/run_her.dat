5|$|Following The Painted Hills in 1951, MGM {{executives}} felt Lassie had <b>run</b> <b>her</b> {{course and}} planned no future films featuring the character. MGM executives then sought {{a way to}} break Weatherwax's contract. Weatherwax was concerned about protecting Pal and the Lassie image he had created from future diminishment {{at the hands of}} others. In lieu of US$40,000 in back pay owed him by the studio, Weatherwax bargained for and received the Lassie name and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Smith beyond what she writes of herself in the preface. She spent her life working as a cook or {{housekeeper}} in wealthy households, and unlike Elizabeth Raffald who left service to <b>run</b> <b>her</b> own shop, continued in that profession despite the success of her book. It is possible that she worked at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire. She is critical of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E

5|$|The crew of Apropos had <b>run</b> <b>her</b> ashore {{soon after}} Emerald {{had entered the}} harbour. The harbour {{batteries}} having been destroyed, Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and refloat the French ship. The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram, which had already encountered and dispersed 60 members of the schooner's crew, met Baird's party on the beach.

Emerald had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} start of the war with France, Monke sailed Speedwell to Hamburg to {{retrieve}} some British sailors rescued from various vessels that had wrecked on the coast of Jutland. He brought back about 100. Monke was forced to stay on deck day and night, although on the way back to Britain the weather was bad, to forestall any uprising by the rescued sailors.
