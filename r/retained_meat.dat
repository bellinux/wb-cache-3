5|$|The Norman Cob is {{also used}} for riding, and {{may be used for}} most equestrian disciplines. It is {{particularly}} well suited for vaulting. Elderly and nervous riders often appreciate the breed's calm temperament. Lighter Cobs can be used for mounted hunts. Crosses between the Norman Cob and Thoroughbred continue to be made to create saddle horses, generally with 25 to 50 percent Cob blood. Some Norman Cobs are bred for the meat market. The breed is sometimes preferred by butchers because of the lighter carcass weight and increased profitability over the Thoroughbred, {{while at the same time}} <b>retaining</b> <b>meat</b> similar in flavor and appearance to that of the Thoroughbred.|$|R
25|$|Harmless to humans, the barbeled houndshark is {{relatively}} common and probably of some economic {{importance in the}} West Africa region. It is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using hook-and-line, fixed-bottom gillnets, and bottom trawls. When <b>retained,</b> the <b>meat</b> is sold fresh, smoked, or dried and salted, and leather is made from the skin. The IUCN has assessed the barbeled houndshark as Near Threatened, noting that fishing pressure is intense throughout its range. However, no specific fishery data are available.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{components}} of the dish largely remain the same, the preparation of the dish can differ greatly. A pressure fryer or deep fryer can be used, although most restaurants serve a pan-fried product. Nearly all hot chicken is marinated in buttermilk to impart flavor and to <b>retain</b> the <b>meat's</b> juices upon frying. Some preparations of hot chicken are breaded and fried after application of the spice paste; the more traditional method has the paste applied immediately after the chicken is removed from the fryer.|$|R
50|$|The newer {{white area}} (Den hvide Kødby) is a 400 × 600 m enclave of white modernistic structures, built in 1934 {{to the design}} of city {{architect}} Poul Holsøe. The area is listed for conservation and is still serving its original purpose of housing businesses relating to the meat industry, such as the Inco cash and carry wholesale warehouse for the catering business and the Copenhagen Hospitality College. A municipal master plan aims at creating a mixed-use area, encouraging cultural, design, and gastronomy businesses to settle there, while <b>retaining</b> the <b>meat</b> industry.|$|R

50|$|The Malines {{originates}} {{in the southern}} part of the province of Antwerp and the northern part of the province of Brabant, in eastern Flanders. It derives from cross-breeding of local cuckoo-patterned farm chickens with several of the various types of Oriental chicken that began to be imported to Europe in the nineteenth century. From about 1852, cuckoo-patterned local chickens were crossed with birds which had been brought from Shanghai, China, to the zoological gardens of Antwerp. Later, Brahma, Langshan and Cochin birds were also used. The resulting birds had the large structure of the Oriental chickens, but <b>retained</b> the <b>meat</b> quality of the local stock. Selective breeding for type and colour began in 1891, and in 1898 the Malines received official recognition.|$|R
5000|$|M&M {{was founded}} by Michael [...] "Mac" [...] Voisin and Mark Nowak in Kitchener, Ontario, in 1980. Voisin and Nowak's {{original}} business model was to provide good quality meat at lower prices. The partners discovered that flash frozen <b>meats</b> <b>retained</b> their freshness with Canadian grown(health Canada safe) meats with no steroids, added preservatives and no torture farms. But because they could be stored over a longer term, could be sold at a price comparable to supermarket meats.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2013, {{after much}} speculation, it was {{reported}} that the Staples Center had agreed {{for the first time ever}} to make every vendor in the area 100% vegetarian for Morrissey's performance of 1 March, contractually having all McDonald's vendors close down. In a press release, Morrissey stated, [...] "I don't look upon it as a victory for me, but a victory for the animals". The request was previously denied to Paul McCartney. Despite these reports, the Staples Center <b>retained</b> some <b>meat</b> vendors while closing down McDonald's. Later in February, Morrissey cancelled an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after learning that the guests for that night also included the cast of Duck Dynasty, a show about a family who create duck calls for use in hunting. Morrissey referred to the cast as [...] "animal serial killers".|$|R
50|$|The White Polled Heath is well-suited {{to life on}} the moors and is even able, for example, to get {{itself out}} of bog holes. It is very hardy and can even walk through knee-high water. It is best suited to nature reserves, {{conservation}} areas and grazing of bogs and wet areas. Its meat is considered a delicacy, and is leaner and darker than that of other breeds of sheep. As a result of extensive rearing and feeding the <b>meat</b> <b>retains</b> a spicy, gamey flavour.|$|R

5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When <b>retained,</b> the <b>meat,</b> skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a fire using 'Iliahi (sandalwood) {{is built}} in a dirt pit called the imu. The pit is usually about 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 4 feet (1.2 m) wide and 3 ft (90 cm) deep. Rocks are then placed in the pit to retain cooking heat long after the flames have burned down. Once the rocks have become {{extremely}} hot, the hole is lined with traditional vegetation, such as banana leaves. The meat to be cooked is salted, stuffed with more hot rocks, then wrapped with ti and banana leaves. To maintain even heating and to <b>retain</b> the <b>meat's</b> natural moisture, the meat is covered with wet burlap, then {{with a layer of}} sand or soil. The meat is then left to cook in the pit for six to seven hours, absorbing smoke and steam from the koa wood and banana leaves. When the meat is fully cooked, it is removed from the imu and shredded. This is done to allow the melted fat to mix with the meat to help maintain its uniform consistency and flavor.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change could}} affect the costs and returns of {{livestock}} production by altering the thermal environment of animals thereby affecting animal health, reproduction, and the efficiency by which livestock convert feed into <b>retained</b> products (especially <b>meat</b> and milk). In the United States, concentrated livestock operations are located {{in a variety of}} climatic regions, suggesting that the industry could adapt to future changes in temperature and weather patterns resulting from global warming. However, this adaption could be costly. We use nationally representative data on dairy producers coupled with finely-scaled climate data to empirically examine how producers’ costs, returns, and production systems vary across U.

40|$|Sixteen Podolian young bulls {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} two {{different}} feeding systems on fatty acids composition and oxidative stability of meat: C group, eight young bulls were kept indoors and fed with commercial concentrate for all experimental period (260 days); PC group, eight young bulls were allowed to graze a pasture for 200 days and shifted indoor, fed with concentrate, 60 days before being slaughtered. Meat from young bulls that were allowed, before stall finishing with concentrate, to graze a natural pasture showed lower levels of some n- 6 PUFA and higher levels of some n- 3 PUFA than meat from animals that were offered only concentrate for the whole experimental period. Lipid oxidation was not affected by the dietary treatment.

40|$|Solid heavy paste, a {{byproduct}} of crude palm oil processing, is found in an excessive amount in Central Kalimantan. It is estimated that 400 tons of this material were produced per day by crude palm oil (CPO) factories in this region. This material contains 12. 63 - 17. 41 % crude protein, 9. 98 - 25. 79 % crude fiber, 7. 12 - 15. 15 % crude fat, 3217 - 3454 kcal/kg (gross energy) and 1. 5 % CPO. Considering its composition, this material {{can be used as}} an ingridient in broiler’s diet. This study was conducted on broiler chickens of Hubbard strain in Kapuas district. The objectives of the experiment were to study the cholesterol, fatty acid and vitamin A <b>retained</b> in <b>meat</b> and liver of broilers as a result of feeding ration containing solid heavy paste. This experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design. The treatments were levels of solid in the diet, i. e., 0. 0, 12. 5, 25 and 37. 5 %. Four hundred broilers were divided into 4 treatmen groups with 5 replications, consisted of 20 chickens in each replication. Data was analyzed based on statistical and descriptive analyses. The results of this experiment indicated that 25 % solid in the diet decreased the total fat and cholesterol in the meat and liver, but increased polyunsaturated fatty acid contained in meat. The highest contain of vitamin A in meat and liver was found in the group that received diet containing 12. 5 % solid...|$|R
40|$|Spectrophotometric {{measures}} {{were used to}} determine the redness:browness (R 630 /R 580) of 4238 lamb longissimus muscle after 3 days under simulated display. The results were analysed using linear mixed effects models. Environmental factors represented by effects such as kill group and site of production produced the greatest variation of up to 2. 76 units in R 630 /R 580. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, reflecting muscle oxidative capacity, reduced R 630 /R 580 by 0. 5 units. Selection for high muscling sires increased R 630 /R 580 by 0. 27 units, likely due to changes in muscle oxidative capacity. Lamb carcass weight also increased R 630 /R 580 by 0. 5 units. Analysis of genotypic factors influencing lamb size and growth rate such as sire type and dam breed further supported that increased growth rate improves meat R 630 /R 580. Our findings suggest that breeding for increased growth rate and increased muscle weight could result in Australian lamb <b>meat</b> <b>retaining</b> its red colour for extended periods whilst on display...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of increasing levels of dietary calcium on performance, egg quality, and the amount of calcium <b>retained</b> in the <b>meat</b> and excreted by Japanese quails at the final production. Four hundred 46 - 58 -week-old Japanese quails were distributed in a completely randomized design consisting of five calcium level treatments: T 1 = 2. 95 %, T 2 = 3. 25 %, T 3 = 3. 55 %, T 4 = 3. 85 % and T 5 = 4. 15 % calcium. The performance variables included feed intake (g bird- 1 day- 1), egg production (%), feed conversion by egg mass and per dozen eggs, egg mass (g), and viability. For egg quality, we assessed egg weight, percentage of albumen, yolk weight, percentage of shell, and shell thickness. We also evaluated the amount of calcium present in the meat and the amount of calcium excreted by quails. Increasing levels of calcium linearly influenced feed conversion, weight of yolk, and percentage of eggshell. Shell thickness increased up to the 3. 85 % calcium treatment. Calcium content of the meat differed among the quails; the quails fed the lowest level of calcium (2. 95 %) showed higher calcium content in meat, whereas calcium excretion increased with increasing levels of calcium in the diet. In conclusion, the addition of 3. 85 % of calcium in quail feed at the end of production improved eggshell quality, and maintained internal quality and performance within the recommended standards for the production phase tested in quails. Levels higher than 3. 85 % calcium negatively influenced the parameters analyzed...|$|R
