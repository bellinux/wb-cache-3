25|$|In 1962, the United States Marine Corps held a {{competition}} {{to choose an}} assault support helicopter to replace the Cessna O-1 fixed-wing aircraft and the Kaman OH-43D helicopter. The winner was the UH-1B, which was already in service with the Army. The helicopter was designated the UH-1E and modified to meet Marine requirements. The major changes included the use of all-aluminum construction for corrosion resistance, radios compatible with Marine Corps ground frequencies, a <b>rotor</b> <b>brake</b> for shipboard use to stop the rotor quickly on shutdown and a roof-mounted rescue hoist.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{equipment}} can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, baggage compartment extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, <b>rotor</b> <b>brake,</b> multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable landing light, emergency floatation equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting belly tank, and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear {{seats in the}} cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted {{for a total of}} five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.|$|E
500|$|The CH-47Fs have {{generally}} similar performance to the CH-47Ds. However, the F variant {{was designed to}} be easier to maintain and deploy. Its fuselage comprises a small number of machined components, rather than the large number of fabricated sections of sheet metal used in the D variant, which reduces vibration and structural cracking. The F variant also includes more advanced avionics as well as design features which enable the helicopters to be more quickly prepared to be transported within a cargo aircraft. The first seven Australian CH-47Fs are fitted with <b>rotor</b> <b>brakes</b> and other equipment to better enable them to operate from the Royal Australian Navy's Canberra class landing helicopter dock vessels, but are otherwise identical to those operated by the US Army. The second tranche of three CH-47Fs are not fitted with <b>rotor</b> <b>brakes</b> as they were taken directly from the production line of helicopters for the US Army. As of 2017, it was planned to fit these helicopters with <b>rotor</b> <b>brakes</b> by 2020.|$|R

For automotive field, {{the technology of}} engine develops very fast even {{the system of the}} car, luxury or comforts everything that develops by the innovation of engineer. Although the engineer gives priority for safety measure, but most consumers still have inadequate of knowledge in safety system. Thus safety is the first important thing we must focus. This paper is presented with “Thermal analysis of Disc <b>Brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> with slot shape optimization ” which studies about on disc <b>brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> by analysis of different shapes of slots of different vehicle’s Disc <b>Brake</b> <b>Rotor.</b> Therefore, we can optimize number of shapes of slots to estimate the good thermal conductivity of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>Rotor.</b> In this paper, Thermal analysis done on real model of Disc <b>Brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> of Bajaj Pulsar 220 and Thermal analysis of disc <b>brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> of different shapes of slots of different vehicle’s in one Disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Different shapes of slots are because of to reduce the weight of disc rotor and for good thermal conductivity.

25|$|A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo {{turboshaft}} engines {{power the}} Puma's four-blade main rotor. The helicopter's rotors are driven {{at a speed}} of roughly 265 rpm via a five reduction stage transmission. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the rotor shaft and the anti-vibration measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade inspection system, which guarded against and alerted crews to fatigue cracking in the rotor blades. There are two hydraulic systems on board, these operate entirely independent of one another, one system powers only the aircraft's flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, <b>rotor</b> <b>brake,</b> and the flight controls.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} automotive ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Disc <b>brakes</b> operate {{on the principle of}} friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The main objective of a disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> is to store this heat energy and dissipate it as soon as possible. This work is carried out in a area where there is very limited understanding. Commercial CFD code FLUENT was used for carrying out the simulations with the rotor rotating in still air. Only one passage and blade were simulated as all the rotor passages were identical. Uniform temperatures were used on the rotor to simulate the braking condition. Sixteen different blade angle sets were simulated and the range of blade angles having the best aero-thermal performance were identified using mass flow rate, rate of heat dissipation and temperature uniformity as performance metrics. The effect of rotational speed and rotor temperature (corresponding to various braking conditions) on the aero-thermal performance was evaluated. The rotor speed and temperature were observed to have significant effect on the rotor performance. The number of blades in the ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> was also varied and was observed {{to have an impact on}} the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Detailed design changes like inlet chamfer, blade leading edge rounding, and variable thickness blade and passage aspect ratio were incorporated. All these changes did have an effect on the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> The inlet chamfer and the leading edge rounding improved both the rate of heat transfer and the temperature uniformity. The variable thickness blade and the lower aspect ratio passage improved the temperature uniformity of the rotor...|$|R

40|$|For active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) to be {{used with}} confidence in industrial applications, the safe failure of the AMB system should be guaranteed. The exact behaviour of the rotor on the backup bearings (BBs) is relatively uncertain [1, 2, 3]. Uncertainty in a failure situation means that the safe failure of the AMB system cannot be guaranteed. The purpose of the presented rotor delevitation simulation model (RDSim model) is to eliminate some of the uncertainties associated with a rotor delevitation event. The simulation model includes a flexible rotor model [4], a non-linear AMB model [5], a non-linear BB model, stator effects, active <b>rotor</b> <b>braking,</b> <b>rotor</b> free running, inner race speed up, AMB/BB load sharing and sudden unbalance (blade-loss simulation). The RDSim model can be used to simulate any AMB failure on one or more locations. The failure modes include power amplifier (PA) malfunction, AMB coil short-circuit, total power failure and controller failure. This paper will discuss the BBSim model; a brief explanation of each of the sub-models of the BBSim model is also given. [URL]...|$|R

High resolution infrared thermography was {{used to analyze the}} thermal response of a vented brake disk (made of gray cast iron) during sudden braking. This research was conducted to test <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> made of a new gray iron alloy. Experience with current rotors has shown the formation of cracks due to thermal stresses developed during braking episodes. Such crack results in the shortening of the service life of the <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> but also and most importantly they may constitute a safety risk to the people using a vehicle with damaged <b>brake</b> <b>rotors.</b> Results from the thermal characterization reveal that our approach to minimize cracking during braking episodes is the correct one. ej 201...|$|R
