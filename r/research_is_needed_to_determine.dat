5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. Further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at {{the close of the}} 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. <b>Research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though more <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E

25|$|Weidemeyer's admiral {{butterfly}} (Limenitis weidemeyerii) is {{only known}} {{to exist in}} Canada within the Milk River watershed, {{as well as the}} yucca moth mentioned previously. An estimated population of 3000 adult Weidemeyer's admiral adults exist in a total approximate total occupied area of less than one square kilometer, and are susceptible to extreme natural weather events or drought. They are ranked as a species of special concern provincially in Alberta and nationally in Canada but a knowledge gap exists and further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> more accurate numbers and range.|$|E

In the longer term, high-dose niacin use may persistently lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, but more <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the extent of this effect.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{speculate that}} abnormalities or {{deficiencies in the}} receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors {{that appear to be}} related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for benzodiazepines, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord. More <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to myoclonus.|$|E

25|$|Response–stimulus {{interval}} (RSI) {{is another}} form of data {{that is used to}} quantify negative priming. RSI is the time difference between the response to prime target and the onset of probe trial. Negative priming effects are observed for delays of 20 millisecond to 8000 millisecond between the prime trial and the probe trial. Several experiments found that negative priming decays rapidly during this delay between prime and probe trials. Many studies have tried to find a rate of this decay but have not been successful. Researchers of both the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model use varying results of the RSI effects to justify the decay as a part of their model. More globally accepted <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> concrete RSI data and establish short-term and long-term negative priming limits.|$|E
25|$|German {{historian}} Rüdiger Overmans {{published a}} study of German military casualties, this project did not investigate civilian expulsion deaths. Overmans did however provide a critical analysis of the previous studies by German government of the human losses in the expulsions. Overmans maintains that these studies lack adequate support, he maintains that a figure of 500,000 expulsion dead is credible {{and that there are}} more arguments for the lower figures rather than the higher figures, he believes that new <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the correct balance of the human losses in the expulsions. According to Overmans the figure of 1.9 million missing persons reported by the search service is unreliable as it includes military dead and persons of dubious German ancestry who were not expelled after the war but remained in eastern Europe, also the figures for expellees living in the GDR was understated.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} educational approach {{informed by}} cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex {{data to be}} presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – bits of information – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. [...] In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the course content, a hypertext document that allowed the learners to access content in a self-directed manner. These [...] (CFH) provide a “three-dimensional” and “open-ended” representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains.|$|E
500|$|Joel Asaph Allen first {{described}} Oryzomys mexicanus {{as a full}} species in 1897 from specimens from Jalisco. In the same publication, he also described Oryzomys bulleri from nearby Nayarit, {{but he did not}} compare the two with each other. Merriam added a second species from Nayarit, Oryzomys rufus, in 1901, noting that it was smaller and more reddish than mexicanus. Goldman synonymized the three as O.couesi mexicanus in 1918 and in 2009 Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred, arguing that the differences between rufus and mexicanus were age-related and within the normal range of variation of the animal. Another subspecies, Oryzomys couesi lambi, was described by Burt in 1934 from central coastal Sonora, which extended the range of the species by [...] at the time. This form is dark gray-brown, much darker than mexicanus, and has a shorter tail and weaker jugals. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that it is similar to mexicanus, but that further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether it should be recognized as a subspecies. Large O.couesi from northern Sinaloa may also belong to this form. Goldman wrote that mexicanus was very similar to nominate couesi, but usually with paler fur; the upperparts are more buffy than in couesi and the underparts are usually white, but may be buffy, the normal color in couesi.|$|E

[...] An article that appeared in The (Pittsburgh) Gazette Times in December 1908 described Hogan's reasons for leaving the organization. [...] "There were too many directors connected with the Zanesville club to suit Hogan, as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run", the paper reported. [...] "As Hogan has his own, which did not exactly coincide with the numerous directors, he resigned". [...] The Gazette Times praised Hogan's performance in Zanesville, stating that his club [...] "was a pennant contender at all stages of the championship race". [...] The paper added: [...] "He did not have a very good team, but kept the men playing the game at all times and was really the wonder of the [...] league".|$|E
