Baxter's work was further explored from different angles by Gian-Carlo Rota, Pierre Cartier, and Frederic V. Atkinson, among others.

5000|$|Circuitscape is an {{open source}} program that uses circuit theory to predict {{connectivity}} in heterogeneous landscapes for individual movement, gene flow, and conservation planning. Circuit theory offers several advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>theory</b> {{and an ability to}} evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with low resistances assigned to habitats that are most permeable to movement or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to poor dispersal habitat or to movement barriers. Effective resistances, current densities, and voltages calculated across the landscapes can then be related to ecological processes, such as individual movement and gene flow.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{correlated}} <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>theory,</b> {{for transport}} in random networks, is developed here also for cubic networks. A comparison of correlated <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>theory</b> and effective medium theory predictions for cubic networks with simulation results shows {{the latter to}} be more accurate in general. For random networks a hybrid alternative, combining the effective medium and correlated random walk theories, is formulated and found to compare better with simulation results. However, under normal conditions, in which percolation effects are not dominant, the correlated <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>theory</b> {{is found to be}} adequate. Under conditions involving positional variations in pore structure, or non-linear field-variable-dependent flux laws, the correlated <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>theory</b> appears as the only analytical alternative. Based on this theory, an accurate semi-empirical expression for the conduction threshold is also developed, suggesting directions for its further development incorporating the considerations of disorder...|$|E

40|$|Given a <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> on a graph, {{the cover}} {{time is the}} first time (number of steps) that every vertex has been hit (covered) by the walk. Define the marking time for the walk as follows. When the walk reaches vertex v i, a coin is flipped and with {{probability}} p i the vertex is marked (or colored). We study the time that every vertex is marked. (When all the p i 's are equal to 1, this gives the usual cover time problem.) General formulas are given for the marking time of a graph. Connections are made with the generalized coupon collector's problem. Asymptotics for small p i 's are given.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{recently}} introduced logarithmic metrics used to predict disease arrival times on complex networks are approximations of more general network-based measures derived from <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> <b>theory.</b> Using the daily air-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the infection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by accounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The comparison with direct simulations of arrival times reveals a higher correlation compared to the shortest path approach used previously. In addition our method allows to connect fundamental observables in epidemic spreading with the cumulant generating function of the hitting time for a Markov chain. Our results provides a general and computationally efficient approach to the problem using only algebraic methods. Comment: F. I. and A. K. contributed equally to this work.
