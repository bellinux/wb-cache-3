5|$|Jeopardy! is an American {{television}} {{game show}} created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants {{are presented with}} general knowledge clues {{in the form of}} answers, and must phrase their <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by Sony Pictures Television, premiered on September 10, 1984, and is still airing.|$|E

5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future <b>responses.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E

25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced.

The <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin D {{comes in}} two forms.

Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms {{may or may not be}} bioequivalent.

In 1948, Raymond P. Ahlquist published a seminal paper concluding his findings, that there were two distinct receptors for catecholamine drugs, and they caused different <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart muscle. He labeled them α-and β-adrenoceptors. These findings were soon to be a foundation for further research into drug development.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{strategy}} {{that is based on}} risk is portfolio theory. This suggests that a reasonable response to uncertainty is to have a wide portfolio of possible <b>responses.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of climate change, mitigation can be viewed as an effort to reduce the chance of climate change impacts (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.24). Adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur. The risk associated with these impacts can also be spread. As part of a policy portfolio, climate research can help when making future decisions. Technology research can help to lower future costs.|$|E
