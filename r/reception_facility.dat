Due to dilapidated sanitary installations {{and issues of}} monument protection this was declined at first; instead parts of the rooms used by the Academy of the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart (see below) were rededicated as refugees home. In 2015, the number of refugees rose steeply. In July and August 2015 {{a part of the}} former abbey rooms was cut off and prepared to serve as additional Bedarfsorientierte Erstaufnahmeeinrichtung (BEA) (auxiliary first admittance/initial <b>reception</b> <b>facility</b> for refugees).

25|$|Broxhead House {{was built}} by Admiral Thomas Foley, hero of the Battle of the Nile, in 1877. After {{purchase}} of the Broxhead estate in November 1902 by the War Department, the house {{was used by the}} general officer commanding, and later the brigade commander of the garrison. From the start of World War II, it was used as the local divisional headquarters, until that was moved in November 1940 to Batts Hall, Frensham. It was then made the UK headquarters for the Canadian Army in Europe. At the end of the war, it was initially used as a medical <b>reception</b> <b>facility,</b> and then as an officers hotel. At the start of 1952 it became the Central Volunteer Headquarters (CVHQ)of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Territorial Army, until they moved to Louisburg Barracks in 1979. In 1981 Molex bought Wolfe Lodge and then Broxhead House, with the house demolished in 1983 to make way for new laboratories. The site is now named Lion Court.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2006, MEPC 54 {{emphasized}} {{the value of}} <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> that would exceed expectations {{in the implementation of}} MARPOL, and introduced a policy of [...] "zero tolerance of illegal discharges from ships" [...] that could only be enforced when there were adequate <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> in ports. Therefore, the Committee urged all Parties to MARPOL, particularly port States, to fulfill their treaty obligations to provide <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> for wastes generated during the normal operation of ships.|$|R

50|$|MARPOL {{states that}} {{contaminants}} cannot be discharged {{into the ocean}} {{in line with the}} requirements stated in its annexes should be dropped of at port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities.</b> It also says that port States need to ensure that there are enough port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> throughout the area to help with convenience.|$|R
50|$|A {{new plan}} {{to manage the}} waste must be found and ships must be {{encouraged}} to use the port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> rather than to discharge waste anywhere in the ocean. As a response, the European Community adopted the Directive 2000/59/EC on port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> {{with the goal of}} eliminating discharges of ship-generated residues into the ocean. The Directive is especially aimed at increasing the prevalence and use of port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities,</b> thereby securing a cleaner and more sustainable marine environment. These ideologies were previously addressed by the MARPOL 73/78 Convention in 1973, however Member States are still encountering difficulties in fully implementing the requirements.|$|R
25|$|It is also {{possible}} for ships to discharge ballast at approved shore <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> in ports, as article 5 requires that when cleaning or repair of a ships ballast tanks occurs, ports should have adequate <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> for the sediments. Facilities must include safe disposal arrangements, storage and treatment equipment, safe and suitable mooring and emergency arrangements and the necessary reducers for connections to ships.|$|R

The model evaluates the readiness of the port to changes brought by the amendments of MARPOL Annex IV. The scientific problem comes with perception of adequacy. Resolution MEPC. 200 (62) amending MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex IV states, that port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> must be adequate {{to the needs of}} passenger ships using them without causing undue delay. Concept of adequacy is not defined, therefore other guidelines explaining adequacy were used: EU directive 2000 / 59 /EC and IMO resolution MEPC. 83 (44) Guidelines for ensuring adequacy of port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities.</b> Based on these sources, criteria that must be met to ensure adequacy were identified and tested in article: 1) <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> meet needs of ships normally using them; 2) discharge of sewage does to cause undue delay; 3) <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> does not provide disincentive to use them; 4) facilities are accessible; 5) facilities contribute to the improvement of the marine environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} comply fully with the {{discharge}} requirements {{set out in}} the MARPOL 73 / 78 Convention depends upon the availability of adequate facilities on land for the reception of shipgenerated waste. This paper considers ways of ensuring adequate provision of <b>reception</b> <b>facilities,</b> and discusses the approach taken by the UK {{to reduce the amount of}} pollution entering the marine environment from the deliberate discharge of waste from ships. Arguably, the most significant of the measures adopted by the UK is the requirement for all ports and harbours to prepare port waste management plans. Disincentives to the use of port waste <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> are examined, together with the benefits and shortcomings of various financing arrangements, and compulsory discharge of waste in ports. The paper concludes that the statutory approach to improving the provision and use of waste facilities should be supported by an appropriate awareness campaign to educate shipowners about the need to discharge waste legally to port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities.</b> Port waste <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> MARPOL 73 / 78 Port waste management planning...|$|R

The evaluation is based primarily on original survey data from the autumn of 2002 which followed on from a similar survey conducted in the summer of 2000. The EU Directive on port <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> for ship-generated waste etc. (Directive 2000 / 59 /EC) was due to enter into force in December 2002, and required all EU ports to provide <b>reception</b> <b>facilities</b> to meet the needs of the vessels normally calling in at them.
