5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most {{closely related to the}} porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). This finding adds to a growing consensus that the genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E

5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, but the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E

50|$|Another Christianizing {{influence}} was <b>the</b> mass emigration <b>of</b> Danes to England and Normandy in the Viking years. Thousands of Danes settled in east central England and in northern France displacing or intermarrying with the locals who were Christian. Once {{part of a}} Danish clan became Christian, it often meant that <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family's</b> view toward Christianity softened.|$|R

Meera, being her respectful self, bears the insults silently.|$|E

5|$|His mother {{cultivated}} the family's small {{plot of land}} and, {{like many}} women of the area, commuted {{three times a year}} to the Po Valley to work in its rice fields. Despite the Ponticelli family's hard work, they were impoverished and the children often went to bed on an empty stomach. When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living.

5|$|Judah and two {{siblings}} were boarded {{with relatives}} in Fayetteville for about 18 {{months after the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among {{the founders of the}} first Reform congregation in the United States, with shorter services conducted in English rather than Hebrew. Philip was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep the Sabbath, and the extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain.
