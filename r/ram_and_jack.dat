40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} species specificity of prostate-specific antigen in the semen of <b>ram,</b> <b>jack</b> <b>and</b> human. A comparative study of undiluted and diluted semen from ejaculates of <b>rams,</b> male donkeys (<b>jacks)</b> <b>and</b> human, was performed. The species specificity of PSA was done with the specific membrane test SERATEC ® PSA Semiquant, SERATEC, Gesellschaft für Biotechnologie mbH, Göttingen, Germany. Our results showed the lack of cross reactivity between PSA in semen from <b>ram,</b> <b>jack</b> <b>and</b> human. The SERATEC ® PSA Semiquant test is human-specific and not appropriate for detection of prostate-specific antigen in ether ram or jack semen...|$|R
