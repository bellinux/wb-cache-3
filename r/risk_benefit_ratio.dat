40|$|AbstractSubstantial {{progress}} has been made in the past decade in treating several primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) with gene therapy. Current approaches are based on ex-vivo transfer of therapeutic transgene via viral vectors to patient-derived autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) followed by transplantation back to the patient with or without conditioning. The overall outcome from all the clinical trials targeting different PIDs has been extremely encouraging but not without caveats. Malignant outcomes from insertional mutagenesis have featured prominently in the adverse events associated with these trials and have warranted intense pre-clinical investigation into defining the tendencies of different viral vectors for genomic integration. Coupled with issues pertaining to transgene expression, the therapeutic landscape has undergone a paradigm shift in determining safety, stability and efficacy of gene therapy approaches. In this review, we aim to summarize the progress made in the gene therapy trials targeting ADA-SCID, SCID-X 1, CGD and WAS, review the pitfalls, and outline the recent advancements which are expected to further enhance favourable <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>ratios</b> for gene therapeutic approaches in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract There is {{an ongoing}} debate {{concerning}} the <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>ratio</b> of psychopharmacologic compounds. With respect to the benefit, recent reports and meta-analyses note only small effect sizes with comparably high placebo response rates in the psychiatric field.

In a recently published article, Leucht and his colleagues compare the efficacy of psychotropic drugs with the efficacy of common general medicine drugs in different indications according to results from reviewed meta-analyses. The authors conclude that, overall, the psychiatric drugs were generally not less effective than most other medical drugs. This article will highlight some of the results of this systematic review and discuss the limitations and the impact of this important approach on the above mentioned debate. </p...|$|E

40|$|Achilles {{tendinopathy}} (AT) is {{the most}} common cause of posterior heel pain. It is most often due to mechanical stress related to overload or overuse of muscle-tendon unit.

Pain secondary to AT is generally located in the corporeal part of the tendon or its attachment to the bone and is worsened by exercise. Examination can reveal a painful swelling or thickening on palpation. Additional tests are not routinely recommended but may be useful. Treatment should be tailored to the stage of tendinopathy and to functional disability, and should include an assessment of predisposing factors, analgesia and physiotherapy. Other treatments (shock waves, ultrasound) are less well documented. The indications and effectiveness of infiltrations are controversial and are reserved for chronic AT.

Importantly, only 13  % of technologists gave the correct answer, and a significant proportion of the participants suggested medical termination of pregnancy as an option. The knowledge was variable among other groups (residents, fellows and staff radiologists) in the range of 60 – 85  %. This is highly important, as the technologists come into close contact with the patients in the radiology department and they should have adequate knowledge on radiation exposure during pregnancy and should ideally be trained enough for answering patients’ concerns and arranging a discussion with the radiologist.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{substantial}} increase in the use of atypical antipsychotics among children and adolescents. The reason for this rising trend is mainly due to better tolerance and lower rates of extra pyramidal side-effects compared to first generation antipsychotics, the increase in the diagnosis of psychotic and bipolar disorders in youth, and the use of low doses of atypical antipsychotics in autistic and mentally retarded children with behavioural problems and in disruptive behavioural disorders [1]. However, care should be taken to judicious assessment of the <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>ratio</b> before prescribing these agents as the adverse effects associated with atypical antipsychotics, especially weight gain and other metabolic side effects, may have significant adverse long term implications. Children and adolescents who use atypical antipsychotics run a significantly higher risk of developing the metabolic syndrome [2, 3].

40|$|Purpose of review: The {{purpose of}} this review was to examine statin therapy and the risk for {{diabetes}} among adult women using a selective review.
