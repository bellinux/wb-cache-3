5|$|An October 2001 {{survey of}} Mahanoy Creek {{identified}} {{two species of}} fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed {{at the mouth of}} the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the <b>rosyface</b> <b>shiner,</b> the river chub, the banded darter, and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E

5000|$|The carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is a {{freshwater}} fish species. In Manitoba, {{it was once}} known as the <b>rosyface</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis rubellus). It is now recognized as a different species within the <b>rosyface</b> <b>shiner</b> species complex, largely based on zoogeographic information.

50|$|The <b>rosyface</b> <b>shiner</b> is an {{omnivorous}} {{fish and}} {{has been reported to}} eat insects such as caddis fly larvae, mayfly nymphs, diptera, fish eggs, algae, diatoms, and other organic material, although insects make up a large majority of its diet. They are known to feed on insects {{on the surface of the}} water including terrestrial insects that fall into the water, but will also feed in mid-waters as well. They have even been known to jump out of the water to capture flying insects. In a study conducted by Roger J. Reed in 1957 rosyface shiners were reported to have 20% of fish with full stomachs during the months of late April to late May during pre-spawning activities. Feeding activities then picked back up again post-spawning in mid-June with 80% of the population having full stomachs.|$|E
5000|$|The Red Cedar River is a {{familiar}} campus landmark at Michigan State University. The name of the river is featured in {{the first line of}} MSU's fight song, and MSU students can be found studying in the parkland along its banks. A number of student activities centered around the Red Cedar over the course of MSU's history, including freshman vs. sophomore [...] "tug-o-war" [...] spanning the river and a Water Carnival featuring student made floats drifting in procession. People on campus frequently feed the large community of mallard ducks that congregate near the river. Wildlife in the river includes 33 species of fish and various other aquatic animals, and study of the river and its ecosystem is incorporated into relevant areas of the university's curricula. Fishing was banned on the campus in the 1960s; the ban was rescinded for a section of the river in 2013. The river is popular in the summer for canoeing and kayaking. (The campus canoe dock is self-mockingly named Red Cedar Yacht Club.) During floods, the river forms a standing wave at the campus dam that can be surfed. In the winter, the river often freezes over and students walk or play on the ice despite the inherent danger. During its inaugural season in 1922, the MSU hockey team played games on the frozen river. Alongside the river on MSU's campus is the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden, the oldest continuous botanical garden in the United States. The garden was started in 1873. A variety of species of fish {{can be found in the}} Red Cedar River. From December 1979 to 1981, Dr. Patrick M. Muzzall from MSU's zoology department collected the following species: white sucker, northern hog sucker, spotted sucker, golden redhorse, silver redhorse, rock bass, green sunfish, pumpkin seed, warmouth, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, stoneroller, carp, hornyhead chub, common shiner, <b>rosyface</b> <b>shiner,</b> sand shiner, bluntnose minnow, blacknose dace, creek chub, grass pickerel, brook stickleback, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rainbow darter, johnny darter, yellow perch, blackside darter, and central mudminnow.|$|E
