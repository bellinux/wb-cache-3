25|$|Despite its {{widespread}} {{use as a}} metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable {{in the presence of}} metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry, when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point in a <b>reflux</b> <b>condenser</b> and observing decomposition. The first widely used stabilizing additive was dioxane; however, its use was patented by Dow Chemical Company and could not be used by other manufacturers. Considerable research took place in the 1960s to develop alternative stabilizers for trichloroethylene. Other chemical stabilizers include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone.|$|E

The <b>reflux</b> <b>condenser</b> contains water heated at 60 °C, which condenses unreacted propanol, but allows propionaldehyde to pass. The propionaldehyde vapor is immediately condensed into a suitable receiver. In this arrangement, any propionaldehyde formed is immediately removed from the reactor, thus it does not get over-oxidized to propionic acid.|$|E

The LiFePO 4 {{nanoparticles}} {{with high}} crystallinity were prepared using polyol process without any further heating as a post step, which will greatly economize {{in time and}} energy comparing with other conventional synthesis method. The temperature of the polyol solution was rapidly increased up to 550 K and maintained for 24 h in a round-bottomed flask attached to <b>refluxing</b> <b>condenser</b> to obtain nanoparticles.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples showed the needled and flaky shapes of particles with uniform size in the range of 50 - 250 nm. It is noted that the nanoparticle was in favor of shortening the diffusion path to improve electrochemical performance.

40|$|The {{document}} {{deals with}} the analysis of an experiment to be performed in LOBI ITF in the configuration Mode 2. LOBI was a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) simulator installed in the EC center of Ispra Italy financially supported by EURATOM. The configuration Mod 2 of LOBI {{was designed as a}} consequence of the Three Mile accident in US and is the follow-up of the configuration Mod 1. Mod 2 was designed to simulate stratification phenomena and natural circulation which are important during Small Break Loss of Coolant Accidents (SBLOCA); as a difference Mod 1 was designed to simulate phenomena expected during Large Break Loss of Coolant (LBLOCA) scenarios. Namely downcomer size in Mod 2 was much smaller than in the case of Mod 1 and a large number of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were installed in Mod 2. The concerned A 2 - 77 Natural Circulation (NC) experiment was performed to model as far as possible the PWR performance. Various phase of NC were identified and brought to important findings in Nuclear Reactor Safety, including the characterization of instabilities and the <b>reflux</b> <b>condensing</b> mode.

This investigation was undertaken {{because there are}} no existing data and/or prediction methods that are applicable for these shell-and-tube condensers commonly used in the process industries. To obtain these estimates, existing design methods published in the open literature were used. The major findings are that (1) surface-area reductions can almost approach the single-phase heat transfer enhancement level, and (2) vapor-release reductions can approach a factor of four. The important implication is that enhanced tubes appear to be very cost effective for addressing the recovery of volatile organic vapors (VOCs), and for a vast number of different reflux-condenser applications...|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} Schlenk flask is a round bottom, pear-shaped, or tubular flask with {{a ground}} glass joint and a side arm. The side arm contains a valve, usually a greased stopcock, {{used to control}} the flask's exposure to a manifold or the atmosphere. This allows a material {{to be added to}} a flask through the ground glass joint, which is then capped with a septum. This operation can, for example, be done in a glove box. The flask can then be removed from the glove box and taken to a Schlenk line. Once connected to the Schlenk line, the inert gas and/or vacuum {{can be applied to the}} flask as required. While the flask is connected to the line under a positive pressure of inert gas, the septum can be replaced with other apparatus, for example a <b>reflux</b> <b>condenser.</b> Once the manipulations are complete, the contents can be vacuum dried and placed under a static vacuum by closing the side arm valve. These evacuated flasks can be taken back into a glove box for further manipulation or storage of the flasks' contents.|$|E
50|$|The tube-like {{structure}} is often bent {{and can also}} widen to form a bulb/desiccant reservoir. Typically a drying tube is 1-2 cm wide and 5-10 cm long and bent at an angle of about 90 degrees. In use, the drying tube is filled with a rechargeable desiccant such as calcium chloride, and the open end of drying tube is partially blocked (e.g. with wool, glasswool or a bung/cork which has a small bore made in it) and the drying tube {{is connected to the}} apparatus to be kept dry via the ground glass joint. If the drying tube is bent the bend is oriented so that solid desiccant does not fall into the reaction vessel. Some drying tubes have a glass sinter to prevent desiccant falling into the reaction vessel. Drying tubes are often prepared in advance and the desiccant can be replaced when exhausted. Reactions which are being heated, or which evolve gases, must never be sealed because an overpressure may shatter the vessel. Drying tubes are usually fitted on top of the <b>reflux</b> <b>condenser,</b> allowing the pressure to be relieved while excluding atmospheric moisture.|$|E

One example of the sol-gel method in use today is the sensing of air acidity. The sol-gel is made with an organic dye, (2-phenylazobenzoic acid). The dye has a pH color range of 6.7-8.7. This means that below a pH of 6.7 you see one color, in this case a red-pink, and at a pH higher than 8.7 you see a different color, in this case yellow, and you see a changing orange in between.

40|$|A novel {{biofilter}} that removes ammonia {{from air}} streams and converts it to nitrogen gas {{has been developed}} and operated continuously for 300 days. The ammonia from the incoming up-flow air stream is first absorbed into water and the carrier material, zeolite. A continuous gravity <b>reflux</b> of <b>condensed</b> water from the exit of the biofilter provides moisture for nitrifying bacteria to develop and convert dissolved ammonia (ammonium) to nitrite/nitrate. The down-flow of the <b>condensed</b> water <b>reflux</b> washes down nitrite/nitrate preventing ammonium and nitrite/nitrate accumulation at the top region of the biofilter. The evaporation caused by the inflow air leads to the accumulation of nitrite to extremely high concentrations {{in the bottom of}} the biofilter. The high nitrite concentrations favour the spontaneous chemical oxidation of ammonium by nitrite to nitrogen (N 2). Tests showed that this chemical reaction was catalysed by the zeolite filter medium and allowed it to take place at room temperature. This study shows that ammonia can be removed from air streams and converted to N 2 in a fully aerated single step biofilter. The process also overcomes the problem of microorganism-inhibition and resulted in zero leachate production...|$|R
40|$|Butadiene 1 : 3 is {{separated}} from other C 4 -hydrocarbons by extractive distillation in a sieve plate tower. Prior to the development work to be described, the pressure in the extraction tower was controlled at a fixed value. The tower pressure-boilup control loop did not behave satisfactorily {{in the presence of}} non-condensables which entered with the feed. The capacity of the flooded <b>reflux</b> drum <b>condenser</b> for the tower was limiting production during summer months. The tower pressure control loop was put on manual. The pressure was allowed to drop to its lowest attainable value for the existing conditions of boilup and condenser cooling capability. This manner of operation is known as floating pressure control. By taking advantage of the higher relative volatility at the lower tower pressure, energy usage was reduced and there was an increase in production capacity. The tower operation at a lower temperature reduced tower and reboiler fouling. Substantial savings have resulted from these improvements. The annual energy consumption has been reduced by 25 % and maximum productive capacity is higher by 15 %. The rate of tower and reboiler fouling has not been fully quantified but is greatly reduced. A more stable tower operation has also contributed to higher productivity and reduced energy usage. Venting of non-condensables does not affect tower stability and the operators have adapted well to the new control strategy...|$|R

5000|$|Both these {{techniques}} require rather expensive equipment {{and can be}} time consuming. Where air-free requirements are not stringent, other techniques can be used. For example, using a sacrificial excess of a reagent that reacts with water/oxygen can be used. The sacrificial excess in effect [...] "dries" [...] the reaction by reacting with the water (e.g. in the solvent). However, this method is only suitable where the impurities produced in this reaction are not in turn detrimental to the desired product of the reaction or can be easily removed. Typically, reactions using such a sacrificial excess are only effective when doing reactions on a reasonably large scale such that this by-reaction is negligible compared to the desired product reaction. For example, when preparing Grignard reagents, magnesium (the cheapest reagent) is often used in excess, which reacts to remove trace water, either by reacting directly with water to give magnesium hydroxide or via the in situ formation of the Grignard reagent which in turn reacts with water (e.g. R-Mg-X + H2O → HO-Mg-X + R-H). To maintain the resultant [...] "dry" [...] environment it is usually sufficient to connect a guard tube filled with calcium chloride to the <b>reflux</b> <b>condenser</b> to slow moisture re-entering the reaction over time, or connect an inert gas line.|$|E
