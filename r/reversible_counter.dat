40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the study}} of {{synchronous}} counter and adiabatic circuits, a new design scheme of ternary adiabatic synchronous <b>reversible</b> <b>counter</b> is proposed. According to the theory of three essential circuit elements, circuit structure of four-bit ternary adiabatic synchronous <b>reversible</b> <b>counter</b> is realized by using NMOS transistors with different thresholds and cross-storage structure and combining with the principle of energy recovery. Computer simulation results indicate that the designed circuits have correct logic function.

40|$|We present new {{experimental}} Windows 95 / 98 /NT {{software for}} investigation of graph properties of boolean (in particular, Reed-Muller) logic {{with an equal}} number n of inputs and outputs (called movement functions). Realized at the input of an n-bit register, such functions create autonomous Finite State Machines (FSMs). TRACE software system allows the user to visualize State Transition Graphs (STGs) of the autonomous FSMs. Other features of TRACE help explore graph properties of function families. These families are produced by a generic function, differing from it only {{in the order of}} components, one operation, or one literal (this literal is complemented or replaced by another literal). The autonomous FSMs are used to implement economically next-state logic of realtime control units such as CPU controllers. A case study using TRACE to build economical, highly testable <b>reversible</b> <b>counters</b> based on linear Reed-Muller polynomials is given. Introduction The classical approach [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{computing}} {{has attracted}} the attention of researchers due to its low power consumption and less heat dissipation compared to conventional computing. A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different researchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits {{have been reported in the}} literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate suitable for sequential building block i. e. T flip-flop and hence designing low cost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose designs of <b>reversible</b> <b>counters</b> are significantly better in optimization parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM. Because of non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our results cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the sequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits, handling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in reverse direction by reversing the original output.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the decidability of the periodicity and the immortality problems in three models of <b>reversible</b> computation: re-versible <b>counter</b> machines, <b>reversible</b> Turing machines and reversible one-dimensional cellular automata. Immortality and periodicity are proper-ties that describe {{the behavior of}} the model starting from arbitrary ini-tial configurations: immortality is the property of having at least one non-halting orbit, while periodicity is the property of always eventually returning back to the starting configuration. It turns out that periodicity and immortality problems are both undecidable in all three models. We also show that it is undecidable whether a (not-necessarily reversible) Turing machine with moving tape has a periodic orbit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a 4 4 -state two-dimensional reversible cellular automaton called P 4 having very simple state-transition rules. We show that any reversible two-counter machine can be {{embedded in a}} finite configuration of P 4 very concisely. Since a reversible two-counter machine {{is known to be}} universal, P 4 has thus universal computing ability. It is a four-neighbor partitioned cellular automaton (PCA) where each cell is divided into four parts. Each part has the state set f 0; 1; 2; 3 g, hence a cell has 4 4 states. Besides reversibility, P 4 also satisfies the constraint of a number-conservation property, i. e., the total of the integers, which represent cells' states, over the configuration is conserved throughout its evolving process. Reversibility and number-conservation in CA can be regarded as properties that reflect reversibility and conservation of mass or energy in physics. In order to embed a <b>reversible</b> <b>counter</b> machine in P 4 space, we first design six kinds [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for monitoring the respiratory {{process in which}} the gas flow rate and the frequency of respiration and expiration cycles can be determined on a real time basis. A face mask is provided with one-way inlet and outlet valves where the gas flow is through independent flowmeters and through a mass spectrometer. The opening and closing of a valve operates an electrical switch, and the combination of the two switches produces a low frequency electrical signal of the respiratory inhalation and exhalation cycles. During the time a switch is operated, the corresponsing flowmeter produces electric pulses representative of the flow rate; the electrical pulses being at a higher frequency than that of the breathing cycle and combined with the low frequency signal. The high frequency pulses are supplied to conventional analyzer computer which also receives temperature and pressure inputs and computes mass flow rate and totalized mass flow of gas. From the mass spectrometer, components of the gas are separately computed as to flow rate. The electrical switches cause operation of up-down inputs of a <b>reversible</b> <b>counter.</b> The respective up and down cycles can be individually monitored and combined for various respiratory measurements...|$|E
40|$|Reversible logic has {{applications}} in low-power computing and quantum computing. However, {{there are few}} existing designs for reversible floating-point adders and none suitable for quantum computation. In this {{paper we propose a}} space-efficient reversible floating-point adder, suitable for binary quantum computation, improving the design of Nachtigal et al. Our work focuses on improving the reversible designs of the alignment unit and the normalization unit, which are the most expensive parts. By changing a few elements of the existing algorithm, including the circuit designs of the RLZC (<b>reversible</b> leading zero <b>counter)</b> and converter, we have reduced the cost about 68 %. We also propose fault-tolerant designs for the circuits. The KQ for our fault-tolerant design is almost sixty times as expensive as for a 32 -bit fixed-point addition. We note that the floating-point representation makes in-place, truly reversible arithmetic impossible, requiring us to retain both inputs, which limits the sustainability of its use for quantum computation.
