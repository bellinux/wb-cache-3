40|$|To {{maximise}} {{productivity and}} reduce scrap in high-value, low-volume production, five-axis machine tool (5 A-MT) motion accuracy must be verified quickly and reliably. Numerous metrology instruments {{have been developed}} to measure errors arising from geometric imperfections within and between machine tool axes (amongst other sources). One example is the TMBB, which is becoming an increasingly popular instrument to measure both linear and <b>rotary</b> <b>axis</b> errors. This research proposes new TMBB measurement technique to rapidly, accurately and reliably measure all position-independent <b>rotary</b> <b>axis</b> errors in a 5 A-MT. In this research two literature reviews have been conducted. The findings informed the subsequent development of a virtual machine tool (VMT). This VMT was used to capture the effects of rotary and linear axis position-independent geometric errors, and apparatus set-up errors on a variety of candidate measurement routines. This new knowledge then informed the design of an experimental methodology to capture specific phenomena that were observed within the VMT on a commercial 5 A-MT. Finally, statistical analysis of experimental measurements facilitated a quantification of the repeatability, strengths and limitations of the final testing method concept. The major contribution of this research is the development of a single set-up testing procedure to identify all 5 A-MT <b>rotary</b> <b>axis</b> location errors, whilst remaining robust in the presence of set-up and linear axis location errors. Additionally, a novel variance-based sensitivity analysis approach was used to design testing procedures. By considering the effects of extraneous error sources (set-up and linear location) in the design and validation phases, an added robustness was introduced. Furthermore, this research marks the first usage of Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis in conjunction with <b>rotary</b> <b>axis</b> TMBB testing. Experimental evidence has shown that the proposed corrections for set-up and linear axis errors are highly effective and completely indispensable in <b>rotary</b> <b>axis</b> testing of this kind. However, further development of the single set-up method is necessary, as geometric errors cannot always be measured identically at different testing locations. This has highlighted the importance of considering the influences on 5 A-MT component errors on testing results, as the machine tool axes cannot necessarily be modelled as straight lines...|$|E

The current model’s static and dynamic data coverage of the angular and rate excursions experienced during out-of-control motions was evaluated.

When implemented using methodology proposed by Kalviste, properly collected dynamic data are capable of providing adequate dynamic definition. When the simulation was revised to incorporate an entirely as-tested dynamic data set with the Kalviste mechanization, rigorous correlation with flight test revealed a significant improvement in modeling of flight motions over the original model, which used empirically adjusted forced oscillation terms.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} predict cutting force and motion of the rotating insert in cutting processes with self-propelled rotary tools (SPRT). Metal cutting utilizing rotary tools is effective to suppress tool wear and thus it {{is considered to be}} suitable to attain high performance machining of difficult-to-cut materials. It is well known that a circular insert attached to a rotational axis is self-propelled due to inclined chip flow on rake face plane by setting certain oblique angle. A resultant insert rotation speed can be easily predicted considering a frictionless <b>rotary</b> <b>axis.</b> However, friction at the <b>rotary</b> <b>axis</b> of SPRTs may not be negligible in practice especially when slide bearings are employed. In order to investigate the influence of the friction at the rotation axis on the rotary cutting process, a new cutting model is proposed. As the friction at the rotation axis causes a decrease in a speed of round insert rotation, an equivalent oblique cutting process is taken into account in the proposed model utilizing conventional theoretical model. In the equivalent process, the tangential component of the resultant cutting force corresponds to the friction force at the <b>rotary</b> <b>axis.</b> The friction force is determined by cutting force component normal to force-bearing mechanism and the bearing's friction coefficient. Considering the equilibrium condition in cutting and friction forces, the resultant cutting force and the insert rotation speed are iteratively computed in the proposed model. Edge force model is also associated with the oblique cutting model, which is not negligible especially in machining difficult-to-cut materials. The developed model is extended to simulate milling processes with SPRTs. The proposed model is experimentally verified, and influence of the bearing friction of SPRT on the process is clarified...|$|E

A {{review of existing literature}} provides {{a foundation for}} process planning in machining; efficiency (tool path length) is identified as a primary concern.

Previous research efforts are contrasted to establish motivation for improvements in these areas in four-axis rough machining. The original research is presented as a journal article. This research develops a new methodology for quickly estimating the remaining stock during a plurality of 2 y D cuts defined by their depth and orientation relative to a <b>rotary</b> fourth <b>axis.</b> Unlike existing tool path simulators, this method can be performed independently of (and thus prior to) tool path generation.

40|$|Sine Bowl is {{the result}} of {{research}} into ways to overcome the limitations of traditional woodturning practice which conventionally enables forms symmetrical about a single axis. Historically, complex geometries were (and indeed are still) a feature of turned objects created using the Holtzapffel turning engines whose provenance extends back to 1793 (see Böckelmann in LeCoff, 1997). Multi-axis turning is difficult though not impossible on a conventional lathe (see McKay in LeCoff, 1997). It involves complex jig arrangements and the use of router technology in concert with the lathe. Thus it rather resembles manually controlled <b>rotary</b> four <b>axis</b> milling rather than 360 degrees turning. While this expands the range of formal possibilities, it does not permit the precise control of non-euclidean geometry for which purpose a three axis (or more) milling machine is preferable. Sine bowl exploits such capabilities and exhibits tri-axial sinoidal geometry, the main concave part of which is a sine curved section rotated through 267 degrees, the terminations of which are rotated either downwards or upwards through 90 degrees. The form’s resolution exploits the potential of computer aided design and manufacture utilizing computer controlled three axis milling which overcomes the limitations of single-axis turning and also enables the utilization of materials such as cast acrylic, which are otherwise hard to work with. It thus opens new formal possibilities. While invoking Pye’s notion of the ‘workmanship of certainty’ (Pye 1968 : 20), computer-controlled making still requires considerable hand finishing, for example, where the vertical access of the three-axis milling machine was unable to complete one small area of the form...|$|R

Static compliance is a measurement made with a constant force applied e. g. the average depth of cut.

40|$|Although a {{considerable}} amount of research exists on geometrical aspects of 5 -axis flank milling, the dynamics of this efficient milling operation have not yet been given proper attention. In particular, investigating machining chatter in 5 -axis flank milling remains as an open problem in the literature. The axial depth of cut in this operation is typically quite large, which makes it prone to machining chatter. In this thesis, chatter in 5 -axis flank milling is studied by developing analytical methods of examining vibration stability, generating numerical simulations of the process, and conducting experimental investigations. The typical application of 5 -axis milling includes the machining of thermal resistant steel alloys at low cutting speeds, where the process damping dominates the machining vibration. The results of experimental study in this thesis showed that the effect of process damping is even stronger in flank milling due to the long axial engagement. Accordingly, {{the first part of the}} thesis is devoted to studying process damping, and in the second part, the modeling of chatter in flank milling is presented. Linear and nonlinear models have been reported in the literature that account for process damping. Although linear models are easier to implement in predicting stability limits, they could lead to misinterpretation of the actual status of the cut. On the other hand, nonlinear damping models are difficult to implement for stability estimation analytically, yet they allow the prediction of “finite amplitude stability” from time domain simulations. This phenomenon of “finite amplitude stability” has been demonstrated in the literature using numerical simulations. In this thesis, that phenomenon is investigated experimentally. The experimental work focuses on uninterrupted cutting, in particular plunge turning, to avoid unduly complications associated with transient vibration. The experiments confirm that, because of the nonlinearity of the process damping, the transition from fully stable to fully unstable cutting occurs gradually over a range of width of cut. The experimental investigation is followed by developing a new formulation for process damping based on the indentation force model. Then, the presented formulation is used to compute the stability lobes in plunge turning, taking into account the effect of nonlinear process damping. The developed lobes could be established for different amplitudes of vibration. This is a departure from the traditional notion that the stability lobes represent a single boundary between fully stable and fully unstable cutting conditions. Moreover, the process damping model is integrated into the Multi-Frequency Solution and the Semi Discretization Method to establish the stability lobes in milling. The basic formulations are presented along with comparisons between the two approaches, using examples from the literature. A non-shallow cut is employed in the comparisons. Assessing the performance of the two methods is conducted using time domain simulations. It is shown that the Semi Discretization Method provides accurate results over the whole tested range of cutting speed, whereas higher harmonics are required to achieve the same accuracy when applying the Multi Frequency Solution at low speeds. Semi Discretization method is modified further to calculate the stability lobes in flank milling with tools with helical teeth. In addition to the tool helix angle and long axial immersion, the effect of instantaneous chip thickness on the cutting force coefficients is considered in the modified formulation of Semi Discretization as well. Considering the effect of chip thickness variation on the cutting force coefficients is even more important in the modeling of 5 -axis flank milling, where the feedrate, and consequently the chip thickness, varies at each cutter location. It also varies along the tool axis due to the additional <b>rotary</b> and tilt <b>axis.</b> In addition to the feedrate, the tool and workpiece engagement geometry varies at each cutter location as well. The actual feedrate at each cutter location is calculated by the dynamic processing of the toolpath. The tool and workpiece engagement geometry is calculated analytically using the parametric formulation of grazing surface at the previous and current passes. After calculating the instantaneous chip thickness and tool/workpiece engagement geometry, they are integrated into the Semi Discretization Method in 5 -axis flank milling to examine the stability of vibration at each cutter location. While the presented chatter analysis results in establishing stability lobes in 3 -axis flank milling, it results in developing a novel approach in presenting the stability of the cut in 5 -axis flank milling. The new approach, namely “stability maps”, determines the unstable cutter locations of the toolpath at each spindle speed. The accuracy of established 3 -axis flank milling stability lobes and 5 -axis stability maps is verified by conducting a set of cutting experiments and numerical simulations...|$|R

ProVistas area of expertise is mainly the rehabilitation of visually impaired. This includes research, training of opticians and sale of supporting materials such as glasses with magni cation. The thesis problem {{is a part of}} the research to give their customers a better product with much shorter delivery time. Today the customers normally have to wait several weeks to get their visual aid glasses. The reason for this is that the holes are milled manually. With CNC mills existing some decades now, the visual aid community should also bene t from the advantage of CNC milling. Both producer and customers will bene t from a new automated small ve axis mill, especially ProVista that has started this paradigm shift. ProVista wants the opportunity to mill holes in their own glasses. Today they are depending on two foreign companies to mill the holes. This is both time consuming and costly for ProVista and their customers. This master thesis comprises the study, design and manufacturing of a ve axis mill. The decision to build a ve axis CNC mill was made early in the process, this was done by integrating a three axis CNC mill with two extra rotations axes. The project incorporates the main areas within mechatronics such as designing and building mechanical and electronic parts and the interplay between them, control system for controlling and tuning the motors. The mill shall produce di erent holes, mostly circular with angles so that the binoculars achieve the correct focal point in accordance to the user's needs. The users are mainly surgeons and dentists, who depend on magni cation provided with two binoculars, focused at an item to performer their work more e ciently and correctly. In ProVista sub market the users vary from hobbyist using binocular glasses to paint tin soldiers, old people reading the paper and other people that are visually impaired. The solution this project presents is a new small ve axis CNC mill special designed for milling in glasses. The mill is based on the High-Z S 400 purchased from CNC-Step in Germany. The chosen design for the two extra axes is a two <b>axis</b> <b>rotary</b> table design also known as trunnion. The trunnion table was tted with two stepper motor, from the same producer used on the High-Z S 400. The stepper motors were chosen mainly for their low cost and ease of use. There has been made a control box with motor drives and power supply for the trunnion table. The control box is also tted with serial ports, parallel port, fan, emergency button, fuse and power connection. A new xture for glasses is also designed and built. This will most probably be the rst milling xture for a pair of glasses in the world. The software used in the project is Excel and Mach 3. Excel was used to generate the G code from the position, diameter and the angle of the holes. After this the data is saved in a txt le, making it readable by Mach 3. This process has been made as user friendly as possible so that a user can operate the milling machine without problems. The Mach 3 CNC program already has a good enough interface, and only needed to be modi ed with a six axes interface. The Excel spreadsheet is been made simpler and the user may only change a few variables, the transfer of the G code is also been done simpler by adding the possibility to save the column with G code as txt le. The most typical holes that ProVista needs are circular holes and oblong holes (prism). After implementation several test were carried out to verify that the di erent parts obtained the requirements. Among the tests that were carried out was: resolution and repeatability for the mill, and the backlash for the trunnion table. In the last test it was milled holes through glasses to verify that the nal product met the requirements All tests met the requirements with good margin, except the last test. The problem will be xed and the test will be redone before handing over the machine to ProVista. With the new automated mill ProVista will be able to o er high quality visual aids on the world market. Their products will be made quicker and at a lower cost, bene ting both ProVista and the customers. ProVista will also have a new tool in their further research, which may result in new methods to help visually impaired so they may have a better quality of life. With the newly acquired high capacity to mill holes in glasses, ProVista would be able to take in orders from other visual aid companies. Further work may involve reducing the size of the mill since a large portion of the work area is unused. The user interface should be something similar to HMI (Human Machine Interface) where the users do not see the Mach 3 or Excel and just put in the desired position, diameter and angles on a touch screen. The xture should also be modi ed so that the glasses are self centred, this will reduce any minor errors. A new spindle should also be re tted to reduce noise level...|$|R
