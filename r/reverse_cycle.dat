In particular a steam cycle with two bleedings is analyzed, neglecting heat losses and pressure drops in the boiler and considering irreversibility only along the expansion line of the steam turbine and into the feedwater heaters. The efficiency and the work of the regenerative cycle are compared to the analogous values of the CHC cycle composed by one simple steam cycle (HEC) and two heat pump cycles (RC), with steam as the working fluid.

50|$|Inductive {{pumps are}} {{considered}} highly accurate and energy efficient. Inductive pumps use two primary parameters to control flow, they are Rate and Dwell. Rate {{is used to}} determine the number of strokes per second or in any given time interval. Dwell is used to control the length of time the energizing coil remains on during the Rate cycle. Essentially if the piston has completed its stroke and is waiting for the <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> to occur, {{there is no need to}} continue energizing the coil as most of this energy will be converted to heat as no more work is being done by the piston. The Dwell setting allows adjustment of this ON time during the rate cycle. Also the Dwell setting allows for a true pressure control parameter for the pump. By reducing the Dwell time even further one can reduce the total energy applied to the piston during the pumping cycle. This can reduce the maximum output pressure during pumping. This differs from many other pumps as they commonly reduce flow to reduce pressure in a given circumstance, however if an occlusion occurs to the output channel other pumps tend to build up to their maximum pressure until they either burst the tubing or damage their internal mechanism. Inductive pumps can be shut off at the outlet and will not exceed the pressure they are set at. Pumping against a close output does not cause damage to the pump.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the surface}} {{temperature}} of the outdoor coil in an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit is below both the air dew point and freezing point of water, frost can be formed and accumulated over the surface of the outdoor coil, which is usually of multi-circuit structure in order to minimize its refrigerant pressure loss and enhance the heat transfer between refrigerant and ambient air. However, frosting adversely affects the operational performance and hence the energy efficiency of the ASHP unit, therefore periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely standard defrosting method used for ASHP units is <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting. A previous related study has suggested that during <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting, downwards flowing of melted frost due to gravity over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit could deteriorate defrosting performance, by using more energy for defrosting and prolonging a defrosting process. If however an outdoor coil can be horizontally installed, the flow path for melted frost over coil surface can be shortened, and a better defrosting performance expected. In this paper, therefore, an experimental study on performance during <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting of an ASHP unit having a horizontal three-circuit outdoor coil has been carried out.

It was suggested in previous experimental studies that during <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting, downwards flowing of the melted frost due to gravity over a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit has negative effects on defrosting performance.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit {{is used for}} space heating at a low ambient {{temperature}} in winter, frost may be formed on its outdoor coil surface. Over time, frost accumulation on coil surface may become sufficient to restrict air passage through the coil and increase the heat transfer resistance between ambient air and coil surface, leading to performance degradation for the outdoor coil, or even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Therefore, periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard defrosting method for an ASHP unit is <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting. During a standard <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting (SRCD) operation, the indoor coil in an ASHP unit actually acts as an evaporator. Because the indoor fan is usually turned off during defrosting, there is an insignificant amount of energy from indoor coil, leading to a number of associated operational problems such as a longer defrosting duration and the risk of having a lower air temperature inside a heated space during defrosting, etc. To solve the fundamental problem of insufficient heat available during defrosting while ensuring the efficient and safe system operation, a novel <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting (NRCD) method which is thermal energy storage-based using sub-cooling energy of refrigerant for ASHPs has been developed. Comparative experiments using both the SRCD method and the NRCD method were carried out on an experimental ASHP unit with a nominal 2. 5 kW heating capacity. Experimental results clearly suggested that when using the NRCD method, the discharge and suction pressures were increased by 0. 56 and 0. 12 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the defrosting duration and heating-resumption duration were shortened by 30. 8 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, and the defrosting energy consumption was reduced by 13. 9 %, compared to those when using the SRCD method. Practical application: ASHPs have been widely used worldwide due to their significant energy-saving potentials. However, frost can be formed on the outdoor coil surface when an ASHP unit operates for space heating. Frost accumulation on coil surface reduces the coil's efficiency, or causes even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. <b>Reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method. This paper presents the <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting performance for an ASHP unit with a PCM-HE acting as both a sub-cooler during heating operation and a heat source during defrosting operation, which could help to ensure the safe operation and achieve a higher defrosting efficiency of the ASHP unit.
