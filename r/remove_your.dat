2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba {{taught in}} Johanan bar Nappaha's name {{that the words}} of [...] "You shall not <b>remove</b> <b>your</b> neighbor's landmark, which they of old have set," [...] meant that when planting, one should not {{encroach}} upon the boundary that they of old set. (Thus, one should not plant so near to one's neighbor's border that one's plants' roots draw sustenance from the neighbor's land, thus impoverishing it.) The Gemara further cited this analysis for the proposition that one may rely on the Rabbis' agricultural determinations.|$|E
2500|$|The Turkish {{government}} {{has refused to}} officially recognise the Republic of Cyprus until {{the removal of the}} political and economic blockade on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey's non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus has led to complications within the Customs Union. Under the customs agreements which Turkey had already signed as a precondition to start EU membership negotiations in 2005, it is obliged to open its ports to Cypriot planes and vessels, but Turkey has not complied so far; refusing to do so until the EU eases the international isolation of Northern Cyprus. In February 2013, Turkish EU Minister Egemen Bağış told the Republic of Cyprus, [...] "if you truly want salvation, truly want peace, then <b>remove</b> <b>your</b> blockade of Ercan Airport to EU member countries and Turkey will open its ports to you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sifre {{asked why}} [...] says, [...] "You shall not <b>remove</b> <b>your</b> neighbor's landmark," [...] when [...] already says, [...] "You shall not rob." [...] The Sifre {{explained}} that [...] teaches that one who removes a neighbor's boundary mark violates two negative commandments. The Sifre further explained that lest one {{think that this}} conclusion applies outside the Land of Israel, [...] says, [...] "in your inheritance that you will inherit in the land," [...] indicating that only in the Land of Israel would one violate two negative commandments. Outside the Land of Israel, one would violate only the one commandment of [...] "You shall not rob." [...] The Sifre further taught that one violates the command of [...] not to move a neighbor's landmark (1) if one moves an Israelite's landmark, (2) if one substitutes the statement of Eliezer ben Hurcanus for that of Rabbi Joshua or vice versa, or (3) if one sells a burial plot purchased by an ancestor.|$|E
