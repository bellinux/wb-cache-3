5|$|The Elvish {{languages}} are a language family of several <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> and dialects. The {{following is a}} brief overview of the fictional internal history of late Quenya as conceived by Tolkien. Tolkien imagined a diglossic Elven society with a vernacular language for every-day use, Tarquesta, and a more educated language for use in ceremonies and lore, Parmaquesta.|$|E

25|$|The C {{programming}} language (and many <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> like C++, Java, C#, and Scala) uses apostrophes to delimit a character literal. In these languages a {{character is a}} different object than a 1-letter string.|$|E

25|$|Pohnpeian is {{most closely}} related to the Chuukic {{languages}} of Chuuk (formerly Truk). Ngatikese, Pingelapese and Mwokilese of the Pohnpeic languages are closely <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> to Pohnpeian. Pohnpeian shares 81% lexical similarity with Pingelapese, 75% with Mokilese, and 36% with Chuukese.|$|E
25|$|Catalan bears {{varying degrees}} of {{similarity}} to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, {{as it should be}} expected from closely <b>related</b> <b>languages,</b> Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.|$|E
25|$|The two {{varieties}} of Proto-Luwian or Luwian (in the narrow sense of these names), are known after the scripts {{in which they}} were written: Cuneiform Luwian (CLuwian) and Hieroglyphic Luwian (HLuwian). There is no consensus as to whether these were a single language, or two closely <b>related</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|E

25|$|Min peoples {{may also}} be known as Mountain Ok peoples, from the word ok meaning 'river' or 'water'. The latter name {{contrasts}} them with the Lowland Ok people to the south who speak <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> but differ greatly culturally and in the environment that they live in.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to diverse}} {{backgrounds}} of Chinese community in Perak, they speak {{a number of}} diverse dialects and closely <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> that continued to be spoken even to this day. Chinese dialects that are spoken in Perak includes Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka, Mandarin, and Hokchiu. Most Chinese can speak Standard Malay and English as well.|$|E
25|$|In Arab-dominated Yemen and Oman, on the {{southern}} rim of the Arabian Peninsula, a few tribes continue to speak Modern South Arabian languages such as Mahri and Soqotri. These languages differ greatly from both the surrounding Arabic dialects and from the (unrelated but previously thought to be <b>related)</b> <b>languages</b> of the Old South Arabian inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|IF..THEN..ELSE..(ENDIF). As above, {{but with}} a second action to be {{performed}} if the condition is false. This {{is one of the}} most common forms, with many variations. Some require a terminal ENDIF, others do not. C and <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> do not require a terminal keyword, or a 'then', but do require parentheses around the condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} of the Algonquian family constitute {{a group of}} historically <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> descended from a common source language, Proto-Algonquian. The Algonquian languages are spoken across Canada from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast; on the American Plains; south of the Great Lakes; and on the Atlantic coast. Many of the Algonquian languages are now extinct.|$|E
25|$|The Apache and Navajo tribal {{groups of}} the North American Southwest speak <b>related</b> <b>{{language}}s</b> of the Athabaskan language family. Other Athabaskan-speaking people in North America continue to reside in Alaska, western Canada, and the Northwest Pacific Coast. Anthropological {{evidence suggests that the}} Apache and Navajo peoples lived in these same northern locales before migrating to the Southwest sometime between AD 1200 and 1500.|$|E

Of the two groups, the Daza, found {{to the south of}} the Teda, are the most numerous with a population of 358,000, while the Teda number only 47,000.|$|E
25|$|Modifiers {{that would}} {{appear on a}} left branch under a noun (i.e. they precede the noun that they modify) cannot be extracted. The {{relevant}} constraint {{is known as the}} Left Branch Condition, and Ross (1967) is again credited with having discovered it. The left branch constraint captures the fact that possessive determiners and attributive adjectives in English and many <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> necessarily pied-pipe the entire noun phrase when they are fronted, e.g.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware languages, {{also known}} as the Lenape languages, are Munsee and Unami, two closely <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> of the Eastern Algonquian {{subgroup}} of the Algonquian language family. Munsee and Unami were spoken aboriginally by the Lenape people {{in the vicinity of the}} modern New York City area in the United States, including western Long Island, Manhattan Island, Staten Island, as well as adjacent areas on the mainland: southeastern New York State, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and coastal Delaware.|$|E

25|$|Not every {{international}} auxiliary {{language is}} necessarily {{intended to be}} used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of a certain group of <b>related</b> <b>languages.</b> The oldest known example is a Pan-Slavic language written in 1665 by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić. He named this language Ruski ("Russian"), but in reality it {{was a mixture of}} the Russian edition of Church Slavonic, his own Southern Chakavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian, and, to a lesser degree, Polish.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> such as Amharic. However, it is harder to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E
25|$|Once learned, Interlingua {{can be used}} {{to learn}} other <b>related</b> <b>languages</b> quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to {{understand}} them immediately. Research with Swedish students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one 1974 study, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand. Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp the mechanisms of language quickly.|$|E
