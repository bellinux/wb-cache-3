Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{negative}} logic selector bail that is {{displaced by the}} interposer in turn pulls a latch interposer and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be {{pulled away from the}} latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged {{for the rest of the}} cycle, while the remaining latches take part in character selection, hence the term [...] "{{negative logic}}". The minus five selector bail pulls an interposer and link which causes a latch to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional [...] "low velocity" [...] selector latch is also engaged by certain keys, such as '.' and '_', which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control cam follower, which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the cam in the carrier, causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E

[...] Bloomberg's Terhune (2010) explained how investors seeking high-margin returns use Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to bet against financial instruments owned by other companies and countries.

2500|$|Smith {{requested}} close air support, {{calling for}} the waiting aircraft to drop napalm across 11 Platoon's eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived; however, due to the rain and low cloud {{they were unable to}} observe the coloured smoke thrown by the Australians to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, yet with Smith unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted them out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft drop their payloads on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing it the location of the Viet Cong command element. With the artillery beginning to fall again and D Company still heavily outnumbered, it proved critical in preventing them being overrun as the Viet Cong formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor—officer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support—served as Townsend's artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries, as well as directing the American medium artillery against depth targets. On the ground Stanley would call down the fire himself or would relay the direction of the assault, from which Honnor would select targets and order the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Despite the rain and the soft ground <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable technical conditions, including the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting Viet Cong, the convenient range of [...] at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat.|$|E
