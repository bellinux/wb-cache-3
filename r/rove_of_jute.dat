50|$|Bangladesh is {{currently}} the second largest producer <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber, now over taken by India. The Jat Area, popular for highest quality <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber is located in Bangladesh. Therefore, Bangladesh is able to supply the highest quality <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber in the world. However, Bangladesh falls behind its other competitors in applying recent technological advancements. In terms of world export <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber, Bangladesh's share is more than 70%, which makes Bangladesh the largest exporter <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber in the world.|$|R

The awareness and demand <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> products is increasing in both international and domestic market which creates the opportunity for Bangladesh’s jute again. The study aims to analysis the comparative growth and development <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> production <b>of</b> Bangladesh with other major jute producing countries to avail the opportunities <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> growing demand in the world market. The results indicate that both world jute production and production area has decreased with fluctuating trend over the period.

30|$|The {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber {{with the}} biopolymer chitosan {{and its effect}} on dyeing with natural colorants and antibacterial characteristics of fiber has been investigated. The detailed study has demonstrated the twofold effect <b>of</b> chitosan on <b>jute</b> fiber. The treatment <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> with chitosan can appreciably enhance the uptake of dye by the fiber. Moreover, the color fastness property of dyed fabrics against washing and rubbing also exhibits within the acceptable range of good to excellent. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activities <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fabric increase significantly due to the combined effect of natural dye henna and biopolymer chitosan. Thus, the findings of the study suggest a potential application of chitosan as a non-toxic, eco-friendly, and multi-functional finish providing the desired dyeing and antimicrobial properties <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber after treatment with chitosan.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{microorganisms}} obtained from jute (Corchorus spp.) in the retting of dry ribbons <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> was determined. Efficiency of fungus on retting of green ribbon and dry ribbon <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> was also examined.

Distribution and activity of microbial population for jute retting and their impact on the water quality <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> growing areas <b>of</b> Bangladesh was also surveyed. Utilization and suitability of retting effluents as a fertilizer in vegetable crops production were also determined. Micrococcus spp. were identified as an accelerator <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> retting. Referring to the recent advancements made in isolating completed/partial genes controlling desirable traits, it is suggested to use the modern molecular technology not only to improve the quality <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fibres but also bioengineer microbial flora to further reduce the retting time without sacrificing fibre qualities...|$|R

40|$|Modification <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fibre {{was due to}} {{sulphonation}} {{which were}} improved the physico-chemical and physico-mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fibre. The change in chemical composition, morphological, geometrical structure, tensile properties and stress-strain characteristics were determined at different degree of sulphonation at optimal reaction conditions. The dimensional structure and mechanical properties <b>of</b> sulphonated <b>jute</b> fiber was studied. In sulphonation no damage and disintegration of the fibre cells were noticed except swelling of the secondary wall only and the fibre tenacity was not impaired. The sulphonation treatment in the optimal condition were improved the fineness in terms of linear density and developed flexibility, softness and compressibility <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fibre. These values were measured {{in order to assess}} the textile importance <b>of</b> sulphonated <b>jute</b> fibre compared to cotton and other textile fibres for fine spinning. The stress-strain properties of the sulphonated fiber were much improved. The breaking extension <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fibre was increased up to 3 % with the degree of sulphonation against the initial value of 1 %. The evaluation of these properties was regarded very significant towards improvement of spinnable characters and other textile performances <b>of</b> the sulphonated <b>jute</b> fibre...|$|R

Data about traditional jute retting process and ribbon retting process were collected through personal interview from the jute growers. The farmers are involved in jute cultivation and majority of them use the traditional method and time consuming approach of retting in ponds/canals. The traditional method hampers the quality <b>of</b> the <b>jute</b> fiber, fish cultivation and pollutes the environment as it decomposes bio-mass. For minimizing the problems <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> retting process, the farmers are now more interested on ribbon retting process.
