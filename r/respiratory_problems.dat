5|$|On 9 November 1901, {{nine days}} after {{arriving}} back in Britain {{and on the}} King's sixtieth birthday, George was created Prince of Wales. The family moved their London residence from St James's Palace to Marlborough House. As Princess of Wales, May accompanied her husband on trips to Austria-Hungary and Württemberg in 1904. The following year, {{she gave birth to}} her last child, John. It was a difficult labour, and although she recovered quickly, her newborn son suffered <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>problems</b> (especially pneumonia) are {{the leading cause of}} death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The Nixons {{moved to}} a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, {{and the house was}} smaller and {{contained}} an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to assess the major animal health problems in market oriented livestock developments and to know the veterinary service in Metema woreda North West of the country from November 2006 to June 2007. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 80 livestock owners to collect information on major livestock health problems, veterinary service of the Woreda and production activities recognized by the farmers in the study area, and supported by group discussions, personal evaluations. Major animal health problems that constraint to be market oriented livestock developments and associated veterinary service are surveyed. These are listed based on the priority of livestock owners and key respondents with their veterinary name and corresponding local name in different age group and the occurrence of the seasons. Major health problems are: In Cattle: LSD, <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem,</b> skin diseases, babesiosis, mastitis and trypanosomosis. In goats and sheep diseases: ORf, <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem,</b> enteritis, pasteurellosis, skin disease. In Poultry: NCD, <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem.</b> In donkey: back sore and <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem.</b> Lack of veterinary service, drugs and vaccines, long distance to get veterinary service, absence of professionals at clinic are major problems.

5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems.</b> However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems</b> in juveniles.|$|E

He returned to Bahrain on 12 July and was welcomed {{by hundreds of}} his supporters. His medical condition deteriorated again as he suffered from repeated <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems</b> and another stroke, {{and in the end}} he lost the ability to speak. In the early morning of 18 December 2006, al-Jamri was rushed by ambulance from his home to Salmaniya Medical Complex, where he was announced dead. The cause of death was heart and kidney failure.|$|E

5|$|San Diego and its backcountry {{suffer from}} {{periodic}} wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego {{was the site}} of the Cedar Fire, called the largest wildfire in California over the past century. The fire burned , killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma, <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems,</b> eye irritation, and smoke inhalation; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas, particularly within the communities of Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Santa Fe, and Ramona.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems</b> and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems,</b> and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a threat to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E
50|$|After a hot {{discussion}} {{between the}} two, Shiva reveals a flashback as follows:When Avanthika was born, {{she was taken}} to ICU unit as she had some <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem.</b> Shiva with help of doctor gets another new born baby from another ward and places near Sakthi who was still asleep. He does this to protect Sakthi as she was mentally too weak to hear her own baby is suffering from <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem.</b> Later, when his own baby recovers Shiva tells the truth to Sakthi and gives back another baby to doctor. But this another baby seems to be child of Anne (Anjali Rao) who dies of post-delivery fit after she sees her baby was not present {{when she woke up}} from delivery pain. Shiva on seeing this decides to take this baby also with him and replaces the baby again when Sakthi was sleeping.|$|R
50|$|Bennett, who had triple {{bypass surgery}} in 1996 after a mild heart attack, {{had been in}} declining health since 2012, when he was afflicted by a {{lingering}} and baffling <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem</b> that doctors finally traced to an infection he contracted {{during a visit to}} Moscow. Bennett passed on December 6, 2014 at his home in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{inadequate}} ventilation, a <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem,</b> {{causes a}} buildup of CO2, hence respiratory acidosis; the kidneys then attempt {{to compensate for the}} low pH by raising blood bicarbonate. The kidneys only partially compensate, so the patient may still have a low blood pH, i.e. acidosis. In summary, the kidneys partially compensate for respiratory acidosis by raising blood bicarbonate.|$|R
5|$|With the Canary Islands' {{power grid}} {{substantially}} disrupted, the Unelco-Endesa power company {{was forced to}} use temporary generators to boost power at sub-stations far from the main grid. In La Corujera in Santa Úrsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000local residents claimed {{to be affected by}} the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems</b> suffered most acutely. Roughly €25million (US$37.25million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, €22.5million (US$33.5million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; €1.5million (US$2.2million) was used for agricultural relief; and €1million (US$1.5million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems,</b> have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>problems.</b> Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, the {{respiratory}} examination is performed {{as part of}} a physical examination, or when a patient presents with a <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem</b> (dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, chest pain) or a history that suggests a pathology of the lungs. It is very rarely performed in its entirety or in isolation; most commonly, it is merged with the cardiac examination.|$|R
40|$|Aim: An {{analysis}} of general practice data for rural communities {{in close proximity}} to coal mining and coal-fired power generation in the Hunter Valley region of NSW was conducted to identify unusual patterns of illness. Methods: Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health general practice consultation data from the Hunter Valley region for 1998 – 2010 were compared with data from all other rural NSW residents. Results: There were no significantly higher rates of problems managed or medications prescribed for Hunter Valley region residents compared with the rest of rural NSW. Rates of <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem</b> management in the Hunter Valley region did not change significantly over time, while for all other rural NSW areas these rates significantly decreased. Conclusion: There was no evidence of significantly elevated health issues for residents in the Hunter Valley region of NSW. The diverging trend for <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem</b> management over time is worthy of further exploration...|$|R
40|$|Airway {{clearance}} {{techniques are}} an important part of the respiratory management in children with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and neuromuscular disease. They are also, however, frequently prescribed in previously healthy children with an acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem</b> with the aim to speed up recovery. The current review explores the evidence behind this use of airway clearance techniques in children without underlying disease. Few studies have been performed; many different techniques are available and the therapies used are often poorly specified. It is necessary to name the specific airway clearance technique used in treatment rather than to just state "chest physiotherapy," a term that is often confused with chest clapping or vibration plus postural drainage. There is little evidence that airway clearance techniques play a role in the management of children with an acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>problem.</b> Physicians routinely prescribing airway clearance techniques in previously healthy children should question their practice. status: publishe...|$|R
