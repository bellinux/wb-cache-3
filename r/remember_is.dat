5|$|A Night to <b>Remember</b> <b>is</b> a 1955 non-fiction book by Walter Lord {{about the}} sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912. The book was hugely successful, and is still {{considered}} a definitive resource about the Titanic. Lord interviewed many survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books, memoirs and articles that they had written. He authored a follow-up book, The Night Lives On, in 1986 following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of Titanic was found.|$|E
25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.|$|E
25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

25|$|<b>Remember</b> <b>is</b> a 2015 drama thriller film {{directed}} by Atom Egoyan and written by Benjamin August. Starring Christopher Plummer, Bruno Ganz, Jürgen Prochnow, Heinz Lieven, Henry Czerny, Dean Norris and Martin Landau, {{it was a}} co-production of Canada and Germany. The plot follows an elderly Holocaust survivor with dementia who sets out to kill a Nazi war criminal, and was inspired by August's consideration that there were fewer parts for senior actors in recent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because somatic cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s somatic cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, {{the same way it}} would on sperm cells.|$|E
25|$|Songs to <b>Remember</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} album by the British pop group Scritti Politti. The album's {{recording}} {{had to be}} delayed for nine months due to frontman Green Gartside's collapse and illness, and then after completion its release was delayed for a further year at the band's request. It was eventually released on Rough Trade Records on 3 September 1982, reaching number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was heavily influenced by disco, reggae, and soul music, and {{marked the beginning of}} Scritti Politti's move from their underground DIY post-punk sound towards commercial pop music.|$|E

25|$|That same day, Ipomadon is {{told that}} his mother is dying; he returns to Apulia and learns from her on her deathbed {{that he has a}} {{half-brother}}. Much later in the tale we learn that the name of this half-brother is Cabanus and there is a grand recognition scene between Ipomadon and his brother {{at the very end of}} the story. Cabanus is living at King Meleager's court in Sicily, who, you will <b>remember,</b> <b>is</b> the Proud's uncle, and, following his abrupt departure from this proud teenager's queenly court and a season of jousting in far-flung corners of Christendom, Ipomadon arrives in Sicily and to King Maleager's court, becoming known at once as the queen's favourite, perhaps even her lover. But he again becomes a figure of fun among the other noblemen for his (feigned) dislike of jousting in favour of hunting.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton {{to be part of the}} daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, it took a long time before finally a group got away from the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance. After the only categorized climb of the day, it's Giuseppe Guerini and David López who are just riding a few seconds in front of the peloton, followed by Jérôme Pineau, the holder of the polka dot jersey who successfully tried to enhance his lead in the king of the mountains classification. But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most important to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> Benoit Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.|$|E
500|$|Something to <b>Remember</b> <b>is</b> a {{compilation}} album by American singer Madonna, released by Maverick Records on November 3, 1995. The album was conceived after a controversial period in Madonna's career, when many critics had speculated that her career had declined. It compiles ballads spanning {{over a decade}} of her career, including a reworked version of [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] and three new songs: [...] "You'll See", [...] "One More Chance" [...] and a cover of Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Want You". The album also features previously released singles {{that had never been}} included on a Madonna album, [...] "I'll Remember" [...] and [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", and altogether provided a softer image for the singer during a critical period in her career.|$|E

500|$|Dave Mustaine {{served as}} the lead guitarist for Metallica during their early days. However, due to drinking, {{substance}} abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with band mates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was soon fired from Metallica. Two months after being dismissed, he and bassist David Ellefson formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: [...] "After getting fired from Metallica, all I <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them." [...] Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as [...] "Mechanix", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced [...] "The Four Horsemen". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to [...] "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and {{said he could not}} play guitar.|$|E
500|$|On the bridge, Beyoncé sings {{about having}} drunken {{sex in the}} kitchen: [...] "We {{woke up in the}} kitchen saying / How the hell did this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last thing I <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> our {{beautiful}} bodies grinding off in that club". The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about [...] "reppin' that Third", a reference to the Third Ward area located in Houston.|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Remember</b> <b>is</b> {{a fantasy}} novella set in Berlin, {{depicting}} dramatic {{events in the}} life of dandy Aubrey de Vere. Perpessicius argued that the main protagonist was [...] "taken, apparently, from a short story by Oscar Wilde", while others noted a direct reference to the 19th century writer Aubrey de Vere, an indirect one to Poe's Lenore (the lyric: [...] "And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore!"), or a partial anagram of the name Barbey d'Aurevilly. The mysterious events standing {{at the center of the}} writing have been interpreted by several critics as an allusion to de Vere's homosexuality. Probably taking place in 1907, it contrasts Caragiale's other, more tenebrous, writings of its kind—one of its main traits is the writer's nostalgia towards the German capital, which serves to give the story an atmospheric rather than narrative quality. Its depiction of hallucinatory visions probably owes inspiration to Gérard de Nerval, while, according to historian Sorin Antohi, the main character is reminiscent of Joris-Karl Huysmans' Des Esseintes (see À rebours). Lovinescu praises the story for [...] "the gravity of its tone, [...] the cadence of its sumptuous, cultured and noble style." [...] George Călinescu, who referred to the narrative as [...] "a pastiche", and to Berlin as portrayed in Caragiale's story as [...] "a Berlin-Sodom", concluded that the text allowed readers to form [...] "the direct sensation" [...] of Bucharest as a [...] "Balkan Sodom" [...] to be discerned from the German landscape.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Jerryson, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Ohio's Youngstown State University and {{co-editor of}} the book Buddhist Warfare, said that [...] "Buddhism differs in {{that the act of}} killing is less the focus than the 'intention' behind the killing" [...] and [...] "The first thing to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that people have a penchant for violence, {{it just so happens that}} every {{religion}} has people in it." ...|$|E

40|$|Pigeons {{performed}} a delayed matching-to-sample task in which {{large or small}} reinforcers for correct <b>remembering</b> <b>were</b> signaled during the retention interval. Accuracy was low when small reinforcers were signaled, and high when large reinforcers were signaled (the signaled magnitude effect). When the reinforcer-size cue was switched from small to large partway through the retention interval, accuracy accordingly changed from low to high. The opposite happened when the cue was switched from large to small. This dissociation of forgetting from {{the passage of time}} raises the possibility that <b>remembering</b> <b>is</b> delay-specific. The reversal of the signaled magnitude effect during the retention interval is consistent with an attentional account in which the stimulus control of <b>remembering</b> <b>is</b> influenced by extraneous events...|$|R
