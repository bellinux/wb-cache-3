5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts {{are made of}} an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> 500HV.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E

5|$|The {{global market}} for {{brachytherapy}} reached US$680 million in 2013, {{of which the}} High-Dose Rate (HDR) and LDR segments accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic brachytherapy comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the brachytherapy market may <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic brachytherapy, which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a user-friendly technology. The word brachy is Greek for short distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when the air is cool. Later in the day, when the air temperature may <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E

5|$|Before Krosa {{struck the}} Philippines, PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for {{portions}} of northern Luzon, where winds {{were expected to}} <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> 100km/h (60mph). The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides. High winds knocked down trees across Luzon, and left about 80% of Cagayan province without power, {{as well as some}} areas without internet or cellphone service. Portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway were blocked, and in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages. Agriculture damage was estimated at P273million (PHP, $6.3million USD), occurring just {{before the start of the}} harvest. Across the island, the typhoon damaged 32,745houses, including 3,837 that were destroyed, forcing 65,648people to evacuate to storm shelters. Overall, Krosa killed four people in the Philippines, and left P273million (PHP, $6.4million USD) in damage. After the storm, workers quickly restored power lines, while the government provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families, after Cagayan was declared a state of calamity. Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm.|$|E
5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two nuclear plants, 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> 7m/s in the mountainous areas. King Abdullah inaugurated several large-scale projects like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed.
