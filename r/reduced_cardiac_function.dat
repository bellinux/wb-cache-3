Spectra were derived by Fourier analysis of 128 interbeat interval data sets from subjects with sufficient numbers of beats during matched periods of the protocol.

Despite the clinical importance, there is no non-invasive technique for direct detection of myocardial fibrosis yet. Ultra short echo time (UTE) MRI has been shown to detect tissues with a fast T(2) * signal decay. Collagen has a fast T(2) * signal decay compared to myocardium and should therefore be detectable with UTE MRI. This study aims to investigate the use of UTE MRI to detect fibrosis after myocardial infarction without using exogenous contrast. In 7 male Lewis rats either myocardial infarction was created (n= 5) or sham surgery was performed (n= 2). Six weeks after surgery, hearts were isolated and visualized by MRI. Images were acquired with UTE (TE 0. 15 ms), to detect tissue with a fast T(2) * decay. Acquired conventional images (TE= 6. 0 ms) were subtracted from UTE images to maintain only 'short living signal' (SLS) : tissue with a fast decay. In infarcted hearts, SLS was observed in subtracted images, whereas in control hearts hardly any SLS was detected. Subtracted images were cross-referenced with histology and showed that the SLS area observed with UTE MRI corresponded to the collagen-rich areas observed in histology. Normalized SLS areas correlated well with the normalized collagen-rich areas; r= 0. 7, p= 0. 002.

BackgroundExpression of beta-MHC is considered to be energetically favorable, but this might be offset by depressed <b>cardiac</b> <b>function.</b> MethodsTransgenic mice with near-complete replacement of the normally predominant alpha- with beta-MHC were subjected to cardiac stress. ResultsAt baseline, TG mice show moderately <b>reduced</b> <b>cardiac</b> contractile <b>function</b> but are otherwise healthy with normal ventricular morphology. After four weeks of swimming, both TG and non-TG animals showed a 20 % increase in left ventricular (LV) /body weight ratios. The TG hearts displayed mildly greater end-diastolic and end-systolic LV diameters than nontransgenic hearts after training, but no signs of LV failure were observed. However, chronic stimulation with isoproterenol resulted in augmented LV hypertrophy with signs of LV decompensation in TG mice. Furthermore, in a post-infarction failure model, TG hearts displayed accelerated LV dilation and a faster decline of shortening fraction.

Langendorff-perfused isolated rat hearts were subjected to 2 h of intermittent cold cardioplegia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Hearts were treated with (CP+SB) or without (CP) the p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB- 203580 (5 μM) supplied in the cardioplegia. Sham-treated hearts served as controls. In separate experiments, isolated rat ventricular myocytes infected with either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a nonphosphorylatable HSP 27 mutant (3 A-HSP 27) were subjected to 3 h of cold hypoxic cardioplegia and simulated reperfusion (CP) followed by video microscopy and length change measurements. Baseline parameters of cardiac function were similar between groups [left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), 119 ± 4. 9 mmHg; positive and negative first derivatives of LV pressure (± dP/dt), 3, 139 ± 245 and 2, 314 ± 110 mmHg/s].

Inhibition of p 38 MAPK significantly lowered CP-induced p 38 MAPK, HSP 27, and αB-crystallin (cryAB) phosphorylation. In vitro CP decreased myocyte length changes from 10. 3 ± 1. 5 % (GFP) to 5. 7 ± 0. 8 % (GFP+CP). Infection with 3 A-HSP 27 completely rescued CP-induced decreased myocyte contraction (11. 1 ± 1. 0 %). However, infection with 3 A-HSP 27 did not block the endogenous HSP 27 response.

40|$|Chronic low alcohol {{exposure}} {{has been}} shown clinically to have beneficial cardiac effects; whereas chronic high alcohol consumption can lead to heart failure. We have previously shown that cardiac inotropy {{is closely related to}} the activation of the survival PI 3 K/Akt. This study aimed {{to determine the effects of}} chronic low and high alcohol on <b>cardiac</b> <b>function</b> as well as to determine if low alcohol can alleviate the development of volume-overload-dependent (shunt) cardiac hypertrophy. Littermate adult rats were put on a 3 -months isocaloric Lieber-Decarli liquid diet with either low alcohol (LA: 5 mM) or high alcohol (HA: 100 mM) levels. The rats were further divided into sham or shunted group. The measured final blood alcohol concentrations were 0. 02 % and 0. 20 % respectively. In vivo intra-ventricular catheterization (Scisense/iWorks) of the left ventricle (LV) showed that an improved LV contractility and ejection fraction of the LA group while the opposite occurred with the HA group. Since we currently do not have all experimental results, our partial results show that shunted rats developed eccentric cardiac hypertrophy as expected, which was exacerbated by high alcohol consumption, whereas low alcohol seems to alleviate the effect of volume-overload on the <b>cardiac</b> <b>function</b> to a certain extent. The results of the present study suggest that there is an association between alcohol intake and cardiac function; chronic low alcohol exposure seems to have beneficial cardiac effects; whereas chronic high alcohol consumption is associated with <b>reduced</b> <b>cardiac</b> contractile <b>function</b> and could lead to heart failure over the time...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) and aortic cross-clamping causes myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (I-RI) and {{can lead}} to <b>reduced</b> postoperative <b>cardiac</b> <b>function.</b> We investigated whether this injury could be attenuated by thymosin beta 4 (TB 4), a peptide which has showed cardioprotective effects. Pigs received either TB 4 or vehicle and underwent CPB and aortic cross-clamping for 60 min with cold intermittent blood-cardioplegia and were then followed for 30 h. Myocardial function and blood flow was studied by cardiac magnetic resonance and PET imaging. Tissue and plasma samples were analyzed to determine the amount of cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis as well as pharmacokinetics of the peptide. In vitro studies were performed to assess its influence on blood coagulation and vasomotor tone. Serum levels of the peptide were increased after administration compared to control samples. TB 4 did not decrease the amount of cell death. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>function</b> and global myocardial blood flow was similar between the study groups. At high doses a vasoconstrictor effect on mesentery arteries and a vasodilator effect on coronary arteries was observed and blood clot firmness was reduced when tested in the presence of an antiplatelet agent. Despite promising results in previous trials the cardioprotective effect of TB 4 was not demonstrated in this model for global myocardial I-RI...|$|R
5000|$|ATGL {{deficient}} mice administered {{pirinixic acid}} demonstrated <b>reduced</b> <b>cardiac</b> hypertrophy and improved <b>cardiac</b> <b>function.</b> These data demonstrate that genes induced by PPARα activation via {{free fatty acids}} from ATGL-dependent reactions are essential {{for the maintenance of}} normal <b>cardiac</b> <b>function.</b> As PPARα activation triggers the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (M-CPTI I and MCAD), treating the mice with pirinixic acid may improve cardiac myocyte energy supply by increasing mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation to prevent severe cardiac dysfunction as a result of lipid accumulation [...]|$|R
