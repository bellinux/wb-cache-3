It is found that the proposed SCI <b>readout</b> structure can achieve a good <b>readout</b> performance in a small pixel size.

40|$|The {{average time}} T {{required}} for high-fidelity <b>readout</b> of quantum states can be significantly reduced via a real-time adaptive decision rule. An adaptive decision rule stops the <b>readout</b> {{as soon as}} a desired level of confidence has been achieved, as opposed to setting a fixed <b>readout</b> time t_{f}. The performance of the adaptive decision is characterized by the “adaptive-decision speedup,” t_{f}/T. In this work, we reformulate this <b>readout</b> problem in terms of the first-passage time of a particle undergoing stochastic motion. This formalism allows us to theoretically establish the maximum achievable adaptive-decision speedups for several physical two-state <b>readout</b> implementations. We show that for two common <b>readout</b> schemes (the Gaussian latching <b>readout</b> and a <b>readout</b> relying on state-dependent decay), the speedup is bounded by 4 and 2, respectively, in the limit of high single-shot <b>readout</b> fidelity. We experimentally study the achievable speedup in a real-world scenario by applying the adaptive decision rule to a <b>readout</b> of the nitrogen-vacancy-center (NV-center) charge state. We find a speedup of ≈ 2 with our experimental parameters. In addition, we propose a simple <b>readout</b> scheme for which the speedup can, in principle, be increased without bound as the fidelity is increased. Our results should lead to immediate improvements in nanoscale magnetometry based on spin-to-charge conversion of the NV-center spin, and provide a theoretical framework for further optimization of the bandwidth of quantum measurements...|$|R

40|$|Single-shot qubit <b>readout</b> {{typically}} combines high <b>readout</b> {{contrast with}} long-lived <b>readout</b> signals, leading to large signal-to-noise ratios and high <b>readout</b> fidelities. In recent years, {{it has been}} demonstrated that both <b>readout</b> contrast and <b>readout</b> signal lifetime, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, can be enhanced by forcing the qubit state to transition through intermediate states. In this work, we demonstrate that the sub-Poissonian relaxation statistics introduced by intermediate states can reduce the single-shot <b>readout</b> error rate by orders of magnitude even {{when there is no}} increase in signal-to-noise ratio. These results hold for moderate values of the signal-to-noise ratio (S≲ 100) and a small number of intermediate states (N ≲ 10). The ideas presented here could have important implications for <b>readout</b> schemes relying on the detection of transient charge states, such as spin-to-charge conversion schemes for semiconductor spin qubits and parity-to-charge conversion schemes for topologically protected Majorana qubits.

25|$|Since the {{landmark}} {{discovery of the}} prototypic second messenger cAMP in 1957, three families of eukaryotic cAMP receptors have been identified to mediate the intracellular functions of cAMP. While protein kinase A (PKA) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclic nucleotide regulated ion channel (CNG and HCN) were initially unveiled in 1968 and 1985 respectively; EPAC genes were discovered in 1998 independently by two research groups. Kawasaki et al. identified cAMP-GEFI and cAMP-GEFII as novel genes enriched in brain using a differential display protocol and by screening clones with cAMP-binding motif. De Rooij and colleagues performed a database search for proteins with sequence homology to both GEFs for Ras and Rap1 and to cAMP-binding sites, {{which led to the}} identification and subsequent cloning of RAPGEF3 gene. The discovery of EPAC family cAMP sensors suggests that the complexity and possible <b>readouts</b> of cAMP signaling are much more elaborate than previously envisioned. This {{is due to the fact}} that the net physiological effects of cAMP entail the integration of EPAC- and PKA-dependent pathways, which may act independently, converge synergistically, or oppose each other in regulating a specific cellular function.|$|E

25|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical <b>readouts,</b> which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine <b>readouts,</b> whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems.

This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in the front passenger seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example.
