40|$|Abstract — The lifting scheme-based Integer Fast Fourier Transform (IntFFT), {{an integer}} {{approximation}} of the FFT, is reversible. When {{it is used}} for lossless coding applications, the computational complexity and approximation error increase due to realization of the trivial butterflies by three lifting steps. Since the error appears as “noise floor ” and it limits the lossless coding efficiency, it is desirable to reduce not only the computational complexity but also the noise floor level as much as possible. This survey presents two schemes to realize an improved IntFFT {{in terms of the}} number of arithmetic operations and the level of the noise floor. The first scheme is based on employment of two/three lifting step schemes with combined <b>rounding</b> <b>operations,</b> and the second one is the multi-dimensional lifting (MDL) scheme. The improvement is shown by comparing the number of arithmetic <b>operations</b> and <b>rounding</b> <b>operations</b> to compute the IntFFT and also by comparing levels of the noise floor. In addition, an improvement in lossless coding efficiency due to the reduced noise floor can be predicted by observing the reduced estimated entropy of the IntFFT coefficients. I...|$|R
