40|$|We {{report the}} results of a study on Ni-clusters {{assembled}} films deposited on Si(100) and MgO(100) surfaces. The films were produced by deposition of pre-formed Ni nanoparticles generated by a gas aggregation source. The samples topography and growth mode were investigated with SEM, AFM, STM and XPS. MOKE technique was used to determine magnetization curves at T= 300 K, T= 100 K and T= 50 K. The films show <b>random</b> <b>paving</b> growth mode, where clusters assemble in agglomerates. From MOKE data we observe a behaviour that can be ascribed to the occurrence of Super Correlated Spin Glass phase at T= 300 K, and soft ferromagnetic hysteresis cycles at low temperature, possibly related with a different magnetic phase...|$|E
40|$|Films of Ni@CoO {{core-shell}} nanoparticles (NP Ni {{core size}} d ≈  11  nm) have been grown on Si/SiOx and lacey carbon supports, by a sequential layer deposition method: a first layer of CoO was evaporated on the substrate, {{followed by the}} deposition of a layer of pre-formed, mass-selected Ni NPs, and finally an overlayer of CoO was added. The Ni NPs were formed by a magnetron gas aggregation source, and mass selected with a quadrupole mass filter. The morphology of the films was investigated with Scanning Electron Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. The Ni NP cores have a shape compatible with McKay icosahedron, caused by multitwinning occurring during their growth in the source, and the Ni NP layer shows the typical <b>random</b> <b>paving</b> growth mode. After the deposition of the CoO overlayer, CoO islands are observed, gradually extending and tending to merge with each other, {{with the formation of}} shells that enclose the Ni NP cores. In situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy showed that a few Ni atomic layers localized at the core-shell interface are oxidized, hinting at the possibility of creating an intermediate NiO shell between Ni and CoO, depending on the deposition conditions. Finally, X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism at the Ni L 2, 3 absorption edge showed the presence of magnetization at room temperature even at remanence, revealing the possibility of magnetic stabilization of the NP film...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{modelling}} of passive hydraulic automotive dampers {{for use in}} computationally-fast vehicle-dynamic simulation. An extended version of the Duym and Reybrouck 1998 physical model is examined to enable work with high frequency input displacements. This computationally-expensive model is verified with real damper data under both isothermal and variable temperature regular, and <b>random</b> (<b>Pave)</b> input displacement conditions. Initially the extension includes just additional input kinematics to account for inertial effects, with an imposed temperature profile. Subsequently a heat generation model is developed to include appropriate energy losses. When the heat generation model is coupled to the damper model, naturally-generated transient-temperature operation of the damper can be accounted for.

The fundamentals of the diffusion framework [50] are detailed in Section 3.1, and the Nyström extension is described in Section 3.2. The asymptotic properties of <b>random</b> walks that <b>pave</b> {{the way for a}} novel approach for HMM and FHMM estimation, are discussed in Section 3.3. A systematic approach for estimating the HMM parameters based on the diffusion framework is presented in Section 3.4.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a framework for}} modelling conditional variance (volatility) of a multivariate time series by common factors. We estimate the factor loading space {{and the number of}} factors by a stepwise algorithm of expanding the “innovation space”. We develop the asymptotic theory on the proposed estimation method based on the empirical process theory. We further illustrate the method using both simulated and real data examples. Some novel asymptotic results on empirical processes constructed from nonstationary <b>random</b> sequences, which <b>pave</b> the way for the main result, are presented in the Appendix...|$|R
40|$|Active waveguides {{with high}} surface {{roughness}} due to phase separation in polymer blends can sustain wave-guided coherent <b>random</b> lasing, <b>paving</b> {{way to the}} development of integrated devices technologically and economically more favorable that the ones based on nanopatterning. In spite of the vast amount of work on organic thin film lasers carried out, the orange-red spectral region (600 - 700 nm) has not received much attention in this context, albeit it is of interest in biophotonic applications. In this paper, wave-guided coherent random lasing (RL) at 610 nm (Sulforhodamine B) and 630 nm (Sulforhodamine 640) is achieved by incorporating silsesquioxane nanoparticles into dye-doped polymer films. An AFM analysis concludes that the RL emission originates due to the scattering induced by the high surface roughness coming from the polymer/silsesquioxane phase separation. The reported results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} get efficient and photostable laser emission from dye-doped thin films in the wavelength region over 600 nm by incorporating into the polymeric material appropriate nanoparticles which induce structural changes.

40|$|Julian Besag was an {{outstanding}} statistical scientist, distinguished for his pioneering {{work on the}} statistical theory and analysis of spatial processes, especially conditional lattice systems.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the {{transfer}} law of roughness during asphalt pavement construction, a mathematical model concerning the effect of sublayer, <b>paving</b> layer, <b>random</b> factors and <b>paving</b> materials compactness on final surface layer roughness was established through theoretical deduction and data statistical analysis. The critical conditions of sublayer roughness transfer to final surface layer were determined {{through the application of}} the Error Propagation Theory, allowing to further establish, the transfer model for roughness conditions in asphalt pavement construction, internal relationships among paving roughness, initial compactness and final surface layer roughness were also clarified. Moreover, the best initial compactness under different paving smoothness was determined and the transfer model was verified using typical engineering test data...|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} {{approach to}} modeling network data {{is based on}} exponential-family random graph models. We consider here exponential-family random graph models with additional structure {{in the form of}} local dependence, which have important conceptual and statistical advantages over models without additional structure. An open problem is how to estimate such models from large <b>random</b> graphs. We <b>pave</b> the ground for massive-scale estimation of such models by exploiting model structure for the purpose of parallel computing. The main idea is that we can first decompose random graphs into subgraphs with local dependence and then perform parallel computing on subgraphs. We hence propose a two-step likelihood-based approach. The first step estimates the local structure underlying random graphs. The second step estimates parameters given the estimated local structure of random graphs. Both steps can be implemented in parallel, which enables massive-scale estimation. We demonstrate the advantages of the two-step likelihood-based approach by simulations and an application to a large Amazon product network...|$|R
40|$|Background, aim and scope: Studies of particulate-associated pollutants, or PAPs, {{in urban}} areas have become {{necessary}} due to their potentially deleterious effects on the environment. However, {{it is not just}} the sediments themselves which are problematic but also their particle size composition, which has a great influence on their capacity to adsorb and transport pollutants. This paper presents the particle size distributions and concentrations of five metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) of urban sediments collected from paved streets and gully pots from 20 cities in southern Brazil. The cities have different characteristics and hence sources of PAPs associated with differing geologies, soil types and type of urbanisation. Studies of this nature enable elucidation of the relationship between diffuse sources such as streets and gully pots and the likelihood of PAPs to subsequently pollute the urban aquatic environment. Materials and methods: Sediment samples were taken at <b>random</b> from <b>paved</b> streets and gully pots in 20 cities in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil by means of a portable vacuum cleaner to avoid loss of finer particles. The particle sizes of the samples were measured using a Cilas® 1180 laser particle analyzer, and the concentrations of five metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were determined by wet acid digestion (HCl–HF–HClO 4 –HNO 3) followed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy on the < 63 -µm fraction. Results: It was found that in comparison to sediments collected from the streets, gully pot sediments were more heterogeneous in terms of particle size and also that sediment samples from the gully pots were predominantly coarser than those originating on the streets. From the gully pot results, analysis of the modal particle diameter enabled the cities to be divided into three categories. The concentrations of metals in the street sediments were similar across all 20 cities, with all concentrations above background values. Discussion: The fact that concentrations of metals in the street sediments were above statutory guideline values and that the coarser material was deposited in the gully pots suggests that the finer, more polluted sediment is not retained in the gully pots but is transported to the nearest local receiving watercourse. This finding has implications for management strategies for reducing pollution in urban environments. Conclusions: High concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the < 63 -µm fraction of street sediments, in combination with coarse material retained in the gully pots, indicate that metals could be transferred quite rapidly from the diffuse source of pollutants, on impermeable street surfaces, to receiving watercourses. Recommendations and perspectives: Studies of urban sediment particle size and geochemistry enable predictions to be made of sediment behaviour in urban environments. This will inform management strategies such as the possibility of including sustainable urban drainage systems in future management plans, in which it is useful to know how efficient the drainage system is from the point of view of sediment deposition in the urban aquatic environment and the potential for pollution of receiving waters...|$|R
