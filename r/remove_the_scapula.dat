40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{results of}} surgical procedures for severe Sprengel's deformity have been uncertain. To obtain improved elevation, we consider {{that it is}} necessary to realign the lateral border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> for upward rotation. The purposes of the current study were to evaluate the clinical results and range of motion of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> after such realignment. Methods: Seven cases of Sprengel's deformity of Cavendish grade 3 or 4 were treated surgically and then clinically evaluated and examined using three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D CT). (Two boys and five girls aged 50. 9 ± 15. 4 months, mean ± standard deviation at the time of operation.) The mean follow-up was 53. 1 months (range, 12 to 92 months). After the omovertebral bone and the superomedial side of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> were <b>removed,</b> <b>the</b> levator <b>scapulae</b> and rhomboids were reattached to wrap around <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> at maximum upward rotation to assist in maintaining this position. Cavendish and Rigault grades were used for evaluation of postoperative appearance. The superior displacement and rotation of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> were measured on the trunk posterior view using 3 D CT. The relationship between improvement in the range of motion and radiologic change were analyzed statistically. Results: The postoperative flexion (97. 9 ° ± 12. 9 ° to 160 ° ± 11. 5 °) and abduction (99. 3 ° ± 13. 0 ° to 161. 4 ° ± 15. 7 °) were significantly improved compared with the mean preoperative values (P <. 0001). 3 D CT revealed that in all patients the malrotation of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> was improved postoperatively. The current study shows that successful realignment of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> led to these improved clinical results. Conclusions: Our procedure has advantages not only for recovery of the range of motion but also for reducing the characteristic lump in the web of the neck. However, our procedure has an inherent limitation related to asymmetrical shoulder level and width. 3 D CT may be useful for preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation...|$|R
30|$|A {{study of}} Salassa et al. {{pointed out that}} {{posterior}} approach to <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> without deltoid takedown allowed 91  % of exposure of <b>the</b> bony <b>scapula</b> obtained by <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> deltoid muscle; those author suggested to only proceed with takedown if additional exposure is needed [33].|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} rhomboid major, the rhomboid minor retracts <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> when {{trapezius}} is contracted. Acting as an antagonist to the trapezius, the rhomboid {{major and minor}} elevate the medial border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> medially and upward, working in tandem with <b>the</b> levator <b>scapulae</b> muscle to rotate <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> downward. While other shoulder muscles are active, the rhomboid major and minor stabilize <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
25|$|Scapular {{fractures}} {{involving the}} neck of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> have two patterns. One (rare) type of fracture is through the anatomical neck of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> other more common type of fracture is through the surgical neck of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> surgical neck exits medial to the coracoid process.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> include <b>the</b> muscles of the rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> infraglenoid tubercle of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> and spine of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> consists of <b>the</b> trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Scapular {{companion}} shadow overlie <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> with a smooth, well-defined margin {{parallel to}} the medial border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> companion shadow results from unusual radiographic position of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> which causes a soft-tissue fold to occur along its medial border. Winging of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> may also {{be responsible for the}} shadow. Scapular companion shadows may be mistaken for a soft-tissue or pleural lesion.|$|R
50|$|Because of its sturdy {{structure}} and protected location, fractures of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> are uncommon. When they do occur, {{they are an}} indication that severe chest trauma has occurred.Scapular fractures involving the neck of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> have two patterns. One (rare) type of fracture is through the anatomical neck of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> other more common type of fracture is through the surgical neck of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> surgical neck exits medial to the coracoid process.|$|R
50|$|Contraction of the {{trapezius}} muscle {{can have}} two effects: movement of <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> when <b>the</b> spinal origins are stable, and {{movement of the}} spine when <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> are stable.Its main function is to stabilize and move <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Movements of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> {{are brought}} about by the {{scapular}} muscles. <b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> can perform six actions: ...|$|R
5000|$|Serratus ventralis: {{includes}} the serratus cervicus, which originates {{from the final}} 4-5 cervical vertebrae and inserts into <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> and <b>the</b> serratus thoracis, which originates on the lateral side of the first 8-9 ribs and inserts into <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> two muscles are antagonists to each other, with the serratus cervicus pulling <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> towards <b>the</b> neck, and the serratus thoracis pulling <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> away from <b>the</b> neck. They help move the forelimb forward and back.|$|R
50|$|The rhomboids work collectively with <b>the</b> levator <b>scapulae</b> {{muscles to}} elevate the medial border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> {{downwardly}} rotating <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> {{with respect to the}} glenohumeral joint. Antagonists to this function (upward rotators of <b>the</b> <b>scapulae)</b> are <b>the</b> serratus anterior and lower fibers of the trapezius. If the lower fibers are inactive, the serratus anterior and upper trapezius work in tandem with rhomboids and levators to elevate <b>the</b> entire <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
50|$|It passes beneath <b>the</b> levator <b>scapulae</b> to <b>the</b> {{superior}} {{angle of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> and then descends under the rhomboid muscles along the vertebral border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> {{as far as}} the inferior angle.|$|R
30|$|Fibrous bands may connect <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> chest wall; {{these should}} be divided by blunt {{dissection}} using gause and finger in order to mobilise <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> We do ask the anaesthetist to abduct both shoulders to around 120 °; then, we do apply gentle downward pressure on {{the upper part of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> by index and middle finger to allow <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to be descend distally to the desired possible position without tension.|$|R
25|$|The {{superior}} {{angle of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> or medial angle, {{is covered by}} the trapezius muscle. This angle is formed by the junction of the superior and medial borders of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> superior angle {{is located at the}} approximate level of the second thoracic vertebra. The superior angle of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is thin, smooth, rounded, and inclined somewhat lateralward, and gives attachment to a few fibers of <b>the</b> levator <b>scapulae</b> muscle.|$|R
50|$|The rhomboid major is a {{skeletal}} muscle {{on the back}} that connects <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> with <b>the</b> vertebrae of the spinal column. In human anatomy, it acts together with the rhomboid minor to keep <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> pressed against thoracic wall and to retract <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> toward <b>the</b> vertebral column.|$|R
50|$|It {{provides}} motor innervation to the rhomboid muscles, which pull <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> towards <b>the</b> {{spine and}} levator scapulae muscle, which elevates <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rhomboideus is a thick, large muscle {{below the}} Trapezius muscles. It {{extends from the}} {{vertebral}} border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> mid-dorsal line. Its origin is from the neural spines of the first four thoracic vertebrae, and its insertion is at the vertebral border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> Its action is to draw <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> dorsal.|$|R
50|$|The artery then {{enters the}} supraspinatous fossa of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> It travels {{close to the}} bone, running between <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> and <b>the</b> {{supraspinatus}} muscle, to which it supplies branches.|$|R
50|$|During the {{transverse}} lifts, <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> {{will also}} articulate and adduct/retract as the weights lift, then abduct/protract as the weights are lowered. Some lifters will retract <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> {{and hold them}} there, as opposed to letting them protract, {{to get a better}} stretch in the posterior deltoid. Muscles that retract <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> include <b>the</b> rhomboid muscle and the trapezius muscle.|$|R
60|$|I have {{measured}} {{the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> in nine different large and small-sized breeds, and in all <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is proportionally shorter (taking the same standard as before) than in the wild rock-pigeon. The reduction in length on an average is very nearly one-fifth of an inch, or about one-ninth {{of the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> in <b>the</b> rock-pigeon.|$|R
30|$|This concept can be {{observed}} in the connection of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> axial skeleton in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. <b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> attaches to <b>the</b> axial skeleton only with soft tissue. <b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade) is a flat, triangular bone located along the posterior aspect of the thoracic cage. Seventeen muscles attach to the scapula; therefore, this bone is usually resistant to fractures [34]. Since the attachment of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> axial skeleton is exclusively made by muscles there is no requirement to imitate the form of the adjacent structure as in the previous case. Those seventeen muscles are arranged in a way that allows the body to (1) set an equilibrium state in which <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is at a particular location and (2) move <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> around in a controlled way. This is a more complex joint to design. It certainly needs to be designed with antagonistic tensional elements and strong tensional topology.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in shoulder impingement syndrome. It is a wide, flat bone lying on the posterior thoracic wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> include <b>the</b> muscles of the rotator cuff- the subscapularis, infraspinatus, teres minor and supraspinatus [...] These muscles attach to the surface of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the glenohumeral joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> infraglenoid tubercle of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> and spine of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> consists of <b>the</b> trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> Each of these muscles has their own role in proper shoulder function and must be in balance with each other in order to avoid shoulder pathology. Abnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. One action <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> performs during a throwing or serving motion is elevation of the acromion process in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.|$|R
50|$|In Keilhauia, <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> has a {{relatively}} straight blade that was broadened at its front end into a fan-like acromion process. This process is less prominent {{than that of}} Acamptonectes and Sveltonectes, instead being more {{similar to that of}} Cryopterygius, Platypterygius hercynicus, and Sisteronia. <b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> formed more of the glenoid than the coracoid; like Sveltonectes but unlike Cryopterygius, the glenoid does not extend onto the bottom face of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> de facto blade of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> was widest near the middle, and angled slightly downwards; like Acamptonectes but unlike all other ophthalmosaurids, the blade has {{a relatively}} uniform thickness along its entire length.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Winged scapula {{is defined}} as the {{prominence}} of the medial border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> classic etiopathology of scapular winging are injuries to the spinal accessory or long thoracic nerves resulting respectively in trapezius and serratus anterior palsy. To the best of our knowledge, there are only few reports of scapular lesions being mistaken for winging of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> We report a rare case of a large scapular osteochondroma arising from the medial border and causing a pseudowinging of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> Case presentation. A 17 -year-old Caucasian boy came to us complaining about a winged left <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> patient had a complete painless range of motion, but a large hard bony swelling was palpable along the medial border of his left scapula. A grating sensation was felt when his arm was passively abducted and/or elevated causing discomfort. A lesion revealed on X-rays was diagnosed as an osteochondroma of the medial border of his scapula. After preoperative examinations, he underwent open surgery in order to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> lesion. A histological examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis of osteochondroma. A clinical examination 3 months later showed a full and painless range of motion, the absence of the grating sensation during passive abduction and elevation and the complete disappearance of his left shoulder deformity. After 2 years of follow-up, there were no clinical or radiological signs of recurrence. Conclusions: Despite its rarity osteochondroma should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any adolescent presenting with a winging of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> © 2013 Chillemi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
50|$|Neuquensaurus has {{an almost}} {{complete}} skeleton. Among the preserved elements are a <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> is co-ossified with the coracoid, a feature {{also found in}} Opisthocoelicaudia. In general aspect, <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> resembles Saltasaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia, Lirainosaurus, and Alamosaurus. The coracoids of <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> are roughly quadrangular in shape, and are alike Saltasaurus and Lirainosaurus, but not Opisthocoelicaudia, Rapetosaurus, or Isisaurus, {{all of which have}} a rounded coracoid.|$|R
50|$|In anatomy, <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> (plural scapulae or scapulas) a.k.a. {{shoulder}} blade or wing bone, is the bone {{that connects the}} humerus (upper arm bone) with the clavicle (collar bone). Like their connected bones <b>the</b> <b>scapulae</b> are paired, with <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> on <b>the</b> {{left side of the}} body being roughly a mirror image of <b>the</b> right <b>scapula.</b> In early Roman times, people thought the bone resembled a trowel, a small shovel. The {{shoulder blade}} is also called omo in Latin medical terminology.|$|R
30|$|Finally, <b>the</b> levator <b>scapulae</b> muscle {{reattached}} to {{the spine}} of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> Redivac drain size 14.0 was inserted under the subcutaneous tissue at the region of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> wound was then closed in layers. Postoperative treatment consisted of application of a broad arm sling for 4  weeks, followed by a range of movement exercise to the shoulder girdle for 4  weeks. Cases of bilateral deformity were operated on 6  months after the operation on <b>the</b> other <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
50|$|The back of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> (also called <b>the</b> dorsal or {{posterior}} surface) is arched {{from above}} downward, and is subdivided into two unequal parts by {{the spine of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> <b>The</b> portion above the spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa.|$|R
50|$|The {{spine of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> or {{scapular}} spine is a prominent plate of bone, which crosses obliquely the medial four-fifths of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> at its upper part, and separates the supra- from the infraspinatous fossa.|$|R
50|$|All {{three parts}} {{described}} above pull <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> forward around <b>the</b> thorax, which {{is essential for}} anteversion of the arm. As such, the muscle is an antagonist to the rhomboids. However, when the inferior and superior parts act together, they keep <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> pressed against <b>the</b> thorax together with the rhomboids and therefore these parts also act as synergists to the rhomboids. The inferior part can pull {{the lower end of}} <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> laterally and forward and thus rotates <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to make elevation of the arm possible. Additionally, all three parts can lift the ribs when the shoulder girdle is fixed, and thus assist in respiration.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> is {{originally}} located as a sagittally-oriented {{structure in}} the neck. It then migrates to a coronally aligned posterior thoracic position. In congenital high scapula (CHS), failure of of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to descend leaves it in an elevated, malrotated position. The bone is small and broad, the periscapular muscles are hypoplastic and <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is rotated with its inferior angle medialised and the glenoid directed inferiorly. Fibrous bands tether <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> chest wall, limiting rotation. The superior angle {{is attached to the}} cervical spine by an omovertebral bar (OVB) in 40  % of cases. Associated anomalies of the cervico-thoracic spine are common [1].|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} animals {{to have the}} ability to walk upright, there are certain {{anatomical}} requirements. For mammals that exhibit orthograde posture, <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is more dorsally placed than in animals with a pronograde posture. The scapular index, the measure of width to length of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> is decreased in animals exhibiting orthograde posture. This means that <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is broader than it is long. The rib cage is more flattened and the acromion process on <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> is much larger. This is because there is more of a need for the deltoid muscle in orthograde posture, due to the availability of resource manipulation by the freeing up of hands.|$|R
50|$|Acromio{{trapezius}} is {{the middle}} trapezius muscle. It covers the dorsal and lateral surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> Its origin is the neural spines of the cervical vertebrae and its insertion is in the metacromion process and fascia of the clavotrapezius. Its action is to draw <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> to <b>the</b> dorsal, and hold <b>the</b> two <b>scapula</b> together.|$|R
50|$|It {{arises from}} the upper border of <b>the</b> <b>scapula,</b> and {{occasionally}} from the superior transverse scapular ligament which crosses the scapular notch, its extent of attachment to <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> varying from a few millimetres to 2.5 cm.|$|R
50|$|In dinosaurs {{the main}} {{bones of the}} {{pectoral}} girdle were <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade) and the coracoid, both of which directly articulated with the clavicle. The clavicle was present in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian dinosaurs. The place on <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> where it articulated with the humerus (upper bone of the forelimb) is the called <b>the</b> glenoid. <b>The</b> <b>scapula</b> served as <b>the</b> attachment site for a dinosaur's back and forelimb muscles.|$|R
30|$|The {{skeletal}} {{features of}} CCD are short stature, hypoplasia or aplasia of the clavicle, and, consequently, hypermobility of <b>the</b> <b>scapula.</b> A bell-shaped small thoracic cage and dysplasia of <b>the</b> <b>scapula</b> are also seen {{in patients with}} CCD [9].|$|R
