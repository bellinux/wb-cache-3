50|$|During beating or reaching, the <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> in {{windward}} side is in tension. The {{one in the}} leeward side is lazy. As the boat tacks they change over. Another function of the <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> is to adjust the tension of the forestay to suit the sailing angle and sea condition. In general, during a hard beat when the boat sails {{very close to the}} wind, the <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> is tightened to increase the tension of the forestay. The genoa is sheeted in. Under these conditions, the draft of the genoa is brought forward reducing the drag.|$|E
50|$|A <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> always {{attaches}} to the mast at a point below {{the top of the}} mast and is generally used in conjunction with a permanent backstay. Running backstays are found on both masthead rigs and fractional rigs. There are some rigs for which running backstays may be used without a permanent backstay. This occurs most often where the mainsail has a significant roach or a very large mainsail, especially combined with narrow hull beam. Gaff rigged boats invariably have running backstays with no permanent backstay. In both of these cases the mainsail extends aft of a line from masthead to stern, and so a permanent backstay would interfere with the operation of the sail. As a direct consequence of its attachment point (below the top of the mast) a <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> is always adjustable because it must be manually engaged and disengaged during every tack or jibe. Adjusting the tension on the <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> has two effects: First, the forestay is tensioned (controls sag in headsail) and Second, mast bend is increased (the mast becomes more bent). The overall effect of tensioning the <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> is a shallower mainsail (less camber) combined with a reduction in headsail sag.|$|E
5000|$|Running Backstaysâ€”These are {{supplemental}} temporary backstays (one on each side) that attach {{opposite of}} the forestay. They are very effective at generating forestay tension, but make the boat more difficult to tack because one <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> needs to be released {{and the other one}} applied each time the boat tacks.|$|E
50|$|Backstays may be {{permanent}} or <b>running.</b> A permanent <b>backstay</b> {{is attached to}} the top of the mast. <b>Running</b> <b>backstays</b> appear in pairs attached about two-thirds of the way up the mast (sometimes at multiple locations along the length of the mast). In general, most modern sailboats will have a permanent backstay and some will have a permanent <b>backstay</b> combined with <b>running</b> <b>backstays.</b> Backstays are not always found on all vessels, especially smaller ones.|$|R

5000|$|If the <b>running</b> <b>backstays</b> lead to {{the mast}} where the {{forestay}} attaches, the effect of tensioning them will reduce sag in the headsail and second, increase mast bend and flatten the mainsail as a result. Both effects are desirable as the wind increases.|$|R
50|$|Running backstays {{support the}} {{headstay}} in a fractionally rigged boat. A masthead rig {{has the advantage}} of not needing them. A <b>running</b> <b>backstay</b> runs from each lateral corner of the stern to the mast at the level where the forestay begins in the fractional rig. Together with other rigging, it supports the mast. Because they are attached low on mast, they can present a significant problem in an accidental gybe, as the boom hits the stay, with the possibility of breaking the boom, mast, or both.|$|E
5000|$|C: This is a 20-foot catboat {{with one}} large sail set far {{forward on the}} hull. It {{requires}} a crew of two or three. Unlike the A and E, the C-scow has a large, efficient single rudder. It has no permanent backstay, so jibing the boat requires the quick use of <b>running</b> <b>backstays.</b>|$|R
50|$|The halyards {{and sheets}} lead {{back to the}} {{companionway}} for central control including mainsail furling, two winches located on the cabin top and two on the side decks handle all tasks. The mast design chosen avoids the need for <b>running</b> <b>backstays,</b> as these are definitely a hindrance and safety problem when cruising short handed.|$|R
5000|$|Gaff rig is a sailing rig (configuration of sails, mast and stays) {{in which}} the sail is four-cornered, fore-and-aft rigged, {{controlled}} at its peak and, usually, its entire head by a spar (pole) called the gaff. Because of {{the size and shape}} of the sail, a gaff rig will have <b>running</b> <b>backstays</b> rather than permanent backstays.|$|R
50|$|A Highfield lever is a lever device {{which allows}} tension to be rapidly {{set up in}} a wire and equally rapidly {{released}} to the required extent. It is frequently used in sailing boats where tension in some part of the rigging needs to be adjusted to a pre-set amount as the wind impinges {{on one side of the}} sails or the other. It is typically used in <b>running</b> <b>backstays</b> (runners).|$|R

50|$|Lines (generally steel cables) {{that support}} masts are {{stationary}} and are collectively {{known as a}} vessel's standing rigging, and individually as shrouds or stays. The stay running forward from a mast to the bow is called the forestay or headstay. Stays <b>running</b> aft are <b>backstays</b> or after stays.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Harold H. Gilbert of the Washington State Highway Department, and was constructed by the Gilpin Construction Company of Portland, Oregon. The only short-span steel suspension bridge in Washington, the bridge incorporates unique features. Only the central span is slung from the cables, with separate unloaded cables acting as <b>backstays</b> <b>running</b> from the 88.75 ft tall towers to concrete anchorages in the canyon's rocky sides. The approach spans were originally supported from below by a timber structure. The cables are discontinuous at the towers, unlike most suspension bridges in which the cables run over a saddle on the towers. With less wear, the cables could be smaller. The bridge deck is made of timbers with an asphalt overlay. The counties transferred the bridge to the Washington State Department of Highways in the late 1930s and it was rebuilt in 1957-58 with steel approach spans. It is noted for prominent brackets supporting osprey nests.|$|R
