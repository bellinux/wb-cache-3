40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to design a new RF {{front-end}} receiver for a ground penetrating radar, with a bandwidth of 4 GHz and the implementation of <b>range-gate</b> switching. Several manufacturers were considered {{in the quest for}} suitable components, and the most interesting components were ordered for testing. From these results, two different receiver designs were prototyped and further developed, and several measurements were conducted to determine if they fulfilled the desirable specifications. Only one of the designs proved to yield the desired gain characteristics, with a total gain of around 55 dB, and a small gain variation across the desired bandwidth. The initial design had issues regarding oscillations because of feedback in the DC network, and had to be sorted out to achieve the final results. The dynamic range of this design was calculated to be approximately 108 dB, with a 1 dB compression point at around 18 dBm. The video leakage transients from the <b>range-gate</b> switches, and the T/R leakage, did not saturate any of the amplifiers in the receiver.

40|$|Coherent Doppler lidar is a {{promising}} technique {{for the global}} measurements of winds using a space-based platform. Doppler lidar produces estimates of the radial component of the velocity vector averaged over the resolution volume of the measurement. Profiles of the horizontal vector winds are produced by scanning the lidar beam or stepping the lidar beam through a sequence of different angles (step-stare). The first design for space-based measurements proposed a conical scan which requires a high power laser to produce acceptable signal levels for every laser pulse. Performance is improved by fixing the laser beam and accumulating the signal from many lidar pulses for each <b>range-gate.</b> This also improves the spatial averaging of the wind estimates and reduces the threshold signal energy required for a good estimate.

30|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} multi-target {{tracking}} problem, whereby the available measurements comprise the superposition of received target signal strengths of all {{targets in the}} sensor field of view. Sensors collecting these measurements are not necessarily radars or high-cost receivers, but can be general-purpose radio units employing simple energy detectors. The measurements are nonlinearly related to target locations, but no data association issues arise because conventional <b>range-gate</b> operations {{have not yet been}} employed to detect, separate, and localize the targets of interest [3]. To cope with the nonlinearity issue, this paper introduces a grid-based dynamical state-space model in which the state describes signal strengths of targets traversing a preselected spatial grid (TSSG) of the tracking field. Because the locations of grid points are preset and known, both the measurement and state equations become linear. Further, data association is avoided by dynamically tracking the TSSG values rather than directly producing the target tracks. Based on TSSG tracking, however, data association and track trajectory estimation can be performed as a follow-up step, whereby track association and estimation errors do not propagate back to the TSSG tracker.|$|E

Vertical cross-sections of w were used to calculate second- to fourth-moment statistics of w as a function of height throughout most of the CBL. We compare the results with large-eddy simulations (LES) of the CBL and with in situ aircraft measurements. A major cause of the observed case-to-case variability in the vertical profiles of the higher moments is differences in stability. For example, for the most convective cases, the skewness from both LES and observations changes more with height than for cases with more shear, with the observations changing more with stability than the LES.

We have conducted recent experiments that have demonstrated the utility of detecting and imaging low-density aerosol clouds. The Mobile Active Imaging LIDAR (MAIL) system uses a Lincoln Laboratory-developed microchip laser to transmit short pulses at 14 - 16 kHz Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), and a Lincoln Laboratory-developed 32 x 32 Geiger-mode Avalanche-Photodiode Detector (GmAPD) array for singlephoton counting and ranging. The microchip laser is a frequency-doubled passively Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser providing an average transmitted power of less than 64 milli-Watts. When the avalanche photo-diodes are operated in the Geiger-mode, they are reverse-biased above the breakdown voltage for a time that corresponds to the effective <b>range-gate</b> or range-window of interest. The time-of-flight, and therefore range, is determined from the measured laser transmit time and the digital time value from each pixel. The optical intensity of the received pulse is not measured because the GmAPD is saturated by the electron avalanche.

40|$|Radar {{refractivity}} retrievals {{can capture}} near-surface humidity changes, but noisy phase {{changes of the}} ground clutter returns limit the accuracy for both klystron- and magnetron-based systems. Observations with a C-band (5. 6 cm) magnetron weather radar indicate that the correction for phase changes introduced by local oscillator frequency changes leads to refractivity errors no larger than 0. 25 N units: equivalent to a relative humidity change of only 0. 25 % at 20 °C. Requested stable local oscillator (STALO) frequency changes were accurate to 0. 002 ppm based on laboratory measurements. More serious are the random phase change errors introduced when targets are not at the <b>range-gate</b> center and there are changes in the transmitter frequency (ΔfTx) or the refractivity (ΔN). Observations at C band with a 2 -μs pulse show an additional 66 ° of phase change noise for a ΔfTx of 190 kHz (34 ppm); this allows the effect due to ΔN to be predicted. Even at S band with klystron transmitters, significant phase change noise should occur when a large ΔN develops relative to the reference period [e. g., ~ 55 ° when ΔN = 60 for the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) radars]. At shorter wavelengths (e. g., C and X band) and with magnetron transmitters in particular, refractivity retrievals relative to an earlier reference period are even more difficult, and operational retrievals may be restricted to changes over shorter (e. g., hourly) periods of time. Target location errors can be reduced by using a shorter pulse or identified by a new technique making alternate measurements at two closely spaced frequencies, which could even be achieved with a dual–pulse repetition frequency (PRF) operation of a magnetron transmitter...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{utilized}} a Doppler lidar {{to measure}} spectra of vertical velocity w from 390 m {{above the surface}} {{to the top of}} the daytime convective boundary layer (CBL). The high resolution 2 μm wavelength Doppler lidar developed by the NOAA Environmental Technology Laboratory was used to detect the mean radial velocity of aerosol particles. It operated continuously during the daytime in the zenith-pointing mode for several days in summer 1996 during the Lidars-in-Flat-Terrain experiment over level farmland in central Illinois, U. S. A. The temporal resolution of the lidar was about 1 s, and the <b>range-gate</b> resolution was about 30 m. The vertical cross-sections were used to calculate spectra as a function of height with unprecedented vertical resolution throughout much of the CBL, and, in general, we find continuity of the spectral peaks throughout the depth of the CBL. We compare the observed spectra with previous formulations based on both measurements and numerical simulations, and discuss the considerable differences, both on an averaged and a case-by-case basis. We fit the observed spectra to a model that takes into account the wavelength of the spectral peak and the curvature of the spectra across the transition from low wavenumbers to the inertial subrange. The curvature generally is as large or larger than the von Kármán spectra. There is large case-to-case variability, some of which can be linked to the mean structure of the CBL, especially the mean wind and the convective instability. We also find a large case-to-case variability in our estimates of normalized turbulent kinetic energy dissipation deduced from the spectra, likely due for the most part to a varying ratio of entrainment flux to surface flux. Finally, we find a relatively larger contribution to the low wavenumber region of the spectra in cases with smaller shear across the capping inversion, and suggest that this may be due partly to gravity waves in the inversion and overlying free atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Amplification of low-light-level optical {{images is}} {{important}} for extending the range of lidar systems that image and detect objects in the atmosphere and underwater. The use of range-gating to produce images of particular range bins is also important in minimizing the image degradation due to light that is scattered backward from aerosols, smoke, or water along the imaging path. For practical lidar systems that must be operated within sight of unprotected observers, eye safety is of the utmost importance. This dissertation describes {{a new type of}} eye-safe, range-gated lidar sensing element based on Solid-state Raman Image Amplification (SSRIA) in a solid-state optical crystal. SSRIA can amplify low-level images in the eye-safe infrared at 1. 556 μm with gains up to 106 with the addition of only quantum-limited noise. The high gains from SSRIA can compensate for low quantum efficiency detectors and can reduce the need for detector cooling. The <b>range-gate</b> of SSRIA is controlled by the pulsewidth of the pump laser and can be as short as 30 - 100 cm, using pump pulses of 2 - 6. 7 nsec FWHM. A rate equation theoretical model is derived to help in the design of short pulsed Raman lasers. A theoretical model for the quantum noise properties of SSRIA is presented. SSRIA results in higher SNR images throughout a broad range of incident light levels, in contrast to the increasing noise factor with reduced gain in image intensified CCD's. A theoretical framework for the optical resolution of SSRIA is presented and it is shown that SSRIA can produce higher resolution than ICCD's. SSRIA is also superior in rejecting unwanted sunlight background, further increasing image SNR. Lastly, SSRIA can be combined with optical pre-filtering to perform optical image processing functions such as high-pass filtering and automatic target detection/recognition. The application of this technology to underwater imaging, called Marine Raman Image Amplification (MARIA) is also discussed.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{adaptive}} optics (AO) and laser-beacon AO {{has been successfully}} implemented in {{the last part of}} the 20 th century. Adaptive optics greatly improves the resolution capabilities of ground-based telescopes by correcting for atmospheric turbulence. The initial implementation of laser-beacon AO was done on relatively small telescopes, on the order of 1. 5 m. However, with larger aperture telescopes being built, such as the 8 -m class Gemini telescopes, there is much room for improvement. Errors resulting from laser-beacon AO, such as focus anisoplanatism, become worse with an increase in aperture diameter. Tilt anisoplanatism is also a problem, regardless of the size of telescope, and also needs to be reduced to enhance the resolution of the objects being observed. This dissertation investigates alternate laser-beacon AO configurations, to reduce the effects of focus and tilt anisoplanatism for larger aperture telescopes. The configurations investigated include single and multiple laser beacons at single altitudes and single and multiple laser beacons at multiple altitudes. These second configurations are referred to as hybrid beacon systems and consist of Rayleigh beacons at altitudes of 10 to 20 km and sodium beacons at about 90 km, the location of the sodium layer. Hybrid systems are shown to reduce both focus and tilt anisoplanatism as opposed to the first configurations which only aid in reducing focus anisoplanatism. An addition to the hybrid systems with multiple beacons, the use of multiple deformable mirrors (DM's) is investigated. These additional DM's are placed conjugate to atmospheric altitudes with predominant turbulence, beyond the traditional conjugate location of the primary mirror. They correct for turbulence at these atmospheric layers and are referred to as multi-conjugate adaptive optical (MCAO) systems. The purpose of MCAO configurations is to increase the corrected field of view. For the types of systems investigated in this dissertation, radiometric characteristics are calculated. These include the optimum <b>range-gate</b> at the minimum noise equivalent angle (NEA) for several laser pulse energies, wavefront sensor sampling rate as a function of bandwidth, and the optimum system bandwidth for several laser powers.

40|$|Developed a new {{algorithm}} for {{the simulation}} of three dimensional homogeneous turbulent velocity fields. For typical atmospheric {{conditions it is}} impossible to produce a simulated velocity field that simultaneously satisfy a given spatial correlation and the corresponding spatial spectrum because of spectral aliasing. The new algorithms produce a turbulent velocity field which has accurate spatial correlations which is required for performance predictions from space-based systems. Developed a new algorithm for extracting the spatial statistics of the atmospheric velocity field using coherent Doppler lidar. The performance of the algorithm was compared with past methods and the new algorithm produces useful results for space-based data, which was not possible before. Developed new methods for verification of the errors in ground-based and space-based Doppler lidar wind measurements. These new methods do not require independent in situ data. This is an important issue for the verification of space-based Doppler lidar measurements of the global wind field. The performance of the new algorithm was compared with past results for both space-based and ground-based operation. The new algorithm has the best performance and is the only algorithm that performed satisfactory for spacebased operation. The performance of coherent Doppler lidar for a space missions with various scanning geometries was determined using computer simulation which contained the effects of random instrumental velocity errors, wind shear, wind variability along the <b>range-gate</b> and from shot-to-shot, and random variations in atmospheric aerosol backscatter over the measurement volume. The bias in the velocity estimates was small and the accuracy in the is typically less than 0. 5 m/s for high signal conditions. For a large number of shot per velocity estimate, the threshold signal level for acceptable estimates is proportional to the number of shots to the minus one half power. This agrees with previous results determined for ground-based measurements. The use of multi-element optical detectors for autonomous operation of coherent Doppler lidar was shown to be a very promising technique. Optimal detector geometries were determined by computer simulation of performance: for ground-based testing with a fixed calibration target and for space-based operation using the random surface returns. The effects of refractive turbulence on ground-based calibration of coherent Doppler lidar was determined by computer simulations and compared with theoretical predictions. New techniques were required to correctly predict performance for the focused beam geometry commonly used for verification of space-based operation. An improved velocity estimator was evaluated for space-based applications were signal shot measurements are used to produce vector wind measurements. This permits more accurate measurements when the signal level is not known a priori or not available from multiple shot measurements. The average Doppler lidar signal spectrum including the effects of velocity turbulence was derived and calculated. This permits new estimation algorithms for turbulence based on spectral estimates. In situ atmospheric measurements were conducted and analyzed using an instrumented kite-platform.

FMCW is desirable for through-slab applications because of the signal gain resulting from pulse compression of long transmit pulses (1. 926 - 4. 069 GHz chirp in 10 ms). The difficulty in utilizing FMCW radar for this application is that the air-slab boundary dominates the scattered return from the target scene and limits the upper bound of the receiver dynamic range, reducing sensitivity for targets behind the slab. A method of <b>range-gating</b> out the air-slab boundary by significant band-limiting of the IF stages facilitates imaging of low radar cross section (RCS) targets behind the slab. This sensor is combined with a 1 D linear rail and utilized as a rail synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging system. A 2 D model of a slab and cylinder shows that image blurring due to the slab is negligible when the SAR is located at a stand-off range of 6 m or greater, and thus, the two-way attenuation due to wave propagation through the slab is the greatest challenge at stand-off ranges when the air-slab boundary is <b>range-gated</b> out of the scattered return. Measurements agree with the model, and also show that this radar is capable of imaging target scenes of cylinders and rods 15. 24 cm in height and 0. 95 cm in diameter behind a 10 cm thick lossy dielectric slab. Further, this system is capable of imaging free-space target scenes with transmit power as low as 5 pW, providing capability for RCS measurement. United States.
