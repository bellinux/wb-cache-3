40|$|ABSTRACT: No {{previous}} {{studies on the}} association of smoking behaviour with disability <b>retirement</b> due <b>to</b> register verified {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) exist. This 30 -yr follow-up study examined how strongly aspects of cigarette smoking predict disability <b>retirement</b> due <b>to</b> COPD. The study population consisted of 24, 043 adult Finnish twins (49. 7 % females) followed from 1975 to 2004. At baseline the participants had responded to a questionnaire. Information on retirement was obtained from the Finnish pension registers. Smoking strongly predicted disability <b>retirement</b> due <b>to</b> COPD. In comparison to never-smokers, age adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for current smokers was 22. 0 (95 % CI 10. 0 – 48. 5) and for smokers with o 12 pack-yrs was 27. 3 (95 % CI 12. 6 – 59. 5). Similar estimates of risk were observed in within-pair analyses of twin pairs discordant for disability <b>retirement</b> due <b>to</b> COPD. Among discordant monozygotic pairs those with disability pension due to COPD were more often current smokers. The effect of early smoking onset (, 18 yrs) on the risk of disability <b>retirement</b> due <b>to</b> COPD remained after adjustment for the amount smoked (HR 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 08 – 2. 68). Smoking strongly predicts disability <b>retirement</b> due <b>to</b> COPD. Preventive measures against disability retirement and other harmful consequences of tobacco smoking should receive greater emphasis...|$|R
