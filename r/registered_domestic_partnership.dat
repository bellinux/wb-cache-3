5000|$|Title 26 of the Revised Code of Washington, {{entitled}} [...] "domestic relations", governs {{marriage in}} Washington state.

It also would add language at Section 26.04.010 exempting religious organizations from any requirement to [...] "provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the solemnization or celebration of a marriage". Governor Christine Gregoire signed the engrossed bill on February 13.

Because moneys in the Public Employees' Retirement Fund would be used for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation, and revise and recast the provisions described above in connection with the extension of the rights and duties of marriage to domestic partnerships that occurred on and after 2005. Because moneys in the Public Employees' Health Care Fund would be used for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation and entitle a retired member and his or her domestic partner to the same entitlements as described above, if specified criteria are satisfied, including providing an affidavit signed by the member and domestic partner under penalty of perjury relative to the member's service retirement effective date or disability retirement date and expand those provisions to provide that a conservatee retains the capacity to enter into a domestic partnership, as specified. Also that same day, he signed AB 1586 into law, a prohibit gender-based discrimination in health insurance. Also that day, he vetoed AB 723, which would have required the State Board of Education (SBE), as a component of reviewing curriculum frameworks, and after consulting civil rights organizations that relate to discrimination on the basis of disabilities, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, to integrate instruction on intergroup relations and tolerance into existing curriculum frameworks.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there are}} at least 1. 5 million in the United States today, lesbian, gay and {{bisexual}} older adults continue to be an invisible population in media, society and research. Prior research suggests that marriage is related to lower rates of depression among older adults in general, but there is no research regarding lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults, many of whom are unable to be married to the same sex. This study explored the relationship between legally recognized same sex relationships and depression among LGB older adults, using data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS, 2009). The main independent variable had three categories: same sex marriage, <b>registered</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>partnership</b> (RDP), or none of the above. The dependent variable was depression, based on the Kessler scale (CHIS, 2012).
