Commonly referred to as ‘National VMS reporting’, it uses both satellite and GPRS/GSM communication services depending on the Legislative requirements. Two schemes are currently operational: for Northern Ireland Mussel Dredging and Isle of Man Scallop Fisheries. EU VMS reporting scheme: these are fishing vessel position reporting requirements, through satellite communication services only, that enables the authorities to track the position of fishing vessels, as set out in EU Regulations. It is commonly referred to as ‘EU VMS reporting’.In addition, electronic logbook requirements are defined thus: catch and effort recording in ‘real time’ but as a minimum every 24hrs whilst a fishing vessel is at sea. Catch and effort data can be transmitted over whichever communication channel is available (i.e., if the Satellite Communication Service is unavailable, connection will be attempted via GPRS/GSM and vice versa). Electronic logbooks are commonly referred to as ‘E-logbooks’ and the end to end process and accompanying software is referred to as ‘Elogbook Software System or ELSS’.In order to address this challenge the UK fishing authorities teamed up with Applied Satellite Technology Ltd (AST Ltd) in 2012 {{to come up with a}} combined solution. The resulting solution was the VMS Plus device, which has the capability to deliver all of these requirements through one device and is now being rolled out to the UK fishing fleet.

40|$|Chief pharmacists in 209 {{hospitals}} were surveyed about ADR <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes,</b> the priority given to ADR reporting, and attitudes towards ADR reporting. ADR reporting had a low managerial priority. Local <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes</b> {{were found to}} be operating in 37 % trusts, but there were few plans to start new schemes. Few problems were discovered by the introduction of pharmacist ADR reporting. Chief pharmacists had concerns about the competence of hospital pharmacists to detect ADRs and were in favour of increased training. Lack of time on wards, and recruitment difficulties were suggested as reasons for hospital pharmacist under-reporting. Teaching hospitals appeared to have an increased interest in ADR reporting. A retrospective analysis of reporting trends within the West Midlands region from 1994, showed increasing or stable reporting rates for most sectors of reporters, except for general practitioners (GPs). The West Midlands region maintained higher ADR reporting rates {{than the rest of the}} UK. National reporting figures showed a worrying decline in ADR reports from healthcare professionals. Variation was found in the ADR reporting rates of Acute NHS Hospital Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in the West Midlands region, including correlations with prescribing rates and other PCT characteristics. Qualitative research into attitudes of GPs towards the Yellow Card scheme was undertaken. A series of qualitative interviews with GPs discovered barriers and positive motivators for their involvement in the Yellow Card scheme. A grounded theory of GP involvement in the Yellow Card scheme was developed to explain GP behaviour, and which could be used to inform potential solutions to halt declining rates of reporting.

40|$|Drug {{regulatory}} authorities in {{many developed countries}} have established spontaneous adverse reaction <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes</b> to monitor drug safety [1]. The United Kingdom yellowcard system, organised by the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM), {{is one of the}} oldest and the most successful of these national schemes. With typical Anglo-Saxon self-deprecation however, both the medical profession and the lay press have tended to emphasise the limitations of the yellow-card scheme at the expense of its achievements. Spontaneous <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes</b> do indeed have substantial limitations [2]. Firstly, they rely on doctors reporting suspected (and not necessarily proven) adverse reactions. Few adverse reactions, however, are uniquely iatrogenic and an efficient spontaneous reporting scheme depends on doctors ' professional skill and judgement in associating their patient's diseases with the drug(s) they have taken. Such schemes are therefore inherently more likely to detect those adverse reactions which occur soon after the start of treatment, and which produce syndromes commonly having an iatrogenic basis such as anaphylactoid reactions, dystonia-dyskinesias and various dermatoses. Conversely, reactions which have a long latency, or which are expressed as conditions only rarely having a recognised iatrogenic basis, may remain unrecognise...|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, no performance comparison between Reporting Centers and Location Areas has been reported in the literature.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{levels of}} {{public awareness of}} consumer adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting systems in Australia. Design, setting and participants: Cross-sectional study conducted in 2012 of residents of the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, who participated in a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), and a national sample, who completed an online Pureprofile survey. Main outcome measures: Proportion of respondents experiencing ADRs; the type of medicine involved; whether participants reported the adverse event and to whom; awareness and use of existing consumer ADR reporting mechanisms. Results: There were 2484 CATI respondents and 2497 Pureprofile respondents. Side effects with medicines were very common (46. 3 % of respondents), most relating to prescription medicines (88. 4 %). Among respondents who had experienced a side effect, 84. 6 % reported the event to a health care professional, most often a general practitioner. Awareness of consumer ADR <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes</b> was low (10. 4 %). Of 217 respondents who had experienced a side effect and were aware of consumer <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes,</b> 46 (21. 2 %) had reported an ADR using one of these schemes. Conclusions: Consumers can contribute {{to our understanding of}} medicines safety, but there is low awareness of available reporting systems. Some consumers aware of ADR self-reporting systems appear prepared to use them, but promotion of and education on how to use reporting systems are required. Significant resources may be needed to support an enhanced consumer reporting scheme...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a {{collection}} of many nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities.

Due to time driven data <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> data accuracy will be high and because of event data <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> longer lifetime of the network can be achieved. In our paper we combined both collection schemes so that the accuracy of the data and the network lifetime is increased. The Parameter based Event Detection algorithm is used here for the switching between the data collecting schemes. Data is send to the observer, only when the temperature approaches the fixed threshold value and here the energy is consumed, otherwise the transmission remains ideal and the energy is not all used. Because of this energy saving the lifetime of the network is protracted...|$|R
40|$|We <b>report</b> an imaging <b>scheme,</b> termed aperture-scanning Fourier ptychography, for 3 D {{refocusing}} and super-resolution macroscopic imaging. The <b>reported</b> <b>scheme</b> scans an aperture at the Fourier {{plane of}} an optical system and acquires the corresponding intensity {{images of the}} object. The acquired images are then synthesized in the frequency domain to recover a high-resolution complex sample wavefront; no phase information is needed in the recovery process. We demonstrate two applications of the <b>reported</b> <b>scheme.</b> In the first example, we use an aperture-scanning Fourier ptychography platform to recover the complex hologram of extended objects. The recovered hologram is then digitally propagated into different planes along the optical axis to examine the 3 D structure of the object. We also demonstrate a reconstruction resolution better than the detector pixel limit (i. e., pixel super-resolution). In the second example, we develop a camera-scanning Fourier ptychography platform for super-resolution macroscopic imaging. By simply scanning the camera over different positions, we bypass the diffraction limit of the photographic lens and recover a super-resolution image of an object placed at the far field. This platform’s maximum achievable resolution is ultimately determined by the camera’s traveling range, not the aperture size of the lens. The FP <b>scheme</b> <b>reported</b> in this work may find applications in 3 D object tracking, synthetic aperture imaging, remote sensing, and optical/electron/X-ray microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} explore how {{critical}} and acceptable practice are defined in anaesthesia and how this influences the discussion and reporting of adverse incidents. Method. We conducted workplace observations of, and interviews with, anaesthetists and anaesthetic staff. Transcripts were analysed qualitatively for recurrent themes and quantitatively for adverse events in anaesthetic process witnessed. We also observed departmental audit meetings and analysed meeting minutes and report forms. Results. The educational value of discussing events was well-recognized; 28 events were discussed at departmental meetings, of which 5 (18 %) were presented as ‘critical incidents’. However, only one incident was reported formally. Our observations of anaesthetic practice revealed 103 minor events {{during the course of}} over 50 anaesthetic procedures, but none were acknowledged as offering the potential to improve safety, although some were direct violations of ‘acceptable’ practice. Formal reporting appears to be constrained by changing boundaries of what might be considered ‘critical’, by concerns of loss of control over formally reported incidents and by the perception that <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes</b> outside anaesthesia have purposes other than education. Conclusions. Despite clear official definitions of criticality in anaesthesia, there is ambiguity in how these are applied in practice. Many educationally useful events fall outside critical incident <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes.</b> Professional expertise in anaesthesia brings its own implicit safety culture but the reluctance to adopt a more explicit ‘systems approach’ to adverse events may impede further gains in patient safety in anaesthesia...|$|E

The Water Accounting Framework was applied across four operations over three countries producing four commodities. The advantages of the framework were then evident through the presentation of the reports. The contextual statement of the framework was able to explain contrasting reuse efficiencies.
