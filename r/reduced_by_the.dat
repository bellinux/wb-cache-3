5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E

Though winds were <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time Georges hit Cuba, it still retained winds of 75mph (120km/h), along with stronger gusts in squalls.

The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy.

5|$|During the Boshin War of 1868-69, the Nanbu clan {{initially}} {{attempted to}} remain neutral. However, {{under the leadership}} of Nanbu Toshihisa and the karō Narayama Sado, the Nanbu clan later sided with the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei). On September 23, 1868, the Nanbu clan's troops joined in the attack on the Akita Domain, which had seceded from the alliance and sided with the imperial government. By October 7, Nanbu troops took Ōdate, one of the Akita Domain's castles. However, due to the collapse of the alliance, the Nanbu clan surrendered to the imperial army on October 29, 1868. After the war, the Nanbu clan's holdings were drastically <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> imperial government as punishment for siding with the northern alliance. While Hachinohe and Shichinohe Domains survived intact, a large area of what is now northeastern Aomori Prefecture was given as a resettlement zone for former samurai of Aizu Domain. The Nanbu were also briefly expelled from Morioka itself, and were assigned new lands surrounding the vacant Shiroishi Castle before being allowed to returned to Morioka a few months later. Two years after the war, as with all other daimyō, the heads of all three Nanbu branches were relieved of their offices by the abolition of the han system.|$|E

Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of saloon passengers and in 1862 commissioned Scotia, the last paddle steamer to win the Blue Riband. Inman carried more passengers because of its success in the immigrant trade. To compete, in May 1863 Cunard started a secondary Liverpool–New York service with iron-hulled screw steamers that catered for steerage passengers. Beginning with China, the line also replaced the last three wooden paddlers on the New York mail service with iron screw steamers that only carried saloon passengers.|$|E
