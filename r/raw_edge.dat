5|$|On the April 11 {{episode of}} <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> {{announced}} his retirement from professional wrestling due to his neck injury permanently preventing him from being cleared, thus ending any possibility of he and Orton teaming up again.|$|E
5|$|On the April 30, 2007, {{episode of}} <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> and Orton {{met in a}} {{one-on-one}} match. Edge won the match by pinning Orton following a spear. Edge then moved to the SmackDown brand on the May 11 episode after cashing in the Money in the Bank briefcase (which he had won from Mr. Kennedy on the same episode of Raw) to win the World Heavyweight Championship from then-champion The Undertaker. With this move, Rated-RKO was officially disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The band entered Music Box Studios in Los Angeles with Gordon and Fleming in March 1991, {{and worked}} on the album for one week; the songs were {{recorded}} {{over a period of}} four days, and were mixed {{over the course of a}} further three days. During the recording sessions for the album, Love purportedly gargled whiskey and excessively smoked cigarettes before takes to give a <b>raw</b> <b>edge</b> to her vocals.|$|E
50|$|A seam finish is a {{treatment}} that secures and neatens the <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> of a plain seam to prevent raveling, by sewing over the <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> or enclosing {{them in some}} sort of binding.|$|R
50|$|In a French seam, the <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> of {{the fabric}} are fully {{enclosed}} for a neat finish. The seam is first sewn with wrong sides together, then the seam allowances are trimmed and pressed. A second seam is sewn with right sides together, enclosing the <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> of the original seam.|$|R
50|$|A bound {{buttonhole}} is one {{which has its}} <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> encased by pieces of fabric or trim instead of stitches.|$|R
5|$|With {{his defeat}} {{at the hands}} of Edge, Hardy was moved to the SmackDown! brand where he re-debuted with a win over Simon Dean on October 21 in Reno, Nevada. One week later, Hardy won the fan vote to {{represent}} Team Smackdown (alongside the second-highest vote-getter Rey Mysterio) to challenge team <b>RAW</b> (<b>Edge</b> and Chris Masters) at Taboo Tuesday. Edge, however, refused to wrestle and sent Snitsky in place of him in the match, which Hardy and Mysterio would win.|$|E
5|$|On the April 11, 2011 {{episode of}} <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> gave an {{emotional}} speech about {{his career and}} the realities of wrestling. He said he took further tests to his basic-strength tests, and an MRI result forced him to retire. Leading up to this announcement, he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and felt numbness in his arms. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than it being too late.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) and D-Generation X (DX; Triple H and Shawn Michaels) {{began on the}} October 9 edition of <b>Raw.</b> <b>Edge</b> and Orton both had {{problems}} with DX {{in the past and}} formed an alliance against them, and challenged DX to a match at Cyber Sunday, WWE's only pay-per-view where people can go online and votes for different aspects of a match. Rated-RKO defeated DX, after Eric Bischoff, the referee of the match, let Orton use a folding chair, which led Rated-RKO to victory. For consecutive weeks, Triple H and Orton competed in singles matches. On the December 11 edition of Raw, Flair assisted DX in an ambush by Rated-RKO and Kenny, and Coachman came out to announce a Six-man tag team match, where DX and Flair again emerged victorious. DX would challenge Rated-RKO for the World Tag Team Championships at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Raw</b> <b>Edges</b> also {{included}} the ghost story [...] "Mrs Rivers's Journal" [...] which Hugh Lamb has reprinted in his anthologies Gaslight Nightmares 2 and [...] "Gaslit Horror".|$|R

50|$|Sewing {{machines}} are now {{made for a}} broad range of specialised sewing purposes, such as quilting machines, computerized machines for embroidery, and sergers for finishing <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> of fabric.|$|R
5|$|Upon his return, Edge {{began to}} show some villainous {{characteristics}} centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned his partner (although Benoit managed to win the title on his own) and instead interfered in the main event, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again and {{sitting in a chair}} and watching the match. After the conclusion of the match, Edge attacked Benoit, officially turning heel {{for the first time since}} 2001. Edge then adopted a drastically different gimmick, becoming a crazed and brash villain in the process. At Survivor Series, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista and Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho before getting eliminated by Randy Orton.|$|E
5|$|With Triple H out of action, Rated-RKO {{continued}} their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels. They {{were able to}} schedule a two-on-one handicap match against Michaels, during which {{he was able to}} beat the odds and defeat both men, leaving Orton lying in the ring after a one-man con-chair-to as Edge stood and watched at ringside. on the January 22 episode of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> defeated Michaels in a street fight with help from Orton. at the Royal Rumble (2007), both members of Rated-RKO made it to the final four where The Undertaker won the match. On January 29, 2007, the duo lost the World Tag Team Championship to the impromptu team of John Cena and Michaels. on the February 12 episode of Raw, Rated-RKO, Mr. Kennedy and MVP lost to John Cena, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker and Batista. Internal dissension continued as both men laid claim to being the number one contender to the WWE Championship, and Edge walked out on Orton during a February 26, 2007, rematch for the World Tag Team Championship due to miscommunication.|$|E
5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, a real life issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E

50|$|Buttonholes {{often have}} a bar of {{stitches}} at either side of them. This is a row of perpendicular hand or machine stitching to reinforce the <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> of the fabric, and {{to prevent it from}} fraying.|$|R
5000|$|Felled seam, or flat-fell seam, is a seam made {{by placing}} one edge inside a folded edge of fabric, then {{stitching}} the fold down. It includes a topstitched finish. It {{is useful for}} keeping seam allowances flat and covering <b>raw</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore Intergender match, as Edge and Mick Foley faced Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. The rivalry started between Edge and Foley, when the two faced in a Hardcore match at WrestleMania 22. Edge won the match after a spear off the apron and through a flaming table on the outside. Foley was a guest on the Cutting Edge on the May 1, 2006 episode of Raw, and the two agreed to a WrestleMania Hardcore rematch the {{following}} week. Before the match began on the May 8, 2006 edition of Raw, Foley announced that the match was now a triple threat match, with Tommy Dreamer added as the third person. During the match, however, Foley turned heel {{for the first time}} in over eight years and attacked Dreamer with a barbed wire baseball bat. Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize for what happened to Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s. When the two exchanged punches, Edge and Lita came out, with Lita low-blowing Funk. Edge and Foley double-teamed Funk, with Edge hitting Funk with a barbed wire baseball bat. A week later, on the May 22, 2006 edition of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> and Foley announced themselves as co-holders of the WWE Hardcore Championship. Paul Heyman came out and made a challenge to Edge and Foley to face Funk and Dreamer at One Night Stand, which Edge accepted. The two, along with Lita, went after Heyman up the ramp, before Dreamer and Funk attacked them with several weapons, sending the trio out of the arena. On the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on June 7, 2006, Edge faced Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match. Dreamer hit Edge with a Dreamer Driver through the table. Lita interfered, and hit Dreamer repeatedly with a cane. Dreamer was not hurt by the shots, and he got Lita up for a powerbomb, before Edge speared Dreamer. Edge got the pinfall and won the match. During the match, Foley and Funk were fighting outside the ring, with Funk busting Foley open. After the match, Foley sat in the middle of the ring and stated his kayfabe thoughts on ECW.|$|E
25|$|At the 2010 Royal Rumble Jericho was {{eliminated}} by the returning Edge, his former tag team partner, {{who went on}} to win the match. At Elimination Chamber, Jericho won the World Heavyweight Championship in an Elimination Chamber match, defeating The Undertaker following interference from Shawn Michaels. The next night on <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> used his Royal Rumble win to challenge Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVI. Jericho defeated Edge, but on the April 2 episode of SmackDown!, Jack Swagger cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Jericho for the championship, after he had been speared by Edge. Swagger retained the championship in a match against Jericho and Edge soon after. Edge defeated Jericho in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules to end the feud.|$|E
25|$|Another {{preliminary}} {{match was}} between Edge versus Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing Match. At WrestleMania, Edge {{won the first}} ever Money in the Bank ladder match, gaining himself a contract that gave him {{a shot at the}} World Heavyweight Championship within one year. On the April 4 episode of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> chose not to use his contract that night, deciding to wait until the right opportunity. When Edge declined to force Batista into a title defense, Eric Bischoff scheduled Edge in a match against Chris Benoit. Benoit won the match by pinfall after performing a roll-up. After the match, Edge attacked Benoit's injured arm with a steel chair. Two weeks later, Benoit and Edge faced off in another match, in which ended in a no-contest, leading to Bischoff to book the Last Man Standing match for Backlash. Other feuds that received less promotion and culminated into matches at Backlash include WWE Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin versus Chris Jericho for the title in standard singles bouts. William Regal and Tajiri versus Rosey and The Hurricane versus The Heart Throbs (Antonio Thomas and Romeo Roselli) versus La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) in a tag team turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship, and a singles match between Kane (accompanied by Lita) versus Viscera (accompanied with Trish Stratus).|$|E
50|$|The {{details of}} a Tori Richard shirt include laser-etched mother-of-pearl buttons, French seams (<b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> turned in, sewn and invisible), matched pockets, and collars with interlining, an extra layer of fabric fused {{to the inside of}} the collar to add {{crispness}} and prevent droop.|$|R
50|$|A {{plain seam}} {{is the most}} common type of machine-sewn seam. It joins two pieces of fabric {{together}} face-to-face by sewing through both pieces, leaving a seam allowance with <b>raw</b> <b>edges</b> inside the work. The seam allowance usually requires some sort of seam finish to prevent raveling.|$|R

25|$|The main feud on the undercard {{was between}} D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The feud {{began to develop}} on the October 9 edition of Raw, when Edge {{convinced}} Orton that Triple H {{was the reason for}} their unsuccess. Orton lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H in 2004, and Edge lost a title match due to interference from DX the previous week. This led to Edge and Orton joining forces. On the next edition of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> praised Mr. McMahon's booking skills and suggested that he and Orton have a match with DX at Cyber Sunday where fans could choose a special guest referee. Mr. McMahon liked the idea, and decided for the options to be Coachman, Eric Bischoff, and himself. The following week, Orton pinned Triple H in a match after hitting Triple H {{in the head with a}} steel chair. Coachman had been the special guest referee, but Michaels superkicked him after he tried to count the pinfall, after Edge had interfered. On October 30, McMahon, Coachman, and Bischoff were guests on Edge's talkshow, The Cutting Edge, and McMahon booked a match between Orton and Triple H for later that night, with Edge as the guest referee. Before the match could start, however, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge, meaning he couldn't officiate. Edge recovered and interfered, meaning the match ended in a no-contest. Edge and Orton attacked Triple H with steel chairs, until Triple H got his sledgehammer and retaliated.|$|E
500|$|Although Edge {{had lost}} his {{scheduled}} match at New Year's Revolution, {{that would not be}} his only match that evening as the main event saw John Cena, the reigning WWE Champion, defend his title in an Elimination Chamber match. After a bloody Cena won the match, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon revealed that Edge was cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to face Cena for the championship immediately. After two spears, Edge quickly defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship, marking his first world title win. The following night on <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> decided to celebrate his victory by having [...] "hot, unbridled sex" [...] {{in the middle of the}} ring. He and Lita engaged in foreplay until they were interrupted by Flair, who called Edge a disgrace and [...] "that he was horrible in the sack". Flair, however, ended up on the receiving end of a con-chair-to on the announcers' table until Cena came out to Flair's aid and performed an FU on Lita. The [...] "Live Sex Celebration" [...] segment earned Raw a 5.2 rating, the highest Raw rating in over a year, leading Edge to call himself the [...] "most watched champion ever". On the January 16 episode of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> defeated Ric Flair in a TLC match to retain the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Edge lost the WWE Championship back to Cena.|$|E
500|$|Off-screen, at this time, Dumas {{had been}} {{involved}} with Matt Hardy romantically, but began a relationship with Adam Copeland (Edge). WWE then began to use the real-life issues between the three as an on-screen storyline. In April, Hardy was released from WWE, only to be rehired several months later. Lita continued to act as Edge's valet, and Edge defeated Hardy at SummerSlam. On the October 3 episode of <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge,</b> {{with the assistance of}} Lita, defeated Hardy in a ladder match, and Hardy was obligated to leave Raw as a stipulation of the match. Edge defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship on January 8 at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

500|$|On the May 7, 2007 {{episode of}} <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> {{interrupted}} an in-ring promo by {{the winner of}} the 2007 Money in the Bank contract, Mr. Kennedy. Kennedy had said for weeks that he would not cash in the contract until the following WrestleMania, but Edge decided to goad him into a match for his briefcase. Edge attacked Kennedy before the match even started, severely injuring his shoulder, and took advantage of the injury to beat Kennedy and take the briefcase. Edge thus became the first person to gain the Money in the Bank contract twice and the first not {{to do so in the}} ladder match. (This was done to give Kennedy time to recuperate from what was originally thought to be a completely torn triceps tendon, but later turned out to be a much less severe injury.) ...|$|E
500|$|On the April 26, 2010, {{episode of}} <b>Raw,</b> <b>Edge</b> [...] (who became a heel again) cost Orton (who turned face after feuding with The Legacy) a title shot against John Cena by spearing him during a triple threat match against Batista and Sheamus. Orton and Edge faced off at May's Over the Limit pay-per-view, though, Orton dislocated his right {{shoulder}} and concluded the match with a double countout. On the January 28, 2011, episode of SmackDown, Edge and Orton—now both fan favorites—reunited to take on Dolph Ziggler and The Miz which ended with Edge and Orton taking the win. On the February 18, 2011, episode of SmackDown, Edge and Orton reunited once again with John Morrison, R-Truth, Rey Mysterio, and John Cena to take on CM Punk, Kane, Drew McIntyre, Wade Barrett, Dolph Ziggler, and Sheamus in a 12-man tag team match which was won by Edge, Orton, Morrison, Truth, Mysterio, and Cena.|$|E
