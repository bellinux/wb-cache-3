40|$|We present <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping,</b> a full-likelihood {{dynamical}} modelling machinery, {{that aims}} to recover the Milky Way's (MW) gravitational potential from large samples of stars in the Galactic disk. <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping</b> models the observed positions and velocities of stars with a parameterized, action-based distribution function (DF) in a parameterized axisymmetric gravitational potential (Binney & McMillan 2011, Binney 2012, Bovy & Rix 2013). In anticipation of the Gaia data release in autumn, we have fully tested <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping</b> and demonstrated its robustness against the breakdown of its assumptions. Using large suites of mock data, we investigated in isolated test cases how the modelling would be affected if the data's true potential or DF {{was not included in}} the families of potentials and DFs assumed by <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping,</b> or if we misjudged measurement errors or the spatial selection function (SF) (Trick et al., submitted to ApJ). We found that the potential can be robustly recovered — given the limitations of the assumed potential model—, even for minor misjudgments in DF or SF, or for proper motion errors or distances known to within 10 %. We were also able to demonstrate that <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping</b> is still successful if the strong assumption of axisymmetric breaks down (Trick et al., in preparation). Data drawn from a highresolution simulation (D'Onghia et al. 2013) of a MW-like galaxy with pronounced spiral arms does neither follow the assumed simple DF, nor does it come from an axisymmetric potential. We found that as long as the survey volume is large enough, <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping</b> gives good average constraints on the galaxy's potential. We are planning to apply <b>Road</b> <b>Mapping</b> to a real data set — the Tycho- 2 catalogue (Hog et al. 2000) —very soon, and might be able to present some preliminary results already at the conference...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> methodology we developed {{in the context of}} the CyberROAD EU FP 7 project, whose aim is to develop a research roadmap for cybercrime and cyber terrorism. To this aim we built on state-of-the-art methodologies and available guidelines, including related projects, and adapted them to the peculiarities of our <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> subject. In particular, its distinctive feature is that cybercrime and cyber terrorism co-evolve with their contextual environment (i. e., Technology, society, politics and economy), which poses specific challenges to a <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> effort. Our approach can become a best practice in the field of cyber security, and can be also generalised to phenomena that exhibit a similar, strong co-evolution with their contextual environment. We aim to describe here the <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> methodology that will lead to the roadmap but not the roadmap itself (this one being, incidentally, still under construction at the time of writing this paper) ...|$|R
40|$|Technology <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> {{has emerged}} {{in recent years as}} a key {{management}} tool in formulating the link between technological resources and the exploitation of market opportunities. A powerful aid to strategy formulation and communication, the technique has the major advantage of bringing many functions within a business together around a common plan. Although there is no definitive guide to <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> practice, the application in many different businesses has revealed a number of generic aspects. A major common factor is that technology <b>road</b> <b>maps</b> are concerned with the introduction of technology change into an organisation. This paper proposes a conceptual model of the factors significant for the successful introduction of technology change. The relevance of this framework to technology <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> is discussed based on the in-depth experience of developing and implementing TRMs for three large companies. Also discussed briefly are results of questionnaires sent to these three companies to obtain a feedback on their post-implementation experiences...|$|R
