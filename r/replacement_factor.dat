40|$|Introduction Using {{clotting}} factors (fresh frozen plasma and/or cryoprecipitate) {{to treat}} snake venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC) is controversial. We aimed {{to determine if}} <b>factor</b> <b>replacement</b> after antivenom is associated with an earlier return of coagulation function. Methods We retrospectively analysed VICC cases due to brown snake (genus Pseudonaja), tiger snake (Notechis, Tropidechis, and Hoplocephalus), and taipan (Oxyuranus) envenoming. Recovery of international normalized ratio (INR) /prothrombin time (PT) was compared between patients who did not receive <b>factor</b> <b>replacement</b> and those who did, and between patients who received <b>factor</b> <b>replacement</b> ≤ 4 h of commencing antivenom and those who received <b>factor</b> <b>replacement</b> later or not at all. Results There {{was no significant difference}} between cases receiving clotting factors and cases that did not, however in 21 cases having <b>factor</b> <b>replacement</b> within 4 h, the median time to coagulation recovery was 4. 6 h (interquartile range [IQR] 3. 5 – 8. 8), versus 9. 5 h (IQR 7. 3 – 13) in 106 cases who had clotting factors later or not at all (P < 0. 001). No serious adverse effects attributed to clotting factors were recorded. Recovery by 6 h after starting antivenom was also more likely in those who were younger, in tiger snake envenoming, and where the interval between bite and starting antivenom was longer. The initial dose of antivenom did not appear to influence the likelihood of recovery at 6 h.

In addition, the related metazoan-specific TBP-like factor (TLF/TRF 2) is essential for transcription of a distinct subset of genes. Here we characterize the vertebrate-specific TBP-like factor TBP 2, using in vitro assays, in vivo antisense knockdown, and mRNA rescue experiments, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation.

Furthermore, TBP 2 is essential for gastrulation and for the transcription of a subset of genes during Xenopus embryogenesis.

Published recommendations exist {{for the management of}} some common cardiovascular conditions (eg, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation), but identifying optimal strategies for anticoagu-lant or antithrombotic therapy constitutes the primary challenge of man-aging nonoperative cardiovascular disease (cvD) in PwH. in general, as long as factor concentrates or other hemostatic therapies maintain adequate hemostasis, the recommended medical and surgical management of cvD in PwH parallels that in individuals without hemophilia. the presence of factor inhibitors complicates hemophilia management. Published outcomes of cvD treatment in PwH are similar to those in the general population.

40|$|Current {{therapy for}} {{haemophilia}} A {{is guided by}} severity of the disease, {{which in turn is}} best reflected in patients’ endogenous factor VIII activity levels. For patients with severe haemophilia (particularly children), prophylaxis with continuous routine factor replacement has become standard of care in developed countries and is gradually becoming the standard of care in developing countries. The question arises then: what is an appropriate prophylaxis regimen to prevent bleeding events and arthropathy, while also maximizing patient quality of life and taking into consideration the costs of prophylaxis? Should all patients be treated with one standard, fixed prophylaxis regimen, or should prophylaxis be individualised for each patient? If so, what factors need to be considered in choosing the appropriate dose and frequency of factor administration? If prophylaxis is tailored to the individual patient, then patient-related factors (bleeding phenotype, activity profiles, age, joint status) and product-specific factors (half-life of the <b>replacement</b> <b>factor</b> in the individual patient) will determine the choice of regimen, whether it be a fixed-regimen prophylaxis or prophylaxis that is tailored to patient activity and bleeding risk.

40|$|SummaryEctopic {{expression}} of Oct 4, Sox 2, cMyc, and Klf 4 confers a pluripotent state upon several differentiated cell types, generating induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) [1 – 8]. iPSC derivation is highly inefficient, and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This low efficiency suggests the existence of additional cooperative factors whose identification is critical for understanding reprogramming. In addition, the therapeutic use of iPSCs relies on the development of efficient nongenetic means of factor delivery, and although a handful of replacement molecules have been identified, their use yields a further reduction to the already low reprogramming efficiency [9 – 11]. Thus, the identification of compounds that enhance rather than solely replace the function of the reprogramming factors will be of great use. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Tgfbβ signaling cooperates in the reprogramming of murine fibroblasts by enabling faster, more efficient induction of iPSCs, whereas activation of Tgfβ signaling blocks reprogramming. In addition to exhibiting a strong cooperative effect, the Tgfβ receptor inhibitor bypasses the requirement for exogenous cMyc or Sox 2, highlighting its dual role as a cooperative and <b>replacement</b> <b>factor.</b> The identification of a highly characterized pathway operating in iPSC induction will open new avenues for mechanistic dissection of the reprogramming process...|$|E
40|$|Neutralizing {{antibodies}} (inhibitors) to <b>replacement</b> <b>factor</b> VIII (FVIII, either plasma derived or recombinant) impair {{the effective}} management of hemophilia A. Individuals with hemophilia A due to major deletions of the FVIII gene (F 8) lack antigenically cross-reactive material in their plasma ("CRM-negative"), and {{the prevalence of}} inhibitors in these individuals may {{be as high as}} 90 %. Conversely, individuals with hemophilia A caused by F 8 missense mutations are CRM-positive, and their overall prevalence of inhibitors is < 10 % (ref. 2). Individuals with the F 8 intron 22 inversion (found in ∼ 50 % of individuals with severe hemophilia A) have been grouped with the former {{on the basis of their}} genetic defect and CRM-negative status. However, only ∼ 20 % of these individuals develop inhibitors. Here we demonstrate that the levels of F 8 mRNA and intracellular FVIII protein in B lymphoblastoid cells and liver biopsies from individuals with the intron 22 inversion are comparable to those in healthy controls. These results support the hypothesis that most individuals with the intron 22 inversion are tolerized to FVIII and thus do not develop inhibitors. Furthermore, we developed a new pharmacogenetic algorithm that permits the stratification of inhibitor risk for individuals and subpopulations by predicting the immunogenicity of replacement FVIII using, as input, the number of putative T cell epitopes in the infused protein and the competence of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to present such epitopes. This algorithm showed statistically significant accuracy in predicting the presence of inhibitors in 25 unrelated individuals with the intron 22 inversion. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

40|$|The {{availability}} of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, eptacog alfa activated) has greatly advanced {{the care of}} patients with haemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors against the infused <b>replacement</b> <b>factor.</b> Recombinant FVIIa is licensed for the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes and the prevention of bleeding in surgery or invasive procedures in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors. This article attempts to review in detail the extensive evidence of rFVIIa in congenital haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Patients with acute bleeding episodes are best treated on demand at home, to achieve the short- and long-term benefits of rapid bleed control. Key prospective {{studies have shown that}} rFVIIa achieves consistently high efficacy rates in the management of acute (including joint) bleeds in inhibitor patients in the home treatment setting. Substantial post-approval data from key registries also support the on-demand efficacy profile of rFVIIa established by the prospective clinical trials. The {{availability of}} rFVIIa has allowed major surgery to become a reality for inhibitor patients. Studies in key surgery, including orthopaedic procedures, have found that rFVIIa provides consistently high efficacy rates. Importantly, the wealth of data does not raise any unexpected safety concerns surrounding rFVIIa use; this is likely because rFVIIa is a recombinant product with a localised mechanism of action at the site of vascular injury. In summary, rFVIIa is established as an effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment for on-demand bleeding control and bleed prevention during minor and major (including elective orthopaedic) surgery in inhibitor patients. Use of rFVIIa has been a major step towards narrowing the gap in outcomes between inhibitor patients and non-inhibitor patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
