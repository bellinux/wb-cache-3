5|$|Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This external heating differs from the internal heat source for volcanism on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope decay and <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E

25|$|Information {{provided}} to the IAEA indicated that storage pool temperatures at both Units 5 and 6 remained steady around 60–68°C between 19:00 JST 14 March and 21:00 JST 18 March, though rising slowly. On 18 March reactor water levels remained around 2 m above the top of fuel rods. It was confirmed that panels {{had been removed from}} the roofs of Units 5 and 6 to allow any hydrogen gas to escape. At 04:22 on 19 March, the second unit of emergency generator A for Unit 6 was restarted which allowed operation of pump C of the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal system (RHR) in Unit 5 to cool the spent fuel storage pool and reactor core alternately. Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary power connections had to be made to the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal system main loop pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48°C on 19 March 18:00 JST, and 37°C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41°C. On 20 March, NISA announced that both reactors had been returned to a condition of cold shutdown.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} individual quasiparticle excitations on a small superconducting aluminum island connected to normal metallic leads by tunnel junctions.

By injecting electrons with a periodic gate voltage, we probe electron-phonon interaction and relaxation down to a single quasiparticle excitation pair, with a measured recombination rate of 16 kHz. Our experiment yields a strong test of BCS theory in aluminum as the results are consistent with it without free parameters. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This study quantifies {{uncertainties}} {{in closing}} the seasonal cycle of diabatic heat storage over the Pacific Ocean from 20 degrees S to 60 degrees N through {{the synthesis of}} World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) products over 7 years from 1993 - 1999. We utilize WOCE reanalysis products from the following sources: diabatic heat storage (DHS) from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO); near-surface geostrophic and Ekman currents from the Earth and Space Research (ESR); and air-sea heat fluxes from Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and European Center for Mid-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We interpolate these products onto a common grid, allowing the seasonal cycle of DHS to be modeled for comparison with that observed. Everywhere latent <b>heat</b> flux <b>residuals</b> dominate sensible <b>heat</b> flux <b>residuals</b> and shortwave <b>heat</b> flux <b>residuals</b> dominate longwave <b>heat</b> flux <b>residuals,</b> both comparable in magnitude to the <b>residual</b> horizontal <b>heat</b> advection. We find the root-mean-square (RMS) {{of the differences between}} observed and model residual DHS tendencies to be less than 15 W per square meters everywhere except in the Kuroshio extension. Comparable COADS and NCEP products perform better than ECMWF products in the extra-tropics, while the NCEP product performs best in the tropics. Radiative and turbulent air-sea <b>heat</b> flux <b>residuals</b> computed from ship-born measurements perform better than those computed from satellite cloud and wind measurements. Since the RMS differences derive largely from biases in measured wind speed and cloud fraction, least-squares minimization is used to correct the <b>residual</b> Ekman <b>heat</b> advection and air-sea heat flux. Minimization reduces RMS differences less than 5 W per square meters except in the Kuroshio extension, suggesting how winds, clouds, and exchange coefficients in the NCEP, ECMWF, and ESR products can be improved...|$|R
25|$|The {{detachment}} {{along the}} weak layers was likely {{aided by the}} presence of high-pressure water in the sediment pore spaces. This possibility has interesting astrobiological implications. If water-saturated zones still exist in sediments under the volcano, they would likely have been kept warm by a high geothermal gradient and <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from the volcano's magma chamber. Potential springs or seeps around the volcano would offer exciting possibilities for detecting microbial life.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July in the morning, a {{crack in}} a {{polyvinyl}} hose - 30 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide - was found around the outlet of a temporary pump for seawater. At 10AM the pump was shut off, the cooling system of reactor 5 was halted 15 minutes later. The polyvinyl pipe was replaced, and the cooling system was restarted at 13:45PM. The temperature in the reactor rose some 5 degrees Celsius to 47.7 degrees Celsius. Constant tidal movements were probably {{the cause of the}} rupture of the pleated flexible tube. On 4 July TEPCO announced that all tubes and hoses used in the heat removal systems will be checked on possible weaknesses. Tubes like these, that were used to transfer highly radioactive water, did not require replacement because they were not bent at extreme angles. At 10:16 AM on 15 July, TEPCO completed repairs to Pump B of the original <b>Residual</b> <b>Heat</b> Removal Seawater System of Unit 5. The original seawater system was severely damaged in the tsunami requiring the temporary seawater pumps and hoses to be installed which have proven to be leak prone. At 2:45 PM on 15 July, TEPCO began pumping seawater through the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal heat exchanger with the newly repaired pump.|$|E

This restriction in age {{is thought to be}} due to cooling of the mantle, which may have been up to 500 °C hotter during the early to middle Archaean (3.8 to 2.8 billion years ago). The early Earth had much higher heat production, due to the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from planetary accretion, as well as the greater abundance of radioactive elements.|$|E

40|$|We {{observe the}} {{spontaneous}} evaporation of atoms confined in a bubble-like rf-dressed trap (Zobay and Garraway, 2001). The atoms are confined in a quadrupole magnetic trap and are dressed by a linearly polarized rf field. The evaporation {{is related to}} the presence of holes in the trap, at the positions where the rf coupling vanishes, due to its vectorial character. The final temperature results from a competition between <b>residual</b> <b>heating</b> and evaporation efficiency, which is controlled via the height of the holes with respect {{to the bottom of the}} trap. The experimental data are modeled by a Monte-Carlo simulation predicting a small increase in phase space density limited by the heating rate. This increase was within the phase space density determination uncertainty of the experiment. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures; to appear in J. Phys. ...|$|R

25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the exhaust steam feedwater heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the reactor}} SCRAM, {{operators}} activated the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC) and the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal system and core spray systems were {{made available to}} cool the suppression pool; whether they were activated prior to the tsunami {{has not been made}} clear. The RHRS and CS pumps were knocked out of commission by the tsunami. With DC battery power remaining, the RCIC continued to keep the water level stable, and the operators switched to the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system when water level began to drop. On 13 March, the HPCI system failed, the reason for which is not completely clear due to instrumentation not being available. It is believed to be either due to loss of DC power due to depletion of batteries or to reactor pressure dropping below the level at which it can operate. Operators were unable to restart it as batteries were exhausted. After this the operators were unable to start the RCIC system and began injecting seawater. Although it was not clear at the time, some of the fuel in Reactor 3 apparently melted around sixty hours after the earthquake (the night of the 12th to 13th).|$|E
25|$|On the 16th, {{warm air}} picking up {{moisture}} – due to <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> from the Atlantic Ocean – travelled towards the South West Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon {{contact with the}} topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force thus causing internal moisture to reach the atmosphere, and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall {{on the afternoon of}} 16 August 2004. 185mm (7inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of the downpour, at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, 2.5 miles (4km) up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, 89mm (3.5inches) of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. The rain was very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24 hour totals of 200mm and 185mm respectively on the day, whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect.|$|E
25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases. The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of this {{experiment}} was {{to select the}} best material {{for the construction of}} thermal links aiming at cooling down sensitive masses of the order of 100 - 1000 kg for the detection of rare decays and gravitational waves. We report on the technique used to measure the thermal conductivity at very low temperatures (down to 30 mK) of three different types of copper, before and after a thermal treatment of the samples. The most conductive copper was used for the thermal link of the CUORICINO experiment, where a mass of about 60 kg needs to be cooled down to a few mK. The cool down time was reduced by at least one order of magnitude with respect to previous similar experiments.
