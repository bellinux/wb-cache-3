50|$|The Original Roland R-8 {{drum machine}} had one <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> slot for {{patterns}} and songs and one slot for PCM ROM sound cards to be plugged {{in order to}} add {{a wide range of}} sounds to the internal sound banks. The R8M rack version allows up to three PCM ROM cards and one <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> to be plugged in and accessed simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|Battery-backed {{real time}} clock for time and date {{stamping}} of files, if the internal <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> is present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> {{could be}} added using 1 or 2 MB RAM cards (up {{to a maximum of}} 4 MB) ...|$|E
5000|$|Data {{storage can}} be done by an {{optional}} external 720kb (in fact it supported [...] "Japanese" [...] 1.2Mb format but did not support more common 1.44Mb) 3.5-inch floppy drive, by the internal non-volatile RAM drive (silicon hard drive), or by proprietary <b>RAM</b> and ROM <b>cards.</b> The internal <b>ram</b> drive is powered by an auxiliary battery inside the unit which needs to be recharged every week or so {{in order to keep the}} contents of the ram drive. The credit-card sized, battery-powered <b>RAM</b> <b>cards</b> come with capacity sizes of 256kb or 512Kb. Both <b>RAM</b> <b>cards</b> and ROM cards use a proprietary NEC interface because this laptop came out at a time when there were no standard portable computing interfaces. The PCMCIA standard did not exist until 1990. The <b>RAM</b> <b>cards</b> were powered by a replaceable 3 volt lithium coin battery and had a write-protect switch.|$|R
5000|$|The STD Bus uses 6.5" [...] by 4.5" [...] {{expansion}} card {{with an edge}} connector with 56 pins. Many different types of cards have been available for the STD Bus, from processing <b>cards,</b> <b>RAM</b> <b>cards,</b> I/O cards, and specialized cards for various applications.|$|R
5000|$|An 8086 CPU was used. The maximum RAM was 768 KB, {{made up of}} 256 KB on {{the main}} board plus two {{additional}} 256 KB <b>RAM</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|FX-BMP - 128KB+ Backup <b>RAM</b> <b>Card</b> with x 2 AAA batteries, FX-SCSI - Adaptor {{allows a}} PC {{to use the}} PC-FX as a 2X SCSI CD-ROM ...|$|E
5000|$|... 256 KB <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> (1 or 2 {{could be}} added for 768KB total; each card had two 128KB banks of nine 64 KB DRAM chips, type 4164) ...|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The Atari 800 used large {{expansion}} <b>cards</b> for the <b>RAM,</b> ROM and processor. Most Atari 800s shipped {{with three}} of these 16KB <b>RAM</b> <b>cards,</b> {{for a total of}} 48KB.|$|R
5000|$|Random Access Memory (<b>RAM)</b> <b>cards</b> {{were also}} available, with {{capacities}} ranging from 8,192 (8K) bytes up to 56K (the maximum supported in their system architecture). Since the systems {{were based on}} the S-100 bus, other manufacturers' memory card could be used in Poly systems as well.|$|R
50|$|The HP 2640A was {{introduced}} in 1975, and used an Intel 8008 CPU, and was priced at US$3500. At introduction, it could have up to 8 KB of RAM (two 4 KB semiconductor <b>RAM</b> <b>cards).</b> Also introduced in 1975 was the HP 2644A, which was an HP 2640A with mass storage (two mini-tape cartridges), for US$5000.|$|R
50|$|System 8813 {{hardware}} {{included the}} standard CPU and VTI cards; a <b>RAM</b> <b>card,</b> typically {{with at least}} 32K of memory; and a disk controller card, to interface with the minifloppy drives. Later, a Z80 based disk controller supported double sided, double-density minifloppy drives, and full-size (8-inch) floppy drives.|$|E
50|$|The memory {{configuration}} was software-switchable {{from the}} command-line. The <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> could be appended {{to the system}} memory, replace the system memory or act as a separate space {{to be used as}} a RAM drive (F:). The main memory could also be partitioned off to a RAM drive (E:).|$|E
5000|$|The total memory {{capacity}} of the devices varied from 1 KB to 12 KB and up as far as 16 KB {{with the use of}} an available <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> (only for some models). The option RAM cards varied in sizes from 1 KB, 4 KB and 8 KB.|$|E
50|$|Three {{models were}} produced, the 6150, 6151, and 6152. The basic types of {{machines}} were the tower model (6150), and the desktop model (6151). All these models featured a special board slot for the processor card, {{as well as}} machine specific <b>RAM</b> <b>cards.</b> Each machine had one processor slot, one co-processor slot, and two RAM slots.|$|R
5000|$|The machine came {{standard}} with 64 KB RAM, {{with the}} equivalent of a built-in Apple Language Card in its circuitry, and had a new special [...] "Auxiliary slot" [...] (replacing slot 0, though electronically mapped to slot 3 for compatibility with earlier third-party 80-column cards) for adding more memory via bank-switching <b>RAM</b> <b>cards.</b> Through this slot it also includes built-in support for an 80-column text display on monitors (with the addition of a plug-in 1K memory card, via bank-switching of 40 columns) and could be easily doubled to 128 KB RAM by alternatively plugging in Apple's Extended 80-Column Text Card. As time progressed, even more memory could be added through third-party cards using the same bank-switching slot or, alternatively, general-purpose slot cards that addressed memory 1 byte at a time (i.e. Slinky <b>RAM</b> <b>cards).</b> A new ROM diagnostic routine could be invoked to test the motherboard for faults and also test its main bank of memory.|$|R
50|$|The Amen32 was a <b>RAM</b> {{expansion}} <b>card</b> for the Amiga 1200. It {{also provided}} a socket for an FPU.|$|R
50|$|A 6502 {{assembler}} {{was soon}} offered on disk, {{and later the}} UCSD compiler and operating system for the Pascal language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16k <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) {{in addition to the}} full 48k of motherboard memory.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} hack is the Portfolio Compact Flash modification. By {{modifying the}} <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> slot and fitting a CF-socket {{and a small}} circuit (a 74 series chip {{and a bit of}} buffering) CF cards can be used (albeit in partitions no larger than 32 MB each due to limitations of the ROMed DOS).|$|E
5000|$|Two type of <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> are available, a 4 or 8 MB card, and the [...] "XP Cache" [...] card, {{incorporating}} up to 8 MB with an 82385 cache controller and 32 KB of cache SRAM. Up to two memory cards can be installed, to give {{a maximum}} RAM capacity of 16 MB.|$|E
25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} {{switches on the}} front panel {{was the only way}} to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel. Nevertheless, many were sold in this form. Roberts was already hard at work on additional cards, including a paper tape reader for storage, additional <b>RAM</b> <b>cards,</b> and a RS-232 interface to connect to a proper Teletype terminal.|$|R
5000|$|The Sharp PC-E500 series could {{store data}} and {{programs}} on memory expansion cards {{as well as}} the main <b>RAM.</b> Six <b>cards</b> were available: ...|$|R
50|$|CPU/RAM - {{holding the}} Z80A CPU, {{firmware}} ROMs, {{and up to}} 32 KB of <b>RAM.</b> The <b>card</b> also provided a parallel Centronics printer port (not always connected).|$|R
50|$|Predecessor formats {{include the}} 15 SN-U110 PCM cards (U-110, U-20, U-220, D-70, CM-64 and CM-32P), 8 SL-JD80 PCM card/preset <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> (JD-only) sets and 8 SO-PCM1 1-2 MB cards (both JD-800, JD-990, JV-80, JV-880, JV-90, JV-1000 and JV-1080), 22 SR-JV80 {{expansion}} boards (JD-990, JV-880, JV-1010, JV-1080, JV-2080, XV-3080, XV-5080, JV-80, JV-90, JV-1000, XP-30, XP-50, XP-60, XP-80, Fantom FA76, XV-88) and others.|$|E
5000|$|The D-50 {{was fully}} MIDI-compatible, though it transmits {{on only one}} channel. The {{keyboard}} was velocity- and after-touch-sensitive, and the keys were slightly [...] "weighted" [...] with metal for a higher-quality feel. It included 64 patches on-board, and 64 more patches were available on the expansion <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> that was included. It use C2032 Lithium internal battery for memory back up.|$|E
5000|$|The TwinSystem was {{marketed as}} [...] "Get more work {{done on a}} {{computer}} built for two." [...] The System 8813 TwinSystem had an additional <b>RAM</b> <b>card,</b> video card, and keyboard. Bank switching between the RAM cards allowed the CPU to keep two applications in memory simultaneously. However, the TTL-level keyboard interface limited {{the distance between the}} two user stations to a few feet.|$|E
50|$|The DS-8 {{features}} one {{joystick controller}} for bending pitch, timbre and modulation speed, one card slot for aforementioned KORG <b>RAM</b> <b>Cards,</b> MIDI IN/OUT/THRU jacks, a damper pedal, assignable pedal, assignable switch, program up pedal, one balance slider, four keyboard modes (Single, Layer, Double and Multi) and two slider controls which indicate {{the ability to}} edit the two oscillators from fast to slow.The three editable banks shown {{on the right side}} of the board (Function, Voice Parameter and Combi Parameter) provide multiple ways in which the user can edit the programs, banks and patches.|$|R
50|$|The HP-75 had a {{single-line}} {{liquid crystal}} display, 48 KiB system ROM and 16 KiB RAM, a comparatively large keyboard (albeit without separate numeric pad), a manually operated {{magnetic card reader}} (2×650 bytes per card), 4 ports for memory expansion (1 for RAM and 3 for ROM modules), and an HP-IL interface {{that could be used}} to connect printers, storage and electronic test equipment. The BASIC interpreter also acted as a primitive operating system, providing file handling capabilities for program storage using <b>RAM,</b> <b>cards,</b> or cassettes/diskettes (via HP-IL).|$|R
5000|$|Voice and {{sequencer}} {{data and}} samples can be loaded from or saved to 3.5" [...] double-density floppy discs. Voices and performance combinations {{can also be}} loaded from or saved to Yamaha's proprietary MCD64 (64K <b>RAM</b> <b>cards</b> (one slot for such cards was provided, alongside one slot for a PCM 'waveform' ROM card). Yamaha and other manufacturers sold expansion sounds for the SY85 in both formats. The SY85 can also transmit and receive voice and sequencer data as MIDI sysex bulk dumps and load or send samples via the MIDI sample dump standard (SDS).|$|R
50|$|The HT-700 was {{the user}} {{programmable}} {{version of the}} MT-600 (hence the prefix HT). It included the fully editable SD synthesis of the HZ-600, plus it took the auto-accompaniment of the MT-600 and made it fully editable too (a very rare and powerful feature). Users could fully program their own 2-measure patterns consisting of drums, basslines and chord inversions. The fill-in measure was also programmable. The HT-700 had 49 mini-keys and a pitch bender, and looked somewhat similar to the MT-600. Unlike the MT-600, though, it included a programming wheel and a card slot for Casio RA-100 RAM cards. The HT-700 and other HT synths could not store nearly as many patches to a <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> as the HZ-600, {{because most of the}} <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> capacity was reserved to store accompaniment patterns and chord/operation sequences. The HT-700 was also sold by Hohner in Germany as the 'KS-49 midi' (with slightly different preset sound set).|$|E
50|$|The COMX 32 kB <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> placed {{additional}} RAM from address @C000 to @DFFF, i.e. {{only one}} 8 kB {{bank of the}} available 32 kB at a time. To switch to a different 8 kB bank the OUT 1 instruction needed to be used via 1802 assembler code. Bit 5 and 6 {{were used for the}} RAM bank selection (bit 1 to 4 were used for the expansion box slot selection).|$|E
50|$|The 170 was {{introduced}} with System 7.0.1, specifically to support new power management and other unique hardware features. However, {{due to the}} RAM prices in 1991, combined with its already high list price, the 170, like the 100 and 140, only had 2 megabytes (MB) RAM soldered directly onto the logicboard, which critics felt was restrictive for use with System 7. Further, since localized versions of System 7 were not yet available worldwide, the Japanese 6.0.7 KanjiTalk version of Apple's System software, was modified to support all three new PowerBooks and released as version J-6.0.7.1. As a result, this version was unofficially adapted for use with the standard 6.0.7 allowing many users to run System 6 on their PowerBooks, rather than upgrading on-board RAM with an expensive proprietary <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> (a 6 MB card was US $899). The 170 shipped with an additional 2 MB <b>RAM</b> <b>card</b> already installed, so it was less of a problem; however, 4 MB was the minimum recommended RAM size for use with System 7 and not practical for use with a RAM Disk, a battery power-saving feature.|$|E
50|$|Arcade Card Duo (PCE-AC1) - A <b>RAM</b> {{expansion}} <b>card</b> {{that adds}} the 16 Megabits of DRAM required to run Arcade CD-ROM² discs on any Super CD-ROM² and PC Engine Duo systems.|$|R
50|$|The Korg DS-8 is an {{expandable}} FM synthesizer {{released by}} KORG in 1986 which used the Yamaha FB-01 FM synthesis engine with 4 sine wave oscillators. 61 Keys in length with both initial and switchable aftertouch capabilities it stores up to 100 programs and 10 combinations in its internal memory. By {{using one of}} the optional non-volatile (but battery-powered) KORG <b>RAM</b> <b>cards</b> MCR-01, MCR-02, or MCR-03 this program memory can be expanded by extra programs and combinations: 100/10 for the MCR-01, 200/20 for the MCR-02, or 400/40 for the MCR-03. Programs can be backed up and received via standard MIDI dumps.|$|R
50|$|The next {{member of}} the line was the Apple IIGS computer, {{released}} on September 15, 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the IIGS featured a true 16-bit microprocessor, the 65C816, operating at 2.8 MHz with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines (<b>RAM</b> <b>cards</b> with more than 4 MB were never directly supported by Apple). It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions with a palette of 4,096 colors and up to 256 colors on screen; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time.|$|R
