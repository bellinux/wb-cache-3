5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and <b>relative</b> <b>index</b> which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Relative</b> <b>Index</b> (or, as Dewey spelled it, [...] "Relativ Index") is an {{alphabetical}} index to the classification, for use both by classifiers {{but also by}} library users when seeking books by topic. The index was [...] "relative" [...] because the index entries pointed to the class numbers, not to the page numbers of the printed classification schedule. In this way, the Dewey Decimal Classification itself had the same relative positioning as the library shelf and could be used either as an entry point to the classification, by catalogers, or as an index to the Dewey-classed library itself.|$|E

The objective of this study was to estimate the sexual compatibility, mating performance and relative sterility between laboratory and wild flies of the Mediterranean fruit fly, C. capitata by new <b>indices</b> (<b>relative</b> mating <b>index,</b> RMI; <b>relative</b> isolation <b>index,</b> RII; isolation <b>index,</b> ISI; male <b>relative</b> performance <b>index,</b> MRPI; female <b>relative</b> performance <b>index,</b> FRPI and <b>relative</b> sterility <b>index,</b> RSI). The results revealed that different doses of gamma radiation 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 Gy had no effect on the various parameters of mating compatibility, performance and competitiveness of lab strain males of medflies when mated with wild males. Moreover, no significant assortative or disassortative mating was observed. Therefore, we suggest that the lab strain males of medfly are compatible of mating with the wild males, at least under the laboratory conditions employed here. ...|$|R

For example, if multiple threads within the same process belong to different data-parallel computations, then the architecture, compiler, or run-time system must ensure that <b>relative</b> <b>indexing</b> and collective operations are handled properly and efficiently. We introduce a run-time-based solution for data-parallel programming in a distributed memory environment that handles the problems of <b>relative</b> <b>indexing</b> and collective communications among thread groups.

In {{contrast to the}} absolute indexing scheme of Johnson and Tian (2000) which bases the option’s payoff on the dollar difference between the stock price and the indexed exercise price, our scheme defines the option’s payoff on {{the ratio of the}} stock price over the indexed exercise price. The absolute indexing is shown to still yield an option value moving in tandem with the index, which is undesirable for it ends up rewarding or penalizing the executive for the factors outside his/her control. Besides correcting the misalignment between reward and performance, <b>relative</b> <b>indexing</b> also possesses many desirable incentive properties. On a per dollar basis, it has a much higher delta (i. e., sensitivity to stock price) and vega (i. e., sensitivity to firm volatility) than absolute <b>indexing,</b> implying that <b>relative</b> <b>indexing</b> has a stronger performance incentive and is more effective in encouraging the CEO to undertake more risky projects which otherwise may be shun due to his/her less-diversified personal wealth. ∗Both authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada...|$|R

METHODS: A cohort of employed Scottish men (n = 5567) provided their fathers' occupation {{and their own}} first and current occupations, from which social class in childhood, at labor-market entry, and at screening (1970 to 1973) was determined. Relative rates of mortality and <b>relative</b> <b>indices</b> of inequality were calculated from 21 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Mortality risk was similar at each stage of life, with men in the higher social classes having the lowest risk.

By comparing the results obtained using ICA-BD with those using IFA, we found <b>relative</b> <b>indices</b> of 85. 0 % for sensitivity and 91. 2 % for specificity, and the positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were 85. 0 % and 91. 2 %, respectively.

For determining the <b>relative</b> chlorophyll <b>index,</b> a CFL 1030 chlorophyll meter was used on a regular sampling grid of 10 m x 10 m with 472 sampling points. Based on the initial sampling grid, by using the point elimination method, the simulation was performed in the following sampling grids: 10 m x 20 m; 20 m x 20 m; 20 m x 30 m; 30 m x 30 m; 30 m x 40 m; and 40 m x 40 m. The increase of the sampling grid reduced the diagnostic accuracy of <b>relative</b> chlorophyll <b>index</b> in wheat leaves. As the sampling grid increased, the maps became more general and information on the spatial variability of the <b>relative</b> chlorophyll <b>index</b> were lost.

40|$|Lightweight threads are {{becoming}} increasingly useful in supporting parallelism and asynchronous control structures in applications and language implementations. Recently, systems have been designed and implemented to support interprocessor communication between lightweight threads so that threads can be exploited in a distributed memory system. Their use, in this setting, has been largely restricted to supporting latency hiding techniques and functional parallelism within a single application. However, to execute data parallel codes independent of other threads in the system, collective operations and <b>relative</b> <b>indexing</b> among threads are required.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Little {{information}} is available on temporal trend in socioeconomic inequalities in cause of death mortality in France. The aim {{of this paper was}} to study educational differences in mortality in France by cause of death and their temporal trend. METHODS: We used a representative sample of 1 % of the French population and compared four periods (1968 - 1974, 1975 - 1981, 1982 - 1988, 1990 - 1996). Causes of death were obtained by direct linkage with the French national death registry. Education was measured {{at the beginning of each}} period, and educational disparities in mortality were studied among men and women aged 30 - 64 at the beginning of each period. Analyses were conducted for all deaths and for the following causes of death: all cancers, lung cancer (among men), upper aerodigestive tract cancers (among men), breast cancer (among women), colorectal cancer, other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, other cardiovascular diseases, external causes, other causes of death. Socioeconomic inequalities were quantified with relative risks and <b>relative</b> <b>indices</b> of inequality. The <b>relative</b> <b>indices</b> of inequality measures socioeconomic inequalities across the population and can be interpreted as the ratio of mortality rates of those with the lowest to those with the highest socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Analyses showed an increase in educational differences in all cause mortality among men (the <b>relative</b> <b>indices</b> of inequality increased from 1. 96 to 2. 77 from the first to the last period) and among women (the <b>relative</b> <b>indices</b> of inequality increased from 1. 87 to 2. 53). Socioeconomic inequalities increased for all cause of death studied among women, and for cancer and cardiovascular diseases among men. The contribution of cancer mortality to difference in overall mortality between the lowest and the highest levels of education increased strongly over the whole study period, especially among women. CONCLUSION: This study shows that large socioeconomic inequalities in mortality are observed in France, and that they increase over time among men and women...|$|R
