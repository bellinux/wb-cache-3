Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the oven charge. A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The post re-solidification shrinkage is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical primary fissures being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at primary fissures on handling the coke after pushing. Smaller secondary fissures present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and small coke particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> <b>degradation</b> in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of secondary fissures in coke lumps [...] ...|$|E

Files are usually compressed using lossy compression; this reduces file size at the cost of some loss of quality. The trade-off between degree of compression and file size can be varied, although this is not an option for existing compressed files. The advantage of solid-state DAPs over hard disks and CDs is <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> vibration, small <b>size</b> and weight, and low battery usage.

In this article, the structure of liver glycogen from mice is investigated with respect <b>to</b> <b>size</b> distributions, <b>degradation</b> kinetics, and branching structure, complemented by a comparison of normal and diabetic liver glycogen. This is done to screen for differences that may result from disease. Glycogen α-particle (diameter ∼ 150 nm) and β-particle (diameter ∼ 25 nm) size distributions are reported, along with in vitro γ-amylase degradation experiments, and a small angle X-ray scattering analysis of mouse β-particles. Type 2 diabetic liver glycogen upon extraction {{was found to be}} present as large loosely bound, aggregates, not present in normal livers.

Application of branching theories to small angle X-ray scattering data for mouse β-particles revealed these particles to be randomly {{branched polymer}}s, not fractal polymers. Together, this article shows that type 2 diabetic liver glycogen is present as large aggregates in mice, which may contribute to the inflexibility of interconversion between glucose and glycogen in type 2 diabetes, and further that glycogen particles are randomly branched with a size that is related to the rate of glucose release...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFERMI@Elettra, {{the first}} seeded EUV-SXR free {{electron}} laser (FEL) facility located at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste has been conceived to provide very short (10 – 100 fs) pulses with ultrahigh peak brightness and wavelengths from 100 nm to 4 nm. A section fully dedicated to the photon transport and analysis diagnostics, named PADReS, has already been installed and commissioned. Three of the beamlines, EIS-TIMEX, DiProI and LDM, installed after the PADReS section, are in advanced commissioning state and will accept the first users in December 2012. These beam lines employ active X-ray optics in order to focus the FEL beam {{as well as to}} perform a controlled beam-shaping at focus. Starting from mirror surface metrology characterization, it is difficult to predict the focal spot shape applying only methods based on geometrical optics such as the ray tracing.

The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the degree to which different manipulation methods can reduce the size of a standard tablet to particles suitable for nasal insufflation. Background. Prescription pain medications are among the most commonly-abused drugs and frequently manipulated for abuse via the nasal route. Manipulating the dosage forms involve chewing, crushing, breaking, milling, or grinding to accelerate drug release via snorting, oral ingestion, injection, or smoking. Using common methods employed by abusers <b>to</b> reduce particle <b>size,</b> the ability of each methods to produce small particles suitable for aerosolization (~ 250 microns) was determined. Methods. Tablets consisting of 80 mg acetaminophen and 320 mg high molecular weight polyethylene oxide (Polyox® WSR coagulant) were prepared on a single station Carver press at 2000 pounds of force. Tablets were then manipulated by various methods including two manual and four mechanical methods for one minute (n= 3). The resultant product was then separated by particle size above and below 250 microns using sieve analysis. Results. Each method was highly capable of producing light particles from tablets with a measured breaking force of 124. 2 N. The percentage of particles ~ 250 microns generated by each method was 20. 3 ± 0. 7, 45. 5 ± 3. 2, 43. 5 ± 1. 6, 20. 0 ± 0. 7 and 33. 3 ± 0. 4 for pill crusher, mortar-pestle, ball mill, high shear grinder and domestic blender, respectively.

40|$|Key Points SummaryWe report how blood pressure, {{cardiac output}} and {{vascular}} <b>resistance</b> are related <b>to</b> height, weight, {{body surface area}} (BSA), and body mass index (BMI) in healthy young adults at supine rest and standing. Much inter-subject variability in young adult's blood pressure, currently attributed to health status, may actually result from inter-individual body size differences. Each cardiovascular variable is linearly related to height, weight and/or BSA (more than to BMI). When supine, cardiac output is positively related, while vascular resistance is negatively related, <b>to</b> body <b>size.</b> Upon standing, the change in vascular resistance is positively related <b>to</b> <b>size.</b> The height/weight relationships of cardiac output and vascular <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> body <b>size</b> are responsible for blood pressure relationships <b>to</b> body <b>size.</b> These basic components of blood pressure could help distinguish normal from abnormal blood pressures in young adults by providing a more effective scaling mechanism. Introduction: Effects of body size on inter-subject blood pressure (BP) variability are not well established in adults. We hypothesized that relationships linking stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) with body size would account for a significant fraction of inter-subject BP variability. Methods: Thirty-four young, healthy adults (19 men, 15 women) participated in 38 stand tests during which brachial artery BP, heart rate, SV, CO, TPR, and indexes of body size were measured/calculated. Results: Steady state diastolic arterial BP was not significantly correlated with any index of body size when subjects were supine. However, upon standing, the more the subject weighed, or the taller s/he was, the greater the increase in diastolic pressure. Systolic pressure strongly correlated with body weight and height both supine and standing. Diastolic and systolic BP were more strongly related to height, weight and body surface area than to body mass index. When supine: lack of correlation between diastolic pressure and body size, resulted from the combination of positive SV correlation and negative TPR correlation with body size. The positive systolic pressure vs. body size relationship resulted from a positive SV vs. height relationship. In response to standing: the positive diastolic blood pressure vs. body size relationship resulted from the standing-induced, positive increase in TPR vs. body size relationship. The relationships between body weight or height with SV and TPR contribute new insight into mechanisms of BP regulation that may aid in the prediction of health in young adults by providing a more effective way to scale BP with body size...|$|R

Nevertheless the Bond-work index is the genuine grindability parameter. A Smith formula for re-calculating the Bond-work index from the Hardgrove grindability is also analysed. A new self-developing algorithm for the simulation of Bond grindability is introduced: this algorithm fits the experimental data better than the ones proposed earlier and, at the same time, has shorter testing times.

Although this approach has strong advantages, {{it has its own}} limitations (manipulation of radioactive products and possible anaphylactic reactions to the dye). As recently proposed, these limitations could in principle be by-passed if semiconductor nanoparticles (quantum dots or QDs) were used as fluorescent contrast agents for the in vivo imaging of sentinel lymph nodes. QDs are fluorescent nanoparticles with unique optical properties like strong <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> photobleaching, <b>size</b> dependent emission wavelength, large molar extinction coefficient, and good quantum yield. Materiel and Methods : 20 μL of 1 μM CuInS 2 /ZnS core/shell QD solution were injected subcutaneously in the right anterior paw of healthy balb/c mice. Animals were sacrificed at different time points after QDs injection. Organs, blood and excretions were collected and analysed by ICP-MS. RALNs and RLTLNs were removed and weighed for histological analysis to visualize inflammatory changes. Results : CuInS 2 /ZnS QDs were observed in RALN, studied organs and blood as soon as 5 min and up to 10 days after the injection by ICP-MS and in vivo fluorescence imaging. The maximum amount of QDs in the ALN was detected 24 h after injection and corresponded to 5 % of the injected dose Histological sections of RALNs dissected 7 days post-injection have shown that the RALN of mice injected with 20 pmol of CuInS 2 /ZnS showed no appreciable difference with control LNs.

40|$|Abstract — Electrical {{resistance}} and hence heat generation in semiconductor chips {{are becoming more}} significant issues particularily as generations of silicon devices continue to have smaller features. The resistance of interconnect vias is {{a significant source of}} heat generation because of the increasing number of these on chips and increases in via <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> reduced <b>size.</b> Finite element modeling of voltage drops and current flow through interconnect vias gives information to aid in designing geometry and materials used in forming vias. It can also be used for modeling the thermal distribution in a via and hence the contribution by vias to heating a chip. In this paper we examine the effect of misalignment of the via between the two metal layers M 1 and M 2 with regard to the interconnect via resistance. The effect of the interface specific contact resistance is examined in particular. Significant misalignment can be tolerated without increasing the via resistance.

Church leaders continue to act in ways that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and ultimately failed change efforts. These actions on the part of church leaders often strengthen and reinforce the sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, making it very difficult for change to be accepted by church members. A literature study design was used to conduct this research. The purpose of this research was to: • Understand the phenomenon of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine the actions of leaders that generate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine how church leaders can overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change The research indicates that church leaders make too many errors in a change process that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research has found eight actions of leaders that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by followers. Apart from the eight actions of leaders that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, many change agents continue to function as managers and not leaders in a change process. This results in further <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000. The {{management}} of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by school principals of secondary {{schools in the}} North-West Province was investigated in this study. Changes are continually occurring on all levels of a rapidly developing society, and resistance is an inseparable part of this process. Since the school stands {{in the center of}} the developing community, the school principal, as education manager, should have a firm knowledge of skills which will enable him to efficiently implement the {{management of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Examples of large-scale changes that occurred in education during the past five years are the implementation of Curriculum 2005 and the transformation of Model C schools. The aim of this research centered on the following problems: What is the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? What does the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change encompass? To what extent and in which way do school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? Firstly a literature study was undertaken to ascertain the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, as well as methods and models according <b>to</b> which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change can be managed. Findings from the literature study points to a number of aspects of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change which plays a decisive role in the management of change. These include factors giving rise <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, types of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, manifestations of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and reaction phases of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The way in which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change is managed is influenced by, among others, factors indicating whether or not the school is ready for change, techniques which can be employed in the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, and also existing models which can be used successfully to facilitate the management process of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Secondly an empirical investigation was undertaken to investigate the degree and way in which school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. For this purpose a structured questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview schedule was used. Findings from the empirical interview revealed that in general school principals handled the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change better than what was initially surmised, although few of them had enough relevant knowledge to be considered specialists in this field. Recommendations ensuing from this study comprise the inclusion of a module in educational management courses specifically aimed at change, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and especially the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change with the view to better equip education managers, the development of a refined model for the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in schools, and also further research into such management model(s) to ascertain the practical application or its relevance in practice.

Expression of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga appears to be quantitative suggesting the involvement of quantitative trait loci (QTL). However, many of these loci including the one responsible {{for the production of}} low germination stimulant (lgs) have not been mapped. The objectives of this study were to (i) construct a molecular map of the sorghum genome and to map the (lgs) gene, (ii) estimate heritability and response <b>to</b> selection of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iii) estimate genetic correlation between field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iv) identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> two species of Striga in sorghum (v) compare the efficiency of predicted response to marker-based selection (MBS) and marker-assisted (MAS) selection relative to phenotypic selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga. A sorghum linkage map based on one 168 RI lines and 236 molecular marker loci was constructed. The population was mapped using RAPDs, RFLPs, I-SSR and SSR markers. The estimated map size was 1628 cM, with an average interval of 9. 5 cM between adjacent loci. The lgs gene mapped 11. 8 cM from RFLP marker PI 0200725. Narrow sense heritability (h 2) of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica was estimated at 0. 35 and that of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica at 0. 24. Predicted response <b>to</b> selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the two Striga species was the same. Significant genetic correlation (0. 52) was found between <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and S. asiatica. Single marker analysis linking field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> marker data detected six QTL for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and five QTLs for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica. QTL detected for resistance accounted for 37 % of the variation in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and 49 % of the variation in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica.

Analysis of predicted response to selection indicated that marker-based selection was 24 % more efficient in selecting for S. hermonthica and 37 % more when selecting for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica. Marker-assisted selection was 41 % more efficient in selecting for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and 43 % more efficient for selecting <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica. ...|$|R
40|$|Field {{screening}} {{was carried}} out to identify sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> three groundnut pests. A total of 1, 000 genotypes of groundnut were screened for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the jassid (Empoasca kerri Pruthi), 2, 700 for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the thrips (Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom)), and 530 for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> pod scarifying termites (Odontotermes sp.). Genotypes with multiple <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these pests were identified from the 3 years field screening trials {{and some of them}} have been used in the breeding program at ICRISAT...|$|R
5000|$|As {{theory is}} as much a {{linguistic}} construct as literature, it falls prey to the same problematics of literary language. De Man states that the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> theory may be [...] "a built-in constituent of its discourse." [...] The real debate of literary theory is henceforth [...] "not with its polemical opponents but rather with its own methodological assumptions and possibilities." [...] (p. 358) This is because [...] "the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> theory is a <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the use of language about language." [...] The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> theory is therefore, according to de Man, a <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> reading: [...] "Nothing can overcome the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> theory since theory 'is' itself this resistance." ...|$|R
40|$|Mutation <b>to</b> {{high level}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> {{nitrofurantoin}} of {{a strain of}} Escherichia coli carrying an R-plasmid conferring <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> gentamicin, kanamycin and other antibiotics resulted in greatly increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the two aminoglycosides but not the other antibiotics. A similar result was observed when the R-plasmid was transferred to high level nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants. The enhanced resistance {{was accompanied by a}} 30 % increase in 3 -. /V-acetyltransferase activity. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> chloramphenicol in a strain carrying an R-plasmid coding for chlor-amphenicol acetyltransferase was not increased although the same strain showed increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> kanamycin. These observations may have considerable significance in the development of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> gentamicin and other amino-glycoside antibiotics...|$|R
