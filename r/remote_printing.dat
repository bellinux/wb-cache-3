40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to propose a new task analysis methodology that combines a statistical approach, the fuzzy Bayesian model, with classic task analysis methods, to develop a semi-automated task analysis tool to better help traditional task analysts identify subtasks. We hypothesize that this approach could help task analysts identify activity units performed by the call center agent. The term activity units, in our study, represents the subtasks the agents perform during a remote troubleshooting process. We also investigate whether this tool could help predict the activity units as well. With the help of the <b>Remote</b> <b>Print</b> Defect Diagnostics research team, an effort-intensive field-based approach for the call center 2 ̆ 7 s naturalistic decision making 2 ̆ 7 s environment was accomplished. A total of 126 customer calls were collected onsite. These calls provided a dataset of 5184 agent-customer conversation narratives containing approximate 165, 000 words. The calls also represented a diversified working environment that involved 24 experienced agents, 55 printer models, 75 companies, 110 customers, and dealt with over 70 software and hardware issues. A human expert and an additional 18 Purdue juniors and seniors also participated in the validation of the 72 manually assigned subtasks. The machine learning tool 2 ̆ 7 s performance was then examined based on three models: classic Bayes, fuzzy Bayes (single word, two words, three words, four words, and their combinations), and hybrid Bayes, a combination of classic and fuzzy Bayes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first aerial additive building manufacturing system developed {{to create and}} repair civil engineering structures remotely using polymers extruded from unmanned aerial robots (drones). The structural potential of three commercially available expanding polyurethane foams of varying density (LD 40, Reprocell 300 and Reprocell 500), and their feasibility for deposition using an autonomous flying dual-syringe device is described. Test specimens consisting of one and two layers, with horizontal and vertical interfaces, were mechanically tested both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of expansion. LD 40 specimens exhibited ductile failure in flexural tests and provided evidence that the interfaces between layers were not necessarily regions of weaknesses. Hand-mixed specimens of Reprocell 500 possessed compressive strengths {{comparable to those of}} concrete and flexural strengths {{similar to those of the}} lower range of timber, though they exhibited brittle failure. There are challenges to be faced with matching the performance of hand-mixed specimens using an autonomous dual-syringe deposition device, primarily concerning the rheological properties of the material following extrusion. However, the device successfully imported and deposited two liquid components, of varying viscosity, and maintained correct mixing ratios. This work has demonstrated the structural and operational feasibility of polyurethane foam as a viable structural material for <b>remote</b> three-dimensional <b>printing</b> using drones...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} digital signal {{processing}} (DSP) has been advancing at an unprecedented rate {{over the past few}} decades, and its impacts are being felt in numerous applications. Such diverse areas as geology, meteorology, archaeology, biomedical, music, digital battlefields, electrophotography, pattern and speech recognition, <b>remote</b> sensing, <b>printing,</b> and multimedia applications rely heavily on the use of DSP algorithms to identify and resolve inherent issues specific to the area at hand. To this effect, the “DSP toolbox,” which encompasses algorithms such as fast Fourier transforms, discrete cosine transforms, statistical estimation techniques, filter design methods, and Cepstrum techniques, has been widely exploited to analyze, visualize, predict, and manipulate the vast quantities of data collected in the above applications. The use of these tools has yielded innovative commercial, health, military, and government solutions. Results from these areas impact how we analyze lake deposits; predict weather and seismic patterns; interpret archeological findings; diagnose and treat medical problems; develop and record music; organize and direct military forces; model and analyze xerographic engines; travel using global positioning systems and intelligent highways; search, retrieve, and recognize data and visual content; and perform video on demand manipulations.

40|$|Missionaries, {{teachers}} and art advisers during the 1970 s introduced {{the process of}} fabric printing to Aboriginal people, particularly in <b>remote</b> areas. <b>Printing</b> was a means to encourage productive work and income generation. Early forms included lino block and stencil prints, followed by screen printing. Bima Wear, was the earliest cooperative to established a business initially producing fabrics for their own clothing and then to sell to others. Historically men were the primary producers of artistic works dominating the production of carvings, sculpture and painting. Designing for fabric printing opened up a new space {{for men and women}} to work freely with their own designs and without the same amount of cultural restraints. This democratic approach allows for drawing on traditions as well as inventing new motifs from the environment, narratives and abstract interpretations. Since the 1980 s fabrics have been sought after by local communities, gallery and museum shops, fashion/interior and product designers, but {{there has always been a}} limited supply. Because of the slow methods and limited printing facilities combined with increased demand for these fabrics, outsourcing of the screen printing has become part of the business development of both remote and urban artists. At the same time, there is growing interest in digital printing, with one community purchasing a printer and others working with print bureaus. The hand produced, digital and hybrid fabrics are establishing their own market niches but not without controversy over decreasing work in communities, authenticity and copyright issues. Working digitally creates a niche for younger artists engaged with new technology and helps to maintain their cultural identity and still live in their community. Aboriginal fabric printing provides new ways for artists to draw on their traditional culture, engage with wider communities and present a cultural and economic path to the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} a novel visual information concealment technique, {{referred to as}} optical watermarking, for the authentication of original printed documents. An optical watermark is a two-dimensional binary image. It can be of any shape and can be printed on any part of a document. The hidden information is embedded using phase modulation. Based on properties of the human visual system and modulation principle, the hidden information becomes visible to the human eyes only when a right “key ” is positioned {{on top of the}} optical watermark with the right alignment. Here, “keys ” play the similar role as keys in encryption, that is, to decode hidden information. Thus, with such a “lock and key ” approach, it greatly improves the security level of the optical watermark. Due to its high security and tight link with electronic document systems, which requires documents to be finally printed on paper, the optical watermark has been applied to various electronic document systems. These are online ticketing, online bill of lading, and <b>remote</b> signing and <b>printing</b> of documents, where critical and unique information are embedded in watermarks and printed together with individual documents for future authentication. It has also been used in offline and traditional anti forgery applications, such as brand protection, preprinted high-value tickets, and identification documents...|$|R

50|$|Before the SSRL was formed, {{the founders}} {{originally}} started it as a space company in 2015 and {{they participated in}} a UGA start up accelerator program. Their product at the time, a large <b>remote</b> operated 3D <b>printed</b> telescope, found moderate success but was ultimately overshadowed by the research lab. The Small Satellite Research Laboratory was founded in 2016 by 3 undergraduate students, two of which were involved with the previous startup, at the University of Georgia after winning the Virginia Tech Hacks Hackathon and leaving their startup company. The students originally intended to build a small spacecraft using money raised on Kickstarter, but the project quickly began to increase in complexity. The lab now works with NASA and the US Air Force, and is constructing two 3U cubesats for low earth orbit. It has been noted that the students who founded the SSRL, which now consists of over 50 members, have kick-started a space program for the University of Georgia {{that did not exist}} before.

40|$|Different {{types of}} remote sensing data have been {{evaluated}} in this thesis {{with respect to their}} potential use in groundwater assessment in hard rock areas. The primary objectives of the study have been (1) to evaluate the interpretation of groundwater indicators from high resolution satellite images and aerial photography and (2) to investigate how remote sensing interpretations subsequently can be integrated with other pertinent data, as a decision support in water well siting under difficult hydrogeological conditions. Two areas of low-grade metamorphic and crystalline rocks in Ghana and Botswana have been the focus of the study. The study has included a general field evaluation of various types of optical remote sensing imagery, with special emphasis on lineaments, vegetation, drainage and bedrock characteristics. The results indicate that a top-down approach using multiple sources of remote sensing data is beneficial in groundwater assessment, and that there are clear advantages in using digital image data in preference to paper <b>prints.</b> <b>Remote</b> sensing interpretations have been integrated with geological and topographical maps, borehole data, and geophysical investigations in a geographical information system (GIS). A number of spatial analyses have been performed to identify relationships that will prove useful to groundwater exploration strategies. Correlation studies of lineaments and well capacities have not been conclusive in the study areas, but have demonstrated the need for improved lineament descriptors in groundwater exploration. Lineaments classed by inferred hydrogeological significance has, between several interpreters, shown a good reproducibility of the most significant lineaments. The confidence in these features being important to groundwater availability, is thereby increased. A probabilistic approach to groundwater exploration has been evaluated in the study. The approach incorporates professional judgment in a Bayesian framework and is based on a number of different datasets indicating groundwater occurrence. The results clearly show that the approach is promising, as it restricts detailed field investigations to the most favourable targets. However, improved methods for assessing the fracture zone characteristics in hard rock areas are needed. Data integrated in a GIS has been found an ideal decision support, for a time and cost effective selection of well sites or target areas. Errors and positional accuracy of the data should, however, be carefully considered, not to yield meaningless analysis results in the GIS. The use of the global positioning system (GPS) has been very useful in limiting positional inaccuracies in borehole and image data...|$|R
