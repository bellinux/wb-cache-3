5|$|In this episode, flashbacks {{depict the}} story behind Claire's pregnancy. Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides {{to go to an}} {{adoption}} agency out of a belief that she will struggle to <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not <b>raise</b> <b>it.</b> In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that somebody is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E
5|$|King Rufus, {{the leader}} of a furry race of creatures called the Gobbos, is {{watching}} the sunrise over Gobbo Valley when he sees a large, woven basket carrying a baby crocodile floating down the river. Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> as one of their own and teach it in the ways of the Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E
5|$|In 2379, {{two hundred}} years after the events of Alien 3, {{military}} scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The xenomorph queen's DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As {{a result of the}} xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic link with the xenomorphs. Additionally, the xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he would <b>raise</b> <b>it.</b> Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the final battle, the player meets Morrigan, who proposes a way to slay the Archdemon without sacrificing anyone: the two conceiving a child. The child, also {{carrying}} the Taint, would merge with the Archdemon once it dies, creating a demonic essence which will spare any Grey Warden. Morrigan agrees to conceive the child, which would resultantly be born a demigod, {{on the condition that}} she be allowed to <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> alone. The player can accept Morrigan's offer (if male), convince Alistair/Loghain to take part instead, or refuse the witch's proposal, which will cause her to leave the party.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool. When she continues to misbehave, her parents send her to boarding school in Switzerland. The following year, Victoria returns as a moody teenager who is working in the mailroom at her father’s company, Newman Enterprises, and becoming smitten with the Ryan McNeilwho is older than her. Victor offers Ryan money to leave town but he and Victoria elope. Their marriage ends when Ryan leaves her for Nina Webster in 1993. Victoria then {{falls in love with}} Cole Howard and they marry the following year, but their marriage is quickly annulled when it is believed by their parents that they are siblings. When this is proved untrue they wed again; this marriage breaks down four years later when in 1998 Cole has sex with Ashley Abbott. Victoria becomes pregnant with Cole’s child and chooses to <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> with Neil Winters. Her baby girl, Eve Howard, dies a few days after birth and Victoria ends her union with Neil. Victoria briefly tries and fails to win Cole back from Ashley. In 1999, Victoria meets Gary Dawson (Ricky Paull Goldin) and they begin dating, though she soon discovers that he is stalking her and ends the relationship. Enraged, Gary kidnaps Victoria in a tree house and she takes months to recover. She and Ryan then reunite and plan to remarry, but on their wedding day in November 2001 Ryan's ex-wife Tricia Dennison shoots and kills him, leaving Victoria devastated. She then has a brief relationship with Diego Guittierez in 2002, and afterward dates Michael Baldwin. The following year, some of Victor's crimes come to light and Victoria leaves town when these and other family problems overwhelm her. She moves to Florence, Italy, where she studies Art History.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E
