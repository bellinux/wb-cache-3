25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E

40|$|The energy {{consumed}} by domestic space heating systems represents a considerable {{share of the}} {{energy consumed}} in the UK. At the same time up to a quarter of English homes have inadequate controls on the central heating systems.

The Salford Energy House is a full-sized end terrace house built within a climate controlled laboratory.

50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot air furnace that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) opens the stoker circuit when {{the air in the}} furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that the}} <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan switch and the limit switch.|$|E

50|$|Walter M. Cross {{invented a}} hot-air furnace system with three main elements: (1) a motor driven stoker for feeding {{fuel to the}} {{combustion}} chamber of a furnace, (2) a room thermostatic switch for controlling the feeding of fuel, and (3) a combustion stoker switch to prevent the fire's going out in warm weather not requiring domestic heating. The <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> the supply of heat, or discontinues its supply, by closing or opening the circuit to the stoker motor at the required temperatures. The combustion stoker switch, or holdfire control, responds to a low temperature in the furnace by causing the stoker to feed fuel so as to prevent the furnace fire from going out. The control of the combustion stoker switch is effective in mild weather when the <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> may not call for heat for a considerable period.|$|E
40|$|Refrigerator-freezer energy {{consumption}} is {{greatly influenced by}} <b>room</b> temperature, <b>thermostat</b> setting positions, and door openings. To develop a realistic test procedure with respect to climatic conditions and usage patterns prevailing in a given country, {{the effect of these}} parameters on refrigerator-freezer {{energy consumption}} has to be taken into consideration. In order to do so, we have tested six household refrigerator-freezers of different capacities and brands in the laboratory. Using response surface methodology (RSM), we developed a mathematical model to co-relate energy consumption as a function of <b>room</b> temperature, <b>thermostat</b> setting positions, and door opening. Finally, modelled energy consumption was compared with the ISO specified standard energy consumption and field energy consumption to justify the possibilities of introducing ISO refrigerator-freezer energy test procedure in Malaysia. Based on the above comparison, we observed that ISO test standards can be adopted for testing and rating of these appliances in Malaysia...|$|R

25|$|In static methods {{a mixture}} {{is brought to}} {{equilibrium}} and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by chemical analysis. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases.

50|$|As the {{operative}} temperature {{of a room}} {{is a combination of}} the air temperature and the mean temperature of all the surfaces in the room this implies that people will feel increasingly cooler as the air flow through the wall increases.

5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the <b>room</b> <b>thermostat,</b> and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital <b>room</b> <b>thermostat.</b> Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/ ...|$|E

Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings.

40|$|Refrigerator-freezers energy {{consumption}} is greatly affected by room temperature, door opening and thermostat setting position. Two frost free household refrigerator freezers {{of the same}} capacity were tested in the laboratory to determine the sensitivity of their {{energy consumption}} to various usage conditions. The experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of single variables, such as temperature, thermostat setting positions and door opening, and their combined effect on energy consumption. Our investigation reveals that room temperature has the higher effect on energy consumption, followed by door opening. Thermostat setting position has the lower effect on energy consumption. More detailed tests were performed under different <b>room</b> temperature, <b>thermostat</b> setting position arid door opening conditions. With the experimental results, a first order mathematical model has been developed to investigate their combined effect on energy consumption. The test results are discussed and presented...|$|R

50|$|Heating {{engineers}} {{will usually}} {{do this as}} part of the installation of a brand new system but they will rarely do it when replacing a component of the system, such as just the <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> or a part inside the boiler. They will check and adjust the balance if asked to do so but, as it can take about an hour to balance the radiators in an average sized three-bedroom house - and proportionally more or less for larger or smaller homes - many people don't want to pay for {{the time it takes to}} do the balancing properly.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to make sure that, when the <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> is calling for heat, all the radiators in the system heat up fully - to the maximum temperature possible - in sitting rooms and other daily [...] "living" [...] rooms but NOT in the other rooms (utility rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) which should be kept as cool as possible. This is easy {{to do if you}} have TRVs (thermostatically-controlled radiator valves) fitted to your radiators but, if you don't have TRVs, you should be sure to open the IN-FLOW valves fully in all living rooms and turn them almost fully off in the other rooms.

Radiant heating experiences highest comfort levels as people's own energy (± 70 Watt for an adult) (must radiate out in heating season) is in balance with its surrounds. Compared to convection heating system based on academic research the air temperatures may be lowered by up to 3 degrees.One variation is using tubes filled with circulating hot water as heat source for warming the floor. The heating principle remains the same. Both old style electric and warm water (hydronic) underfloor heating systems embedded in the floor construction are slow and cannot respond to external weather changes or internal demand/lifestyle requirements.The latest variant places specialized electric heating systems and blankets directly under the floor-decor and on top of additional insulation all placed on top of construction floors. Construction floors stay cold.The principle change of heat source positioning allows it to respond within minutes to changing weather and internal demand requirements such as life style being in/out, at work, rest, sleep, more people present/cooking, etc.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} {{discrete}} time stochastic hybrid systems whose evolution can {{be influenced by}} some control input is proposed in this paper. With reference to the introduced class of systems, a methodology for probabilistic reachability analysis is developed that is relevant to safety verification. This methodology {{is based on the}} interpretation of the safety verification problem as an optimal control problem for a certain controlled Markov process. In particular, this allows to characterize through some optimal cost function the set of initial conditions for the system such that safety is guaranteed with sufficiently high probability. The proposed methodology is applied to the problem of regulating the average temperature in a <b>room</b> by a <b>thermostat</b> controlling a heater. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of the refractive index (RI) of the eye fluid as a freshness test for fish were investigated. Procedure details were studied {{in order to improve}} the usefulness of the method. The following fishes were used : cod (Gadus morhua L), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), redfish (Sebastes marinus L) and blue ling (Molva byrkelange). It appears necessary to extract nearly the whole quantity of eye fluid. Checking the RI of left and right eye can be omitted. Centrifuging the eye fluid is not absolutely required but improves readability. Filtration has no practical value. Keeping the eye fluid during 24 hrs at I ° C results only in a very slight increase in RI : if necessary, determinations can be postponed without harm. The temperature of the refractometer must be maintained at 20 ° C ± 1, 5 o C. At fairly constant <b>room</b> temperature, no <b>thermostat</b> is required for routine analyses. A handrefractometer appears to be of little use. With redfish and blue ling, no satisfactory results are obtained. Spoilage curves of cod and plaice on the other hand agree fairly well with organoleptic judgment. The RI seems to be a useful freshness test with those species. Quality gradings are proposed. Advantages and limitations of the method were investigated. The RI can be determined very quickly with simple apparatus and by non specialised personnel. However, no determination is possible on beheaded of proccssed fish or on fish with very small eyes. As variations among individuals can be large, a sufficient number of fishes should always be taken for analysis...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{inductive}} links used in {{wireless power}} transfer systems. Inductive power transfer {{can be used as}} a power delivery method for a variety of portable devices, from medical implants to electric vehicles and is gaining increased interest. The focus is on high quality factor coils and MHz operation, where accurate measurements are difficult to achieve. Fast models of all pertinent aspects of inductive power transfer systems for constant cross section coils are developed. These models are used to optimise a new coil winding pattern that aims to increase efficiency in volume constrained scenarios. Measurement systems are developed to measure coil Q factors in excess of 1, 000. The prototype measurement systems are verified against models of that system, as well as finite element simulations of the coil under test. Shielding of inductive power transfer systems is then investigated. A structure typically used at GHz frequencies, the artificial magnetic conductor, is miniaturised as an alternative to conventional ferrite backed ground plane shielding. Finite element simulation shows this structure significantly improves link efficiency. The artificial magnetic conductor prototype does not result in a gain in efficiency expected, however it does display the properties expected of an artificial magnetic conductor, including increased coupling factor. Finally, an unconventional inductive power transfer system is presented where transmitter and receiver are up to 6 m away from each other and of radically different size. This system provides mW level power to remote devices in a <b>room,</b> for example <b>thermostats</b> or e-ink displays. Conventional approaches to design do not consider the distortion of the magnetic field caused by metallic objects in the room. It was found that treating the system as a decoupled receiver and transmitter provides a better prediction of received power in real world environments. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of control systems operate in the {{real-world}} {{and are expected to}} deal with the range of changing conditions of the physical process that is being controlled.

This paper describes a method that facilitates the design and implementation of these so-called multi-controller systems. It is based on the concept of an autonomous agent, which has recently been introduced in the field of artificial intelligence. The method enables the use of heterogeneous control algorithms and integrating techniques.

40|$|Although {{software}} engineers extensively use a component-based {{software engineering}} (CBSE) approach, existing usability questionnaires only support a holistic evaluation approach, {{which focuses on}} the usability of {{the system as a}} whole.

40|$|This is an {{open access}} article {{published}} by Elsevier and made available {{under the terms of}} the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC BY 4. 0), [URL] behaviours, such as timer and <b>room</b> <b>thermostat</b> settings, are a key influencing factor in energy demand in homes. However they are difficult to measure directly in existing housing with standard heating systems and controls. To overcome this, several indirect methods have been developed in previous research which estimate heating behaviours using sensor measurements of temperatures and energy demands in the home. This work assesses seven of these heating behaviour indirect calculation methods through a comparative study based on sensor data recorded in 20 English homes over a five month period. The results show that methods based on room air temperatures estimate mean daily heating durations between 6. 7 and 11. 4 hours per day, based on radiator surface temperatures between 2. 9 and 3. 3 h per day and based on gas consumption for 4. 4 h per day. Estimated thermostat setting based on peak whole house temperature ranged between 20. 3 °C and 20. 8 °C but a 5 °C temperature range was found when applying the methods to different room temperatures. Of the methods tested, the radiator surface temperature method was found to be the most appropriate for calculating heating behaviours over time and a set of guidelines for the future application of indirect heating behaviour calculation methods is provided. The findings highlight the need for future studies to directly measure heating behaviours in homes in order to further improve the development of indirect heating behaviour calculation methods...|$|E
