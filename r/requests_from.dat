5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to repeated <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership. By September, it had granted charters to police unions in 37 cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Paul, though not without protests from some city officials, {{who opposed the}} unionization of police, firefighters, and teachers.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{the office}} of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott {{investigated}} Trump University.

5|$|Neighbours {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> young viewers in the Neighbours website forums. Bower said that although the show had featured lesbian romances before, love scenes between men are still taboo in Australian dramas. She added that Chris's coming out storyline was also based on the real life experiences of the shows writers.|$|E

He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming for Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, when Jiang Zemin visited Iceland, Icelandic {{authorities}} {{complied with}} <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> the Chinese government to deny entry to Falun Gong practitioners {{who sought to}} enter the country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they managed {{to make it to}} the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} at Buna {{ended on}} 23 January, freeing up aircraft to support Wau, and 52 brand-new Dakotas of the US 317th Troop Carrier Group {{had arrived in}} Australia, their movement from the United States having been expedited in response to urgent <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> General Douglas MacArthur arising from the Buna fighting. After a quick maintenance check, they were flown up to Port Moresby to help the 374th Troop Carrier Group fly the 17th Infantry Brigade into Wau. This meant that up to 40 aircraft were now available daily.|$|E

5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|While {{previous}} Street Fighter titles relied almost {{solely on}} Capcom's Research and Development branch, the development team instead allowed other {{branches of the}} company to give input {{on the design of}} new characters, due to the influx of fan <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> outside Japan. Rufus was designed based upon marketing research on what sorts of characters an American audience would enjoy playing, and was one of several characters considered for inclusion during the game's development.|$|E
5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> other students for a copy of the picture. It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor was}} that, in early May 1944, an {{uncontrolled}} agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on {{details of a}} meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> the Abwehr about his whereabouts {{it does not appear}} that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture.|$|E
5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> strangers, {{checklist}} challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. <b>Requests</b> <b>from</b> Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Guam, 3rd Battalion spent two months conducting 'mopping up' operations on the island until November, when it received orders to prepare for operations against Iwo Jima. From November until February 1945, they {{took part in a}} training regimen so serious that a fellow battalion later reported at least 20% of its members were incapacitated due to foot and heat injuries. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, 3rd Battalion, as part of 3rd Marines, was kept offshore as the Expeditionary Troops reserve. However, despite numerous <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> other Marine officers, the 3rd Marines were never landed. According to one 3rd Battalion veteran, some Marines from the battalion came ashore to unload supplies or with other units that they had recently transferred to. After sitting off Iwo Jima in their transport ships for a month, the 3rd Marines were ordered to return to Guam on 5 March 1945.|$|E
