ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the creation of complex and robust <b>RSFQ</b> digital <b>logic</b> circuits an extensive library of electronic design automation (EDA) tools is a necessity. It is {{the aim of this}} work to introduce various methods to improve the current state of EDA in RSFQ circuit design. Firstly, Monte Carlo methods such as Latin Hypercube sampling and Sobol sequences are applied for their variance reduction abilities in approximating circuit yield. In addition, artificial neural networks are also investigated for their applicability in modeling the parameter-yield space. Secondly, a novel technique for circuit functional testing using automated state machine extraction is presented, which greatly simplifies the logical verification of a circuit. This method is also used, along with critical timing extraction, to automatically generate Hardware Description Language(HDL) models which can be used for high level circuit design. Lastly, the Greedy Local search, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm meta-heuristics were statistically compared in a novel manner using a yield model provided by artificial neural networks. This is done to ascertain their performance in optimising RSFQ circuits in relation to yield. The variance reduction techniques of Latin Hypercube Sampling and Sobol sequences were shown to be beneficial for the use with RSFQ circuits. For optimisation purposes the use of Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms were shown to improve circuit optimisation for possible multi-modal search spaces. An HDL model is also successfully generated from a complex RSFQ circuit for use in high level circuit design which includes critical timing and propagation latency.

40|$|Superconducting digital {{circuits}} {{based on the}} concept of rapid single quantum <b>logic</b> (<b>RSFQ)</b> offer high speed operation at very low power dissipation. The product of switching time and dissipated power of these circuits is very small compared to semiconductor devices. However, due the cooling demands of superconducting circuits, reasonable applications are only those where the higher performance justifies higher cooling costs. RSFQ circuits in niobium technology are already well developed. High temperature superconductors (HTSC) like YBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 _-_#delta# allow operation temperatures above the temperature of liquid helium and higher clock frequencies due to the larger energy gap. Unfortunately, the technology for HTSC is still immature. In this work, different aspects of HTSC RSFQ circuits have been investigated, with the emphasis on multilayer technology and on measurements of the bit error rate. In addition, a first step towards a three-dimensional integration of low temperature RSFQ circuits was developed. A new device consisting of two vertically stacked separately shunted Nb/AlO_xAl/Nb Josephson junctions was used to test the possibility of three dimensional integration for RSFQ circuits for the first time. A T-flipflop was designed its operation as a voltage divider was verified experimentally. For HTSC circuits, basic devices like resistors and multilayer structures, e. g., cross overs, insulating layers and inductances with groundplane were fabricated, and the electrical properties were investigated. These devices are indispensable for a future technology allowing the realization of more complex circuits. Based on stacked bicrystal junctions in multilayer technology, a first order delta sigma modulator for analog to digital conversion was designed and characterized by electrical measurements.

One of the promising applications of the RSFQ technology is Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for telecommunications. Interference cancellation is a bottleneck for all existing systems {{in terms of the}} performance gain that is theoretically possible and technically realizable using conventional technology. The crucial factor is computational complexity required to handle multiple access interference. The general approach is to compute the interference using available data about propagation channels and then either remove it from received signal or use to predistort the transmitted signal. Computation of the interference matrix can easily fall into 100 Gops range, furthermore, the most e±cient algorithms are based on successive iterations. This requires not only high overall performance of the DSP but also high actual clock rate.

The processor consists of an RSFQ Multiply-Accumulate Unit, memory caches and a synchronization block, partitioned into multiple chips, and a large CMOS memory. The complexity of the RSFQ DSP is 10 x 10 multiplication, rounding to 14 bits, 18 bits accumulator length and 3. 7 Kb memory cache.

In our system a magnetic flux pulse modifies the potential of a double SQUID qubit from a symmetric double well to a single deep well condition. By using this scheme with a Nb/AlOx/Nb system we obtained coherent oscillations with sub-nanosecond period (tunable from 50 ps to 200 ps), very fast with respect to other manipulating procedures, and with a coherence time up to 10 ns, of the order of what obtained with similar devices and technologies but using microwave manipulation. We introduce the ultrafast manipulation presenting experimental results, new issues related to this approach (such as the use of a feedback procedure for cancelling the effect of "slow" fluctuations), and open perspectives, such as the possible use of <b>RSFQ</b> <b>logic</b> for the qubit control.

40|$|A Josephson {{junction}} is {{the basic}} element of rapid single flux quantum logic (RSFQ) circuits. A high operating speed and low power consumption are the main advantages of <b>RSFQ</b> <b>logic</b> over semiconductor electronic circuits. To realize complex RSFQ circuits in HTS technology one needs a reproducible fabrication of Josephson junctions with low parameter spread. High quality HTS junctions require a fully epitaxial multilayer structure with clean interfaces and a smooth surface morphology. Neodymium barium copper oxide (NBCO) thin films were used as superconducting electrodes due to their high transition temperature and low surface roughness. NBCO forms a solid solution in which Nd 3 + ions can substitute for Ba 2 + ions with the formula Nd 1 +xBa 2 -xCu 3 Oy (x= 0. 12 in our study). Cation disorder and oxygen deficiency affect the structural and electronic properties of grown NBCO films. Target composition, substrate temperature, oxygen partial-pressure and annealing steps are properly chosen to obtain smooth films with a high transition temperature. NBCO is deposited on an STO buffered MgO substrate at a pressure of 0. 35 mbar in an Argon and Oxygen (20 : 1) gas mixture. The substrate temperature was fixed at 8200 C. The deposited film is smooth with a surface roughness of 1 - 3 nm for a 150 nm thick layer and a transition temperature around 90 K...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and test of an integrated system composed of a flux qubit and a rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ) circuit that allows qubit manipulation. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of control electronics integrated on the same chip as the qubit, {{in view of the}} application in quantum computation with superconducting devices. <b>RSFQ</b> <b>logic</b> relies on the storage and transmission of magnetic flux quanta and can be profitably used with superconducting qubits because of the speed, scalability, compatibility with the qubit fabrication process and low temperature environment. While standard RSFQ circuitry is well assessed, the application to quantum computing requires a complete rescaling of parameter values, in order to preserve the qubit coherence and reduce the power dissipation. In the system presented in this paper, the qubit role is played by a superconducting loop interrupted by a small dc SQUID, usually called a double SQUID, which behaves as a tunable rf-SQUID. Its energy potential has the shape of a double well, with the barrier between the wells controlled by magnetic flux applied to the inner dc SQUID. Here {{for the first time we}} report measurements at a base temperature of 370 mK in which flux control pulses with desired characteristics were supplied by a RSFQ circuit fabricated using non-standard parameters in the same chip as the qubit. © IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E
