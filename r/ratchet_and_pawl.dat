40|$|The {{maximum power}} of Feynman’s ratchet as a heat engine and the {{corresponding}} efficiency (η∗) are investigated by optimizing both the internal parameter and the external load. When a perfect ratchet device (no heat exchange between the <b>ratchet</b> <b>and</b> the <b>pawl</b> via kinetic energy) works between two thermal baths at temperatures T 1 > T 2, its efficiency at maximum power {{is found to be}} η ∗ = η 2 C /[ηC − (1 −ηC) ln(1 −ηC) ], where ηC ≡ 1 −T 2 /T 1. This efficiency is slightly higher than the value 1 − √T 2 /T 1 obtained by Curzon and Ahlborn (1975 Am. J. Phys. 43 22) for macroscopic heat engines. It is also slightly larger than the result ηSS ≡ 2 ηC/(4 − ηC) obtained by Schmiedl and Seifert (2008 EPL 81 20003) for stochastic heat engines working at small temperature differences, while the evident deviation betweenη ∗ andηSS appears at large temperature differences.

As a consequence, the engine can never achieve the efficiency of a Carnot cycle, {{not even in the}} limit of zero power (infinitely slow motion), in contradiction with the conclusion reached in the Lectures. 1 Introduction Chapter 46 of The Feynman Lectures on Physics [1] contains a celebrated illustration of the impossibility of obtaining work from thermal fluctuations with an efficiency greater than that of a Carnot cycle.

This first motor could be run on 16v AC or 12v DC current, with AC current providing slightly more power. Power was either 'on' or 'off' and cars would freewheel around corners, needing a totally different driving technique to variable speed motors. Cars could only run {{for a short time}} as they were rather prone to overheating, and performances varied wildly, according to contact and brush settings. Later developments moved on to more traditional DC motors with a variable speed control, and the addition of Vanwall, Maserati, BRM and Porsche to the rather limited range.|$|E

50|$|The {{advancement}} of a rotor {{other than the}} left-hand one was called a turnover by the British. This was achieved by a <b>ratchet</b> <b>and</b> <b>pawl</b> mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression. For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{from the}} University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have {{constructed}} a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, {{when not in}} thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-Brownian motion into work {{by means of a}} granular gas, which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state. The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas. [...] Because the <b>ratchet's</b> gear <b>and</b> <b>pawl</b> mechanism, as described above, permitted the axle to rotate only in one direction, random collisions with the moving beads caused the vane to rotate. This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis. However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads. Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas. Unlike an ideal gas, though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop. In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained. Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength. For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation. [...] The experiment was filmed.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{at first}} sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman {{demonstrated}} that if the entire device {{is at the same}} temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work. The reason is that the pawl, since it is at the same temperature as the paddle, will also undergo Brownian motion, [...] "bouncing" [...] up and down. It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up. Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction. Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature [...] of the <b>ratchet</b> <b>and</b> <b>pawl</b> {{is the same as the}} temperature [...] of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense. A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by Magnasco.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} what today is called a revolver were made in Germany in the late 16th century. These weapons featured a single barrel with a revolving cylinder holding the powder and ball. They would soon be made by many European gun-makers, in numerous designs and configurations. However, these weapons were difficult to use, complicated and prohibitively expensive to make, and as such they were not widely distributed. In 1836, an American, Samuel Colt patented the mechanism {{that led to the}} widespread use of the revolver, the mechanically indexing cylinder. According to Samuel Colt, he {{came up with the idea}} for the revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, which had a <b>ratchet</b> <b>and</b> <b>pawl</b> mechanism on it, a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder by cocking the hammer.

50|$|The <b>ratchet</b> <b>and</b> <b>pawl</b> {{was first}} {{discussed}} as a Second Law-violating device by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900. In 1912, Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski gave the first correct qualitative {{explanation of why}} the device fails; thermal motion of the pawl allows the ratchet's teeth to slip backwards. Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, showing that if {{the temperature of the}} paddle T1 was greater than the temperature of the ratchet T2, it would function as a heat engine, but if T1 = T2 there would be no net motion of the paddle. In 1996, Juan Parrondo and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the quasistatic approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency. Magnasco and Stolovitzky (1998) extended this analysis to consider the full ratchet device, and showed that the power output of the device is far smaller than the Carnot efficiency claimed by Feynman. A paper in 2000 by Derek Abbott, Bruce R. Davis and Juan Parrondo, reanalyzed the problem and extended it to the case of multiple ratchets, showing a link with Parrondo's paradox.|$|E
