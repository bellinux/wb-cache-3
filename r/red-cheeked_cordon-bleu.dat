50|$|When {{he first}} {{described}} the <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> in his 1766 edition of Systema Naturae, Carl Linnaeus assigned {{it to the}} genus Fringilla. It was later moved to the genus Uraeginthus, {{along with the rest}} of the cordon-bleus and the grenadiers. The <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu,</b> the blue-capped cordon-bleu, and the blue waxbill—form a species group within the genus. Further, the <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> may form a superspecies with the blue waxbill, with which it shares similar habitats.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> or {{red-cheeked cordonbleu}} (Uraeginthus bengalus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. This estrildid finch is a resident breeding bird in drier regions of tropical Sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 7,700,000 km².|$|E

50|$|This {{widespread}} and abundant species is often found around human habitation, often with other {{species such as}} the <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu,</b> and its soft queet-queet call is a familiar African sound. The song is a rising chick-pea-pea-pea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> is a granivore, feeding principally {{on grass}} seeds, {{but also on}} millet and other small seeds. It is also known to feed {{sporadically}} on beeswax. Larger granivores, such as the pin-tailed whydah will chase cordon-bleus from food sources, limiting the feeding opportunities of the smaller birds and affecting their foraging success.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> is {{reported}} to be [...] "among the most popular exotic finches". [...] While it has no special housing requirements, its habit of roosting on open branches (rather than in a nest or other protected area) makes it sensitive to low temperatures. During the breeding season, captive males become very aggressive towards each other, and birds disturbed during incubation will typically leave the nest.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, the <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> {{is a very small}} finch, {{measuring}} only 12.5 - 13 cm in length. It weighs 9.9 g on average, with known extremes in wild populations ranging from 8.9 - 11 g. The adult male has uniformly brown upperparts, pale blue breast, flanks and tail and a yellow belly. There is a red patch on each cheek, but this can rarely appear orange or even yellow. Females are similar but duller, and lack the cheek spot. Immature birds are like the female, but with blue restricted to the face and throat.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> {{is common}} and {{widespread}} {{across much of}} central and eastern Africa. Its range stretches from the West African countries of Senegal, Gambia and southwestern Mauritania east through southern Mali, southern Niger, southern Chad and southern Sudan to Ethiopia and northwestern and southwestern Somalia, and then south to southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, eastern Angola, northern and western Zambia, southern Tanzania and northern Mozambique. It has also been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and Oahu. [...] It has been found one time (in 1924) on Cape Verde and was recorded in the Maadi area in northern Egypt during the mid-1960s; the latter birds may have been escaped cage birds, as there have been no records since.|$|E
40|$|The area of {{land farmed}} in Africa is {{predicted}} to double by the year 2050 yet very few African studies have investigated the impact of different farming intensities and regimes on bird communities. This study examined avian species richness and diversity along with the densities of some common bird species on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, in relation to habitat features on farmland over a gradient of differing farming intensities. The study area exhibited {{a variety of different}} levels of farming which differed in the habitat available for birds. Birds normally associated with savanna woodland were more associated with less intensive farming, and open-country birds were more associated with more intensive sites, with more species of birds observed where farming was less intensive. Common species of birds using cultivated land associated with different crops, with acha and millet being the most commonly used. Tree density was the most important variable predicting avian species richness and diversity, with medium tree density predicting the highest species richness and diversity. The densities of two common farmland birds were predicted best by tree density, but varied in their responses to the habitat variables, with common bulbul, a savanna generalist, associating more with less intensive, wooded areas and <b>red-cheeked</b> <b>cordon-bleu,</b> an open savanna granivore, associating with medium intensity, more open farmland. Whinchats were common in open, intensively farmed areas with few trees and good herbaceous vegetation cover. The data presented indicates the importance of retaining natural features of savanna habitat in farmland in order to maintain high avian diversity on farmland. More detailed studies are needed {{in order to determine the}} mechanisms involved in the associations observed and collaborations between ecologists and social scientists will be necessary to develop effective policies to limit the impact of the intensification of agriculture in Africa on avian biodiversity.
