40|$|Modelling two {{recommendations}} {{made in the}} Henry Review of Taxation (2010), {{this study}} considers {{the impact of the}} recommendations on rents, rental supply and housing affordability. The Henry Review recommended two key changes to taxation arrangements to promote more balanced investment in private rental accommodation and improve housing affordability: Recommendations 14 - 15 are directed at reducing the net benefit of negative gearing for rental investors by introducing a Savings Income Discount (SID) of 40 per cent for net rental income (including capital gains) from non-business assets. Recommendations 51 - 54 involve the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stamp</b> duties and levying of land tax on a per land holding basis. &​nbsp; The study uses the AHURI- 3 M micro-simulation model to simulate the recommended changes. In the first report, the study authors found that negatively geared investors are adversely affected by the SID reforms with their average after-tax economic cost rising by 50 basis points from 8. 0 to 8. 5 per cent. &​nbsp; However the average after-tax economic cost for equity investors (i. e. those not negatively geared) falls by 50 basis points to 7. 5 per cent. &​nbsp; It is predicted that these lower costs flow through into long-term average annual rents, which would fall by just over $ 300. &​nbsp; Most of the benefit is predicted to go to those in the more expensive part of the rental market. &​nbsp; Other modelling suggests that unleveraged and equity oriented investors are more inclined to retain investments under the SID reforms while negatively geared investors {{would be more likely to}} realise their investments. &​nbsp; Because these supply responses would offset each other, a &# 039;flight of investors&# 039; from private rental housing seems unlikely...|$|E

40|$|Adipogenesis is the {{developmental}} process that upon appropriate stimuli differentiates progenitor cells into specialized fat storing adipocytes. We studied {{this process and}} the potential involvement of two different protein families; Six Transmembrane Proteins of Prostate (STAMP, also names STEAP) and the MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs). The STAMP protein family consists of four members, STAMP 1 - 3 and STEAP. Little {{is known about the}} role of this family in human adipogenesis. In order to address this we made use of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) that can be isolated in high quantities from human lipoaspirate material and which can be differentiated into all mesoderm derived cells. Differentiation of ASCs into adipocytes dramatically increased STAMP 2 expression and significantly increased STEAP without affecting STAMP 1 and STAMP 3 expression. Reduced expression of STAMP 2 by RNA interference reduced the ability of ASCs to differentiate into adipocytes, decreased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, and increased expression of an enzyme involved in β-oxidation. This suggests that STAMP 2 could be an inducer of adipogenesis and lipogenesis in humans. Our work also focused on MKPs, which consist of proteins that inhibit the kinase activity of the MAP Kinases (MAPKs) that have previously been implicated in adipogenesis. We comprehensively analyzed the expression levels of MKPs during adipogenesis of the murine 3 T 3 -L 1 cells and present data regarding MKP- 5, MKP- 6, VHR, and VH 5. All MKPs we studied had a similar expression profile during adipogenesis where levels were high in dividing pre-adipocytes but dropped significantly upon cells reaching confluency. After induction of adipogenesis, MKP levels remained low during the beginning phases of differentiation whereas levels increased and reached their maximum at day 8. We also investigated the expression levels in mouse models of diet-induced or genetic obesity and found that there was significant deregulation of MKPs in subcutaneous fat and livers of obese mice. The final area of focus in this thesis was inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which are hallmarks of metabolic disease. Previously, genetic <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2 from mice was shown to increase inflammation and induce metabolic disease in lean mice on a regular diet. We induced ER stress in adipocytes and found short term ER stress to delocalize STAMP 2 from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments, while chronic ER stress completely extinguished STAMP 2 expression. This was shown to be a consequence of disrupted C/EBPα binding to the STAMP 2 promoter. These data suggest that downregulation of STAMP 2 expression is one mechanism of ER stress-mediated metabolic disease. Overall, the data presented in this thesis contribute {{to the understanding of the}} molecular details of adipogenesis, which may be relevant in tackling issues related to obesity and related disorders...|$|E
40|$|Novel titania and hafnia {{structures}} {{on top of}} silica wafer were produced using atomic layer deposition through the accessible pores created by a patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp in conformal contact. Typically, the processing temperature was {{in the range of}} 125 °C in order to avoid damaging the stamp and also to create an amorphous metal oxide deposit. Interestingly, the deposit formation tended to be dominated by condensation of the metal oxide precursor and water {{in the vicinity of the}} contact edges <b>of</b> the <b>stamp</b> and substrate. Upon <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stamp,</b> the deposit patterns thus exhibited narrow features of much finer lateral resolution than the channel width <b>of</b> the <b>stamp.</b> Furthermore, it was demonstrated that oxide patterns of complex geometries were formed through the accessible pores...|$|R

The three-dimensional topology of the microfluidic network in the stamp makes this technique a versatile one with which to pattern multiple types of proteins and cells in complex, discontinuous structures on a surface. The channel structure, formed by the stamp when it is {{in contact with the}} surface of the substrate, limits migration and growth of cells in the channels. With the channel structure in contact with the surface, the cells stop dividing once they form a confluent layer. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stamp</b> permits the cells to spread and divide...|$|R
25|$|Postage stamps {{that come}} in strips with the {{individual}} stamps arranged side by side or one above the other and rolled into a coil for sale {{at the post office}} are referred to as coil stamps. The coil configuration made the repeated <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>stamps</b> easier for the clerks and others who dealt with mass mailings on a daily basis. The coil configuration also made it possible to dispense individual stamps in vending machines. Responding to complaints from vending machine companies that coil stamps with standard perforations (perforated 12) separated too easily, the postal service introduced a much coarser gauge—perforated 8½—in 1910. This gauge, however, proved problematic for opposite reasons: the stamps proved too difficult to separate. As a result, a finer gauge, perforated 10, was used for coils from 1914 on.|$|R
60|$|I {{have already}} {{declined}} {{to sign a}} petition for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stamp</b> duty on newspapers. I think the reduced duty is some protection to the public against the rash and hasty launching of blackguard newspapers. I think the newspapers are made extremely accessible to the poor man at present, {{and that he would}} not derive the least benefit from the abolition <b>of</b> the <b>stamp.</b> It {{is not at all clear}} to me, supposing he wants The Times a penny cheaper, that he would get it a penny cheaper if the tax were taken off. If he supposes he would get in competition two or three new journals as good to choose from, he is mistaken; not knowing the immense resources and the gradually perfective machinery necessary to the production of such a journal. It appears to me to be a fair tax enough, very little in the way of individuals, not embarrassing to the public in its mode of being levied, and requiring some small consideration and pauses from the American kind of newspaper projectors. Further, a committee has reported in favour of the repeal, and the subject may be held to need no present launching.|$|R

50|$|The best stamp hinges {{are also}} {{designed}} to be “peelable”, meaning that the stamp may be removed from the page, and the hinge from the stamp, without any damage to either. Not all makes of hinge have this property, and the backs <b>of</b> many <b>stamps</b> have “hinge remnants”, where the hinge has torn away rather than releasing the stamp. This is especially common for mint stamps, where the stamp’s own gum adheres tightly to the hinge. Some old stamps may actually have multiple hinge remnants layered on top of each other. Conversely, careless <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> a hinge may take away a layer <b>of</b> the <b>stamp’s</b> paper, resulting in a type <b>of</b> <b>stamp</b> thin known as a hinge thin. The thinner paper will be noticeable when the stamp is held up to the light and is considered a serious fault in a stamp.|$|R
