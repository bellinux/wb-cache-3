NAMI-A pre-mitotic stop to cell proliferation was due to the maintenance of the phosphorylated, inactive, form of Cdk 1, caused by the activation of the ATM/ATR checkpoint, as confirmed by the up-regulation and phosphorylation of Chk 1.

In a third approach, supramolecular triangular prisms were investigated. The prismatic structures can encapsulate large planar compounds. Studies showed that the encapsulated compound can not escape the prismatic cage unless it breaks. This property can be useful for drug transport, therefore a series of functionalized pyrenyl derivatives were encapsulated in the prism.

Competition experiments involving <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compounds</b> and organic drugs were also conducted to obtain information about the DNA binding modes of the <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compounds.</b> These studies provide strong support for the routine application of ESI-MS as a tool for analysis of non-covalent complexes between metallointercalators and dsDNA. ESI-MS also proved to be a rapid and efficient tool for investigation of interactions between the N-terminal domain of ε (ε 186, the exonuclease proofreading subunit of E. coli DNA) and three different metal ions (Mn 2 +, Zn 2 + and Dy 3 +). The dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of Mn 2 +, Zn 2 + and Dy 3 + to ε 186 were determined from ESI-MS data to be 38. 5 x 10 - 6, 3. 7 x 10 - 6 and 2. 0 x 10 - 6 M, respectively. Despite binding the least tightly to the protein, incorporation of Mn 2 + into the enzyme resulted in the highest enzymatic activity as measured by spectrophotometric studies.

Basic research is being conducted to develop the chemistry of a complete cyclic process. The process will remove tritium from H 2 O by concentrating it with respect to protio-water.

Several steps are required in a cyclic process for the concentration of tritium in water. In the first step, the tritium is incorporated in an organic compound. H-T discrimination occurs as the tritium containing compound is oxidized in a step involving a Ru(IV) oxo complex. Strong primary kinetic isotope effects lead to the oxidation of C-H bonds in preference to C-T bonds, and this reaction leads to concentration of tritium in the organic compound. The reduced form of the <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compound</b> can be reoxidized so that the oxidation step can be made catalytic...|$|E

KP 1019 und NAMI-A, zwei Rutheniumverbindungen, die sich zur Zeit in klinischen Studien befinden, wurden als Modellssysteme zur Untersuchung chemischer Reaktionen mittels einer Dichtefunktionaltheorie (DFT) - Methode verwendet. Der Zweck dieser Arbeit ist es, Wissen über die Chemie dieser Verbindungen in der Gegenwart von Wasserstoffperoxid zu erlangen und eventuelle Folgereaktionen zu studieren. Damit wollen wir dazu beitragen, die Reaktionsmechanismen von KP 1019 und NAMI-A mit ROS aufzuklären. Letztenendes ist das Ziel, Schlussfolgerungen über die möglichen redoxchemischen Wirkmechanismen von Rutheniumantikrebsverbindungen in vivo zu ziehen.

In this thesis I examine aspects of the control of biological electron transfer by two copper proteins that act as natural electron carriers. In the first study, I have made a mutation to one of the ligand residues in the azurin blue copper center, methionine 121 changed to a glutamic acid. Studies of intramolecular electron transfer rates from that mutated center to covalently attached ruthenium complexes indicate that the weak axial methionine ligand is important not only for tuning the reduction potential of the blue copper site but also for maintaining the low reorganization energy that is important for fast electron transfer at long distances. In the second study, I begin to examine the reorganization energy of the purple copper center in the CuA domain of subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase. In this copper center, the unpaired electron is delocalized over the entire binuclear site. Because long-range electron transfer into and out of this center occurs over long distances with very small driving forces, the reorganization energy of the CuA center has been predicted to be extremely low. I describe a strategy for measuring this reorganization energy starting with the construction of a series of mutations introducing surface histidines. These histidines can then be labeled with a series of <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compounds</b> that differ primarily in their reduction potentials. The electron transfer rates to these <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compounds</b> can then be used to determine the reorganization energy of the CuA site. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the thermal- and photo-substitution {{behavior}} of polypyridyl ruthenium complexes is described {{at the surface}} of lipid bilayers and in homogeneous solutions. It is shown that the successive thermal binding and light-induced unbinding of the cationic ruthenium complex at {{the surface of the}} lipid bilayer requires negatively charged liposomes and ruthenium complexes containing moderately hindered N-N bidentate ligands. Our results in homogeneous solution show that changing the steric hindrance of the bidentate ligand influences both the photo- and thermal reactivities of these complexes, by altering the mechanism of the Ru-S bond formation. It is also shown that the Ru-S bond formation at the surface of negative lipid bilayers is faster than the same reaction in homogenous aqueous solutions, and a two-steps mechanism is proposed for the thermal coordination of ruthenium aqua complexes at membrane-embedded ligands. Furthermore, the application of ruthenium-functionalized liposomes in drug delivery is discussed. In vitro tests on cancer cell lines show that neutral liposomes functionalized with <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compounds</b> are more readily taken up by cancer cells than ruthenium-free liposomes. The liposome samples with <b>ruthenium</b> <b>compounds</b> are shown to be poorly cytotoxic in the dark. After light irradiation, the cytotoxicity increased at least up to five times for ruthenium complexes supported on non-PEGylated liposomes. Finally, the photoactivation of polypyridyl complexes with low-energy photons was studied using a photosensitization approach. A photosubstitution reaction was made faster upon yellow light irradiation than upon blue light irradiation by covalently linking a rhodamine B dye to the ruthenium complex. Promotor: E.
