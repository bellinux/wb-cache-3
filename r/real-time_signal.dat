40|$|Elevators are {{regarded}} as important modern day necessities for urban communities. Although elevators are widely used in various installations, the actual control and monitoring of these systems is given less attention by the research community. Specifically, the problem of maintaining and analyzing massive <b>real-time</b> elevator control <b>signals</b> has been largely ignored by data mining community. Every elevator consists {{of at least one}} onboard controller (circuit board). Like any other realtime systems, an onboard elevator controller can generate a large volume of signals.

40|$|This study revisits the {{scalability}} {{issue of}} polling I/O, i. e., select() and poll(). Although polling I/O was an efficient and hence popular I/O multiplexing mechanism, {{it is believed}} inadequate today to handle {{tens of thousands of}} concurrent TCP connections because the scanning cost of such a large connection list is overwhelmingly high. However, the real problem of polling I/O is not in the se-mantics itself, but in various implementation factors such as memory allocations and copies to process a system call, pointer operations and function calls through VFS, and wait channel management to handle events. To miti-gate these overheads and reinstate polling I/O as an effi-cient I/O multiplexing mechanism, we have developed a fast polling I/O library based on POSIX <b>real-time</b> <b>signals.</b> This library implements the full functionality of polling I/O by managing the state transition of each connection notified with <b>real-time</b> <b>signals.</b> Traditional polling I/O has a weakness especially when it polls a small number of ac-tive connections together with a huge number of idle ones. Our polling I/O library is proved to achieve high perfor-mance in that situation. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Real-time</b> <b>signal</b> {{processing}} is necessary, but {{not sufficient}} {{in and of}} itself, for live signal processing such as what is required in live event support. Live audio digital signal processing requires both real-time operation and a sufficient limit to throughput delay {{so as to be}} tolerable to performers using stage monitors or in-ear monitors and not noticeable as lip sync error by the audience also directly watching the performers.

50|$|A key {{advantage}} of OFDM is that fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) {{may be used}} to simplify implementation. Fourier transforms convert signals {{back and forth between the}} time domain and frequency domain. Consequently, Fourier transforms can exploit the fact that any complex waveform may be decomposed into a series of simple sinusoids. In signal processing applications, discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) are used to operate on <b>real-time</b> <b>signal</b> samples. DFTs may be applied to composite OFDM signals, avoiding the need for the banks of oscillators and demodulators associated with individual subcarriers. Fast Fourier transforms are numerical algorithms used by computers to perform DFT calculations.|$|E

On the other hand, data networks which store and forward messages using computers had limited connectivity, usually did not have sufficient bandwidth for digitised voice and video signals, and suffer from unacceptable delays for the <b>real-time</b> <b>signals.</b> Television networks using radio or cables were largely broadcast networks with minimum switching facilities.|$|R

5000|$|Unfortunately, it is {{not always}} {{possible}} to meet the setup and hold criteria, because the flip-flop may be connected to a <b>real-time</b> <b>signal</b> that could change at any time, outside the control of the designer. In this case, the best the designer can do is to reduce the probability of error to a certain level, depending on the required reliability of the circuit. One technique for suppressing metastability is to connect two or more flip-flops in a chain, so that the output of each one feeds the data input of the next, and all devices share a common clock. With this method, the probability of a metastable event can be reduced to a negligible value, but never to zero. The probability of metastability gets closer and closer to zero as the number of flip-flops connected in series is increased. The number of flip-flops being cascaded {{is referred to as the}} [...] "ranking"; [...] "dual-ranked" [...] flip flops (two flip-flops in series) is a common situation.|$|E
