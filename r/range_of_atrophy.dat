40|$|Biomechanics of the atrophic {{mandible}} and its implant rehabilitation {{were analyzed}} with the finite element method. In correlation with {{the classification of}} the edentulous jaw by Cawood, four models of the atrophic mandible were designed. 70 designs with and without implant retained dentures were simulated during frontal and lateral bite. Mandibular flexure was measured and stresses and strains were calculated for the mandibular bone by simulation. An evaluation of strain was performed, applying Frost’s mechanonstat hypothesis. According to the hypothesis of Frost, regions of disuse remodeling, conservation remodeling, bone deposition and microfractures were identified. The edentulous jaw without denture showed a significant increase on mandibular flexure with increase of the degree <b>of</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Mandibular flexure was three times as high, comparing severe level <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> compared to low level <b>of</b> <b>atrophy.</b> By applying implant retained dentures, mandibular flexure decreased significantly. However, bone quality appeared to have low influence on mandibular flexure (< 30 %) at severe level <b>of</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The special morphological patterns <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> can be explained with the biomechanical analysis in this work. Accelerated atrophy appears at low level <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> and stagnates with increased degree <b>of</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> removable overdentures on interforaminal implants with splinted cantilever bridge framework shows a significant increase of biomechanical risk when applying a rigid, non-removable denture.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{define the}} role of {{increased}} fundus autofluorescence (FAF), a surrogate for lipofuscin content, as {{a risk factor for}} progression <b>of</b> geographic <b>atrophy</b> (GA). DESIGN: Prospective natural history cohort study, the GAIN (Characterization <b>of</b> geographic <b>atrophy</b> progression in patients with age-related macular degeneration). METHODS: setting: Single-center study conducted in Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: After screening of 211 patients, 109 eyes of 82 patients with GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration and a minimum follow-up of 6 months were included. OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Lipofuscin content was classified independently by 2 masked observers according to FAF patterns described previously. Bivariate, stratified, and multivariable analyses were used to explore the associations between GA growth and independent variables. Mediation analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of FAF patterns to GA progression. MAIN OUTCOME: Progression of GA in mm(2) /year as measured with FAF. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 6 - 42). Median GA growth was 1. 61 mm(2) /year. FAF, baseline area <b>of</b> <b>atrophy,</b> and time <b>of</b> follow-up were independently associated with GA progression (P <. 004). FAF patterns and baseline area <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> were strongly associated (P <. 0001), suggesting potential confounding. Mediation analysis suggested that most of the effect of FAF patterns on GA growth was actually caused by baseline area <b>of</b> <b>atrophy.</b> CONCLUSIONS: FAF patterns, baseline area <b>of</b> <b>atrophy,</b> and time <b>of</b> follow-up were associated with GA progression. However, FAF patterns seem to be a consequence (not a cause) <b>of</b> enlarging <b>atrophy</b> and their effect on GA progression seems mostly driven by baseline area <b>of</b> <b>atrophy...</b>|$|R

The clinical implications <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the heart and the reversibility <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> and hypertrophy are emphasized. <b>ATROPHY</b> <b>of</b> {{the heart is}} defined as an acquired reduction in the size and mass of this organ.

40|$|Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) <b>of</b> hip-pocampal <b>atrophy</b> is a sensitive but not specific method {{to support the}} clinical diagnosis of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We recently described our findings that <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the entorhinal cortex (ERC) in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is equal to that found in AD but that hippocampal atrophy in FTD is less than that found in AD. The MRI volumes of these structures provide a topographic repre-sentation of the region of interest. We hypothesized that two different dementias with distinct histopathologic and clinical features might, in addition to quantitative pat-terns, display topographically different patterns <b>of</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Methods: We adopted a morphometric approach to mon-itor the pattern <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the hippocampus and the ERC by computing two-dimensional profiles from MRI volumes of the structures in control subjects and patients with FTD and AD. Results: Compared with control subjects, <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the hippocampus in patients with AD was diffuse. In patients with FTD, <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the hippocampus was localized predominantly in the anterior hippocampus, suggesting a different pattern <b>of</b> hippocampal <b>atrophy</b> in FTD com-pared with AD. The amount and pattern <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the entorhinal cortex was virtually equal in both demented groups.

40|$|International audienceRapid brain loss is {{characteristic}} for the patients with {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) [1]. In particular, increase of the lateral ventricular volume is strongly correlated with the progression of the disease. Other {{parts of the brain}} (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, etc.) are also subject to the rapid neuronal loss. Many automated image processing methods rely on usage of an anatomical template for registration into a common stereotaxic space for tissue classification, structure segmentation or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Unfortunately, most commonly available anatomical templates are based on the scans of healthy individuals: for example the MNI-ICBM 152 template used in the publicly available SPM and FSL image analysis tools is based on MRI scans of young healthy adults [2], and thus may be suboptimal for image registration techniques. The use of disease-specific templates have been proposed in the literature [3], however high variability in the degree <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> for subjects with AD and MCI makes use of a single disease-specific template challenging. Ideally, one would like to use an average MRI template that is matched to the level <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> for the subject in question. In this paper we propose a novel approach to generate a continuous four-dimensional template, where the 4 th dimension is a surrogate measure <b>of</b> overall brain <b>atrophy,</b> thus making it possible to generate the appropriate representative anatomical template from the wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> possible levels <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> such that it is closely matched to the progression of the disease of the subject, while maintaining continuous one-to-one mapping to the common stereotaxic space...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) atrophy {{in patients}} with Stargardt disease using autofluorescence imaging (AF). • DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. • METHODS: Demographics, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), AF images, and electrophysiology responses (group 1, macular dysfunction; group 2, macula + cone dysfunction; group 3, macula + cone-rod dysfunction) were evaluated at presentation and follow-up {{in a group of}} 12 patients (24 eyes) with Stargardt disease. The existence, development, and rate of enlargement of areas <b>of</b> RPE <b>atrophy</b> over time were evaluated using AF imaging. A linear regression model was used to investigate the effects of AF and electrophysiology on rate <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> enlargement and BCVA, adjusting for age of onset and duration of disease. • RESULTS: Eight male and 4 female patients (median age 42 years; range 24 - 69 years) were followed for a median of 41. 5 months (range 13 - 66 months). All 12 patients had reduced AF compatible with RPE atrophy at presentation and in all patients the atrophy enlarged during follow-up. The mean rate <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> enlargement for all patients was 1. 58 mm 2 /y (SD 1. 25 mm 2 /y; range 0. 13 - 5. 27 mm 2 /y). Only the pattern of functional loss present as detected by electrophysiology was statistically significantly associated with the rate <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> enlargement when correcting for other variables (P <. 001), with patients in group 3 (macula + cone-rod dysfunction) having the fastest rate <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> enlargement (1. 97 mm 2 /y, SD 0. 70 mm 2 /y) (group 1 [macula] 1. 09 mm 2 /y, SD 0. 53 mm 2 /y; group 2 [macula + cone] 1. 89 mm 2 /y, SD 2. 27 mm 2 /y). • CONCLUSION: Variable rates <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> enlargement were observed {{in patients with}} Stargardt disease. The pattern of functional loss detected on electrophysiology was strongly associated with the rate <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> enlargement over time, thus serving as the best prognostic indicator for patients with this inherited retinal disease. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methods. The primary stage of the methods of identification and assessment of the level <b>of</b> <b>atrophy</b> <b>of</b> the alveolar part of the mandible is a digital analysis of digital orthopantomograms of 138 patients who had baseline and repeated X-ray images with a time interval of one to five years.

Reduction of the level of errors is ensured using the root-mean-square and arithmetic average interim results, which approach the final results to their actual value. Results. Levels of absolute and relative errors decreased with approaching to the calculation of final complex constant and proportional anthropometric indices. This is due to the use in a system the calculation of the root-mean-square values and the proposed principle of the mathematical matrix relations that involves finding of the arithmetic average of the columns and lines of the matrix.
