2500|$|Kevin J. Delaney said [...] "Robots {{are taking}} human jobs. But Bill Gates {{believes}} that governments should tax companies’ use of them, {{as a way}} to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment." [...] The <b>robot</b> <b>tax</b> would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers.|$|E
5000|$|Leaders of the {{industrial}} and scientific communities argue that, to offset the social costs created by automation’s displacement effects, either robots should pay income tax, or their owners should pay a tax for replacing a worker with a robot. And this [...] "robot tax" [...] {{should be used to}} finance a universal basic income or guaranteed living wage. Bill Gates said the solution to the problem is simple, the government should start taxing robots i.e. make the robot owners cough up the money needed to re-establish the defunct workforce. But EU Commissioner Andrus Ansip, tasked with bringing Europe to the digital age, says no. He explained that a <b>robot</b> <b>tax</b> would only mean someone else would take the leading position and leave Europe behind.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} long-run growth effects of {{automation}} in the canonical overlapping generations framework. While automation implies constant returns to capital within this model class (even {{in the absence}} of technological progress), we show that it does not have the potential to lead to positive long-growth. The reason is that automation suppresses wages, which are the only source of investment because of the demographic structure of the overlapping generations model. This result stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} effects of automation in the representative agent setting, where positive long-run growth is feasible because agents can invest out of their wage income and out of their asset income. We also analyze the effects of a <b>robot</b> <b>tax</b> that has featured prominently in the policy debate on automation and show that it could raise the capital stock and per capita output at the steady state. However, the <b>robot</b> <b>tax</b> cannot induce a takeoff toward positive long-run growth...|$|E
5000|$|Montebourg's months-long {{position}} in second place, however, was challenged by {{a surge of}} support for Benoît Hamon, with the primary becoming a three-man race between Valls, Hamon, and Montebourg by mid-January. Hamon's strongly left-wing program of legalizing cannabis, <b>taxing</b> <b>robots</b> to fund a universal basic income, and reducing the 35-hour workweek to 32 hours, attracted many left-wing voters disillusioned by the Socialists' turn toward business-friendly policies, championed under Hollande's presidency {{by the likes of}} Valls and Macron. The former education minister's late rise was likened to that of François Fillon in the primary of the centre-right Republicans party, his rise propelled by his championing of left-wing values and vision of a society that spends less time working, enjoys higher pay, and emphasizes the importance GDP growth less. Hamon has also decried [...] "neoconservatives" [...] and [...] "even those on the left" [...] who wished to restrict the rights of French Muslims, a less-than-subtle denunciation of Valls's hardline stance on immigration. His proposal for a universal income has been his signature policy; in the final primary debate, he insisted that it [...] "creates work" [...] and [...] "allows employees to reduce their workdays, and it can further contract and eradicate poverty," [...] and post-debate polls indicated left-wing voters consistently viewed Hamon as being the most convincing candidate.|$|R
