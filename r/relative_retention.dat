40|$|Spray retention, i. e. {{the overall}} capture of spray {{droplets}} by plants on initial or subsequent impact, and after loss due to run-off, {{is an important}} stage in the spray application process as droplet losses may result in reduced efficacy, economic loss, and environmental contamination. The aim of this exploratory study is {{to determine whether a}} new method based on calculating the volumetric proportions per impact type, i. e. adhesion, rebound and shatter, can be used to predict spray retention. These volumetric proportions are calculated based on logistic regression models, derived from vision-based droplet characteristics and impact assessments, and laser-based spray characteristics. The advantages and limitations of such a method are explored. The volumetric proportions per impact type on a horizontal, synthetic hydrophobic surface were determined for four different nozzles (XR 110 01 VS flat-fan nozzle, XR 110 04 VS flat-fan nozzle, XR 110 08 VS flat-fan nozzle and AI 110 08 VS air-induction nozzle) under controlled realistic conditions, and compared to the results of a retention test. The volumetric proportions of adhesion were much lower than the <b>relative</b> <b>retentions,</b> indicating that a considerable amount of rebound and shatter also contributed to final retention.

The retention of the CLAs far exceeds {{the sum of the}} retention of the CLAMEs and stearic acid. In this paper we isolate the interactions at the silica surface by determining the retentions of the same compounds on the NH 4 + cation exchanger that is the precursor to the Ag+ column in the manufacturing process. On the NH 4 + column, the CLAMEs are very weakly retained, but the sum of the retentions of the CLAMEs plus stearic acid is equal to that of the CLAs. It was determined that stearic acid is retained to the same degree on both the NH 4 + and Ag+ stationary phases. By implication, the CLA carboxylic acid functionality does not interact with Ag+ and thus three-centre complexes of the Ag+ with the CLA bonds and carboxyl group do not occur. (Independent supporting evidence is also presented.) A model for CLA retention on the Ag+ stationary phase that explains the synergy of retention is presented. It involves a random arrangement of collapsed Ag+ alkyl sulphonate bonded phase on the silica surface. The nature of retention on the NH 4 + stationary phase is also discussed. Partial separation of the CLAs on the NH 4 + stationary phase shows that bond interactions with the silica surface also contribute to the separations of the CLAs, the CLAMEs, and other unsaturated analytes. As was found on the Ag+ column in the absence acetonitrile, normal phase elution occurs and log k versus log (% strong solvent) plots for all analytes are linear on the NH 4 + column.
