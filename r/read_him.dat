5|$|When {{the wife}} of Chicago {{publisher}} Horace O'Donoghue <b>read</b> <b>him</b> the news of Shepard's death {{four days after the}} event, he picked up a razor and slit his throat. Although his suicide was first thought to be impulsive, it was later learned that the likely cause was O'Donoghue's large debts to Chicago publishing houses.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest <b>read</b> <b>him</b> his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E

5|$|John M. Harlan's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{towards the end}} of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. To cover this, he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife <b>read</b> <b>him</b> Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{lived with}} Smith {{and his wife}} for the {{majority}} of his childhood, and Smith taught the young Lennon to read, <b>read</b> <b>him</b> nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles. He also taught him to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ. Smith collapsed and died on a Sunday at his home of a liver haemorrhage, aged 52, and was buried in St Peter’s Church graveyard, Woolton.|$|E
25|$|Malthus {{criticized the}} Poor Laws for leading to {{inflation}} rather than improving {{the well-being of}} the poor. He supported taxes on grain imports (the Corn Laws), because food security was more important than maximizing wealth. His views became influential, and controversial, across economic, political, social and scientific thought. Pioneers of evolutionary biology <b>read</b> <b>him,</b> notably Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. He remains a much-debated writer.|$|E

25|$|Dzhokhar was {{questioned}} for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating {{with them on}} the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler <b>read</b> <b>him</b> a Miranda warning. Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception. This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.|$|E
25|$|Remarkably modern even {{to readers}} today, Montaigne's attempt {{to examine the}} world through the lens of the only thing he can depend on implicitly—his own judgment—makes him more {{accessible}} to modern readers than any other author of the Renaissance. Much of modern literary non-fiction has found inspiration in Montaigne and writers of all kinds continue to <b>read</b> <b>him</b> for his masterful balance of intellectual knowledge and personal storytelling.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{scholarly}} student Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) {{and popular}} underachieving jock Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) miss their school prom; Schmidt being {{rejected by the}} girl he asked to be his date and Jenko being barred from attending because of his grades. Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol.

6000|$|Could {{there be}} a more simple Tyrtaeus? and who that <b>reads</b> <b>him</b> will not be ambitious of falling in a glorious war? Bayly, indeed, is always simple. He is [...] "simple, sensuous, and passionate," [...] and Milton asked no more from a poet.|$|R
500|$|Hans Christian Andersen {{was born}} in Odense, Denmark on 2April 1805 to Hans Andersen, a shoemaker, and Anne Marie Andersdatter. [...] An only and a spoiled child, Andersen shared a love of {{literature}} with his father who <b>read</b> <b>him</b> The Arabian Nights and the fables of Jean de la Fontaine. [...] Together, they constructed panoramas, pop-up pictures, and toy theatres, and took long jaunts into the countryside.|$|E
500|$|Riley's mother {{frequently}} {{told him}} stories of fairies, trolls, and giants, and <b>read</b> <b>him</b> children's poems. She was very superstitious, and influenced Riley {{with many of}} her beliefs. They both placed [...] "spirit rappings" [...] in their homes on places like tables and bureaus to capture any spirits {{that may have been}} wandering about. This influence is recognized in many of his works, including [...] "Flying Islands of the Night." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the movie indirectly references the work of writers Dante Alighieri (through the use of Divine Comedy imagery) and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (through the presence of Faustian bargains). Confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters, like those in the novels of Franz Kafka, appear in the film, but the Coens insist the connection was not intended. [...] "I have not <b>read</b> <b>him</b> since college", admitted Joel in 1991, [...] "when I devoured works like The Metamorphosis. Others have mentioned The Castle and [...] "In the Penal Colony", but I've never read them." ...|$|E

500|$|While he lived, Stephen Crane was {{denominated}} by critical readers a realist, a naturalist, an impressionist, symbolist, Symboliste, expressionist and ironist; his posthumous {{life was}} enriched by critics who <b>read</b> <b>him</b> as nihilistic, existentialist, a neo-Romantic, a sentimentalist, protomodernist, pointilliste, visionist, imagist and, by {{his most recent}} biographer, a “bleak naturalist.” At midcentury he was a “predisciple of the New Criticism”; by its end he was “a proto-deconstructionist anti-artist hero” who had “leapfrogged modernism, landing on postmodernist ground.” Or, as Sergio Perosa wrote in 1964, “The critic wanders in a labyrinth of possibilities, which every new turn taken by Crane’s fiction seems to explode or deny.” ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{began writing}} Irene around 1726 {{when he first}} began to work in his father's {{bookshop}}. While in the bookshop he befriended Gilbert Walmesley, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court of Lichfield. Johnson would discuss Irene with Walmesley, and <b>read</b> <b>him</b> {{some of the early}} drafts. At one point, Walmesley told Johnson that [...] "he was making Irene suffer so much {{in the first part of}} the play that there would be nothing left for her to suffer in the later part". Johnson joked that there was [...] "enough in reserve... I intend to put my heroine into the ecclesiastical court of Lichfield which will fill up the utmost measure of human calamity".|$|E
500|$|Smith {{taught the}} four-year-old Lennon to read by reading out loud the {{headlines}} of the Liverpool Echo, <b>read</b> <b>him</b> nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon {{how to solve}} crossword puzzles. Smith told Lennon that words {{did not have to}} be taken at face value, as they had many different meanings, which Lennon would later use in his writing. He also taught Lennon to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ. Mimi admitted that she never had the time to [...] "go playing ducks in the bath with him" [...] (Lennon) but that Smith would put Lennon to bed nearly every night. Mimi later said: [...] "John [...] loved his uncle George. I felt quite left out of that. They'd go off together, just leaving me a bar of chocolate and a note saying: 'Have a happy day.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1863 James {{encouraged}} him to further his education at a classical school in New Market, since Johnson had completed the coursework at the Franklin common school. The New Market school was taught by Joseph Salyards (or Saliards), a professor and writer described as one of [...] "the most learned men of the age" [...] and [...] "a most remarkable scholar in many respects." [...] Johnson was accompanied to New Market by {{a young man with}} the surname of Clark, who <b>read</b> <b>him</b> his lessons; he tutored Clark in several subjects, including French. At New Market, Johnson made so much progress in mathematics, literature, science and foreign languages with his sighted classmates that he returned to Franklin after two years. In 1866 the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind in Staunton offered him the opportunity to advance his professional studies in education, and he completed one term in 1867.|$|E
500|$|Rajinikanth {{was cast}} as the village ruffian Parattai. Although Bharathiraja had {{finalised}} [...] as the salary for Rajinikanth after the latter initially charged , he had paid [...] to Rajinikanth. 16 Vayathinile marked Rajinikanth's first appearance in a colour film. Since the actor was not fluent in Tamil at the time, Bhagyaraj <b>read</b> <b>him</b> his lines and Rajinikanth repeated them until he mastered them. Sridevi was cast as Mayil, after whom the film was initially titled. For the role of Mayil's mother Guruvammal, Bharathiraja wanted someone who could speak the village dialect fluently and chose Ganthimathi for her acting style. Receiving a salary of , Bhagyaraj was initially considered for the veterinarian's role but wanted to concentrate on directing; despite that, he still made a cameo appearance in the film. The role of the veterinarian went to newcomer Shabbir Ahmed, who was given the screen name Sathyajith during post-production. His scenes were shot in ten days. Comedian Goundamani was cast as a character named Koothu. Kamal, Sridevi, Rajinikanth and Gandhimathi were credited by their character names in the opening credits, rather than their actual names.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} that the Klingons, not humans, {{are the ones who}} quote Shakespeare; Gorkon claims {{at one point in the}} film that [...] "You have not {{experienced}} Shakespeare until you have <b>read</b> <b>him</b> in the original Klingon." [...] Translating Shakespeare into Klingon proved problematic because Marc Okrand had not created a verb for [...] "to be" [...] when he developed the language. Shakespeare scholar Paul A. Cantor argues that this association is appropriate—the warlike Klingons find their literary matches in the characters Othello, Mark Antony, and Macbeth—but that it also reinforces a claim that the end of the Cold War means the end of heroic literature such as Shakespeare's. Meyer said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim the Bard as German before World War II. According to Kay Smith, the use of Shakespeare has meaning in itself and also derives new meaning (underscoring cultural politics in the film) by its rearticulation in a new form.|$|E
