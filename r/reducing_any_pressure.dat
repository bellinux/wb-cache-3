In some regions, {{the fact that all}} neighbors are verifiably free of nuclear weapons <b>reduces</b> <b>any</b> <b>pressure</b> individual states might feel to build those weapons themselves, even if neighbors are known to have peaceful nuclear energy programs that might otherwise be suspicious.

40|$|Following the serendipitous {{capture of}} the bathyal {{gastropod}} Calliostoma (Otukaia) alertae, observations were made to determine if it would wipe the surface of its shell with its foot, a phenomenon know as shell wiping and only recorded in four other gastropod species, all Calliostomatids. C. alertae wiped its shell at least once every 24 h, in an identical manner recorded for other species. Because of its bathyal habitat and lack of shell fouling, it is concluded that shell wiping in C. alertae probably functions to reduce shell fouling and/or to <b>reduce</b> <b>any</b> predation <b>pressure.</b> Given the different habitats, depths, function and distributions of the species known to exhibit shell wiping, {{it is likely that}} shell wiping is a feature common in the genus Calliostoma...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic causal relationship between electricity consumption {{and economic growth}} in Ghana within a trivariate ARDL framework, for the period 1971 – 2012. The paper obviates the variable omission bias, {{and the use of}} cross-sectional techniques that characterise most existing studies. The results show that there is a distinct causal flow from economic growth to electricity consumption: both in the short run and in the long run. This finding supports the growth-led electricity consumption hypothesis, as documented in the literature. The paper urges policymakers in Ghana to resort to alternative sources of electric power generation, in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>any</b> future <b>pressures</b> on the current sources of electricity production. Appropriate monetary policies must also be put in place, in order to accommodate potential inflation hikes stemming from excessive demands for electricity in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The new, {{draconian}} sanctions {{introduced by}} the United States and the European Union to prevent Iran from earning money from its crude oil exports could pose a serious economic threat to oil-importing countries that also trade heavily with the US and EU economies. Nations such as China, South Korea, and Japan, which obtain significant amount of oil from Iran while enjoying large trade surpluses with the United States, are justifiably anxious. These countries and others worry that by pushing Iran from the global crude market, the new US and EU sanctions will disrupt oil markets, increase crude prices, and further slow global economic growth, which, at a minimum, would cut their export revenues. Saudi Arabia {{and other members of}} the Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have indicated they would replace oil previously purchased from Iran, but these offers have done little to allay the apprehensions. Verleger suggests a way to put real pressure on Iran while moderating or eliminating economic fallout for the US and EU economies and those of their trading partners: selling oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which now holds far more oil than required by treaty obligations—more than 280 million surplus barrels. This strategic use of the SPR will increase the effectiveness of sanctions on Iran and ease the adjustment difficulties that confront US allies. The sales might also <b>reduce</b> <b>any</b> price <b>pressure</b> caused by removal of light Iranian crude from the market. ...|$|R
40|$|Methanohalophilus strain FDF 1 synthesizes I-glutamine, betaine, and N-acetl-f-ysine as osmoprotective agents {{when the}} cells are grown in high {{external}} concentrations of NaCI. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses of 13 CH 30 H- 12 CO 2 label incorporation by the cells {{provide information on}} the biosynthetic pathways of these organic osmolytes. The labeling studies indicate that Methanohalophilus strain FDF 1 produces glutamate and 1 -glutamine via a partial oxidative Krebs pathway. 13 C labeling of betaine is consistent with methylation of glycine generated from serine (via serine hydroxymethyltransferase). The labeling pattern for NE-acetyl- 3 -lysine {{is consistent with the}} synthesis of its precursor a-lysine occurring by the diaminopimelate pathway in these cells. Methanohalophilus species are among the most halophilic of the methanogenic archaebacteria. A variety of organic solutes, including the, 3 -amino acids, 3 -glutamine and N 8 -acetyl- 13 -lysine (11, 15), are used to <b>reduce</b> <b>any</b> differential osmotic <b>pressure</b> between the intracellular and extracellular environments in these cells.
