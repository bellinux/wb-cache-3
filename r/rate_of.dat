5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
