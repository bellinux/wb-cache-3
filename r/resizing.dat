5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by <b>resizing.</b> As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the <b>resizing</b> and inversion.|$|E
5|$|Iridion began {{development}} as a shooter for the Game Boy Color; when Shin'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance, Iridion was the first game by the developer {{to appear on the}} system. Though billed as a 3D game, Shin'en used realtime encoding and <b>resizing</b> to manipulate the size of 2D sprites instead of creating a true 3D environment. More room on the game cartridge was available for graphics due to the game's use of the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in a small file size.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the <b>resizing.</b> This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the <b>resizing</b> transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is another}} handy <b>resize</b> feature. It {{is a kind}} of {{compromise}} between the stretch <b>resize</b> and the proportional <b>resize.</b> This feature will <b>resize</b> the image proportionally using the Fit feature (not the regular proportional <b>resize)</b> and will place it {{in the center of a}} canvas, which has [...] and [...] as its dimensions, and [...] as its background. This is very useful, because it offers the ability to fit virtually any image inside any <b>resize</b> frame - and the proportions will not matter: you can fit a landscape inside a square, or a square inside a portrait, etc. The [...] argument is used in the same manner as it is used when rotating by custsom angles - to fill the left blank areas.|$|R

25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length <b>resizing</b> process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size <b>resizing,</b> although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base <b>resizing</b> die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E

50|$|The Picture Shape {{command in}} {{previous}} versions of Office {{has been replaced}} with a new Crop to Shape command that allows users to <b>resize</b> and move the selected shape during the crop process. By default, Office 2010, like previous versions, automatically <b>resizes</b> images that are inserted into shapes, which can negatively affect their aspect ratio. To address this, images in shapes can now be cropped or <b>resized</b> after being inserted, and individual Fit and Fill options have been incorporated. The former option <b>resizes</b> the selected image so that the entire area of the crop selection rectangle or shape is filled, whereas the latter option <b>resizes</b> the image {{so that it is}} displayed within the selection rectangle or within a shape in its entirety; both options maintain the original aspect ratio of the selected image. Images inserted into SmartArt diagrams can also be cropped, <b>resized,</b> or repositioned.|$|R
50|$|The Shape Handling tool {{allows you}} to select shapes. Once {{selected}} you may move, <b>resize,</b> pull, and rotate the shape. To <b>resize</b> a shape move your cursor {{to one of the}} corners of the selection box. Two arrows pointing in conflicting directions will appear. Then click and drag to <b>resize</b> the shape. If you want to <b>resized</b> it proportionally, hold down shift when Clicking and dragging. To move a shape around the canvas, click within the selected shapes selection box. Then hold your click and drag. This will move the shape.|$|R

25|$|The Space bar is a {{horizontal}} {{bar in the}} lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as <b>resizing</b> or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses {{in addition to its}} normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.|$|E
25|$|Windows Photo Gallery is a {{photo and}} video library {{management}} application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual pictures including custom metadata {{based on the}} Extensible Metadata Platform. It also allows basic editing of images, such as adjusting color and exposure, <b>resizing,</b> cropping, red-eye reduction and printing. Slideshows, with pan, fade and other effects, can also be created, and burnt to DVD. It allows custom metadata {{to be added to}} images and videos, and enables searching by the attributes. It also supports raw image format natively and can open and organize any image format for which image codecs are installed in the Windows Imaging Component. Images and videos may be viewed in the Windows Photo Gallery Viewer with options to zoom, pan and losslessly rotate images, pause or play videos, and bring up the Info pane to view and edit metadata about a photo or video. ICC V4 color profiles embedded in images are also supported. The Photo Print Wizard has been improved to offer a lot of customizability. An upgraded version of this, Windows Live Photo Gallery allows you to upload and share photos and videos online as part of Windows Live services.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the <b>resizing</b> operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E

2500|$|Full {{length and}} neck sizing dies are {{available}} from RCBS and Redding. A full length die set is available from Hornady Manufacturing. Most two-die set includes a bullet seating die and either a full length <b>resizing</b> die or a neck sizing die. A full length sizing die reforms the complete body of the case to specification. The neck sizing die reforms only the neck {{so that it can}} hold the bullet in place. Neck-sizing cases rather than full length sizing cases can extend the case life of cartridges. On the downside, cases that are only neck sized may not feed through some actions reliably especially when used in semi-automatic rifles. Cartridges which are intended for semi-automatics should be full length resized. Most Weatherby manufactured rifle chambers are machined to very tight tolerances making [...] full length <b>resizing</b> has little effect on extending the case life as the cartridge brass {{does not have to be}} worked as much to reform it. If once fired cases are to be used in a rifle in other than one it which it had been previously fired full length <b>resizing</b> the cases is the norm.|$|E
2500|$|Bottleneck rifle {{cartridges}} {{are particularly}} prone to encounter incipient head separations {{if they are}} full-length re-sized and re-trimmed to their maximum permitted case lengths each time they are reloaded. [...] In some such cartridges, such as the [...]303 British when used in Enfield rifles, as few as 1 or 2 re-loadings can be the limit, before {{the head of the}} cartridge will physically separate from the body of the cartridge when fired. [...] The solution to this problem, of avoiding overstretching of the brass case, and thereby avoiding the excessive thinning of the wall thickness of the brass case due to case stretching, is to use what is called a [...] "head space gauge". [...] Contrary to its name, it does not actually measure a rifle's headspace. [...] Rather, it measures the distance from the head of the cartridge {{to the middle of the}} shoulder of the bottleneck cartridge case. [...] For semi-automatic and automatic rifles, customary practice is to move the midpoint of this shoulder back by no more than 0.005 inches, for reliable operation, when <b>resizing</b> the case. [...] For bolt-action rifles, with their additional camming action, customary practice is to move this shoulder back by only 0.001 to 0.002 inches when <b>resizing</b> the case. [...] In contrast to full-length <b>resizing</b> of bottleneck rifle cartridges, which can rapidly thin out the wall thickness of bottleneck rifle cartridges due to case stretching that occurs each time when fired, partial length re-sizing of the bottleneck case that pushes shoulders back only a few thousandths of an inch will often permit a case to be safely reloaded 5 times or more, even up to 10 times, or more for very light loads.|$|E
2500|$|Standard dies {{are made}} from {{hardened}} steel, and require that the case be lubricated, for the <b>resizing</b> operation, which requires {{a large amount of}} force. Rifle cartridges require lubrication of every case, due to the large amount of force required, while smaller, thinner handgun cartridges can get away with alternating lubricated and unlubricated cases. [...] Carbide dies have a ring of tungsten carbide, which is far harder and slicker than tool steel, and so carbide dies do not require lubrication.|$|E
