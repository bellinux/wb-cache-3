40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of the partnership model to minimise and transform the marginalisation and disadvantage felt by rural communities due to the impacts of globalisation. It evaluates the effectiveness of the partnership model in this endeavour by examining one particular case study. Torrens Valley Youth Programme is a successful example of an innovative Community Partnership model in rural South Australia accomplished with minimal funding. This Case Study presents the evolution of a partnership between a <b>rural</b> <b>community</b> <b>centre</b> and a non government organisation into a sustainable and community-funded development programme responding to the needs of local young people. The programme’s financial and social capital sustainability is attributed to Project Management based on community development principles, including honouring the community centre’s invitation of partnership, facilitating regular forums to give young people a mechanism for collective action, and building relationships with the local media. This has culminated in the present transition of the community centre to independent management of the programme...|$|E

40|$|D. Tech. Digital Technology. In {{response}} to the urban-rural digital divide in South Africa, various public and private sector information and communication technology (ICT) -related initiatives have been launched to counteract the disparities which characterise such a divide. Most of the initiatives have simply been attempts to introduce more ICT infrastructure to rural areas. To a lesser extent, some have also incorporated elements of computer training as well as actions aimed at using ICTs to promote types of education or information provision in rural areas. With the rapid developments in technology and the ever-changing understanding of the scope and potential of rural community centres, no manual on these rural community centres can be absolutely comprehensive. It is hoped that this research project {{will serve as a}} starting point for such a body of knowledge, which can be further refined and enlarged with input from the growing number of <b>rural</b> <b>community</b> <b>centre</b> research projects in Africa. Long-term sustainability is probably the most critical issue facing rural community centres in Africa. This study aims to make a contribution towards the development of a model to increase the business results (service delivery), and therefore increase the chances of sustainability of ICT equipped community centres in rural areas, through improving the quality of service delivery to the community (customers). The main research question for this study was formulated as: What would constitute an effective QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (QMS) that contributes towards improving the quality of service delivery at ICT equipped Community Centres in rural areas of South Africa? The objective of this research project is to provide solutions as to how a QMS can be used as a means of improving the quality of operations and service delivery by community centres, utilising defined guidelines, templates, content and information management systems. Therefore, this study involved the development and testing of an interactive, multimedia quality management system or tool in support of the staff and management of the Ikageng Community Centre in a rural area of South Africa. The methodology, which was applied in this research project, was qualitative research supported by action research, a systems approach and prototype research design. The most significant findings from this research study were that an effective QMS has to be customised to address the current service delivery needs within the community centre. Only then can new services be introduced utilising a management system, which supports the improvement of the quality of service delivery at a community centre equipped with information and communication technologies. This management system could be utilised to manage information, such as training material and courses, storage of standard templates and guidelines in support of community centre staff and management to enhance repeatable service delivery as well as management of day-to-day activities of such a community centre. Key terms: quality assurance, self-assessment, systemati...|$|E

The interiors of the buildings had been developed quite randomly and by {{taking into account the}} possibilities of different time periods. The purpose of the renovation was to keep as much of the “old” as possible and incorporate it with the new - to keep and restore. The pride of the old peasant house is a large seto (Russian-style) masonry stove, reconstructed on top of the original foundation and performing all the functions just like in olden times - warming up the room and oneself and can also be used for cooking. Three ancient seto stoves preserved in Mokornulga were used as an example for building the stove.The construction project for renovation of the Seto <b>Community</b> <b>Centre</b> was designed by Rain Veidenberg, the project for interior design was done by Iir Hermeliin and Maria Tarvas. The <b>community</b> <b>centre</b> is an equal ground to cover from all parts of Setomaa, as Petseri is not accessible for everyday meetings and gatherings anymore. The <b>community</b> <b>centre</b> has been the birthplace for many initiatives and creations - for example Seto Kingdom, the Union of Setomaa Rural Municipalities, the Seto Convention, the play “Taarka”, MTÜ Taarka Pärimusteater (traditional theatre). The building hosts three leelo choirs (Estonian folk song expressed in runes) and the Union of Setomaa <b>Rural</b> Municipalities. The <b>community</b> <b>centre</b> has been the location for schoolings, courses, project counsellings, events and initiations, for example the Easterland and Setomaa Village Theatre Day.|$|R
40|$|Energy from waste (E/W) {{technologies}} {{in the form}} o f biogas plants, CHP plants and other municipal solid waste (MSW) conversion technologies, have been gaining steady ground in the provision o f energy throughout Europe and the UK. Urban Waste Water Treatment Plants (UWWTP) are utilising much o f the same biochemical processes common to these E/W plants. Previous studies on Centralised Anaerobic Digestion (CAD) within Ireland found that the legislative and economic conditions were not conducive to such an operation on the grounds o f low energy price for electric and heat energy, and due to the restrictive nature o f the allowable feedstocks. Recent changes to the Irish REFIT tariff on energy produced from Anaerobic digestion; alterations to the regulation o f the allowable use o f animal by products(ABP); the recent enactment o f the Renewable Energy D irective (09 / 28 /EC) and a subsequent review o f the draft Biowaste Directive (2001) required that the issue o f decentralised energy production in Ireland be reassessed. In this instance the feasibility study {{is based on a}} extant <b>rural</b> <b>community,</b> <b>centred</b> around the village o f Woodford Co Galway. The review found that the prevailing conditions were now such that it was technically and economically feasible for this biochemical process to provide energy and waste treatment facilities at the above location. The review also outlines the last item which is preventing this process from becoming achievable, specifically the lack o f a digestate regulation on land spreading which deals specifically with biowaste. The study finds that the implementation o f the draft EU biowaste regulations, with amendments for Cr and Hg levels to match the proposed Irish regulation for compost, would ensure that Ireland has some o f the most restrictive regulations in Europe for this application. The delay in completing this piece o f legislation is preventing national energy and waste issues from being resolved in a planned and stepwise fashion. A proposed lay out for the new Integrated Waste from Energy Plant (IW/EP) is presented. Budget economic projections and alternative revenue streams are outlined. Finally a review o f the national policies regarding the Rural Development Plan (RDP), the Rural Planning Guidelines (RPG) and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) are examined against the relevant EU directives...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Interpersonal {{violence}} in South Africa {{is the second}} highest contributor to the burden of disease after HIV/AIDS and 62 % {{is estimated to be}} from intimate partner violence (IPV). This study aimed to evaluate how women experiencing IPV present in primary care, how often IPV is recognized by health care practitioners and what other diagnoses are made. Methods: At two urban and three <b>rural</b> <b>community</b> health <b>centres,</b> health practitioners were trained to screen all women for IPV over a period of up to 8 weeks. Medical records of 114 thus identified women were then examined and their reasons for encounter (RFE) and diagnoses over the previous 2 -years were coded using the International Classification of Primary Care. Three focus group interviews were held with the practitioners and interviews with the facility managers to explore their experience of screening. Results: IPV was previously recognized in 11 women (9. 6 %). Women presented with a variety of RFE that should raise the index of suspicion for IPV- headache, request for psychiatric medication, sleep disturbance, tiredness, assault, feeling anxious and depressed. Depression was the commonest diagnosis. Interviews identified key issues that prevented health practitioners from screening. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that recognition of women with IPV is very low in South African primary care and adds useful new information on how women present to ambulatory health services. These findings offer key cues {{that can be used to}} improve selective case finding for IPV in resource-poor settings. Universal screening was not supported by this study. © 2012 Joyner, Mash...|$|R
