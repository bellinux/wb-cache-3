40|$|What are {{the ethical}} {{implications}} of global poverty for immigration policy? This article finds substantial evidence that migration is effective at reducing poverty. There is every {{indication that the}} adoption of a fairly open immigration policy by rich countries, coupled with selective use of immigration restrictions in cases of deleterious brain drain, could be of significant assistance to people living in poor countries. Empirically {{there is nothing wrong with}} using immigration policy to address poverty. The reason we have to reject such an approach is not empirical but normative. People have human <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in their home country and to migrate elsewhere. Counter poverty measures that require people to move or <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> are likely <b>to</b> violate these <b>rights.</b> Everyone should be free to migrate but no one should be forced to migrate. Using immigration policy to address global poverty, in place of alternatives, fails on both these counts...|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after they}} arrive, {{the group of}} 20 contestants competes in the first Endurance game, called the <b>Right</b> <b>To</b> <b>Stay</b> Challenge. As the name implies, this game {{eliminates}} a group of contestants from continuing any further in the game. The game is normally a test of endurance, where each contestant has {{to hold on to}} something such as a bar or a pole for as long as possible. In Seasons 1 through 4, the first three girls and the first three boys to let go were eliminated. In Season 5, the game was a test of balance and speed, and the last two boys and last two girls to finish the game were eliminated. In Season 6, the first two boys and two girls to let go of a rope were eliminated, winnowing the sixteen hopefuls to twelve contestants who earned the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> forming six teams of players.|$|E
25|$|The {{first team}} to win two rounds wins the {{challenge}} and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the game. The losers are immediately eliminated.

Canada (Minister of Justice) (1991) it was added that Canada should not attract criminals seeking to escape harsher foreign laws. [...] In the case Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca, an extradition of an individual so old that he would probably die in prison, was technically a denial of his <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> return to Canada as well as <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> but it was upheld; likewise, in United States v. Burns, {{it was found}} extradition of Canadian citizens who might {{face the death penalty}} violated section 6 but this was justifiable under section 1, despite arguments that their citizenship and consequent section 6 rights against exile reinforced their rights under section 7 (the rights claimants won their case anyway, but under section 7). [...] Since Canada v. Schmidt, it is indeed <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> fundamental justice under section 7 that are generally used to evaluate whether a particular case of extradition is fair.|$|R

25|$|As of 2010 {{approximately}} 5% of {{the population}} of Macau self-identifies as Christian, predominantly Catholic. Catholic missionaries were the first to arrive in Macau. In 1535, Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau's harbours and to carry out trading activities, though not the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> onshore. Around 1552–1553, they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore, in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water; they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van. In 1576, Pope Gregory XIII established the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau. In 1583, the Portuguese in Macau were permitted to form a Senate to handle various issues concerning their social and economic affairs under strict supervision of the Chinese authority, but there was no transfer of sovereignty. Macau prospered as a port but was the target of repeated failed attempts by the Dutch to conquer it in the 17th century. Cai Gao was the first mainland Chinese convert of the 19th-century Protestant missions. He was baptized by Robert Morrison at Macau in 1814.|$|E

He was ordered imprisoned for one year in 1909 and temporarily refused the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Baku. Upon his release he returned to his native Tugh to continue his education and established contact with prominent scholars of neighbouring Shusha, one of the largest cultural centres of the Caucasus. He returned to Baku in 1914 and was hired as a clerk at the Shibayev and Co. oil company. That same year he joined the Musavat Party and enrolled in an undergraduate technical school. During that period he acquired several languages in addition to those he had already known. By the time of Azerbaijan's independence in 1918 besides his native Azeri Malik-Yeganov was fluent in Russian, German, Persian, Armenian, and Georgian.|$|E

40|$|Taken from Preface] The International Research Project on Job Retention and Return to Work Strategies for Disabled Workers is an {{initiative}} of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Global Applied Research and Information Network on Employment and Training (GLADNET). It reflects ILO and GLADNET joint aims of establishing a base for cross-national research and strengthening links between research analysis and policy reform {{in the field of}} employment of disabled people. The Project is a response to a combination of developments which highlight the need for more effective policies and practices in support of workers whose prospects of remaining in employment are jeopardised by work injury, illness or disability. Persons with disabilities are increasingly claiming <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in work as well as to access employment. Pressures on state budgets, the rising costs of compensation claims and disability benefits, and changes {{in the structure of the}} labour market are strengthening policies in favour of job retention and return to work. Enterprises are developing their own strategies to minimise the costs of disability and to retain valued employees. Overall, the balance of responsibility is shifting from the state to the enterprise...|$|R

25|$|The {{interaction}} of overlapping citizens rights and laws {{has led to}} some cases of exploitation of loopholes to avoid {{the intention of the}} law. For example, the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was required to amend the potential for abuse of the rights of Irish citizenship to the right to abode in the United Kingdom. Before then, Irish citizenship was granted on the basis of jus soli (i.e. being born on the island of Ireland was reason in itself to be considered an Irish citizen). In one case, a Chinese migrant to the UK, living in Wales on Great Britain, chose to give birth to a child in Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland, to take advantage of Irish citizenship laws. Consequently, her child was born an Irish citizen by virtue of jus soli and so was entitled to permanent abode in the UK even though the mother did {{not have the right to}} visit the Republic of Ireland. The mother and father then claimed the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the United Kingdom by virtue of being the guardians of a citizen of the European Union who would be unable to look after itself should they be deported.|$|E
500|$|The Indian Constituent Assembly was {{established}} on 9 December 1946, for drafting a Constitution when India became independent. The Constituent Assembly witnessed fierce debates {{on the language}} issue. The adoption of a National Language, the language in which the Constitution was to be written in and the language in which {{the proceedings of the}} Constituent Assembly were to be conducted were the main linguistic questions debated by the framers of the Constitution. On one side were members from the [...] "Hindi-speaking provinces" [...] like Algu Rai Sastri, R.V. Dhulekar, Balkrishna Sharma, Purushottam Das Tandon, (all from United Provinces), Babunath Gupta (Bihar), Hari Vinayak Pataskar (Bombay) and Ravi Shankar Shukla, Seth Govind Das (Central Provinces and Berar). They moved a large number of pro-Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole National Language. On 10 December 1946, Dhulekar declared [...] "People who do not know Hindustani have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in India. People who are present in the House to fashion a constitution for India and do not know Hindustani are not worthy to be members of this assembly. They had better leave." ...|$|E
500|$|In his judgment, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray {{considered}} Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1968), {{decided by}} the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore's immigration laws {{were similar to those}} in the UK. In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay, for a day longer than the permitted period; and that an alien's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply. Furthermore, in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien's permit to stay [...] "is revoked before the time limit expires, he ought... to be given the opportunity of making representations: for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time". This argument was advanced by Siah's counsel to persuade the court that [...] "an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and, therefore, he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure, if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely". The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an [...] "attractive" [...] one. However, he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had [...] "not been supported by any English authority", and that the position in Singapore is [...] "quite different". He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act, and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal. The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act.|$|E
