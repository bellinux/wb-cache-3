5|$|During {{the fifth}} wave of attacks, two Pakistani {{soldiers}} closed on Singh's position; Singh {{jumped out of}} his trench and killed them with his bayonet, greatly demoralizing the Pakistanis.

5|$|Fort Ricasoli saw {{use during}} the French {{invasion}} of Malta in June 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars. At the time, it was commanded by the Bali de Tillet, and was garrisoned by the Cacciatori, who were a volunteer chasseur light infantry regiment. The fort <b>repelled</b> three French attacks, before surrendering after Grand Master Hompesch officially capitulated to Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|Fort Tigné {{was one of}} the few fortifications that {{actively}} {{tried to}} resist the invasion. On 10 June, the French attempted to capture it in a minor skirmish, but were successfully <b>repelled.</b> The fort also fired its guns in support of a counterattack by the Order's navy against the French, and it prevented French ships from entering Marsamxett.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Notch was an {{engagement}} between United States and North Korean forces {{early in the}} Korean War on August 2, 1950 in southern South Korea.

5|$|A French {{garrison}} of a {{few hundred}} men took over the fort on 12 June. During the subsequent Maltese uprising and insurrection against the French, Maltese insurgents built Għargħar and Sqaq Cappara batteries to bombard Fort Manoel. The Maltese attacked the fort on a number of occasions, and the French retaliated with their own bombardment at least once. On 12 September 1799, a company of French troops from Fort Manoel attempted to silence an insurgent gun position in San Ġwann, but were <b>repelled</b> by the Maltese insurgents.|$|E

5|$|According to Lithuanian {{historian}} Lesčius, {{the first}} Polish assault of about 300 PMO members on August 22 was <b>repelled,</b> {{but the next}} day Lithuanians were forced to retreat towards Lazdijai. Over 100 Lithuanians were imprisoned in Sejny when their commander Bardauskas sided with the Poles. The Polish insurgents also attacked Lazdijai and Kapčiamiestis, towns on the Lithuanian side of the Foch Line.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, 26 April {{marks the}} end of this battle, {{although}} less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April. Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April. By {{the end of}} the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had <b>repelled</b> the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–Doberschütz–Dauban, and was preparing to launch an offensive toward Prague.|$|E
5|$|After the British invasions {{had been}} <b>repelled,</b> Rosas {{and his family}} moved from Buenos Aires to their estancia (ranch). His work there further shaped his {{character}} and outlook {{as part of the}} Platine region's social establishment. In the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these peons, as such workers were called, were gauchos.|$|E

The North Koreans, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were <b>repelled</b> by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E
5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs <b>repelled</b> {{their attacks}} {{multiple}} times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E

5|$|Arriving to Olot, most of Juigné's force took {{positions}} {{inside the}} convent of El Carme, while 90 Swiss {{soldiers of the}} rear entrenched themselves inside the hospital of the village. While the Swiss troops promptly surrendered, {{the bulk of the}} French column, with Juigné himself, still held for two hours. The miquelets and peasants encircled the building and managed to open a gap in its walls, only to be <b>repelled</b> in the hand-to-hand fight, losing two men killed and one wounded. Sala's men then breached the wall of a chapel and stormed the convent again, but as the French were well clustered within, the assault was as well <b>repelled.</b> Sala ordered to set on fire the gates of the building, but the French walled the gap using stones and bricks. The Catalans managed to enter the building by setting on fire large amounts of pitch and sulfur on the two breaches they had opened. The fire and the smoke blinded and choked the French soldiers, which retreated to the convent's cloister. After that, Juigné, seriously wounded during the fight, requested terms and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was <b>repelled</b> by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through {{the lines of the}} rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00, the Germans {{began their}} most {{successful}} {{assault on the}} perimeter, attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks.

Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually <b>repelled</b> the Germans.|$|E
