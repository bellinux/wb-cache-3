5|$|An ineffectual start {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E

5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|After the UFA entered electoral {{politics}} {{and won the}} 1921 election, new premier Herbert Greenfield asked Brownlee to serve as his attorney-general. Brownlee agreed and {{was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election in the riding of Ponoka. As attorney-general, he was an important member of Greenfield's government. He was closely involved in its most important activities, including efforts to better the lot of farmers living in Alberta's drought-ridden south, divest itself of money-losing railways, and win jurisdiction over natural <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the federal government. When a group of UFA backbenchers grew frustrated with Greenfield's weak leadership, they asked Brownlee to replace him. Brownlee eventually agreed, and became premier in 1925.|$|E

25|$|One {{potential}} {{event is}} the reassignment of a <b>resource</b> <b>from</b> one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires {{more resources to}} complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the <b>resource</b> <b>from</b> another activity. Reallocation of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events {{can be used to}} model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.|$|R
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> one command to the other. Such decisions had to be {{made on the basis of}} compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution or program {{at the national level}} which offers technical assistance to the 12,000 rural community organizations. Law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to the departments, but these have not carried out the task in a satisfactory way so far.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to pull British <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the {{observed}} build-up in the Somme, the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps and the 117th Infantry Division attacked an arc of high ground positions, defended by the Canadian Corps. The German forces initially captured the heights at Mount Sorrel and Tor Top before entrenching on the far slope of the ridge. Following a number attacks and counterattacks, two divisions of the Canadian Corps, supported by the 20th Light Division and Second Army siege and howitzer battery groups, recaptured {{the majority of their}} former positions.|$|E

5|$|In {{northern}} France, men {{and resources}} were being marshalled {{in preparation for}} the large British-French Somme Offensive. The build-up in the Somme did not go unnoticed by the German Supreme Army Command. The German Second Army, which was holding the sector north of the Somme, had observed preparations for an offensive since the end of February 1916. Short of resources due to operations at Verdun, the Germans could only mount local operations in an effort to divert British <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the Somme.|$|E

5|$|In the Ohio River valley, the American Revolutionary War {{was fought}} {{primarily}} between American colonists {{south and west}} of the Ohio River (in present-day Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky) and American Indians with their British allies north of the river (now the Midwestern United States). From Detroit, the British recruited and supplied Indian war parties to attack American forts and settlements, hoping to divert American military <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the primary theater {{of war in the}} East as well as keeping the Indians—and the lucrative fur trade—firmly attached to the British Empire. Indians of the Ohio Country, primarily the Shawnee, Mingo, Delaware, and Wyandot, hoped to drive American settlers out of Kentucky and reclaim their hunting grounds, which they had lost in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) and Lord Dunmore's War (1774).|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was cautious about using important agents to pass over the deception.|$|E
5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E

5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{rapid transit}} system {{was seen as}} the quickest, cleanest and {{cheapest}} way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E
