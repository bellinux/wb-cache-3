40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} of image enhancement technique {{is to improve}} the overall performance by optimally arranging input images for afterward processing stages. A fingerprint is the pattern of ridges and valleys on the surface of a fingertip. Each person has unique fingerprints. The uniqueness of a fingerprint is exclusively determined by the local ridge characteristics and their relationships. 150 different local ridge distinctiveness like islands, short ridges, enclosure, etc. have been acknowledged. These local ridge distinctiveness are not evenly distributed. Most of them heavily depends on the impression conditions, quality of fingerprints and are not often observed in fingerprints. The two most prominent local ridge characteristics, called minutiae, are <b>ridge</b> <b>ending</b> and ridge bifurcation. A <b>ridge</b> <b>ending</b> can be defined as the point where a ridge ends sharply. A ridge bifurcation is defined as the point where a ridge forks or diverges into branch ridges. A good quality fingerprint characteristically contain...|$|E

50|$|The {{discomfort}} of following ridgeways arises from {{their exposure to}} harsh weather {{and the fact that}} they are rarely level. The ridge line rises and falls.

A minutia matching is widely used for fingerprint recognition and can be classified as <b>ridge</b> <b>ending</b> and ridge bifurcation.
