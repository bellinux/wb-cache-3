40|$|Abstract – Photovoltaic (PV) {{stand-alone}} applications {{are able to}} provide electricity to isolated loads in remote areas and they are installed particularly where grid extensions would be uneconomical. However, the limitation in power availability of PV systems due to the variability of solar radiation {{requires the use of}} storage systems in order to supply loads with adequate reliability levels. The storage systems have to store a great amount of energy to be maintained for quite long time periods with small losses. This is quite difficult to be achieved by using electrochemical batteries and the use of hydrogen in <b>regenerative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> as a means for energy storage can represent a solution to reach the aforesaid goals. This paper deals with the use of Unitised <b>Regenerative</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cells</b> (URFC) in the realization of stand-alone PV generation systems. The study of the generation system with solar hydrogen storage will be carried out using analytical models to represent the efficiency of each component in order to assess the capability of the generation system to supply its load with an adequate reliability level in terms of Loss Of Load Probability (LOLP). In this perspective, a comparison between different storage technologies such as <b>Regenerative</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cells</b> (RFC) and Unitised <b>Regenerative</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cells</b> will be presented.

40|$|<b>Regenerative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (RFCs) are {{enabling}} {{for many}} weight-critical portable applications, since the packaged specific energy (> 400 Wh/kg) of properly designed lightweight RFC systems is several-fold {{higher than that}} of the lightest weight rechargeable batteries. RFC systems can be rapidly refueled (like primary <b>fuel</b> <b>cells),</b> or can be electrically recharged (like secondary batteries) if a refueling infrastructure is not conveniently available. Higher energy capacity systems with higher performance, reduced weight, and freedom from fueling infrastructure are the features that RFCs promise for portable applications. Reversible proton exchange membrane (PEM) <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> also known as unitized <b>regenerative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (URFCs), or reversible <b>regenerative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> are RFC systems which use reversible PEM cells, where each cell is capable of operating both as a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> and as an electrolyzer. URFCs further economize portable device weight, volume, and complexity by combining the functions of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and electrolyzers in the same hardware, generally without any system performance or efficiency reduction. URFCs are being made in many forms, some of which are already small enough to be portable. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has worked with industrial partners to design, develop, and demonstrate high performance and high cycle life URFC systems.

40|$|A {{bidirectional}} pressure-regulator {{system has}} been devised {{for use in a}} <b>regenerative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system. The bidirectional pressure-regulator acts as a back-pressure regulator as gas flows through the bidirectional pressure-regulator in one direction. Later, the flow of gas goes through the regulator in the opposite direction and the bidirectional pressure-regulator operates as a pressure- reducing pressure regulator. In the <b>regenerative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system, there are two such bidirectional regulators, one for the hydrogen gas and another for the oxygen gas.

Having a single bidirectional regulator replaces two unidirectional regulators, plumbing, and multiple valves needed to reverse the flow direction.
