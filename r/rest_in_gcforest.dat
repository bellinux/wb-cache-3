40|$|<b>Resting</b> <b>in</b> {{an upright}} {{position}} during daytime decreases downbeat nystagmus (DBN). When measured in brightness only, that is, without intermitting exposure to darkness, {{it does not}} make a significant difference whether patients have previously <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> brightness or in darkness. In real-world scenarios, people are often exposed to brightness and darkness intermittently. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze whether <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> brightness or <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> darkness was associated with a lower post-resting DBN after intermitting exposures to brightness and darkness. Eight patients were recorded with three-dimensional video-oculography in brightness and darkness conditions, each following two 2 -h resting intervals under either brightness or darkness resting conditions. The dependent variable was DBN intensity, measured in mean slow phase velocity. A repeated measures ANOVA with the factors measurement condition (brightness vs. darkness), resting condition (brightness vs. darkness), and time (after first vs. second resting interval) showed a significant effect for the factor resting condition, where previous <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> darkness was associated with a significantly lower DBN relative to previous <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> brightness (P < 0. 01). The clinical relevance is to advise patients with DBN to <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> darkness...|$|R
