We consider the torque provided by an external drive and a <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> as control actuators for the system. Closed-loop {{stability in the}} presence of control constraints is studied via the contractive control Lyapunov function method. We solve the nonlinear MPC problem to assess a performance benchmark, and then design a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) MPC approach which is computationally affordable. We show in several numerical simulations based on a realistic centrifugal compressor case study that the SQP MPC technique outperforms the classic linearized MPC and performs similarly to the nonlinear MPC approach. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTutorial 10 A: Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are subject}} to transient events, such as emergency shutdowns, which can cause energetic surge events during rapid shutdown transients. Many modeling tools are used to predict the behavior of compressor systems during fast transient events. Even more, centrifugal compressor dynamic modeling is a valuable assessment tool that can help improve {{the design of the}} compressor anti-surge system to prevent harsh conditions while the unit is coasting down. Modeling of centrifugal compressor transient events requires a detailed evaluation of many system variables to obtain accurate results. Additionally, many parameters should be included and analyzed to adjust the model and obtain acceptable predictions. Those parameters can include <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> characteristics, the controller and actuator, suction and discharge piping volumes, aftercoolers, and operating conditions. Other parameters, such as machine coast down speed and inertia and different control response times will determine if the compressor will reach its surge limit at a detrimental high head condition, avoid it or go through it at low acceptable energy conditions. Many designs use general guidelines to select and plan the compressor anti-surge system and its main components. For example, the <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> type, size and actuation time are key parameters during the shutdown of the compressor unit since they directly affect the amount of flow through the compressor and its reaction time. Other factors are also relevant and should be assessed in detail to assure a proper design to avoid such transient events as a sudden shutdown of a compressor from a full load or high head operating conditions resulting in damaging surge events. In order to refine the simulation approach of the transients in centrifugal compressors, an extensive assessment has been conducted of the main parameters that will affect the modeling predictions. Parameters such as <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> size, type, actuation time, after-cooler volume, friction factors, unit speed coast down predictions, compressor map, isolation valve control, acting time, as well as placement of the discharge check valve influence the modeling predictions considerably. Therefore, parametric studies of some of those variables have helped to refine and adjust the modeling technique while improving the accuracy of the results. Moreover, computational predictions have been compared against high fidelity ? high accuracy data collected in a full scale compressor system. Initial comparisons indicated reasonable results while adjustments in the technique and main assumptions improved the modeling predictions considerably. A generic methodology to improve modeling predictions and main considerations are part of the analysis. In addition, a comparison of the modeling results and experimental data are presented and complemented with parametric studies of different variables. In general, this work should provide guidelines for advancing the modeling of centrifugal compressor transients as well as showing the application of a valuable tool for designing surge control systems for centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|This {{report on}} {{compressor}} anti-surge control closes {{some of the}} gaps related to the significant properties of control strategies. Anti-surge control {{is an important issue}} in operation of e. g. oil and gas processing plants. However, control strategies have not previously been studied thoroughly from a control theoretic viewpoint. Special attention is given to the input-output relationship between <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> opening and control variable when changing the compressor speed. The properties are then validated through simulations. The compression system is found to be open-loop stable for operating points along the surge control line. However, the behaviour of control variable in different points is highly dependent on control strategy. A normalized control variable structure based on a operating point invariant to inlet conditions will perform similarly for a range of compressor speeds. The report also provide greater insight in the dynamics of the compression system, along with guidelines for strategy analysis and synthesis and controller tuning. </p...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 132. The capacity, pressure, {{speed and}} {{horsepower}} of centrifugal compressors have been trending {{higher and higher}} {{in the past few}} years. Not only are machine designers faced with increasing aerodynamic and mechanical problems, but application engineers now have to cope with greater complexity in designing safe, economic control systems. This paper discusses the application of dynamic simulation to centrifugal compressor control system design. Three complex compressor systems which have been designed with the aid of simulation are presented. Two of the compressors are refrigeration units installed in a liquefied natural gas plant. The third is a high pressure gas injection compressor. Each of the units consumes power in the range of 25, 000 to 40, 000 BHP. The simulation studies resulted in design recommendations concerning the number and location of recycles required, sizing of <b>recycle</b> control <b>valves,</b> and set point, gain, and reset settings for control system instrumentation. The studies also led {{to a better understanding of}} how the compressors would interact with processes. Start-up procedures were tested and amended where required.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{greenhouse}} gases that contributes to the current climate change. Its increasing share in the Earth atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperature. To prevent the sea level from rising and increased severity of extreme weather, many governments are now trying to reduce their carbon footprint. One third of the global CO 2 emissions are produced by fossil-fuelled power plants. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is considered one of the leading technologies for reducing these emissions. This thesis is part of investigating the feasibility of the ROAD 2020 project. This project will be one of the worlds first large-scale Monoethanolamine (MEA) -based Post Combustion Capture (PCC) demonstration project with offshore storage. The power plant in this project is designed so that it can rapidly change between full and part load operation. The combination of the resulting fluctuating flow and offshore storage makes compressing the CO 2 a challenging problem. An integrally geared centrifugal compressor train seems the most suited compressor system for a PCC process. However, their operational limitation is their short operating range for compressing CO 2 at high pressures. If not properly controlled, this compressor train can significantly reduce the capture unit efficiency. Moreover, possible flow instabilities like surge, two phase flow and hydrate formation could inflict unrepairable damage to the systems in the PCC process. This thesis investigates the dynamic performance of the integrally geared centrifugal compressor train for a PCC process retrofitted to a coal-fired power plant. The dynamic performance of the compressor train is evaluated for different process configurations which include different compressor control strategies, addition of a well control valve and a single and double compressor train configuration. The figures of merit used to assess the dynamic performance are: compressor work, impact on stripper pressure, occurrence of surge and choke, occurrence of two phase flow. To evaluate these figures of merit a dynamic model of the integrally geared centrifugal compressor train has been successfully developed. The model also includes the transportation pipeline and offshore storage well. The open source Modelica language is used for the development of the dynamic model. The simulations performed with this model give more insight in the performance of the compressor train and its impact on the CO 2 capture process, transportation pipeline and storage well. <b>Recycle</b> <b>valves</b> seem the most suited solution for the compressor train to extend its operating range during minimum load of the power plant. Simulations show that all evaluated process configurations meet the required performance and guarantee a stable filling of the offshore storage well. However, each configuration has a different power consumption, possible process complications and impact on the process capital and operational costs. To propose an optimal process configuration for the ROAD project a further techno-economic investigation is required. Two future research directions can be distinguished to obtain this goal. The first direction should focus on extending the developed dynamic model with a capture unit model. The second direction should focus on the technology gaps that make the integration of MEA-based PCC processes with offshore storage challenging.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Direct Surge Control project {{was to develop a}} new internal method to avoid surge of pipeline compressors. This method will safely expand the range and flexibility of compressor operations, while minimizing wasteful recycle flow {{at the lower end of}} the operating envelope. The approach is to sense the onset of surge with a probe that directly measures re-circulation at the impeller inlet. The signals from the probe are used by a controller to allow operation at low flow conditions without resorting to a predictive method requiring excessive margin to activate a <b>recycle</b> <b>valve.</b> The sensor developed and demonstrated during this project was a simple, rugged, and sensitive drag probe. Experiments conducted in a laboratory compressor clearly showed the effectiveness of the technique. Subsequent field demonstrations indicated that the increase in range without the need to recycle flow was on the order of 19 % to 25 %. The cost benefit of applying the direct surge control technology appears to be as much as $ 120 per hour per compressor for operation without the current level of recycle flow. This could amount to approximately $ 85 million per year for the U. S. Natural Gas Transmission industry, if direct surge control systems are applied to most pipeline centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 118 - 132 Compression systems {{involving}} {{centrifugal compressors}} are designed and operated {{in a manner}} to eliminate or minimize the potential for compressor surge, which is a dynamic instability that is detrimental {{to the integrity of}} the unit. Compressor surge can occur when the compression systems are subjected to rapid transients such as those caused by and emergency shutdown (ESD) or a power failure. Compression systems, like other second-order dynamic systems, are prone to instabilities. These depend on compressor head-flow characteristics of the compressor units as well as the dynamic characteristics of the machinery train and associated piping systems. Parameters such as gas volume capacitance in the recycle path, compressor power train inertia and the <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> capacity, anti-surge valve prestroke and stroke time, and check valve dynamic characteristics are crucial in determining the conditions for dynamic instabilities to occur. Anti-surge control protocols also contribute to potential compressor instabilities particularly when the compressor is operating close to the surge control line. This paper gives an overview concept of the principle of static and dynamic stabilities in a simple compression system involving centrifugal compressors, capacitance, gas inertia, and flow throttling. For a more complex compression system design, involving complex piping geometries akin to those employed in industrial compression system, techniques and methods of determining whether a certain design or an operating mode will lead to instabilities are also formulated and solved. This investigation lead to the notion of a dimensionless inertia number with a threshold value below which a given design is prone to instability during an ESD operation. Data are drawn from over a dozen compressor station of various designs employing different compressor models and drive types, e. g., electric motors or gas turbines. An example is presented to illustrate the concept of instabilities...|$|E
40|$|The need of {{simulation}} models for physical systems {{is essential in}} all phases of its lifetime. During construction better decisions can be made and difficulties discovered. When running observers one can use the model to estimate states. Knowledge {{of the system is}} also needed to develop good control strategies. A compression system without surge avoidance recycling exists, and its mathematical development and simulation model was studied and simulated. Kalman filters were developed in theory, four filters were designed and lastly implemented. A study of industrial solutions for surge avoidance was performed, with attention to practical building, measurements, mathematical modeling and control. The study resulted in three {{simulation models}} for recycling that were fitted to the compressor at hand. Lastly a surge avoidance system was implemented on the model most likely to be built. A good simulation model of the existing compressor is available, and using this three well working Kalman filters were implemented. A fourth filter yielded non-unique and sometimes unstable estimates, and emphasized the importance of retrieving enough information from the measurements to estimate the correct state. All recycle system models used the characteristics of the existing compressor. The solution most likely to be implemented and form basis for a simulation model recycled gas directly downstream of the compressor. The other two models retrieved the recycled gas from the plenum, however this will change the dynamics of the system. These were not considered practical solutions for the specific system. The surge avoidance scheme worked well for production close to the surge line and small set-point changes. It also worked well for large changes in speed, but will surge if the speed becomes too low. The controller scheme did not work well when a large change in plenum throttle occurred, the <b>recycle</b> <b>valve</b> was then too slow. Future work consists of building a recycle loop, develop simulation model and implement surge avoidance scheme for academic purposes. </p...|$|E
40|$|LectureLecture 2 : Many {{facilities}} employ {{two or more}} centrifugal compressors, {{operated in}} either series or parallel configurations. An accurately designed surge control system that includes multiple compressors with the associated piping systems is a vital element of a facility?s design and ongoing operational integrity. The design must ensure compressors are not subjected to damaging fast dynamic events leading to large capital costs and significant down time for operators. Examples of such fast dynamic events are those following emergency shutdown (ESD) or fast stop of one or all compressor units in a station. Typical studies are not accurate enough to capture the complex interactions leading to catastrophic events, especially for complicated system arrangements. This paper introduces three methods of surge control analysis that can be conducted to assess the effectiveness of any surge control system design to prevent the compressor from surge. The first method utilizes the perturbation theory to relate the compressor deceleration and the resulting drop in its flow and head to determine the elapsed time that the compressor can stay out of surge before the surge control system brings about enough positive flow to prevent the unit from undergoing deep surge. The second method is simpler, {{and is based on}} a dimensionless number, called the inertia number, which combines the salient parameters from the dynamic equation between the fluid energy and that of the compressor rotor inertia to determine, as a first cut check, if the surge control system is adequate. The third method, which is always recommended, and is based on solving the full gas dynamic partial differential equations (PDEs) in spatial and temporal domain, which describe the true dynamic characteristics of the flow through the various piping elements, the compressor itself, to provide much more accurate predictions of surge control system behavior during fast transient events. Comparisons are made to field measurements to provide model validations, and an example application (Case Study) of three units operating in parallel. The first two (Units 6 and 7) were existing in a compressor station, while the third (Unit 8) was an add-on. The addition of Unit 8 meant a number of station layout modifications, which included: re-wheeling of Units 6 and 7 (i. e., change the compressor impellers); adding after gas cooling; and relocating the anti-surge valves downstream of the coolers to allow for both hot (fast stop) and cold recycle (anti-surge) capabilities. Due to the addition of equipment and significant reconfiguration of station piping and valves, a dynamic surge analysis on Units 6, 7, and 8 was required to determine whether the existing anti-surge and fast stop valves were adequately sized and whether the anti-surge valves could be relocated downstream of the gas coolers. A new fast stop recycle system was added along with Unit 8, which also needed to be adequately sized. Further complications arose from the fact that Unit 6 ?s anti-surge valve configuration differs from that of Unit 7 and that Unit 6 has twin <b>recycle</b> <b>valves</b> jointly serving as anti-surge valves with a single fast stop valve while Unit 7 has a single anti-surge valve and a single fast stop valve...|$|R
