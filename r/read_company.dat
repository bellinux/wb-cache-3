5000|$|In 1857, David M. Read and W. B. Hall {{opened a}} dry goods and carpet store on Main Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut, with Read going solo in 1877. In 1885, the {{business}} expanded to two buildings on Main Street and Fairfield Avenue forming a [...] "very popular and elegant place of business." [...] Read's became {{known for its}} classy, upscale merchandise and shopping environment, becoming New England's largest department store. In 1926, Read's moved {{to the corner of}} Broad and John Streets in downtown Bridgeport, where its flagship store ultimately had over 100000 sq ft of selling area on five floors. D.M. <b>Read</b> <b>Company</b> became a unit of Allied Stores in 1954.Allied expanded the store into a chain in the 1950s and 1960s.

5000|$|Financial {{analysts are}} often {{employed}} by mutual and pension funds, hedge funds, securities firms, banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and other businesses, helping these companies or their clients make investment decisions. Financial analysts employed in commercial lending perform [...] "balance sheet analysis," [...] examining the audited financial statements and corollary data {{in order to}} assess lending risks. In a stock brokerage house or in an investment bank, they <b>read</b> <b>company</b> financial statements and analyze commodity prices, sales, costs, expenses, and tax rates in order to determine a company's value and project future earnings. In any of these various institutions, the analyst often meets with company officials to gain a better insight into a company's prospects and to determine the company's managerial effectiveness. Usually, financial analysts study an entire industry, assessing current trends in business practices, products, and industry competition. They must keep abreast of new regulations or policies that may affect the industry, as well as monitor the economy to determine its effect on earnings.|$|E
30|$|Web-based surveys, such as WageIndicator and Glassdoor, {{have already}} been {{introduced}} in the first sections of this article. In this section, we present Glassdoor (www.glassdoor.com), a popular career community website that was first launched in 2008. Although the website operates as a job board, Glassdoor goes beyond traditional job portals as the company also targets employers, recruiters, career centres and libraries. The company is US-based and managed to develop {{into one of the}} largest websites there, and its user base is rapidly expanding towards a more global audience. In fact, Glassdoor currently has over 30 million members in over 190 countries worldwide. The Glassdoor website is organised into six categories. The first four categories are oriented towards job seekers and employees (who are invited to post their resume), while the last two target firms and recruitment agencies. The first out of the six categories is “jobs”. Similarly to the traditional portals, Glassdoor functions as a job board on which millions of vacancies are listed. Job seekers can browse through these job openings to discover which firms are hiring and which positions are available. On the website, job seekers have the opportunity to look for positions by location, title, occupation or keywords. Glassdoor also presents them with a list of popular and related searches. The second category is “companies”. Job seekers can look for firms in a specific location and are redirected to a detailed company page when they select a firm. On a company page, job seekers can upload or <b>read</b> <b>company</b> reviews, find CEO approval ratings, discover the salaries that the firm offers for specific roles, ask questions to current or former employees, find office photos and other information, read interview tips and so on. 3 One of the innovative features of Glassdoor is that all this information is provided by firms’ former or current employees. The website covers over 400, 000 firms worldwide. To write a company review, users need to have an account. Users are only allowed to write one review per firm worked at per year. Reviews are published anonymously. Firms have no information on the identity of the employee that posted the review and cannot manipulate or remove reviews. Before a review is published, it has to be approved by Glassdoor. Reviews that do not meet the guidelines are not published (e.g. reviews should be balanced, cannot disclose trade secrets). Employers can respond to reviews and flag reviews that do not meet the guidelines, are inappropriate or fraudulent. The third category on Glassdoor is “salaries”, which can be viewed for specific positions. The fourth category targeted towards job seekers is “interview”. Job seekers can find information on the interview style, level of difficulty and sample questions. Since much of the information provided on the Glassdoor is provided by former and current employees, the site clearly has a “web survey” dimension.|$|E
