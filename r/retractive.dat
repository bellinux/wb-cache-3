The spaces between the cords and spire and base are narrow, marked by numerous, decidedly <b>retractive</b> axial threads. The sutures are well impressed. The aperture is broadly oval, somewhat effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is strong, decidedly reflected anteriorly, reinforced by the base. It is provided with a small fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a faint callus.|$|E
