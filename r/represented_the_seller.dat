5000|$|An {{exclusive}} buyer agent (EBA) is a U.S. {{real estate}} firm (or an agent or broker who works in such a company) that represents only buyers of real estate. EBA firms never take listings and, therefore, never <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> in a real estate transaction.|$|R
50|$|A buyer {{brokerage}} or buyer {{agency is}} {{the practice of}} real estate brokers and their agents representing a buyer in a real estate transaction rather than, by default, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> either directly or as a sub-agent. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the most common term is buying agent.|$|R
50|$|The broker {{is given}} the {{exclusive}} right to market <b>the</b> property and <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> exclusively. This {{is referred to as}} <b>seller</b> agency. However, <b>the</b> brokerage also offers to cooperate with other brokers and agrees to allow them to show the property to prospective buyers and offers a share of the total real estate commission.|$|R
5000|$|An EBB or {{associated}} broker {{does not}} take or hold listings or <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> or landlord in any way, nor do the agents working under or for him/her. This includes advertising [...] "for sale by owner" [...] properties. In many states, by law, the broker, or agent must have a written agency agreement to <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> buyer exclusively. Without one, the broker or agent may be working for <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> or in a limited capacity.|$|R
50|$|Buyer {{agency can}} exist {{exclusively}} (where a brokerage firm chooses to only represent buyers and never sellers, as an exclusive buyer agent) or, in a full-service company, by offering buyer agency to buyers who become clients. Buyers {{would have to}} agree to some form of dual agency in the event that they wished to buy a home which that company has listed for sale and for which it <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b>|$|R
40|$|We study {{scenarios}} where multiple {{sellers of}} a homogeneous good compete on prices, where each seller can only sell to some subset of <b>the</b> buyers. Crucially, <b>sellers</b> cannot price-discriminate between buyers. We model {{the structure of}} the competition by a graph (or hyper-graph), with nodes <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> and edges <b>representing</b> populations of buyers. We study equilibria in the game between <b>the</b> <b>sellers,</b> prove that they always exist, and present various structural, quantitative, and computational results about them. We also analyze the equilibria completely for a few cases. Many questions are left open...|$|R
50|$|Dual agency {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> same {{brokerage}} <b>represents</b> both <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> and <b>the</b> buyer under written agreements. Individual state laws vary and interpret dual agency rather differently.|$|R

5000|$|In Britain {{until the}} early 1990s, agents {{involved}} in a property transaction worked for <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> as Estate agents. Now, property finders exist to <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> interests of the buyer or tenant. Today in the United States where fiduciary obligations exist, if the buyer is working with a broker other than <b>the</b> brokerage which <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> by [...] "listing" [...] the property for sale, he may choose {{to enter into a}} buyer brokerage agreement to be represented. (In some cases where dual agency is permitted by law, even the listing broker may <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> buyer). If the buyer does not enter into this agreement, he/she remains as a customer of the broker, who is then <b>the</b> sub-agent of <b>seller's</b> broker.

Simultaneously, the users choose from which satellite to buy the requested bandwidth trying to maximize their efficiency. Therefore, the initial problem of bandwidth allocation is modeled as a multiple buyer- multiple <b>seller</b> game where <b>the</b> satellites <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> and <b>the</b> users <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> buyers of the game. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|A yacht broker is a {{specialist}} who serves yacht or boat sellers and/or buyers {{as a representative}} for the sale or purchase of a yacht or boat. The yacht broker is paid an agreed commission by <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> to market <b>the</b> yacht for sale, field interest and inquiries from buyers, handle negotiations, attend inspection and water trial and ultimately, if successful, to attend delivery. A buyer's broker may assist their client in locating and qualifying a vessel and assisting with purchase negotiations but is typically not paid a commission by buyer and instead shares in the commission paid by <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> to their broker. These two roles {{are referred to as}} Listing Broker (<b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> and vessel) and Selling Broker (representing buyer).|$|R
40|$|Information marketplaces {{are places}} where users search and {{retrieve}} information goods. Intelligent agents could <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> participating entities in such places, i. e, {{assume the role of}} buyers and sellers of information products. In this paper, we introduce a finite horizon bargaining model between buyers and <b>sellers.</b> We examine <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> side and define a method for the 'bargaining' deadline calculation based on fuzzy-logic (FL). Such deadline indicates the time for which it is profitable for a seller to participate in the bargaining procedure, i. e., the time threshold for his offers. We <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> knowledge/policy adopting <b>the</b> fuzzy set theory and provide a fuzzy inference engine for reasoning about the bargaining deadline. The result of the reasoning process defines the degree of patience of <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> agent, thus, affecting the time for which that <b>seller</b> participates in <b>the</b> bargaining game...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the broker}} is helping both the buyer and <b>the</b> <b>seller,</b> this is {{referred}} to as a [...] "dual agency". Traditionally, <b>the</b> broker <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller,</b> and his fiduciary duty is to <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> If <b>the</b> broker suggests to the buyer that he will help the buyer negotiate the best price, the broker is practicing [...] "undisclosed dual agency," [...] which is unethical and illegal in all states. Under a dual agency transaction, it is vital that the broker disclose to both parties whom he represents as a client and whom he represents as a customer. A real estate broker owes his client fiduciary duties, which include care, confidentiality, loyalty, obedience, accounting, and disclosure. To protect his license to practice, a real estate broker owes his customer fair and honest dealing and must request that both parties (seller and buyer) sign a dual agency agreement.|$|R
50|$|Brokers {{also can}} furnish market {{information}} regarding prices, products, and market conditions. Brokers may <b>represent</b> either <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> (90% of <b>the</b> time) or the buyer (10%) but not {{both at the}} same time. An example would be a stockbroker, who makes the sale or purchase of securities on behalf of his client. Brokers play a huge role in the sale of stocks, bonds, and other financial services.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conveyancing}} {{process in}} the United States varies {{from state to state}} depending on local legal requirements and historical practice. In rare situations, the parties will engage in a formal [...] "closing." [...] In a formal closing three attorneys will be involved in the process: one each to <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> buyer, <b>seller,</b> and mortgage holder; frequently all three will sit around a table with <b>the</b> buyer and <b>seller</b> and literally [...] "pass papers" [...] to effect the transaction.|$|R
5000|$|Semantic role labeling, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} shallow semantic parsing, {{is a task}} in natural language processing consisting of the detection of the semantic arguments associated with the predicate or verb of a sentence and their classification into their specific roles. For example, given a sentence like [...] "Mary sold the book to John", the task would be to recognize the verb [...] "to sell" [...] as <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> predicate, [...] "Mary" [...] as <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> (agent), [...] "the book" [...] as <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> goods (theme), and [...] "John" [...] as <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> recipient. This {{is an important step}} towards making sense of the meaning of a sentence. A semantic analysis of this sort is at a lower-level of abstraction than a syntax tree, i.e. it has more categories, thus groups fewer clauses in each category. For instance, [...] "the book belongs to me" [...] would need two labels such as [...] "possessed" [...] and [...] "possessor" [...] whereas [...] "the book was sold to John" [...] would need two other labels such as [...] "goal" [...] (or [...] "theme") and [...] "receiver" [...] (or [...] "recipient") even though these two clauses would be very similar as far as [...] "subject" [...] and [...] "object" [...] functions are concerned.|$|R
40|$|Game-theoretic {{models of}} {{bargaining}} are typically {{based on the}} assumption that players have perfect rationality and that they always play an equilibrium strategy. In contrast research research in experimental economics shows that in bargaining between human subjects, participants do not always play the equilibrium strategy. Such agents are said to be boundedly rational. In playing a game against a boundedly rational opponent, a player’s most effective strategy is not the equilibrium strategy, but the one that is the best reply to the opponent’s actual strategy. Against this background, this paper studies the bargaining behaviour of boundedly rational agents byusing genetic algorithms. Since bargaining involves players with different utility functions, we have two subpopulations - one <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> buyer, and <b>the</b> other <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> (i. e., <b>the</b> population is asymmetric). We study the competitive co-evolution of strategies in the two subpopulations for an incomplete information setting, and compare the results with those prescribed by game theory. Our analysis leads to two main conclusions. Firstly, our study shows that although each agent in the game-theoretic model has a strategy that is dominant at every period at which it makes a move, the stable state of the evolutionary model does not always match the game-theoretic equilibrium outcome. secondly, as the players mutually adapt to each other’s strategy, the stable outcome depends on the initial population...|$|R
40|$|This paper characterizes all {{equilibrium}} reserve prices set by 2 sellers auctioning horizontally di¤erentiated items. When <b>sellers</b> co-operate, <b>the</b> weakest bidder(s) gets no rents.

5000|$|Before the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) was {{introduced}} in 1967, when brokers (and their licensees) only <b>represented</b> <b>sellers,</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "real estate salesperson" [...] {{may have been more}} appropriate than it is today, given the various ways that brokers and licensees now help buyers through the process rather than merely [...] "selling" [...] them a property.

50|$|Curtom {{was owned}} by Curtis Mayfield, and the label began {{recording}} Chicago soul talent in 1968. <b>The</b> label better <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> post-soul era in Chicago black music, as it specialized in funk and disco recordings, and became a notable producer of soundtracks for black films. Mayfield became a solo artist while at Curtom, and his Super Fly soundtrack (1972), with its funk style, <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> label's biggest <b>seller.</b> Other Curtom artists were disco singer Linda Clifford ("Runaway Love"), the Natural Four ("Can This Be Real"), and the Staple Singers ("Let's Do It Again"). Predating Curtom, Mayfield ran the labels Windy C (Five Stairsteps, Holly Maxwell, June Conquest), and Mayfield (Fascinations, The Mayfield Singers) (which featured two future soul stars: Donny Hathaway and Leroy Hutson, and Holly Maxwell).|$|R
5000|$|The Listing Agent/Broker owes <b>the</b> <b>Seller</b> full {{duties as}} her fiduciary, {{including}} honesty, loyalty, dedication to purpose, acting in <b>the</b> <b>Seller's</b> best interests, etc., {{in exchange for}} <b>the</b> <b>Seller's</b> agreement to allow the Agent/Broker to sell the property and earn a commission.

5000|$|At one time, all {{real estate}} brokers and agents, or Realtors, practiced [...] "single agency," [...] meaning they <b>represented</b> only <b>the</b> buyer or <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> In <b>the</b> 1990s, {{the concept of}} buyer agency became popular, {{allowing}} a buyer to retain an agent who would <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> {{best interests of the}} buyer alone. The first national company to provide this service was The Buyer's Agent, Inc. A 2008 study by Consumer Reports indicates that prior to this development, a Realtor was presumed by state law to be working for <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> <b>The</b> same study shows that buyers using buyer agents obtained a savings of $5000 in the price of the home as compared to prices paid by unrepresented buyers. It remains true that an unrepresented real estate buyer can still call <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> agent to arrange a showing of the property. In such cases, the buyer should be advised by Agency Disclosure Laws (a state law in every state in the U.S.) that any information obtained, as well as all conversations and negotiations undertaken, will be for the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A naked put (also {{called an}} [...] {{uncovered}} put [...] ) is a put option contract where the option writer (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>seller)</b> {{does not hold}} the underlying position, {{in this case a}} short equity position, to cover the contract in case of assignment. <b>The</b> <b>seller</b> receives <b>the</b> premium cost of the put price, and hopes that the underlying equity or stock price stays the same or rises modestly, in which case <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> retains <b>the</b> premium.
