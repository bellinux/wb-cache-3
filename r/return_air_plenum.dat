40|$|Lighting {{accounts}} for approximately 54 % {{of the annual}} energy consumption of office buildings, and can effectively be reduced through daylighting. The simplest way to provide day lighting into a typical office space has been to use unilateral sidelighting. Discomfort and visibility glare from unilateral sidelighting cause the occupant to close drapes or blinds and turn on luminaries, resulting in an inefficient use of daylighting. One daylighting concept that has been developed to alleviate this problem is the light plenum. A light plenum can be added economically to an office space by using a hung ceiling simultaneously as a <b>return</b> <b>air</b> and light <b>plenum.</b> The appropriate opaque ceiling panels could be replaced with transparent ones to get the light {{to the rear of}} the space. The question is how much light can be expected to be transferred {{to the rear of the}} room and how different plenum opening configurations would affect those light levels. The result simply that a hung ceiling light plenum can provide adequate light to the rear of the room to balance the high brightness ratios created by unilateral sidelighting.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{interaction}} between the fluidized-bed dynamics and the pressure and flow pulsations from the air-supply system. The interaction has been identified as a key process to understand in order to correctly formulate inlet boundary conditions in numerical modelling of fluidized beds, operated under industrial conditions. The interaction between pressure waves, resulting from bubble activities in the bed, with pressure and flow pulsations from the air-supply system is recognized as a main mechanism that gives rise to formation of a coupled system, consisting of fluidized bed, <b>air</b> <b>plenum,</b> pipe(s), flow control devices and fan. The interaction between the bed and its air-supply system is studied experimentally, analytically and numerically. The experiments have been performed in a 1 / 9 th scale model of the 12 MW Chalmers research boiler and in a larger cold circulating fluidized bed unit. Simultaneous measurements have been carried out of pressure fluctuations in the bed and in the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> and of flow fluctuations in the air-supply ducts. In the scale model, bubble dynamics have been measured by an optical probe. The interaction is shown to depend on the configuration of the air-supply system, such as lengths of pipes, characteristics of fluidizing fan and location of flow control devices. A general model of the response of the fluidized bed to disturbances has been formulated, and the information provided by the model with respect to the dynamics of the bed, the bed plus the <b>air</b> <b>plenum,</b> and the bed plus the entire air-supply system, has been investigated. Different modes of bubble flow, responsible for the creation of pressure waves in the bed, have been studied in the time-frequency plane (wavelet analysis), aiming at localizing the phenomena of interest in time. A robust time series analysis method for evaluating and quantifying the bed dynamics (from measurements of fluctuations of pressure in the bed and of local solids concentration) has been obtained. The method is shown to be applicable in cases where, for various reasons, long data records may not be available. A model of the air-supply system has been coupled with three-dimensional numerical simulations of the flow field in the bed and the <b>air</b> <b>plenum.</b> It is shown that the assumption of a spatially uniform inlet condition of the gas flow over the air distributor, assumed in most previous fluidized-bed studies, is not appropriate...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the NOx {{emissions}} of heavy duty gas turbines have been significantly reduced by introducing lean premixed combustion. However, these flames {{are known to}} be prone to combustion instabilities, which became the key issue of modern gas turbine combustion research. In this paper, investigations of a single model gas turbine burner are presented with special focus on thermo-acoustic eigenmodes of the combustor and the resulting interaction between periodic flow field oscillations and flame front fluctuations. A numerical analysis of the eigenmodes of the combustor rig was preformed and compared to pressure probe measurements. By the numerical analysis Helmholtz mode pressure oscillations were predicted to be present in the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> upstream the burner {{as well as in the}} combustion chamber. These oscillation modes could well be confirmed by the analysis of the pressure signals taken at different position within the combustor rig. By these pressure oscillations thermo-acoustic flame instabilities are triggered. Due to a phase lag between the pressure oscillations in the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> and those in the combustion chamber, fluctuations of air flow through the burner are induced, which in turn cause fluctuations of the equivalence ratio at the burner exit plane. As result, fluctuations of the heat release rate within the flame are established, which interfere with the acoustics of the rig and, thus, unstable combustion is maintained.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a gas turbine {{is strongly dependent on}} the flow field inside the combustion system. In the primary zone, the air jets can improve the recirculation of hot products promoted by the break-down of the rotating fuel/air mixture exiting from the swirler. This recirculation stabilizes the flame and completes the fuel oxidation. Moreover, the mixing process in the dilution zone allows to obtain the outlet temperature profile maximizing turbine durability. This paper presents an experimental and computational fluid dynamics analysis of both the isothermal and the reactive flow field inside a heavy-duty gas turbine combustor designed to be fed with a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (up to 100 % of either one). The whole combustor domain comprising the <b>air</b> <b>plenum,</b> the annulus and the hot flow discharge is considered. The study aims at evaluating the capability of a coarse grid CFD model, already validated in previous full-load thermal calculations, in predicting the flow field. An experimental campaign was performed on an isothermal flow test rig to investigate combustion air splitting and the penetration of both primary and dilution air jets. The experimental data are compared with the results of the isothermal flow calculations to complete model validation. Then, reactive numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the impact of combustion on the flow field and to discuss the influence of the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> on the features of the air jets...|$|R

According to the similarity theory, it is concluded that the similarity criterion numbers applied here are Reynolds number (Re) and Archimedes number (Ar) for designation of experiment rig size, choosing device type, and confirming experiment condition. In the designation of key components of experiment rig, the application of automation control makes brine recovery and recycling in the process; designation of electrical control system makes a centralized control of experiment start–stop and the adjustment of the pipeline flow, realizing automation in the whole experiment process.

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the <b>returned</b> <b>air.</b> This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio, three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The <b>return</b> <b>air</b> in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography.
