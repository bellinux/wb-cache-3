5000|$|For {{installing}} a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> under a metal or tile roof, the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> may be applied {{directly over the}} roof sheathing. Then furring strips (1x4s) are applied over the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> before the metal or tile roof is applied. The furring strips ensure that the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> faces into a sufficient air space. If an air space is not present or is too small, heat {{may be able to}} conduct through the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier.</b> Since the metal in the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is highly conductive, the heat transfer would be by conduction and the heat would not be blocked. According to the US Department of Energy, “Reflective insulation and <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> products must have an air space adjacent to the reflective material to be effective.” ...|$|E
50|$|When {{laying a}} <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> over the {{insulation}} on the attic floor, {{it is possible}} for dust to accumulate on the top side. Many factors like dust particle size, dust composition and the amount of ventilation in the attic affect how dust accumulates and thus the ultimate performance of <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> in the attic. A study by the Tennessee Valley Authority mechanically applied a small amount of dust over a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> and found no significant effect when testing for performance. However, TVA referenced a previous study which stated that it was possible for the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> to collect so much dust that its reflectivity could be decreased by nearly half.It is not true that a double-sided <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> on the attic floor is immune to the dust concern. The TVA study also tested a double-sided <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> with black plastic draped on top to simulate heavy dust accumulation, as well as a single-sided <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> with heavy kraft paper on the top. The test indicated that the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> was not performing, and the small air spaces created between the peaks of the insulation were not sufficient to block radiant heat.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method of}} {{applying}} <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> {{to the roof}} in new construction {{is to use a}} <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> that is pre-laminated to OSB panels or roof sheathing. Manufacturers of this installation method often tout the savings in labor costs in using a product that serves as roof decking and <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> in one.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> (also {{known as}} {{reflective}} insulation) are {{a type of}} thermal (heat) insulations that prevents heat transfer by thermal radiation. Thermal energy may also be transferred via conduction or convection, however, and <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> do not necessarily protect against heat transfer via conduction (without airspace facing the heat source) or convection (perforated).|$|R

5000|$|To apply <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> in an {{existing}} attic, a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> may be stapled to {{the underside of}} the roof rafters. This method offers the same benefits as the draped method in that dual air spaces are provided. However, it is essential that the vents be allowed to remain open to prevent moisture from being trapped in the attic. In general, it is preferred to have the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> applied to {{the underside of the}} roof with an air space facing down to prevent the accumulation of dust, preventing the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> from conducting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is as a facing for attics. For a traditional shingle roof, radiant barriers may be applied over the rafters or trusses and under the roof decking. This application method has the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> sheets draped over the trusses of rafters, creating a small air space above with the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> facing into the entire interior attic space below.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{method of}} {{installing}} a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> in an attic is to lay {{it over the}} top of the insulation on the attic floor. While this method can be more effective in the winter there are a few potential concerns with this application, which the US Department of Energy [...] and the Reflective Insulation Manufacturers Association International feel the need to address. First, a breathable <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> should always be used here. This is usually achieved by small perforations in the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> foil. The vapor transmission rate of the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> should be at least 5 perms, as measured with ASTM E96, and the moisture in the insulation should be checked before installation. Second, the product should meet the required flame spread, which includes ASTM E84 with the ASTM E2599 method. Lastly, this method allows for dust to accumulate over the top surface of the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier,</b> potentially reducing the efficiency over time.|$|E
50|$|Radiance or {{spectral}} radiance are {{measures of the}} quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. <b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> are materials that reflect radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good insulators are not necessarily good <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers,</b> and vice versa. Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> can {{function}} as a vapor barriers and serve both purposes with one product.|$|R
50|$|A film of dirt or {{moisture}} {{can alter}} the emissivity and hence the performance of <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|One common {{misconception}} regarding <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is {{that the}} heat reflecting off the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> back to the roof {{has the potential to}} increase the roof temperature and possibly damage the shingles. Performance testing by Florida Solar Energy Center demonstrated that the increase in temperature at the hottest part of the day was no more than about 5 degrees F. In fact, this study showed that <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> had the potential to decrease the roof temperature once the sun went down because it prevented heat loss through the roof. RIMA International wrote a technical paper on the subject which included statements collected from large roofing manufacturers, and none said that <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> would in any way affect the warranty of the shingles.|$|E
5000|$|In 1925, two German {{businessmen}} Schmidt and Dykerhoff {{filed for}} patents on reflective surfaces {{for use as}} building insulation because recent improvements in technology allowed low emissivity aluminum foil to be commercially viable. This became the launching pad for <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> and reflective insulation around the world, and within the next 15 years, millions of square feet of <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> were installed in the US alone.Within 30 years, <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> was making a name for itself, and was included in projects at MIT, Princeton, and Frank Sinatra’s residence in Palm Springs, California.|$|E

50|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> {{may be used}} as a vented {{skin around}} the {{exterior}} of a wall. Furring strips are applied to the sheathing to create a vented air space between the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> and the siding, and vents are used at the top and bottom to allow convective heat to rise naturally to the attic. If brick is being used on the exterior, then a vented air space may already be present, and furring strips are not necessary. Wrapping a house with <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> can result in a 10% to 20% reduction in the tonnage air conditioning system requirement, and save both energy and construction costs.|$|E

50|$|For the Apollo program, NASA {{helped develop}} a thin {{aluminum}} foil that reflected 95% of the radiant heat. A metalized film {{was used to}} protect spacecraft, equipment, and astronauts from thermal radiation or to retain heat in the extreme temperature fluctuations of space. The aluminum was vacuum-coated to a thin film and applied {{to the base of}} the Apollo landing vehicles. It was also used in numerous other NASA projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and Skylab. In the vacuum of space where temperatures can range from 250°F above to 400°F below zero, heat transfer is only by radiation, so a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is much more effective than it is on earth, where 5% to 45% of the heat transfer can still occur via convection and conduction, even when an effective <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is deployed. <b>Radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is a Space Foundation Certified Space Technology(TM). <b>Radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> was inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
40|$|This paper gives {{a summary}} of the efforts at ORNL in {{modeling}} residential attics with <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers.</b> Analytical models based on a system of macroscopic heat balances have been developed. Separate models have been developed for horizontal <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> laid on top of the insulation, and for <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> attached {{to the bottom of the}} top chords of the attic trusses. The models include features such as a radiation interchange analysis within the attic space, convective coupling with the ventilation air, and sorption/desorption of moisture at surfaces facing the attic enclosure. The paper gives details of the models and the engineering assumptions that were made in their development. The paper also reports on the status of efforts that are underway to verify the models by comparing their predictions with the results of laboratory and field tests on residential attics and test cells, both with and without <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers.</b> Comparisons are given for a number of selected sets of experimental data. Suggestions are given for needed model refinements and additional experimental data. Plans for utilization of the models for extrapolation to seasonal and annual performance in a variety of climatic conditions are also described...|$|R
50|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> work in {{conjunction}} with an air space to reduce radiant heat transfer across the air space. Radiant or reflective insulation reflects heat instead of either absorbing it or letting it pass through. <b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> are often seen used in reducing downward heat flow, because upward heat flow tends {{to be dominated by}} convection. This means that for attics, ceilings, and roofs, they are most effective in hot climates.They also have a role in reducing heat losses in cool climates. However, much greater insulation can be achieved through the addition of bulk insulators (see above).|$|R
50|$|Unlike bulk insulators, <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> resist {{conducted}} heat poorly. Materials such as reflective foil {{have a high}} {{thermal conductivity}} and would function poorly as a conductive insulator.Radiant barriers retard heat transfer by two means - by reflecting radiant energy away from its surface or by reducing the emission of radiation from its opposite side.|$|R
50|$|This is {{different}} from the cool roof strategy which reflects solar energy before it heats the roof, but both are means of reducing radiant heat. According to a study by Florida Solar Energy Center, a white tile or white metal cool roof can outperform traditional black shingle roof with a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> in the attic, but the black shingle roof with <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> outperformed the red tile cool roof.|$|E
50|$|When radiant {{solar energy}} strikes a roof, heating the shingles, felt paper and roof {{sheathing}} by conduction, it causes {{the underside of}} the sheathing and the roof framing to radiate heat downward through the attic toward the attic floor. When a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> is placed between the roofing material and the insulation on the attic floor, much of the heat radiated from the hot roof is reflected back toward the roof and the low emissivity of {{the underside of the}} <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> means that very little radiant heat is emitted downwards. This makes the top surface of the insulation cooler {{than it would have been}} without a <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> and thus reduces the amount of heat that moves through the insulation into the rooms below.|$|E
5000|$|Interior Radiation Control Coating Systems (IRCCS), {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings, are paints designed to provide thermal insulation to buildings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> {{may or may}} not exhibit high visual {{reflectivity}}. While reflectivity and emissivity must sum to 1 at a given wavelength, reflectivity at one set of wavelengths (visible) and emissivity at {{a different}} set of wavelengths (thermal) do not necessarily sum to 1. Therefore, it is possible to create visibly dark colored surfaces with low thermal emissivity.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{emissivity}} values {{probably best}} reflect {{the effectiveness of}} <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers.</b> Some manufacturers quote an 'equivalent' R-value for these products but these figures {{can be difficult to}} interpret, or even misleading, since R-value testing measures total heat loss in a laboratory setting and does not control the type of heat loss responsible for the net result (radiation, conduction, convection).|$|R
50|$|In hot conditions, the {{greatest}} {{source of heat}} energy is solar radiation. This can enter buildings directly through windows or it can heat the building shell to a higher temperature than the ambient, increasing the heat transfer through the building envelope. The Solar Heat Gain Co-efficient (SHGC) (a measure of solar heat transmittance) of standard single glazing can be around 78-85%. Solar gain can be reduced by adequate shading from the sun, light coloured roofing, spectrally selective (heat-reflective) paints and coatings and various types of insulation {{for the rest of}} the envelope. Specially coated glazing can reduce SHGC to around 10%. <b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> are highlyeffective for attic spaces in hot climates. In this application, they are much more effective in hot climates than cold climates. For downward heat flow, convection is weak and radiation dominates heat transfer across an air space. <b>Radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> must face an adequate air-gap to be effective.|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Reflective Insulation (<b>Radiant</b> <b>Barrier)</b> is commonly {{evaluated by the}} Reflectivity (Emittance) of the surface with airspace facing to the heat source.|$|E
50|$|Calculating the {{performance}} of radiant barriers is more complex. With a good <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> in place, most heat flow is by convection, which depends on many factors other than the <b>radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> itself. Although radiant barriers have high reflectivity (and low emissivity) over a range of electromagnetic spectra (including visible and UV light), their thermal advantages are mainly related to their emissivity in the infra-red range. Emissivity values are the appropriate metric for radiant barriers. Their effectiveness when employed to resist heat gain in limited applications is established,even though R-value does not adequately describe them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>barrier</b> (or reflective) {{insulation}} is heat/thermal insulation {{which reflects}} radiation heat (radiant heat), preventing transfer {{from one side}} to another due to a reflective (or low emittance) surface.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>radiant</b> <b>barriers</b> are spectrally {{selective}} {{and will}} preferentially reduce {{the flow of}} infra-red radiation in comparison to other wavelengths. For instance low-emissivity (low-e) windows will transmit light and short-wave infra-red energy into a building but reflect the long-wave infra-red radiation generated by interior furnishings. Similarly, special heat-reflective paints are able to reflect more heat than visible light, or vice versa.|$|R
40|$|With today’s {{emphasis}} on sustainable building construction, insulation systems {{are an important}} part of controlling heat loss or gain which directly impacts a building’s energy requirements.
