5|$|On 10 January 1913, Asar-i Tevfik {{supported}} another sortie by the fleet, {{this time}} patrolling off the Dardanelles {{while the rest}} of the fleet raided Imbros. While protecting the fleet's flank, she encountered Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw after firing a few shots. Neither side scored any hits in the engagement. The ship was lost while operating in the Black Sea against Bulgarian forces. On 7 February, the ship was ordered to proceed to Yalıköy to support a raid by the Army. The following day, the raid was launched on the town, but was quickly forced to withdraw from heavy Bulgarian resistance; Asar-i Tevfik was ordered to move in and shell the town, but ran aground on an uncharted sandbank at 12:45. On 10 February, salvage work began, beginning with the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> By the 12th, all armament and coal had been removed, but the ship could not be freed. Heavy seas and Bulgarian artillery damaged the wreck, which rendered her a total loss.|$|E

CT began a three-month pilot project in September 2005 that brought Wi-Fi access to buses on its longest route, Route 422 between Stanwood and Seattle, with hopes of attracting customers and partial-telecommuters to its routes. The pilot project was deemed a success and expanded into the [...] "Surf and Ride" [...] program on all Route 422 trips in 2006, as well as select trips on Routes 406 and 441 from Edmonds to Seattle and Overlake on the Eastside, respectively; the Wi-Fi program was canceled in 2010, with the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> in buses brought on by low customer response, budget constraints and the adoption of improved cellular networks that support mobile browsing on smartphones.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{transfer}} of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20-24 of Waterloo International have remained unused. Waterloo suffers significant capacity problems, and proposals {{have been put in}} place to convert the former international station to domestic use. In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services, including the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> such as customs control facilities, at an estimated cost of between £50,000 and £100,000.However, the conversion of the remaining platforms was delayed as it would require further alterations to the station infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|Kensington locks are not {{designed}} to be an impervious protection measure. Because most computer equipment cases are generally made of plastic or thin metal, the lock can be torn out, though not without doing significant visible damage to the case. The cable itself can be cut if an individual has a wire cutter or bolt cutter sufficiently strong {{to cut through the}} cable material, which will vary between different brands of cable. The Kensington type locks are useful to discourage quick grab-and-run thefts of equipment from casually supervised locations such as coffee shops, but cannot prevent the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> secured in an unattended location.|$|E

50|$|With the {{completion}} of newer power stations, Bunnerong 'A' was out of use by 1973, 'B' Station was relegated to emergency supply duties, and the entire installation was finally decommissioned in 1975. The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> began in 1978 and was largely completed by 1981. Peak load gas turbines were in use on the site from 1982 to 1984, but demolition commenced after their removal. The 112 metre-high concrete emission stack of Bunnerong 'B' boilerhouse was demolished in December 1986, {{and the majority of}} the huge structures of 'A' and 'B' Stations were razed by 28 June 1987. Demolition was largely undertaken by the American company, Controlled Demolition Incorporated. The large switch house dating from 1926 remained in place until its levelling in March 1994. Few traces of the power station remain.|$|E
5000|$|The 6922d Security Group was {{activated}} in April 1970 at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. [...] Initially, {{the group}} conducted operations through subordinate detachments ranging from Thailand through Japan. With {{the withdrawal of}} the United States from Vietnam, operations were substantially reduced, and by 1974 were limited to direction finding, and the group was reduced to the 6922d Security Squadron. Operations continued through June 1991, when Mount Pinatubo erupted, covering Clark with volcanic ash. It became apparent that resumption of operations at Clark was neither financially or politically viable, and the squadron began to devote itself to the salvage and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> except for a small contingent of linguists. The squadron was inactivated as remaining Air Force assets at Clark were turned over to the Philippine government.|$|E

5000|$|Abandonment {{costs are}} costs {{associated}} with the abandonment of a business venture. This term traditionally applied to the process of abandoning an under-producing or non-producing oil or gas well. In that context, it means the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> plugging of the well with cement, any environmental clean-up, etc. necessary to shut the well down. It is occasionally referred to as [...] "Removal and Abandonment" [...] or R & A. The objective of well abandonment is to ensure that no hydrocarbons leak into surface water or into the atmosphere. The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000. Wells that have been used as injectors or have been subject to fracking operation are more likely to develop leaks because the injected substances can create channels that permit uncontrolled flow outside the casing.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{its formal}} decommissioning, {{the ship in}} {{question}} will {{begin the process of}} decommissioning by going through a preliminary step called inactivation or deactivation. During this phase, a ship will report to a naval facility owned by the country in question so as to permit the ship's crew to offload, remove, and dismantle the ship's weapons, ammunition, electronics, and other material that is judged to be of further use to the nation in question. The removed material from a ship usually ends up either rotating to another ship in the class with similar weapons and/or capabilities, or in storage pending a decision on equipment's fate. During this time a ship's crew may be thinned out via transfers and reassignments as the ongoing <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> renders certain personnel (such as missile technicians or gun crews) unable to perform their duties on the ship in question. Certain aspects of a ship's deactivation - such as the removal or deactivation of a ship's nuclear weapons capabilities - may be governed by international treaties observed by the country in question, which can result in the presence of foreign officials authorized to inspect the weapon or weapon system in question to ensure compliance with a given treaty. Other aspects of a ship's decommissioning, such as the reprocessing of nuclear fuel from a ship utilizing a nuclear reactor or the removal of hazardous materials from a ship, are handled by the government in question according to the nation's domestic policies on such matters. When a ship finishes its inactivation, it is then formally decommissioned, after which the ship is usually towed to a storage facility.|$|E
