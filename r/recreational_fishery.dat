40|$|These Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries {{are focused}} on <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> and {{describe}} strategies to promote environmentally sustainable and socially responsible management of such fisheries. To this end, the document details policy, management and behavioural recommendations for sustainable <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> that are an increasingly important component of global fisheries. Specifically, the Guidelines translate the relevant provisions of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries into specific advice for <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries.</b> The concept of aquatic stewardship is introduced as an overarching ethical framework needed to achieve ecologically sustainable <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> on a global scale. Within this normative mindset, the adaptive management philosophy based on quantifiable and transparent objectives and continuous learning and feedback loops is proposed along with the acknowledgement of principles such as the ecosystem approach and the precautionary approach. Adherence to the guidelines and recommendations presented in this document will enable policy-makers, managers and the entire <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> sector to orient <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> towards maintaining or achieving sustainability.

The species takes a wide variety of baits including live and cut fish, squid, octopus, and probably other crustaceans resembling their natural food.

25|$|The Chesapeake Bay has had {{the largest}} blue crab harvest {{for more than a}} century.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the potential for}} implementing individual transferable quota (ITQ) schemes in commercial <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries,</b> focusing particularly on charter and headboat fisheries. After a brief discussion of ITQs in commercial fisheries, the paper {{discusses the}} manner in which rents get dissipated in commercial <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Fishing mortality in <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> is determined as a joint outcome of angler behavior and trip supply. In the recreational sector under open access conditions, there are likely to be too many vessels providing too many trips at prices that are too low. Vessel input configurations are likely to be distorted in a manner that generates excessive fishing mortality. Designing ITQs for <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> requires consideration of issues not prominent in the design of commercial fisheries. Among the most important is {{the manner in which}} angler preferences and types affect overall mortality from both landings and discards. While catch and release fisheries and pure food fish <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> are relatively easy to manage with <b>recreational</b> ITQs, <b>fisheries</b> with both angler types present difficult monitoring problems that add complexities to ITQ design.
