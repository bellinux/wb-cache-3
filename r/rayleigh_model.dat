However, due to the physics of radar imaging process, sar images contain unwanted artefacts {{in the form of}} a granular look which is called speckle. the assumptions of the classical SAR image generation model lead to the convention that the real and imaginary parts of the received wave follow a Gaussian law, which in turn means that the amplitude of the wave has a Rayleigh distribution-. However, some experimental data show impulsive characteristics which correspond to underlying heavy-tailed distributions, clearly non-rayleigh. some alternative distributions have been suggested such as weibull and log-normal distributions, however, in most of the cases these models are empirical, not derived with the consideration of underlying physical conditions and therefore are case specific. In this report, relaxing some of the assumptions leading to the classical <b>rayleigh</b> <b>model</b> and using the recent results in the literature on α-stable distributions, we develop a generalised (heavy-tailed) version of the <b>rayleigh</b> <b>model</b> based on the assumption that the real and the imaginary parts of the received signal follows an isotropic α-stable law which is suggested by a generalised form of the central limit theorem. we also derive novel methods for the estimation of the heavy-tailed rayleigh distribution parameter- s based on negative fractional-order statistics for model fitting. our experimental results show that the heavy-tailed <b>rayleigh</b> <b>model</b> can describe a wide range of data which could not be described by the classical <b>rayleigh</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E

50|$|Rayleigh {{scattering}} is {{a process}} in which electromagnetic radiation (including light) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive index, such as a particle, bubble, droplet, or even a density fluctuation. This effect was first modeled successfully by Lord Rayleigh, from whom it gets its name. In order for <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>model</b> to apply, the sphere must be much smaller in diameter than the wavelength (λ) of the scattered wave; typically the upper limit is taken to be about 1/10 the wavelength. In this size regime, the exact shape of the scattering center is usually not very significant and can often be treated as a sphere of equivalent volume. The inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around, which are normally small enough in scale for <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>model</b> to apply. This scattering mechanism is the primary cause of the blue color of the Earth's sky on a clear day, as the shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight passing overhead are more strongly scattered than the longer red wavelengths according to Rayleigh's famous 1/λ4 relation. Along with absorption, such scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. The degree of scattering varies {{as a function of the}} ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation, along with many other factors including polarization, angle, and coherence.|$|R
