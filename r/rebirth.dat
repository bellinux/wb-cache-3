5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and {{would feel the}} pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked <b>rebirth</b> in water would be an interesting {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and <b>rebirth</b> process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and <b>rebirth</b> process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>rebirths,</b> and realms {{in which these}} <b>rebirths</b> can occur, is {{extensively}} developed in Buddhism, in particular Tibetan Buddhism with its wheel of existence (Bhavacakra) doctrine.

5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to <b>rebirth</b> in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to <b>rebirth</b> in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to <b>rebirth</b> in heaven.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and <b>rebirth,</b> while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and <b>rebirth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of <b>Rebirth</b> (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of <b>rebirth</b> is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E
