Delays in repaying either principal or interest threaten the cooperative nature of the membership and can seriously impair the Fund’s ability to continue to provide financial assistance to other countries. Although critics have often attacked the IMF for being more interested in getting its money back than in helping its member countries, {{the vast majority of}} the Fund’s members have always recognized that the institution cannot help unless it preserves its assets as a revolving stock of lendable resources. When arrears to the Fund became substantial in the 1980 s, creditor and indebted countries alike insisted on a strong reaction. This chapter begins with an overview on how the arrears problem at the Fund developed through the 1980 s. It then reviews in more detail the cases where countries developed problems serious enough to warrant the Fund declaring them ineligibl...|$|E
30|$|The {{unsteadiness}} {{of capitalist}} economies is also {{center stage in}} Schumpeter’s (1934 [1912]) path-breaking work on innovation-driven economic development. At {{the core of his}} theory is entrepreneurship capable of carrying out new combinations of resources, i.e. innovations. Only the most gifted entrepreneurs are assumed to have such a pioneering capacity. In a rather complex argumentation he submitted that these entrepreneurs appear “in swarms”. A new swarm is supposed to enter the scene when the innovative boost brought to the economy by the previous swarm has ebbed away. Once the initial obstacles have been overcome, however, less entrepreneurial talent is required. Imitators get opportunities to participate in exploiting the innovation and massively invest and start producing in parallel. The result is a boom. It gets stuck once the unanticipated excess capacities bring down the profitability and a massive parallel <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> induces an economic contraction. 4 Nonetheless, after each cycle, Schumpeter claims, the economy has been growing thanks to the innovation. Schumpeter's explanation is very much in line with the complex systems view. Yet, in the light of such a view, his growth optimism seems less well founded. It may be an ex post generalization of the growth that Schumpeter observed during the industrialization phase of his time. And it certainly rests on the hypothesis that (innovative) supply creates its own demand – which means that Schumpeter trusted Say’s law.|$|E

This study aims to examine the middlemen roles in agriculture produce market based on the Theory of Moral Sentiment. The explanation reflects the implementation of rational sympathy and benevolence of middlemen actions according to Moral Sentiment Theory argument. This study emphasizes the context of palm fruit middlemen (FD) in Malaysia. This study employs in-depth interview with four palm fruit dealers in Sabak Bernam, Selangor, Malaysia. The finding indicates that the middlemens’ roles have reflected the rational sympathize and benevolence as in the Moral Sentiment Theory. Execution of moral sentiment is found in two aspects, namely the commercial and social aspects. The rational sympathy is translated {{in the form of}} pure commercial services such as purchase of raw produces, farm management, selling of farm necessities and transportation. Although they are paid services, the small holders gain advantages from such services. On the other hand, the middlemen also obtain cash advance and farm items credit which reflects FD benevolence to willingly forgo potential of extra profit. Although <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> is deductable from the selling proceeds, small 46 Akademika 87 (2) palm holders still gain benefits from the service as it was provided without the need of collateral, compliance of rigid loan application procedures, finance charges and with flexible payback arrangement. Therefore, middlemen activities are in line with the moral sentiment and has explicitly underlies the particular FD context.

Study 1 explores how young adults use credit cards to achieve their life goals {{as well as to}} negotiate changes in their relationships with their parents. Credit cards are an important tool for helping young people gain independence and sever their obligation to their parents.

Through depth interviews with 17 undergraduate students who have credit card debt, I find that the consumption <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> cards corresponds to their strategies to negotiate independence as well as obligations to their parents. The use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> cards and management <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card debt among young adults is a significant and symbolic aspect of their transition from childhood to adulthood, and credit cards are a transitional tool for this coming of age.

40|$|The 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances {{provides}} robust {{information on}} the financing of small businesses including an overview of their firm's organization, financial characteristics, and credit use. Information from the survey is {{used in this study}} to compare the financial characteristics of food manufacturing and retailing small businesses. On average, both food manufacturing and food retailing small businesses had positive financial characteristics. Although they were only marginally profitable and liquid, they were highly solvent. Accounts receivable and inventory comprise nearly half of food manufacturers' total assets and a third of food retailers' assets. By most financial measures, food retailers were statistically smaller than food manufacturers. Both food manufacturers and food retailers utilized computers, primarily for accounting/bookkeeping, inventory management, and administration. Primary financial services used are for transactions and trade <b>credit.</b> Nearly three-fourths <b>of</b> food manufacturing and one-half of food retailing supply purchases involve trade credit from a large number <b>of</b> trade <b>credit</b> suppliers, on average. Both firm types have higher credit risks and are tardy with <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>credit.</b> Nonparametric rank order statistical methods were required because normality assumptions were violated due to asymmetric distribution of small firms. business, finances, food, manufacturing, retail, small, survey, Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} five crop seasons, cotton {{production}} has tripled in Burkina Faso after the country began a sectoral reform. The first step of the reform consisted of setting up a new institutional design giving rights to farmers {{to create their own}} groups while the second step established a professional partnership (with a privatization process for the former parastatal cotton firm) where cotton unions gained significant bargaining power. This paper presents a theoretical framework to deal with the role of institutions in the performance of outgrower schemes applied to the Burkinabe cotton sector. The theoretical insights emphasize the link between credit’s group design and the production incentives for farmers with imperfect information on input use and labour effort. The impacts of institutional reform are discussed relative to the dynamics of production and the better <b>repayment</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> groups. We argue that the institutional reform and the change of bargaining power in favor of producers have pushed farmers to increase their investment in cotton growing (effort, land, [...] .) and to better service their credit...|$|R
5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied aid credit, even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, tied aid credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the principal) and terms <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> Such <b>credits</b> are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed as a percentage <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the concessionality level, the more the tied aid credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|R
