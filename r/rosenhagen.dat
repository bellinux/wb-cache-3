His grandfather was the pharmacist Ernst Leopold Andreae (born ca. 1640). The Andreae pharmacy had been founded in 1639 with a ducal privilege from Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and taken over by his great-grandfather Johann Andreae in 1645. It quickly came to serve the ducal court and became the official court pharmacy.|$|E

50|$|Wacker {{managed to}} {{convince}} prominent Van Gogh experts Jacob Baart de la Faille, Hendrik P. Bremmer, Julius Meier-Graefe and Hans <b>Rosenhagen</b> that the paintings {{he was selling}} were genuine. These experts accepted his account that a Russian had bought the paintings, transferred them to Switzerland illegally, and had commissioned an illegal agent to sell them. They understood the need for this Russian to remain anonymous {{in order to prevent}} reprisals from relatives who still lived in the Soviet Union, and they supplied certificates of authenticity without proof of provenance. Thannhauser, Matthiesen and Goldschmidt galleries bought some of the paintings.|$|E

50|$|The trial against Wacker {{began on}} 6 April 1932. Vincent Willem van Gogh, nephew of the painter, gave the first {{evidence}} at the trial and stated that family records did not include any Russian who would have purchased any paintings. De la Faille, on the other hand, had changed his mind once again and claimed that five of the paintings were genuine. During the trial, various experts {{did not come to}} full agreement on what paintings were authentic (and the argument was to continue in some circles for years afterwards). Bremmer argued that at least 9 paintings were genuine. Meier-Grafe admitted his mistake and even that the expert opinion could be fallible. Hans <b>Rosenhagen</b> said that 14 of the works were inferior but genuine. However, the Dutch restorer A M de Wild found that the pigments used in the paintings were not similar to those Van Gogh had used. Art restorer Kurt Wehlte showed with X-rays that the painting techniques were different (although he used a painting that was declared a forgery in the 1970s). Later {{it was found that the}} paintings had not been painted on French canvases at all. On 19 April 1932 Wacker was charged with fraud, and after an appeal, was sentenced to 19 months in prison and a fine of 30,000 reichsmarks. Some former directors of the Bank für Deutsche Beamte, who had been speculating on the paintings on behalf of the bank, were sued.|$|E
5000|$|Rettich {{was born}} in <b>Rosenhagen</b> near Dassow in Mecklenburg. His father was owner of the manor in this small village near the Bay of Lübeck. The area on the Baltic Sea {{influenced}} him {{at an early age}} and recover in his later works. Rettich went to high school in Lübeck, then in 1859 to study law in Munich on his fathers request. But he came over to landscape painting and became a pupil of Adolf Heinrich Lier. In 1862 he went to the Düsseldorf school of painting where he was until 1867 a student with Albert Flamm and Theodor Hagen. After living in Dresden 1867-70, he went 1871 to Weimar. [...] There he was at the Grand Ducal Saxon School of Arts for further studies of landscape painting as a student with Arnold Böcklin, Franz von Lenbach and also Theodor Hagen. [...] He undertook study trips to Norway, Sweden, as well as Italy. After a few years in Munich (1886-1896) he moved to Lübeck and from there in April 1897 he went to Graal-Müritz on the Baltic Sea near Rostock. There he bought a house and spent from now the summer in the small community and the winters in his parents home in Lübeck. With the sale of postcards showing typical landscape motives, he could earn his living. And with the income he also had to build a pavilion in 1898, for the exposition of his paintings. In 1904 he died - suffering from cancer - from the effects of surgery.|$|E
