Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a {{point in your life}} where you're <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of the past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E

Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E

500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks ("I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of the steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station {{as a metaphor for}} time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording.

Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, Steal My Girl, was dubbed by Billboard as [...] "no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction", and that the band was [...] "not entirely <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of its bubble-gum days". Rolling Stone described the record as [...] "saturated with retro vibes"; its songs [...] "split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year." ...|$|E

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

During {{the events of}} A Thief's End, she {{is the leader of}} a private {{military}} company called Shoreline, and forms a partnership with Rafe Adler in finding Henry Avery's lost treasure. They attempt to buy a St. Dismas Cross at an auction in Italy, where she sees Victor Sullivan, whom she is acquainted with. When they fail to acquire the cross due to Nathan Drake cutting off the power, Ross confronts him elsewhere and the two briefly fight, but Nathan escapes with the cross. Adler hacks into Nathan and Sam's phones, using their GPS to track them to Madagascar. Along the way, Ross slowly loses patience with Adler, citing the loss of her men for something that they may not find, and numerous times advocates for Adler to kill Nathan and Sam, which he refuses to do. In the game's climax, Ross and Adler succeed in pillaging a portion of Avery's treasure and is content with leaving afterwards, unwilling to risk falling into Avery's traps aboard the ship and even <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Sam and Nathan keep the rest if they can avoid the traps, though Adler coerces her into aiding him by turning her men against her.
