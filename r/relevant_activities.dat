2500|$|Porter {{wrote in}} 1985: [...] "Competitive {{advantage}} cannot {{be understood by}} looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting its product. Each of these activities can contribute to a firm's relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation...the value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically <b>relevant</b> <b>activities</b> {{in order to understand}} the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the {{business}} model is not used uniformly in the literature. Compared to the {{concept of the}} value chain, it is not limited to a physical production process. It also includes service processes. According to Timmers, [...] "a business model is defined as the organization (or architecture) of product, service and information flows, and the sources of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers." [...] According to Wirtz, [...] "a business model is a simplified and aggregated representation of the <b>relevant</b> <b>activities</b> of a company. It describes how marketable information, products and/or services are generated by means of a company's value-added component. In addition to the architecture of value creation, strategic as well as customer and market components are considered in order to realize the overriding objective of generating and preserving a competitive advantage." [...] The business model as an integrated management tool consists of further partial models: the revenue model, the consumer model, the procurement model, the production of goods and services model, the service offer model and the distribution model. Because a business model can strongly vary {{depending on the type of}} business, it can best be described using a sample. In the following the business model of a book publishing house is presented.|$|E
