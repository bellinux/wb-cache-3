In case of practical <b>retro</b> <b>reflectors</b> though, such as corner cube retro-reflectors (CCRs), the relayed image suffers from loss in quality and resolution due to the positional shift in the retro-reflected rays and the diffraction effects.

40|$|Described {{here are}} the concept, {{architecture}} and preliminary details of an experiment directed towards providing continuous Ultra High Precision (UHP) time transfer between Washington, DC; Salisbury, SA Australia; Orroral Valley, ACT Australia; and Lower Hutt, New Zealand. A proposed method of distributing UTC(USNO) {{at a high level}} of precision to passive users over a broad area of the South Pacific is described. The concept is based on active two-way satellite time transfer from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) to the proposed USNO Master Clock West (MCW) in Wahiwa, HI at the 1 nanosecond level using active satellite two-way time transfer augmented by Precise Positioning Service (PPS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS). MCW would act as an intermediate transfer/reference station, again linked to Salisbury at the 1 nanosecond level using active satellite two-way time transfer augmented by PPS GPS. From this point, time would be distributed within the region by two methods. The first is an existing TV line sync system using an Australian communications satellite (AUSSAT K 1) which is useful to the 20 nanosecond level. The second approach is RF ranging and multilateration between Salisbury, Orroral Observatory, Lower Hutt and the AUSSAT B 1 and B 2 to be launched in 1992. Orroral Observatory will provide precise laser ranging to the AUSSAT B 1 /B 2 <b>retro</b> <b>reflectors</b> which will reduce ephemeris related time transfer errors to below 1 nanosecond. The corrected position will be transmitted by both the time transfer modem and the existing TV line sync dissemination process. Multilateration has the advantage of being an all weather approach and when used with the laser ranging technique will provide a precise measurement of the propagation path delays. This will result in time transfer performance levels on the order of 10 nanoseconds to passive users in both Australia and New Zealand...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the development, testing {{and evaluation of}} a new, automated system for calibration and AUT alignment of a planar near-field scanner that allows the calibration system to remain in place during AUT measurement and {{which can be used}} to support AUT alignment to the scan plane. During scanner calibration, probe aperture position measurements are made using a tracking laser interferometer, a fixture that positions the interferometer <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> at a precise location relative to the probe aperture and a probe roll axis that maintains the proper orientation between the <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> and the interferometer as the probe position is moved. Aperture scan path information is used to construct a best-fit scan plane and to define a Cartesian, scanner-based coordinate system. Scan path data is then used to build a probe position error map {{for each of the three}} Cartesian coordinates as a function of the nominal position in the scan plane. These error maps can be used to implement software-based corrections (K-corrections) or they may be used for active Z-axis correction during measurements. By using a set of tooling points on the antenna mount, an AUT coordinate system is measured with the interferometer. The system then directs an operator through a set of AUT adjustments that align the AUT with the planar near-field scanner to a desired accuracy.

40|$|The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) were adopted from the integrated circuits (IC) industry and are mostly limited to patterning thin films on a flat substrate. As a consequence, micro-machined devices mostly comprise sets of flat two-dimensional (2 D) membranes with etched patterns and undercuts {{that enable them to}} serve their intended functions. However, many mechanical, optical and biological applications, such as corner-cube <b>retro</b> <b>reflectors,</b> micro-scale magnetometers, 3 D microfluidic systems and 3 D photonic crystals, require three-dimensional (3 D) geometries for their functionality. In addition, 3 D circuits have also emerged as a way of improving connectivity and reducing power dissipation in electronic chips. However, the creation of fully 3 D structures via conventional MEMS fabrication techniques typically requires processes that have low throughput, limited control over the final geometry, and higher costs. A promising alternative to 3 D microfabrication that addresses these challenges while requiring minimal investment in a new infrastructure is to use the existing technologies to pattern in 2 D, and then assemble the patterned segments into 3 D structures. Demonstrated methods to achieve that objective have been limited in scope, requiring manual assembly or with limited applicability to specific architectures. This thesis presents a coherent modular system for folding, aligning and latching 2 D-patterned precursors into prescribed 3 D structures. The system presented here comprises flexure hinges to enable relative motion among the 2 D precursors, a cascaded alignment system to provide progressively better alignment among precursors as they approach their final positions, and systems of reversible latches to retain the assembly in its final configuration while, optionally, permitting disassembly and reassembly of the structure. In particular, two types of systems are considered. First, the design, fabrication and testing of polymer structures with metal hinges, cascaded alignment features and integrated latching mechanisms are presented for perpendicular assembly of structures. Second, an alternative latching technique using controlled melting of photoresist polymer adhesive pads is analyzed and tested for the parallel assembly of structures. The structures discussed in this thesis consist of SU- 8 polymer segments patterned on silicon wafers and linked with an underlying thin gold pattern that defines the hinges. The elasto-plastic bending of the hinges is analyzed and simulated to predict the trajectory and angular position of the membranes during folding. The design of cascaded alignment features, consisting of triangular protrusions and corresponding rhombic holes, is discussed. A kinematic model of the alignment mechanism is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cascading aspect of the design to achieve a large range of angular correction and high alignment accuracy at the same time. The design of micro snap-fit latches that work in conjunction with the alignment system is also presented, and quasi-static simulations of the elastic bending of latches is used to evaluate their strength. Experimental measurements were conducted to characterize the behavior of the gold hinges during bending, demonstrating good agreement with models. The integrated folding-alignment-latching system was demonstrated by assembling corner-cube structures. The alignment process was found to be accurate to within 1 from measurements of the final assembled position of the corner cube structure. The system was also shown to support fabricating reconfigurable devices by demonstrating the ability to unlatch and re-latch segments. The latching and unlatching forces were measured to be 9. 7 [mu]N and 12. 3 [mu]N respectively. by Nader S. Shaar. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), {{launched}} on March 17, 2002, represents the state-of-the-art in geodetic {{observations of the}} static and time varying components of the Earth's geopotential field. The fundamental measurement used to observe gravity is the inter-satellite range and range rate between two coplanar, low altitude satellites obtained from a K-band ranging (KBR) system. In addition to the K-band ranging system, each satellite possess a Super-STAR Accelerometer, a GPS receiver/antenna package, Star Cameras and a Laser <b>Retro</b> <b>Reflector</b> (LRR) to complete the compliment of science instruments.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} systematic {{errors in the}} orbit and clock estimates of the GIOVE and Galileo IOV satellites {{in the order of}} Â± 20 cm. These errors are visible as periodic variations in the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and clock residuals. For IOV, these variations could be attributed to the contribution of a stretched satellite body and it was shown that a simple a priori box model for the solar radiation pressure can significantly reduce these errors. GIOVE-B has similar dimensions as the IOV satellites but its orientation is different: for GIOVE-B the narrow side of the satellite points to the Earth rather than the longitudinal side. In addition, an extra plate carrying, amongst others, the laser <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> array is mounted on the spacecraft introducing shadowing effects. These features are considered with a simple box-plate model. This model reduces the periodic clock errors and the SLR residual RMS of GIOVE-B by a factor of two. Most importantly, the box-plate model reduces the SLR offset from 11 cm to less than 1 cm. The largest part of this reduction comes from considering the plate and its shadowing effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Recently, the {{importance}} of underwater wireless optical communication has been grown for applications of underwater observation and sea monitoring systems. This communication technology is expected to play {{a prominent role in}} investigating climate changes, prediction of natural disasters, discovery of natural resources, marine biology in lake, sea, and ocean environment. Though acoustic modems have long been the default wireless communication method for under water applications due to their long range, the need for high speed communication has prompted the exploration of non-acoustic methods that `have previously been overlooked due to their distance limitations. Optical wireless communication has been proposed as the best alternative in order to overcome the limitations in acoustic underwater communication. In this paper we have presented three scenarios regarding underwater optical wireless communication. They are a) Line of sight (LOS) b) Modulating <b>Retro</b> <b>Reflector</b> link c) Reflective link. In this analysis, each scenario has been tested with water having different extinction coefficient and various noise backgrounds. We analysed these links in OPTI SYSTEM. Opti System is an innovative, rapidly evolving, and powerful software design tool that enables users to plan, test, and simulate almost every type of optical link in the transmission layer of a broad spectrum of optical networks from LAN, SAN, MAN to ultra-long-haul.

40|$|Laser ranging to {{satellites}} (SLR) {{in earth}} orbit is an established technology used for geodesy, fundamental science and precise orbit determination. A combined active and passive optical measurement system using a single telescope mount is presented which performs precise ranging measurements of <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> equipped objects in {{low earth orbit}} (LEO). The German Aerospace Center (DLR) runs an observatory in Stuttgart where a system has been assembled completely from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The visible light directed to the tracking camera is used to perform angular measurements of objects under investigation. This is done astrometrically by comparing the apparent target position with cataloged star positions. First successful satellite laser ranging was demonstrated recently using an optical fiber directing laser pulses onto the astronomical mount. The transmitter operates at a wavelength of 1064 nm with a repetition rate of 3 kHz and pulse energy of 25 Î¼J. A motorized tip/tilt mount allows beam steering of the collimated beam with Î¼rad accuracy. The returning photons reflected from the object in space are captured with the tracking telescope. A special low aberration beam splitter unit was designed to separate the infrared from visible light. This allows passive optical closed loop tracking and operation of a single photon detector for time of flight measurements at a single telescope simultaneously. The presented innovative design yields to a compact and cost effective but very precise ranging system which allows orbit determination.

40|$|Tomographic Long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) allows two {{and three}} {{dimensional}} determination of trace gas distributions by measuring the average concentration along 10 to 20 intersecting light paths and applying tomographic inversion techniques. In this thesis such a setup was developed and applied {{for the first time}} to determine the horizontal distribution of several trace gases in the open atmosphere. The measurements took place in the city of Heidelberg, Germany from 2005 to 2007 and focused on the trace gases NO 2, SO 2, O 3, HCHO and HONO, which play a major role in the polluted atmosphere. The setup consisted of three Multi Beam LP-DOAS instruments and 20 <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> arrays all installed on different buildings in the city. The 20 realised intersecting light paths covered an area of 4 Ã— 4 kmÂ² with different emission sources. The retrieved horizontal trace gas distributions had a temporal resolution of up to 15 minutes with best results for NO 2, SO 2 and O 3. The highest trace gas concentrations (except for O 3) and spatial variations arose during low wind situations. Emission sources varying in space and time could be distinguished and identified mainly as emissions from traffic (NO 2 with O 3 depletion) and power plants / industry (SO 2). Several insights into chemical processes in the atmosphere could be gained by studying the interrelationship of the measured trace gases. HONO, for example, displayed much lower spatial variability than NO 2 and was thus not directly emitted by the same source but rather formed in heterogeneous reactions. Transport processes of plumes were also investigated...|$|R
40|$|Formation flying of {{spacecraft}} nowadays {{is acknowledged}} {{to be an}} important technology for many future space missions. TNO underlines the importance and has therefore designed and tested a general use sensor system that is modular and can be used and adapted to the specific needs of a variety of missions. The sensor system is designed to be operated complementary to an interferometric distances measurement system. It replaces the interferometer <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> and uses a small part of its laser light. This light then is used to measure lateral displacement in two directions, pitch, yaw and roll. The lateral displacement accuracy is to the micrometer level and the pitch yaw and roll accuracies are to the arcsecond level. The basis for this system was created by the successful ESA HPOM-project, where TNO developed and tested Fine Lateral displacement Sensor (FLS), with a few cm range and with sub-micron accuracies. At this stage the technology was aimed at the SMART 2 mission, which is very similar to the presently initiated PROBA 3. After including tilt, yaw and roll measurements the system has become a very versatile robust piece of formation flying metrology. This paper treats the development of the sensor system as well as the experiments performed on the first prototype. This prototype consists of all the required optics and sensors assembled in a robust housing. As a result of the first experiments, the design was improved on some aspects. Although the experiments have yet only proven the Technology Readiness Level 4 for the tilt measurements and TRL 6 for the lateral displacement, no difficulties are foreseen for the further development of the sensor system. All potentially critical elements have flown before...|$|R
40|$|The Sentinel- 3 mission {{performs}} routine {{measurements of}} sea surface heights and depends crucially on accurate and precise {{knowledge of the}} spacecraft. Orbit determination with a targeted uncertainty of less than 2 cm in radial direction is supported through an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) instrument, and a complementary laser <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> for satellite laser ranging (SLR). Within this study, the potential of ambiguity-fixing for GPS-only precise orbit determination (POD) of the Sentinel- 3 spacecraft is assessed. A refined strategy for carrier phase generation out of low level measurements is employed to cope with half-cycle ambiguities in the tracking of the Sentinel- 3 GPS receiver, that have so far inhibited ambiguity-fixed POD solutions. Rather than explicitly fixing double-difference phase ambiguities {{with respect to a}} network of terrestrial reference stations, a single-receiver ambiguity resolution concept is employed that builds on dedicated GPS orbit, clock, and wide-lane bias products provided by the CNES/CLS (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales / Collecte Localisation Satellites) analysis center of the International GNSS Service. Compared to float ambiguity solutions, a notably improved precision can be inferred from laser ranging residuals. These decrease from roughly 9 mm down to 5 mm standard deviation for high-grade stations on average over low and high elevations. Furthermore, the ambiguity-fixed orbits offer a substantially improved cross-track accuracy and help to identify lateral offsets in the GPS antenna or center- of-mass (CoM) location. With respect to altimetry, the improved orbit precision also benefits the global consistency of sea-surface measurements. However, modeling of the absolute height continues to rely on proper dynamical models for the spacecraft motion as well as ground calibrations for the relative position of the altimeter reference point and the CoM...|$|R

The main instruments comprise Javad GNSS receivers (1 - and multi-frequency), GNSS antennas plus a phased array beam-steerable reflectometer antenna (passive radar), an SLR <b>retro</b> <b>reflector</b> and a VLBI. The goals of the mission are â€¢	GNSS-based remote sensing for atmosphere, ionosphere, oceans, ice, soil (moisture), etc. using radio occultation and reflectometry â€¢	Precise orbit determination (POD) and co-location of geodetic methods from space (reference systems, gravity field, etc.) â€¢	Development of technologies and know-how for future micro satellite constellations (formation flights) using GNSS â€¢	Passive radar for altimetry and scatterometry using a beam-steerable antenna â€¢	Antenna development for passive radar, including space qualification A number of possible applications and experiments have been identified, particularly in the oceanographic field, i. e. sea level estimation (altimetry), determination of ocean wave spectra (2 D), sea roughness and swells (scatterometry), retrieval of wind speeds, sea ice parameters and the estimation of ocean wave orbital velocities. Finally also the possibility of using a large constellation of such satellites for Tsunami detection is taken into account. Additional applications could be soil moisture extraction, ionospheric and atmospheric effects and land mapping (clutter). It is not yet decided whether the mission concept will be considered for TET- 2 or not.
