5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit <b>rating</b> <b>agencies</b> have fuelled rising euro zone {{indebtedness}} by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that <b>rating</b> <b>agencies</b> were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the small island of Cyprus with 840,000 people was hit by several huge blows in and around 2012 including, amongst other things, the €22 billion {{exposure}} of Cypriot banks to the Greek debt haircut, the downgrading of the Cypriot economy into junk status by international <b>rating</b> <b>agencies</b> and {{the inability of the}} government to refund its state expenses.|$|E

40|$|Analyzing 916 CDOs {{issued from}} January 1997 to December 2007, {{we find that}} direct outputs from a <b>rating</b> <b>agency</b> model are more {{straightforward}} and accurate than actual ratings assigned to CDOs. Actual sizes of AAA rated tranches are on average 12. 1 % larger than implied by the <b>rating</b> <b>agency</b> model. These adjustments to the <b>rating</b> <b>agency</b> model are difficult to explain by possible determinants but exhibit a clear pattern of low model-implied AAA CDOs receiving larger adjustments. CDOs with larger adjustments experience worse subsequent performance. Moreover, prior to April 1, 2007, 91. 2 % of AAA rated notes only comply with the credit <b>rating</b> <b>agency’s</b> own AA default rate standard. Had the credit <b>rating</b> <b>agency</b> followed its model and default standards AAA rated tranches would on average have been rated BBB, resulting in a 20. 1 % lower valuation. 1 In discussions regarding {{the causes of the}} recent financial crisis, the role of collateralized deb...|$|R
