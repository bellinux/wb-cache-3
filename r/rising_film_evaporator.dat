50|$|The hot {{fluid in}} the case of the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> would be the steam in the shell side and the cold fluid would be the liquid inside the long tubes. In {{relation}} to the overall heat transfer rate, there are several key parameters that affect this characteristic specifically in terms of a <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Artisan Industries is {{a company}} specializes in {{customizing}} thermal separation equipment. The Artisan <b>Rising</b> <b>Film</b> <b>Evaporator</b> has similar basic fundamental as the general design of a long-tube vertical evaporator, but it is modified to allow for handling of more viscous and volatile material which the orthodox design {{may not be able}} to handle due to excessive fouling.|$|E
5000|$|Considering that rising film {{evaporators}} use {{the same}} heat transfer principle as a general shell and tube heat exchanger. Therefore, the overall heat transfer rate is crucial in determining {{the performance of the}} evaporator. This factor will determine the capacity of the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The fundamental general formula which gives the overall heat transfer rate is, ...|$|E
50|$|While the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are {{relatively}} efficient {{and have a}} several advantages, some literature suggests {{that they are not}} as efficient as the vertical or the horizontal tube falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> As such, in recent times falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are usually chosen in place of <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> because they have similar advantages as <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> and have the additional benefits of better efficiency. Moreover, <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> requires a driving force to move the film against gravity and this causes a limitation because there is a requirement for a sufficient temperature difference between the heating surfaces to provide the driving force.|$|R
50|$|Limited product versatility:-Another major {{limitation}} of <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is {{the requirement for}} the products to be of low viscosity and have minimal fouling tendencies. Competitive process designs like plate-type evaporators can handle liquids that are more viscous with higher fouling tendencies because the inner parts are more easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{capabilities}} of the used concentrators and the allowable solid content in the mixture for further safe operation of dryers, the protein hydrolysate solution can be concentrated up to 50 % solids (Pasupuleti and Braun 2010). Mostly used modifications of concentrators are falling and <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> which differ from each other by the way of product supply and, correspondingly, by the construction.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} various {{evaporator}} designs {{have been developed}} using the fundamental principles of the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> thermo-siphon. The available designs for the evaporators are mostly customized by private companies and industries depending on the required application in producing the desired products. This is essential {{in order to ensure}} that the optimal product is obtained while maximising the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the design.|$|E
50|$|Evaporators {{have the}} aim of concentrating a {{solution}} by vaporising the solvent. As such to assess the performance of a <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> the capacity and thermaleconomy of the evaporator is measured. Capacity is the amount of water vaporized per unit time while the steam economy is the amount of solvent vaporised. Hence, the main process attributes are the characteristics of the process that significantly affect these two areas.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to that, the Artisan <b>Rising</b> <b>Film</b> <b>Evaporator</b> {{is designed to}} eliminate {{the majority of the}} volatile components before stripping and is usually used as a flash evaporator or pre-heater. This design allows the operator to control the feed rate or steam rate in order to remove residues, to adjust to the product behaviour, and to maximise steam economy. This evaporator is appropriate for high temperature application and materials with high viscosity that has a propensity to foul the transfer surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Juice {{concentration}} and food processing:-The food industry requires handling of delicate {{products that are}} sensitive to high temperature {{for long periods of}} time. <b>Rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> can operate quickly and efficiently enough to avoid having to expose the product to high temperatures which may damage or undermine its quality. Hence, they are suitable to use as concentrators for juices, milk and other dairy products which are products that require delicate handling in the food industry.|$|R

Although the season was short some heat transfer measurements were possible, and these gave encouraging results. Aspects of fouling and cleaning, including scale analysis, are discussed...|$|R
50|$|A <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> or {{vertical}} long tube evaporator {{is a type}} of evaporator that {{is essentially}} a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger. The liquid being evaporated is fed from the bottom into long tubes and heated with steam condensing {{on the outside of the}} tube from the shell side. This is to produce steam and vapour within the tube bringing the liquid inside to a boil. The vapour produced then presses the liquid against the walls of the tubes and causes the ascending force of this liquid. As more vapour is formed, the centre of the tube will have a higher velocity which forces the remaining liquid against the tube wall forming a thin film which moves upwards. This phenomenon of the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> gives the <b>evaporator</b> its name.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is the low residence time of the liquid feed in the evaporator compared to other evaporator designs like plate-type evaporators. This is crucial because it allows the usage of the evaporator in higher operating temperatures and gives assurance of high product quality despite the product being heat sensitive. Additional advantage is {{the availability of the}} option to operate the evaporator as a continuous process which is overall more energy and time efficient than a batch process operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{determination}} {{of the size of}} a <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is generally a sensitive task because it involves obtaining a good understanding of the process requirements and behaviour of the materials involved. In terms of cost efficiency, it is generally accepted that long and thin tubes are relatively cheaper because the thicker shell sizes for shell and tube heat exchangers are usually more expensive. Nonetheless, while weighing in the cost of the construction against the requirement, the size can be always adjusted and customized depending on the required application in producing the desired products. Generally the size of the length ranges between 4 and 8 m and 25 mm to 50 mm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|For a <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> {{the main}} paths of heat {{transfer}} are conduction and convection. These occur as the steam {{in the shell}} side heats up the tube and as the tube heats up the liquid and vapour within. The design of the long vertical tubes in rising tube evaporators promote {{the formation of the}} long, thin and continual film of liquid formed by the pressure exerted by the vapour which occupies the centre part of the tube and rises up. This ascending motion of film and vapour in the centre promotes great turbulence which then allows for higher heat transfer coefficients leading to a better efficiency heat transfer. Another significant factor that affects the value of the heat transfer coefficients is the design of the evaporator.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{disadvantages}} exist, primarily being the comparable {{lack of understanding}} of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> compared to flooded evaporators, particularly for horizontal falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators.</b> Furthermore the fluid distribution for horizontal falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is a challenge, as the performance is severely limited if an uneven distribution of film over the tubes is created.|$|R

5000|$|The Rising Thin Film Vacuum Evaporator {{design is}} {{modification}} {{on the original}} <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> which has the main difference of allowing the liquid evaporates at lower temperature. This is possible because it operates under vacuum conditions which also avoid undesired formation in the liquid. This design is created to re-concentrate a diluted solution to its desired concentration by evaporation while also allowing evaporated water to condense simultaneously and be recovered for either recirculation or other purposes. There are {{many different types of}} Rising Thin Film Vacuum Evaporator models operating with different capacity, concentration control, types of condenser design to obtain the product at optimal condition. [...] In addition to that, this design is compact, allows easy maintenance of solution concentration and applicable to highly corrosive and effervescent liquids.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the total}} contact area between the heating media and the liquid {{requiring}} the heating or any intermediate surfaces in between them. In {{the case of the}} <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> this is the specific region between the film and the surface of long tubes and also the surrounding heating media within the shell of the evaporator. As shown in the equation, the heat transfer area is one of the chief factors that affect the rate of conductive heat transfer. Therefore, it would be favourable to maximise the amount of area available for heat transfer. The limitations for these can be in terms of the cost per unit area as increasing the area would mean increasing the length of the tubes and also the shell of the evaporator which can significantly increase the cost of construction and maintenance,.|$|E

Experiments were carried out for laminar flow conditions. The experimental unit is a floor standing tubular framework for a rising film evaporation system. There are many parameters affecting heat transfer coefficient in evaporators, {{but it was not}} possible to consider all of them, so parameters including, Reynolds Number (NRe), Temperature Difference (DT), Feed Temperature (Tf) and Re-circulation Ratio (R) were investigated while other factors were kept constant. The experimental results obtained showed that heat transfer coefficient increased with the increase in Reynolds number, feed temperature and temperature difference. The increase in re-circulation ratio also increased the heat transfer coefficient but up to the value of 0. 85 and after this the heat transfer coefficient started decreasing slowly and then remained almost constant.

( [...] Internally enhanced tubes are available for vertical falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators,</b> but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is that if a corrosive or fouling liquid is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on the shell side. This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.|$|R

40|$|The sugar {{industries}} {{are one of}} the major food industries in all countries in terms of demand, capacity and consumption. According to the Ethiopian country’s statistical report, the demand of sugar is tremendously increasing. To meet the demand and the requirements of sugar, many sugar {{industries are}} established. The existing sugar industries are operating with high steam consumption and less production capacity. The major cost and energy loss in the sugar industries are the consumption of steam. The main challenging objective in the sugar industry is to reduce the steam consumption. Most of the sugar industries in Ethiopia are using rising film calendria type multiple effect evaporators (Robert’s type evaporator) which are simple, robust, and easy to operate but are susceptible to scaling and require periodic cleaning. The scaling highly reduces the heat transfer, which make the multi effect evaporator to consume more amount of steam. This research work suggests that the rising film multi effect evaporator can be replaced by some radial type multi effect evaporator, which can eliminate the disadvantaged caused by the <b>rising</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> This replacement modification can reduce the steam consumption in the process.

50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} <b>film</b> in <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is very {{important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling <b>film</b> plate <b>evaporator</b> is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporators,</b> the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the working}} {{principles}} of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> used in dairy industries {{in relation to}} the evaporation of skim milk have been explored with a focus on the effect of milk solids content. The changes in rheological behaviour of skim milk and heat transfer within the evaporator during the concentration process have been investigated. With the better understanding of the rheological behaviour of skim milk and the operation of a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> the possibility of improving the performance of commercial falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> from its current configuration can be assessed. The use of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a common and economical practice in the food and beverage industries to remove water from liquid products, e. g. juices, milk, etc., especially when the product is temperature sensitive. In dairy industries, falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are used to evaporate water from dairy products such as milk, protein concentrate, etc. Falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a well established technology but the understanding of rheological influence of milk on the performance and operation of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> remains relatively unexplored which formed the motivation of this project. In milk powder production, milk is normally concentrated from around 10 wt% to 50 wt% or 52 wt% (this depends on the type of milk) using multi-effect falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> prior to the spray drying process. The viscosity changes of milk during the concentration process are evident, especially the exponential rise in viscosity as solids level reaches 50 wt%. With the increase in viscosity, the flowing characteristics of the milks within the tubes in the evaporator change with the concentration of milk. Consequently, the performance of the evaporator, in terms of heat transfer, is considerably affected. The current research project has been divided into 3 main parts into context of viscosity and evaporation of milk using falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> Firstly, viscosity models of milk are established based on stringent viscosity measurement procedures that ensure the repeatability and reliability of the measurements. These models are used for process simulation, model based control and production planning. The second part is to evaluate the performance of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> under the influences of various operation conditions. In the last part, findings from the first two sections are merged into a pilot evaporator mathematical model that is able to predict the solid content, flow characteristics and residence time of milk concentrate in a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The viscosity of milk is influenced by several factors such as solids content, temperature, ageing and shearing, etc. The focus in this thesis is on the instantaneous milk viscosity during the operation of the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> Therefore, viscosity measurements and modelling of the milk viscosity have been mainly focused on only on the effect of solids content, temperature and, to some extend, shear rate. A 2 m steam-heated pilot evaporator was designed and constructed to commercial grade based on a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> design. This pilot evaporator is able to operate under vacuum conditions (up to - 85 kPa gauge) in both shell and tube side so as to mimic the operation conditions in the dairy industries. The viscosity models in this thesis are predominately formulated based on the fresh and reconstituted medium heat-treated skim milk, unless otherwise stated. A comparison of viscosity models were made between the reconstituted and fresh skim milk. Significant differences were found and reported between the two types of milks. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC), a common method of quantifying the performance of an evaporator, was measured based on temperature difference between the heat transfer surface and the processed fluid (e. g. milk) and the energy transfer within the evaporator. Another 1 m electric-heated pilot evaporator was designed and built to facilitate the measurement at such temperatures and to have known power inputs which was not accessible in the steam-heated device. The influence of different operating conditions, such as varying heat flux, flow characteristics (e. g. Re number) and protein content, on the heat transfer coefficient is thoroughly investigated in this thesis. The study into the HTC on the product side found that the HTC measured from the evaporation of reconstituted skim milk is unresponsive to some of the operating conditions it was subjected to as compared to the fresh skim milk. Generally, HTC improves with greater Re number, heat flux and protein content (milk protein concentrate was added). Visual examination of the evaporation conditions within the evaporator also indicates that the amount of bubble formed during the evaporation process appears to increase with increasing flow rate, heat flux and protein content. During the formulation of the pilot evaporator model in this thesis, the viscosity models and heat transfer coefficients established in the current project were incorporated so as to model the steam-heated batch pilot evaporator. Several assumptions were introduced {{in order to create a}} working model. The pilot evaporator model has been verified against the actual experimental data and is proven to be accurate. This model is able to predict the solids content of the skim milk at any given time provided that the operating conditions are available. This model can also be applied onto a commercial falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> with minor modification to the calculation sequence. A scale-up version has been developed but due to commercial nature, it is not reported in this thesis. The research into the operation of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> has been seen to enhance the knowledge of the mechanisms and interactions between the process fluid and the evaporator. Some of the results obtained here have already benefited an industrial operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is the characterisation of a model to describe the dynamics of a climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> over a wide operating range. The model should be sufficiently simple so that the calculation of control action is straight-forward. The hypothesis of this thesis is that such a model may be constructed to describe the dynamics of a climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> well. The first chapter introduces the topics of climbing film evaporation, two-phase flow and modelling and identification. The second chapter describes the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> used in this study. For this purpose, the evaporator was fully instrumented with temperature sensors, conductivity cells and flow-meters. The instrumentation was commissioned and calibrated. In the next chapter a distributed parameter model of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> {{is derived from the}} one-dimensional homogeneous two-phase flow equations, the parameters of which were to be determined by identification. The next two chapters summarise the field of identification. The fourth chapter presents and develops identification techniques for lumped parameter models, and the fifth chapter describes and constructs identification methods for distributed parameter models. The methods described in the lumped parameter identification section were recursive, so that they could be used in real-time to track time-varying parameters – a feature that is useful in the design of self tuning regulators. These identification methods used a UD factorisation algorithm and were found to be robust for inappropriate choices of system dead-time. Accurate estimates of dead-time were obtained from either method. The distributed parameter identification methods investigated were optimisation schemes to minimise an output least square error criterion. Methods for solving the distributed parameter identification problem using the method of characteristics were investigated and developed. Identification using the method of characteristics is appropriate as the partial differential equations describing the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> are hyperbolic in nature. Chapter six presents the identification strategy adopted to model the evaporator using the techniques described and developed in chapters four and five. The experiments for the collection of data {{to be used in the}} various models are designed. A range of models of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> were identified. The simplest models for the evaporator were global black-box linear models. Gain-scheduled linear models were identified to attempt compensation for system non-linearity. Finally the parameters of distributed parameter models for the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> were investigated. These models are presented and discussed in chapters seven, eight and nine respectively. The thesis is organised so that pages are numbered within chapters, with nomenclature and references listed at the end of each chapter. The paper entitled "Multi-input, multi-output identification of a pilot-plant climbing film evaporator" is based upon this work (Appendix VI).
