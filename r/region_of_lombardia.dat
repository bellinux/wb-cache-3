40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence to blood pressure (BP) -lowering drug therapy {{in a large}} population without signs of preexisting cardiovascular (CV) disease. MethodsA cohort of 209, 650 patients aged 40 to 79 years resident in the Italian <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lombardia</b> and newly treated with BP-lowering drugs during 2000 to 2001 was followed from index prescription to 2007. During the follow-up, the 10, 688 patients who experienced a hospitalization for a coronary or cerebrovascular event were identified (outcome). Adherence {{was measured by the}} proportion of days covered by the therapy with BP-lowering drugs. The cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence was measured through the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. ResultsEnhancing adherence from 52 % (baseline) to 60 % and 80 % led to a reduced rate for CV outcomes (from 85 to 83 and 77 events every 10, 000 person-year, respectively) and increased the cost for drug therapy (from € 1, 325 k to € 1, 507 k and € 1, 934 k every 10, 000 person-year, respectively). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased from € 76 k (95 % confidence interval € 74 k–€ 77 k) to € 74 k (95 % confidence interval € 72 k–€ 75 k) for each CV event avoided by enhancing adherence from baseline to 60 % and 80 %, respectively. ConclusionsEnhancing adherence to BP-lowering medications in the setting of primary CV prevention might offer important benefits in reducing the risk of CV outcome, but at a substantial cost...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development and}} validation of passenger car emission factors, using real world operation data. In total, six passenger cars of different technologies were studied. The tested vehicles were operated under various driving conditions and over two different routes in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lombardia,</b> Italy. These routes were specifically defined {{in order to provide}} a range of driving conditions, including urban, rural and highway driving. Tailpipe emissions and exhaust gas flows were measured on-board the vehicle, using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) In addition, all vehicles were tested over the European type-approval driving cycle (NEDC) with the same PEMS equipment.. The testing of gasoline vehicles showed that emissions are well below the emission standards and do not raise any concern. However, the testing of diesel vehicles both under real-world driving conditions and over the NEDC brought to the surface important concerns regarding the actual NOx emissions of modern diesel vehicles, since they seem to comply with the corresponding emission standard over the type-approval cycle, but they constantly exceed the specified limit when tested under real-world driving conditions. Results from real-world operation revealed that there is a significant deviation from the NOx emission standard limit (especially for the newly introduced Euro 5 technology). These observations raise concerns regarding the actual NOx emissions of modern vehicles and their impact on urban air-quality. The emission factors originally measured on the road are also compared to the corresponding COPERT average speed emission factors. In general, emissions of CO 2, THC and CO correlate fairly well with COPERT, for all vehicles. In the case of NOx emissions, emission levels of the two tested Euro 5 diesel passenger cars are consistently higher in urban, rural, and highway driving compared to the corresponding COPERT emission factor. Thus, leading to the conclusion that more experimental data are necessary, especially for post-Euro 4 compliant diesel vehicles of different engine capacities {{particularly when it comes to}} NOx emissions from diesel vehicles.

40|$|We used {{a set of}} {{previously}} published nonparametric attenuation functions to calculate average functions for the Italian region. These nonparametric functions describe the spectral amplitude decay of the S waves {{as a function of}} distance for 14 frequencies between 1 and 20 Hz for the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Lombardia-Piemonte, Eastern Sicily, Friuli, Marche and the Central Apennines. Since all the attenuation functions were obtained using the same methodology, we were able to make a fair comparison of the attenuation characteristics <b>of</b> the different <b>regions.</b> In general, while the Central Apennines show the strongest amplitude decay for all the frequencies analyzed, the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lombardia</b> and Eastern Sicily show the smallest attenuation. The Marche region also shows a strong amplitude decay, particularly for frequencies f > 3 Hz, and in the frequency band between 1 and 3 Hz the rate of decay of the spectral amplitudes with distance becomes similar to that <b>of</b> the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Friuli. Since the attenuation functions analyzed represent different geologic and tectonic environments, we used them to calculate an average set of attenuation functions, one per frequency, for the hypocentral distance range between 10 and 120 km.

Programa de Pós-Graduação em EducaçãoA presente dissertação é o resultado da análise de aulas de teatro {{realizadas}} de forma curricular com adolescentes do Ensino Médio e observa como exercícios propostos para aulas do mesmo tipo na Itália foram recebidas por alunos de uma escola de Florianópolis. Os objetivos desta pesquisa são: verificar como as aulas curriculares de teatro têm sido realizadas em uma escola de Ensino Médio de Florianópolis e nas séries equivalentes na região da Lombradia, na Itália, registrar a reação dos alunos da escola do Brasil aos exercícios propostos para o ensino da matéria na Itália; observar se as técnicas utilizadas nas aulas de teatro do Ensino Médio interferem no dia-a-dia de seus praticantes adolescentes e de que forma se dá essa interferência. Como metodologia foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica, complementada com observação passiva de aulas de teatro; um período de assistência a um curso de formação de professores na Itália; e a implantação de algumas das técnicas desenvolvidas nas aulas da Itália, para os alunos do Brasil. No final do processo foi realizada uma entrevista com os estudantes. Como referencial teórico utilizo principalmente Augusto Boal, Flavio Desgranges e Claudio Bernardi. No resultado foi possível verificar que, embora as aulas de teatro tenham uma boa recepção pelos alunos, que a consideram muito importante para trabalhar os próprios limites, desenvolver a confiança, a autonomia e o espírito de grupo, ainda existem muitas dificuldades a ser superadas para que seja realizado um trabalho realmente satisfatório. As principais barreiras a serem transpostas estão relacionadas com a carga horária que geralmente é insuficiente, com a falta de recursos dispensados para a boa realização das atividades e com o descaso dos demais membros da escola e também dos pais dos alunos. O período de estudos realizados não foi longo o suficiente para poder observar a influência das aulas na vida dos alunos envolvidos na pesquisa. The {{present study}} {{is the result of}} the theater classes analysis performed in a curricular way with adolescents of the High School and observes how proposed exercices for classes of the same kind in Italy were received by students of a school in Florianópolis. The aims of this research are: To verify how the curricular theater classes have been performed in a school of the High School in Florianópolis and in the equivalent grades in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lombardia,</b> in Italy; to record the students reaction of the Brazilian school to the proposed exercices to the teaching of the subject in Italy; to observe if the techniques used in theater classes of the High School interfere in the day-to-day of the adolescents trainees and in which way occurs this interference. As a method one research in bibliography was performed, completed with passive observation in theater classes; a period attending to a teachers formation course in Italy; and the implementation of some of the techniques developed in the classes in Italy, to the students in Brazil. At the end of the process an interview with the students was made. As theory references it is employed mainly Augusto Boal, Flavio Desgranges and Claudio Bernardi. As results it is possible to verify that although the theater classes have had a good acceptance from the students, who found it very important to work out their own limitations, to develop self-confidence, autonomy and the group spirit, there are still many difficulties to surmount in order to realize a really satisfactory work. The main obstacles to be transposed are related to the amount of hours which generally is insufficient, to the lack of resources spended in the good achievement of the activities and to the disregard of others members of the school as well as of the students fathers. The performed period of studies was not long enough in order to observe the influence of the classes in the life of the students involved in the research...|$|E

The phenomenon we want to analyse is the carpal tunnel syndrome surgery treatment. Nowadays, from an operative point of view, two different ways coexist in treating the problem: the day hospital (DH) and the ordinary hospitalization (OH) surgery. Causes of this dichotomy are not so clear. In particular, because of the simplicity of the intervention we can hypothesize that, given the effects of some observed factors, no other significant differences should be observed between different hospitals. We extract 16431 observations from the administrative archive <b>of</b> <b>Region</b> <b>Lombardia</b> Data used for this analysis refer to year 2002. The observations are clustered in 128 hospitals. The binary response variable, the hospitalization regimen, is modelled with a logistic regression. Fixed all the other observed variables (referred both at hospital and at patient level), we identify by a random coeffcient a signicant hospitals effect. Day hospital treatment presents lower costs for the national health service. The suspect of the administration is that DRG reinboursement system can create the premise for acting opportunistically. Administrations of hospitals are induced to choice OH instead of DH in order to obtain major reinboursement. The identication of hospitals presenting higher probability (resulting from the random effect values) in deciding for a OH instead of the more common DH could be useful for the administrative control system. Maximum likelihood results will be presented and different methods of estimation of random effects will be compared...|$|R
