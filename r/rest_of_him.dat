500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then I found an instrument, and through that I realized, that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIM</b> have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E

50|$|Berber {{people in}} Rif region have been {{awaiting}} instead for a museum dedicated to Abd el-Krim {{or at least}} bring the <b>rests</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> from Cairo, Egypt where he died in asylum in 1963.|$|R
50|$|On 11 January 2013 he {{was sent}} on loan to Botev Vratsa until <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the season. <b>Him</b> loan ended after he broke a leg on match day.|$|R
60|$|Though {{this was}} all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with the {{governor}} for his life; and all the <b>rest</b> begged <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for God's sake, {{that they might not}} be sent to England.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> like?" [...] {{asked the}} Wizard. [...] "Here are some pieces of blue legs and green arms, but I don't {{know whether they}} are his or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{encourage}} her admiration. 'He {{might be made}} useful on a farm,' I said; 'if his legs were {{as big as the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> he could draw a plow as well as an ox.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a boy!" [...] {{said the}} white man, {{shaking his head}} while he spoke, and {{addressing}} the father. [...] "Does he think when a hunter sees {{a part of the}} creatur', he can't tell where the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> should be!" ...|$|E
50|$|Frydrych {{was second}} to Thorkildsen once {{more at the}} Adidas Grand Prix in New York City, but a back injury spoiled the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> 2010 for <b>him,</b> and he only placed 10th at the European Championships.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] murmured Dick. [...] "Here is {{certainly}} news of Dan Baxter {{that is very}} much to his discredit. I hope I and Dora and the <b>rest</b> never hear <b>of</b> <b>him</b> again." ...|$|R
25|$|He drew up {{the rules}} from a {{hospital}} bed in 1985, when {{he was having a}} hip replaced, and the League of Veteran Racing Cyclists (LVRC) began in 1986. This time, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> cycling left <b>him</b> to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't know him," [...] {{the girl}} cried. [...] "You know {{just a part}} of him--the part you would know. All the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> is a good man, that would rather his self-respect than all the luxuries you mention--you included." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{his right}} hand, {{always a little}} larger than life, sat the Secretary, 'Down-by-the-starn' Hemmings; an all-too-sad sadness beaming in his fine eyes; his iron-grey beard, in {{mourning}} like the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> giving the feeling of an all-too-black tie behind it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my {{soul and}} my father's soul, in you go!" [...] I said, and, seizing {{him by the}} shoulders, I crammed {{his head into the}} mouth of the burrow, kicked the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in, and, sitting down, covered my face with my hands.|$|E
60|$|After that {{testimony}} {{from a man}} whose knowledge was to be relied on, the Sergeant was silent. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> us, like <b>him,</b> held our peace. With one accord, we all turned back up {{the slope of the}} beach.|$|R
60|$|The Professor {{knocked the}} ash from his cigar and {{replaced}} it in his mouth. His clasped hands <b>rested</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> There was a twinkle of something almost like mirth in {{his eyes as he}} glanced up at the Inspector.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be {{it as you}} please, my love," [...] he replied; [...] "I owe you {{too much}} to {{contradict}} you in aught which may render your solitary mode of life more endurable. Make of this youth what you will, and you have my full authority for doing so. But remember he is your charge, not mine--remember he hath limbs to do man's service, a soul and a tongue to worship God; breed him, therefore, {{to be true to}} his country and to Heaven; and for the <b>rest,</b> dispose <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as you list--it is, and shall rest, your own matter." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was so far}} a {{description}} of himself {{that he had the}} feet of an Elephant: but the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was skin and bone: and the wisps of loose straw, that bristled all about him, suggested that he had been originally stuffed with it, and that nearly all the stuffing had come out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stopped and}} felt the animal. He still hung by {{part of his body}} and by his forelegs {{to the floor of the}} dungeon, and by {{reaching}} out I could feel that the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> extended downward. I therefore seized his body in my arms, threw myself out of the aperture, and began to slide down.|$|E
60|$|The picture alarmed the boy. By {{a little}} stove inside the van sat a figure red {{from head to}} heels--the {{man who had been}} Thomasin's friend. He was darning a stocking, which was red like the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Moreover, as he darned he smoked a pipe, the stem and bowl of which were red also.|$|E
6000|$|Mont. How {{gratitude}} and love divide my breast! Both ways alike my soul is robbed <b>of</b> <b>rest.</b> But--let <b>him</b> die--Can I his sentence give? Ungrateful, must he die, by whom I live? But can I then Almeria's tears deny? Should any live whom she commands to die? ...|$|R
60|$|About the oak that framed this chair, of old The seasons danced their round; delighted wings Brought {{music to}} its boughs; shy {{woodland}} things Shared its broad roof, 'neath whose green glooms grown bold, Lovers, more shy than they, their secret told; The resurrection {{of a thousand}} springs Swelled in its veins, and dim imaginings Teased them, perchance, of life more manifold. Such shall it know when its proud arms enclose My Lady Goshawk, musing here at <b>rest,</b> Careless <b>of</b> <b>him</b> who into exile goes, Yet, while his gift by those fair limbs is prest, Through some fine sympathy of nature knows That, seas between us, she is still his guest.|$|R
25|$|Hippocrates {{described}} trigonocephaly as follows: Men's {{heads are}} by no means all like to one another, nor are the sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form. Thus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> it), in <b>him</b> the sutures <b>of</b> the head take the form of the Greek letter 'tau', Ï„.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh bother!' she said. 'I can't draw {{all of a}} carp-fish, but I {{can draw}} {{something}} that means a carp-fish's mouth. Don't {{you know how they}} stand on their heads rooting in the mud? Well, here's a pretence carp-fish (we can play that the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> is drawn). Here's just his mouth, and that means ah.' And she drew this. (1.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew I was a poet," [...] cried Syme {{in a sort}} of ecstasy. [...] "I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope. It was the {{spectacles}} {{that did}} it! It was all the spectacles. Given those beastly black eyes, and all the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> his health and his jolly looks, made him a live devil among dead ones." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter {{looked up}} to see a bird a little smaller than Welcome Robin. His head, throat and back were black. His wings were black with patches of white on them. But it was his breast that made Peter catch his breath with a little gasp of admiration, for that breast was a {{beautiful}} rose-red. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> underneath was white. It was Rosebreast the Grosbeak.|$|E
50|$|In the novel, Gulliver washes up on {{the shore}} of Lilliput and is {{captured}} by the inhabitants while asleep. He offers his services to the Emperor of Lilliput in his war against Blefuscu, and succeeds in capturing the (one-twelfth sized) Blefuscudian fleet. Despite a triumphant welcome, he soon finds himself at odds with the Emperor of Lilliput, as he declines to conquer the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Blefuscu for <b>him</b> and to force the Blefuscudians to adopt Little-Endianism.|$|R
25|$|At {{the deli}} counter, a patron recognizes Randy as the wrestler, though he denies it. The {{customer}} persists, which agitates Randy, who then cuts {{his hand on}} the deli's slicer and goes into a rampage in the store, hurling abuse at Wayne and the customers. Spurred by the fan's recognition <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and with nothing left, Randy decides to return to wrestling and reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah. He reconciles with Cassidy, though she begs him not to wrestle because of his heart condition. However, Randy explains to her that he belongs in the ring with the fans who, unlike the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> society, love <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|If the 1960s was {{the decade}} wherein Somers proved {{himself as a}} composer, the 1970s were the years wherein the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Canada honoured <b>him</b> for that achievement. In 1971, after he {{returned}} to Canada from his work in Rome, Somers was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, due to his national and international recognition as a composer. He was awarded three honorary doctorates; one from the University of Ottawa (1975), one from York University (1975) and one from the University of Toronto (1976).|$|R
60|$|There {{it was in}} a nutshell. The {{eyes had}} clearly come apart from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath choked in my windpipe. I had {{stumbled}} on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they belonged to the same species.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the wearing}} of a bright red tie would have been unexpected--a bright red tie after the fashion of a South-Western railway guard's! The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> by no means dandiacal, even the vanity of glasses long since abandoned. You would have reflected.... Where had you seen a crowd--red ties {{abundant}} and in some way significant? The truth has to be told. Mr. Lewisham had become a Socialist! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} a motor {{carriage}} with liveried servants drew {{up at the}} emporium entrance; a large lady, with a penetrating and rather hurried manner of talking, stepped out, followed slowly and sulkily by a small boy, who had a very black scowl {{on his face and}} a very white sailor suit over the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The lady was continuing an argument which had probably commenced in Portman Square.|$|E
50|$|In February 1894, Phelps' throat {{began to}} trouble him seriously, and the illness {{confined}} {{him to his}} home for days. He continued {{to try to keep}} up with his work and was present until the adjournment of the term. A few days later he traveled to the Hygeia Hotel at Old Point Comfort in Virginia, a resort that in the past had been a place <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> for <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|The short {{is based}} on the Willow pattern legend, with some major differences, {{including}} a dragon. There is an oriental scene, the Willow pattern on a china plate, that comes to life, telling the story of two young lovers who are disturbed. First, {{they have to deal with}} an angry and overweight Emperor who is the girl's father. He chases after them because the boy disturbed his <b>rest</b> and disapproves <b>of</b> <b>him</b> near his daughter. The two children are then chased by a fire-breathing dragon that eats the emperor (he thought the dragon's open mouth was a cave entrance).|$|R
6000|$|Now, {{upon your}} hypothesis, we must add; {{that even the}} Son of God [...] himself, however divine he may be thought, is really no God at all in [...] any just and proper sense. He {{is no more than}} a nominal God, and [...] stands {{excluded}} with the <b>rest.</b> All worship <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and reliance upon [...] him, will be idolatry, as much as the worship of angels, or men, or of [...] the gods of the heathen would be. God the Father he is God, and he [...] only, and 'him only shall thou serve'. This I take to be a clear [...] consequence from your principles, and unavoidable.|$|R
