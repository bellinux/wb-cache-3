40|$|Motivated by {{the style}} {{investing}} model of Barberis and Shleifer (2003), {{we examine the}} industry-wide investment decisions of <b>retail</b> <b>investors.</b> We find that <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> industry demand is highly correlated and strongly related to past industry returns. Moreover, industries heavily bought by <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> {{over the past year}} significantly underperform industries heavily sold over the subsequent year. Similarly, stocks in industries heavily bought by <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> underperform stocks in industries heavily sold, even after controlling for firm-level demand. Our results suggest that industry-wide categorization influences the investment decisions of <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> and has a significant impact on asset prices...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of whether the trading of <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> causes stock price anomalies. Our intent is to study settings in which <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> are most likely to have influence on market prices. Previous research suggests that <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> have more influence in small capitalization stocks, and argues that <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> are most likely to be irrational. Most theories of stock price anomalies hypothesize the presence of irrational traders. Consequently, we focus on stock price anomalies in primarily small capitalization stocks. Our data are from the Australian Stock Exchange Clearinghouse. The Australian stock market is characterized by a high level of direct stock holdings by individual investors, further enhancing the likelihood of retail investors' influence. We investigate the Granger causality between investor category trading and stock prices, and display the relative trading volume of the investor categories. We conclude that <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> are not responsible for stock mispricing. Since <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> do not affect prices in this carefully selected environment, we infer that their trading is unlikely to influence stock market prices. Our conclusion has important implications for theories, particularly behavioral finance theories, that are dependent on the influence of <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> trading in stock markets. <b>retail</b> <b>investor,</b> individual investor, asset pricing, behavioral finance,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} private {{remedies}} available under Rule 10 b- 5 to <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> {{who have been}} defrauded by false corporate disclosures. After comparing the treatment received by <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> to the treatment received by institutional investors, I identify several areas in which the federal securities laws disfavor <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> who have been defrauded by false corporate disclosures, including {{the creation of a}} two-tiered system of investor remedies for securities fraud. Institutional investors are permitted to pick and choose which law and forum offers them the most attractive chance for recovery, but <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> typically do not have this opportunity. They are forced to sue under federal law in federal court. I then show that disfavored treatment could lead <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> to question the fairness of the federal securities laws, contributing to a loss of investor confidence in U. S. markets. I conclude by exhorting policymakers to recognize that the securities fraud class action significantly disadvantages <b>retail</b> <b>investors.</b> Policymakers need to become much more aware of the plight of the defrauded <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> when considering reforms to private securities fraud litigation and when determining enforcement initiatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{purchase}} {{decision for}} a <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> is complex, {{and is based}} upon multiple attributes derived from impersonal and interpersonal information sources. In this paper {{we look at the}} important role that impersonal data disclosure plays in the selection and retention of Australia’s 2, 637 retail equity investment funds. We find that fund size, past performance, agency ratings, and the management expense ratio (MER) are widely used by <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> in investment decision making. We conclude that the only disclosure that provides any valuable utility to a <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> is the MER. As such, the MER should be the key selection criteria for <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> when making choices regarding investment funds. 5 page(s...|$|R

Previous research have linked different theories and models to explain why underpricing might occur and amongst the most cited theories by researchers are the information asymmetry, winner’s curse and signaling hypothesis. To investigate if there are profitable opportunities for <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> we chose to conduct a quantitative cross-sectional study on 68 IPOs from the years 2005 to 2011 in the Nordic markets.

Our results indicate that a January effect does persist in the Australian market, {{but it is not a}} result of <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> trading. Furthermore, <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> trading does not have a convincingly significant effect independent of market capitalization.

The driving factor behind the relative retail large allocation in overpriced issues when compared to underpriced offerings is not the underwriter allocation bias in favor of institutional <b>investors.</b> <b>Retail</b> <b>investors</b> subscribe more heavily to underpriced issues, consistent with individuals being partially informed.

30|$|Given the China {{market is}} {{dominated}} by <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> who are noise traders, we argue that more (frequent) information processed by <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> could add noise to share price. A recent working paper by Chan et al. (2015) shows that price informativeness improves after day trading was banned in the A share market in 2002. Presumably, reducing frequent trading of <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> improves information quality. To the extent that more frequent reporting enhances more trading, our result is consistent with theirs. However, it {{is beyond the scope}} of the current study to carry out rigorous tests on our conjecture. Nonetheless, we carry out a test that provides some indirect evidence supporting the conjecture.|$|R
40|$|In price-optimism models, {{differences}} of opinion lead to stock overvaluation, as optimistic investors hold stocks while pessimistic investors {{stay out of the}} market due to short-sales constraints.

Stocks are overvalued when both {{differences of opinion}} and small-trade imbalances are high, but not so when either of these two is low. In addition, mispricing happens before <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> start to buy. Therefore, it is not <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> who directly cause mispricing with their trades, but rather they delay the realization of negative information into stock prices and facilitate mispricing.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the fact}} that a {{substantial}} body of European Community (EC) law already exists to protect <b>retail</b> <b>investors,</b> the markets in retail investment services and products in the EU remain fragmented. Moreover, the recent financial crisis has undermined investor confidence in financial markets more generally, and “packaged ” retail investment products (PRIP), such as investment funds or life insurance policies, in particular. To rebuild <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> confidence in PRIP by empowering <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> to make active use of their rights, in 2009 the European Commission proposed to extend the provisions of the 2004 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) to PRIP. Is the MiFID, however, fit for the purpose which the Commission has in mind? This contribution explores to what extent the MiFID actually confers rights on <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> and empowers them to make use of these rights. The author concludes that investor rights and remedies should be taken more seriously when making European financial services law. The current overhaul of the EC legal framework for the provision of investment services provides a good opportunity to do so...|$|R
