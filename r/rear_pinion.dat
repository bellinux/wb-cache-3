50|$|In 1994, {{the slave}} {{cylinder}} on manual transmissions was moved {{outside of the}} transmissions bellhousing to allow for easier replacement, and in 1995 the Dana 30 larger U-joints were used axle U-joints (297x) and <b>rear</b> <b>pinion</b> U-joint (1330). For the 1992 model year, the YJ switched over to an electronic speedometer, outmoding the cable speedos on older YJs. 1995 was the only model year to have a fully galvanized frame and body.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this study is to find the optimum power {{contribution}} ratio defined as the ratio of traction force applied onto rack rail by front pinion gear and <b>rear</b> <b>pinion</b> gear of monorail used in this study. At first, relation between loading weight and applied stress was investigated when loading weight Mb on the bogie was changed. Power contribution ratio was estimated using this relationship. The effect of the condition of power contribution ratio on the normal stress applied onto the rack tooth was simulated using obtained relations. The optimum power contribution ratio of front pinion gear was defined as an effective designing parameter to reduce the stress applied onto the rack tooth. A reduction ratio determined with the ratio of maximum compression stress on the tooth considering power contribution ratio to that of conventional case was estimated when the optimum power contribution ratio was considered. It was found that most of traction force was sheared by the front pinion gear not depending on magnitude of traction force, because the revolutions of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>pinion</b> gears was directly constraint due to the link system of the connection in the gear box of current monorail. The optimum power contribution ratio was α= 0. 53 when the representative location of the contacting forces on front pinion gear was h 1 = 5. 6 mm measured from the root of tooth, and that on <b>rear</b> <b>pinion</b> gear was h 2 = 7. 0 mm, respectively. The maximum reduction with 47 % in observed compression stress was obtained by determining optimum power contribution ratio under the condition at 5. 54 kN of total traction force...|$|E
50|$|The Starion uses a {{traditional}} front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout. Many {{came with a}} limited slip differential and anti-lock brakes (single channel, rear wheels only) as standard features. The entire chassis {{was derived from the}} previous high-performance variant of the Mitsubishi Sapporo or Mitsubishi Galant Lambda sports coupe, with a MacPherson strut suspension and swaybars that were fitted to front and <b>rear.</b> Rack and <b>pinion</b> steering was not offered, instead gearbox steering was standard on all models.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle had an {{iron sight}} line {{consisting}} of rear receiver aperture sight protected by sturdy [...] "ears" [...] calibrated for 100 - 1200 yd in 100 yd increments. The bullet drop compensation was set {{by turning the}} range knob to the appropriate range setting. The bullet drop compensation/range knob can be fine adjusted by setting the <b>rear</b> sight elevation <b>pinion.</b> The elevation pinion can be fine adjusted in approximately 1 MOA increments. The aperture sight was also able to correct for wind drift operated by turning a windage knob that moved the sight in approximately 1 MOA increments. The windage lines on the receiver to indicate the windage setting were 4 MOA apart. The front sighting element consisted of a wing guards protected front post.|$|R
5000|$|The 350 TPI {{engine and}} 305 TPI with 5-speed manual transmission, were {{available}} {{for the first time}} on the IROC-Z. The new 350 (RPO code L98) was only available in the IROC-Z with an automatic transmission. The TPI 350 motor was visually distinguishable from the TPI 305, as the bumper cover decal had [...] "5.7L" [...] added to the [...] "Tuned Port Injection" [...] decal. It can also be determined by checking the VIN (8th character, F=305, 8=350). The 305 TPI equipped with automatic transmission came with 190 hp, while the Manual 305 TPI got a [...] rating. The 350 L98 gave a boost to 225 hp @ 4400 and 330ftlb @ 2800. All V8 engines received hydraulic roller lifters and new valve cover/head design. Valve covers featured new sealing and center bolts in the valve covers. Heads featured new raised lip for improved valve cover sealing and the two center intake bolts were changed from 90-degree orientation to 72 degrees. G92 and L98 cars got the Borg-Warner HD 7.75 in four <b>pinion</b> <b>rear</b> end, produced for GM's Holden of Australia (Firebird WS6 cars went to this unit in 1986). These units can be identified by their 9 bolt (rather than 10) differential cover that has a rubber drain plug. The Borg-Warner logo is also cast into the bottom of the differential case. This rear axle came with tapered rather than straight roller bearings and a cone-clutch rather than disc-clutch limited slip unit. These units came painted black from the factory while most others were bare metal. All 1987 350 TPI L98 IROC-Zs required 3.27 gears, J65 rear disc brakes, G80 limited slip differential, and KC4 engine oil cooler.|$|R
