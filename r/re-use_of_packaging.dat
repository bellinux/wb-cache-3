40|$|Summary: The {{transcoder}} {{project set}} out to develop and trial a cloud based service that can change one type <b>of</b> educational content <b>package</b> into another (i. e. transcode). Such a capability would help overcome the current proliferation <b>of</b> incompatible content <b>packaging</b> formats, which can be an obstacle to the dissemination and <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaged</b> learning content. The aim was to both test the technical feasibility of such a transcoder, as well as explore the business case for deploying it as cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS). In that regard, both the initial set-up phase as well as potential future business models were explored. Possible further developments of the service were also considered. The transcoder software was developed after a pattern established by a similar, advertising supported service for other kinds of file formats. The pattern is centred around a manual upload and download <b>of</b> <b>packages,</b> {{in order to facilitate}} maximal transcoding capacity without bottlenecks. The software itself was developed to be hosted on Amazon web services, {{for a variety of reasons}} that include flexibility of deployment, price and sustainability. In the event, demand for the service turned out to be low, which may have something to do with limited usage <b>of</b> <b>packaged</b> content in the JISC community, exacerbated by limitations of the design of the transcoder’s interface, and possibly also the range of conversions that were developed and are currently available. As a consequence, the low start-up investment costs as well as the scalable exploitation costs of cloud computing offered clear advantages for this type of service. Also, at this, or even much higher levels of usage the ongoing costs required to keep the service going are low. Finally, feedback from stakeholders indicate that a few simple extensions to the software could make the service more useful...|$|R

We have created a scientific IDL {{that focuses on the}} unique interface description needs of scientific software, such as complex numbers, dense multidimensional arrays, and parallel distributed objects. Pre-liminary results indicate that in addition to language interoperability, this ap-proach provides useful tools for the design of modern object-oriented scientific software libraries. We also describe a web-based component repository called Alexandria that facilitates the distribution, documentation, and <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> scien-tific components and libraries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to design new and {{innovative}} packaging for agricultural products with the use of eco-friendly raw materials, processes and practises. The products considered in this study were local Greek produce like olive oil, tsipouro, raki, fruits and vegetables. These products are currently packaged in a very conventional way and it is generally recognised that the current packaging solutions do not reflect the quality of the produce or the ecological trends worldwide. The whole study was based on the use of Computer Aided Design programs and other digital technology. Glass and wood was used for the <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> the fluid produce (olive oil, tsipouro and raki) and the raw material for the packaging solutions for the fruits and vegetables (crates) was olive tree pruning and wood wastes with the use of ecological glues. Other ecological aspects that were considered and utilised in the current proposal/study were 1. the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>packaging.</b> 2. the use of less raw material than current practises, 3. Ease of assembly and disassembly (separation) of materials...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the problem of}} pollution, which nowadays causes a serious damage to nature and therefore to human life. Despite warnings from nature, people are still {{not aware of the}} consequences caused by their irresponsible behaviour. That is why {{it is very important to}} raise awareness of the problem of pre-school children. With proper approach, patience and examples it is possible to inspire children with the sense of protecting the environment that surrounds them. The thesis describes some activities that present the problem in a comprehensible way to children. It also contains a list of all the books pre-school teacher can use while explain certain terms. The activities were accomplished in a group of children aged 4 to 5 years. Oral survey results show what the children already know about the problem and how much knowledge they have gained. Their knowledge has expanded through specific experience with waste, by listening to instructive stories, playing and creating with various waste materials. Along with proper waste management, children were shown options <b>of</b> <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> waste <b>packaging</b> and various materials for creative play and work in the kindergarten...|$|R

Some of our experiences and specific requirements of the real applications lead us to idea give the system possibility to run the tasks in distributive way. The result of the idea is task-based execution engine, which represents middleware-like transparent layer (mostly for programmers who want to <b>re-use</b> functionality <b>of</b> our <b>package)</b> for running <b>of</b> different tasks in multi-thread environment. The original system is being developed as open source with the intention to provide an easy extensible, modular framework for pre-processing, indexing and further exploration of large text collections. This specialized execution engine has been implemented within APVV project called PoZnaŤ (Support for knowledge creation processes) in order to extend proposed text-mining platform for educational and experimental purposes. Conceptual architecture {{of the system is}} provided as well as details regarding our extension of library like usage of content repository paradigm, representation and encapsulation of tasks, implementation of the engine itself and its role within PoZnaŤ platform...|$|R
