Sixty patients were randomized into a 5 -week treatment program, which consisted of only open kinetic chain tonification exercises (group I) (n = 30), or only closed kinetic chain tonification exercises (group II) (n = 30). Assessment of an aspect of neuromotor control was obtained by measuring the <b>reflex</b> response <b>times</b> of VMO and VL {{at the time of}} initial clinical examination, {{at the end of the}} exercise period (five weeks), and three months after the completion of the exercise period. At these evaluation occasions, the intensity and the number of times that the patients experienced anterior knee pain during daily life was recorded on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). No alterations in <b>reflex</b> response <b>times</b> of VMO and VL were observed in either group. Changes of anterior knee pain over time were statistically significant in both groups. Only small and not statistically supported differences in anterior knee pain were found between the two groups. These results suggest that the <b>reflex</b> response <b>times</b> of the two vasti muscles can not be altered after a five week open or closed kinetic chain exercise program.

40|$|Various {{authors have}} {{indicated}} that imbalance of the vastus medialis/vastus lateralis muscles might lead to patellofemoral pain syndrome. However, few reports have been published to substantiate such a hypothesis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to attempt to set a scale for the normal <b>reflex</b> response <b>times</b> of the vastus medialis oblique and vastus lateralis muscles after a patellar tendon tap and to determine if patellofemoral pain syndrome patients have an alteration in this firing sequence. A control group of 80 healthy adults was compared with a group of 19 patellofemoral pain syndrome patients. Results indicated that the <b>reflex</b> response <b>time</b> of the vastus medialis oblique was significantly shorter than the <b>reflex</b> response <b>time</b> of the vastus lateralis in the normal subjects (p < or =. 01). When comparing these data in the patellofemoral pain syndrome group, a significant earlier firing was obtained from the vastus lateralis in comparison with the vastus medialis oblique (p < or =. 01). These findings suggest that a reversal has occurred in the firing pattern of the vastus medialis oblique and vastus lateralis muscles in patellofemoral pain syndrome patients.

Design: Repeated-measures clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient physical therapy department. Participants: Sixteen subjects with ACL deficiency. Intervention: Subjects tested with and without a functional knee brace before and after an exercise protocol designed to fatigue the knee muscles. Main Outcome Measure: Latency of hamstring reflex muscle activity after sudden perturbation of the knee. Results: Wearing a knee brace shortened the hamstring reflex latency regardless of fatigue (F 1. 15 = 20. 62, P<. 001). Muscle fatigue lengthened the hamstring <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> regardless of the bracing condition (F 1. 15 = 7. 57, P<. 015). Conclusion: Wearing a functional knee brace facilitated hamstring muscle reflex, but muscle fatigue lengthened the hamstring reflex latency.

When the intencities of these pulses were respectively subthreshold with respect to reflex response, monosynaptic reflex spike was elicited in ventral root after these pulses. The interval constant from decreasing rate of the pulse intervals was obtained. 1. The larger interval constant of the pulses, the longer the <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> until the appearance of the ventral root spike potential became. The relation between interval constant and <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> is proportional and the ratio resulted in 0. 24 ± 0. 05 (msec/msec). 2. The EPSPs which were produced to correspond to each pulses summated temporarily and the cell fired when the depolarization reached to the critical threshold level. The larger the interval constant, the later the depolarization reached to the critical level, because the efficiency of EPSPs summation gets less effective. 3. The reason why the successful data were difficult to get in this manner in cats could be attributed {{to the fact that the}} inhibitory action of GIb and GII volleys might be activated by applying electrical pulses to the nerve, eventhough the intencities were controlled among seemingly GIa threshold.

The interstitial fluid pressure in the tibialis anterior muscle and subcutaneous tissue of the lower leg was found to fall significantly, while other transcapillary pressures (capillary and interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressures) were relatively unchanged. The total water content of the soleus muscle was unchanged during the head-down tilt. After head-down tilt, isometric strength and isokinetic strength of the plantar flexors were unchanged, while the triceps surae <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> associated with plantar flexion movement slowed slightly.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this study}} we aimed to compare {{induction}} of anesthesia with sevoflurane, to that with intravenous (IV) thiopental {{from the point of}} hemodynamic variations and side effects in adult patients. Material and Metods: Forty ASA class I-III patients undergoing elective abdominal surgical procedures were included in this study. No premedication was administered to the patients. The patients were divided into two groups randomly. After application of fentanyl 1 µg/kg, Group I (n= 20, thiopental group) received thiopental (5 mg/kg) and group II had (n= 20, sevoflurane group) tidal breathing with 50 % N 2 O combined with 6 % sevoflurane in O 2 for the induction of anesthesia. Tracheal intubation was performed after the administration of succinylcholine 1, 5 mg/kg. Systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial blood pressure (DAP), and heart rate (HR) values were recorded at preinduction, after induction, after intubation and 5 minutes after intubation. Loss of eyelash <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> and appearance of the side effects were recorded. Results: While SAP values at intubation were not significantly different from initial values in the sevoflurane group, a significant increase was noted in the thiopental group (p< 0. 05). DAP values of the thiopental group compared to sevoflurane group revealed a deeper decrease at the induction period, however they showed a significant increase after intubation. Dissappearance of eyelash <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> in thiopental group (38. 60 ± 7. 5 sec) was significantly shorter compared to sevoflurane group (67. 85 ± 11. 86 sec) (p< 0. 05). Appearence of the side effects were similar in both groups. Conclusion: We concluded that induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane may be an alternative to IV thiopental induction since it provided hemodynamic stability, was easy for patients to tolerate and had similar complication rates...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{prospective}} {{study was to determine}} the outcome-predictive role of various parameters in the nonoperative treatment of chronic anterior knee pain patients. Thirty patients followed a five-week treatment program, which consisted out of only closed kinetic chain exercises. Prior to this treatment all subjects were evaluated on muscular characteristics, subjective symptoms, weight, sex, duration of symptoms and functional performance. A multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that the <b>reflex</b> response <b>time</b> of m. vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) (P= 0. 041; 0. 026), and the duration of symptoms (P= 0. 019; 0. 045) were the only two parameters which were significantly associated with the outcome (evaluated by the Kujala score) at five weeks, and at three months. The shorter the duration of symptoms, or the faster the <b>reflex</b> response <b>time</b> of VMO prior to the treatment, the better the outcome after a closed kinetic chain exercise program. The statistical significance of these parameters in this study may be seen as an indication of the importance of these variables as predictors of the outcome of a closed kinetic chain strengthening program. Using this information, it seems clinically important to begin the treatment program before the anterior knee pain becomes more chronic and treatment results become less good. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{utilised}} an isolated triceps surae model {{to determine the}} effect of incorporation of AQUA TITAN titanium micro particles to the flexible tape on lower limb neural-musculotendinous function during recovery from strenuous running. AQUA TITAN-tape application caused a large reduction in short latency <b>reflex</b> <b>time</b> and attenuated the reduction in Achilles tendon stiffness seen with the non-treated control tape 48 -h into recovery. These observations suggest that the AQUA TITAN-treated tape leads to faster neuromuscular response to tendon load stimuli that is associated with restoration of tendon stiffness to the pre-loaded condition. The increase in plantarflexion ROM was consistent in magnitude to previous observations (Wadsworth et al. 2010) suggesting the effect of AQUA TITAN on ROM is robust, but small. The effect of AQUA TITAN tape on peak isokinetic force, however, was unaffected leaving the pre-study hypothesis that increased contractility was a mechanism for increased ROM unresolved.|$|E

The potential usefulness of Aplysia californica in aging research is apparent from its long history of neurobiological research, {{but it has been}} underexploited in this model use. Aging of simple reflexes at both single sensory neuron and neural circuit levels was studied to connect behavioral aging to neurophysiological aging. The tail withdrawal reflex (TWR), righting reflex, and biting response were measured throughout sexual maturity in three cohorts of hatchery-reared animals of known age. <b>Reflex</b> <b>times</b> increased and <b>reflex</b> amplitudes decreased significantly during aging. Aging in sensory neurons of animals with deficits in measures of the TWR and biting response resulted in significantly reduced excitability in old animals compared to their younger siblings. The threshold for firing increased while the number of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection decreased during aging in sensory neurons, but not in tail motoneurons. Glutamate receptor-activated responses in sensory neurons also decreased with aging. In old tail motoneurons, the amplitude of evoked EPSPs following tail shock decreased, presumably due to reduced sensory neuron excitability during aging. The results were used to develop stages of aging relevant to both hatchery-reared and wild-caught Aplysia. Aplysia is a viable aging model in which the contributions of differential aging of components of neural circuits may be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{variables}} have retrospectively {{been associated}} with the presence of anterior knee pain. Very few prospective data exist, however, to determine which of these variables will lead to the development of anterior knee pain. It was our purpose in this study to determine the intrinsic risk factors for the development of anterior knee pain in an athletic population over a 2 -year period. Before the start of training, 282 male and female students enrolled in physical education classes were evaluated for anthropometric variables, motor performance, general joint laxity, lower leg alignment characteristics, muscle length and strength, static and dynamic patellofemoral characteristics, and psychological parameters. During this 2 -year follow-up study, 24 of the 282 students developed patellofemoral pain.
