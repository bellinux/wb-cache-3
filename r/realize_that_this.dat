25|$|Around December 1240 {{news came}} that the Mongols were {{advancing}} towards Hungary. King Bela then installed front line defenses at the Carpathian Mountains, {{after which he}} returned to Buda and called a council of war and ordered unity against the Mongols. The opposite happened, however, {{as many of the}} barons were hostile towards the Cumans. The Hungarian barons noted that there were Cumans in the Mongol armies, but they didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was because they were conscripted into it and had no say in the matter. In particular the barons didn't trust Koten, {{despite the fact that the}} Mongols had attacked his people for nearly 20 years. This chaos pushed Bela into a corner; feeling he needed to show his strength and keep the rebellious barons onside, he ordered Koten to be placed under house arrest. This did not placate the barons and had an opposite effect of erroneously seeming to admit that the King harboured doubts about Koten, too. This angered the Cumans, who were far from happy about the actions taken against them, and who had done nothing to invite such actions and hated the Mongols. News arrived on 10 March that the Mongols had attacked the Hungarian defenses at the Carpathian passes. This prompted Bela to send a letter to Duke Frederick of Austria asking for help. Frederick had previously wanted Bela's throne, but Bela responded by amassing a vast army and marching to the gates of Vienna, which forced Frederick to step back. On March 14 news had arrived that the Carpathian defense forces were defeated by the Mongols. Ironically, given the suspicion of the Cumans, they were the only ones who seemed willing to fight the Mongols, the memory of the fate that had befallen them on the steppes still being fresh in their minds. At the time the Hungarian forces were cowered behind the walls of Sibiu. By this time Bela had lost control of his army and many towns were destroyed. Soon thereafter Frederick arrived, and, wishing to harm the country's defense (in revenge to Bela), he stirred up further feelings against the Cumans.|$|E

500|$|A {{week later}} on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped {{off by the}} paper, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time but Jagger, Richards and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were {{subsequently}} charged with drug offences. Richards said in 2003, [...] "When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a whole different ball game {{and that was when}} the fun stopped.

[...] He concluded [...] "German men of learning set to work to demonstrate the guiltlessness of their country, fondly believing that, if this could be established, the whole fabric of the treaty would collapse." [...] René Albrecht-Carrié wrote in May 1940, that [...] "article 231 gave rise to an unfortunate controversy, unfortunate because it served to raise a false issue." [...] He wrote that the German inter-war argument [...] "rested on her responsibility for the out-break of the war" [...] and if that guilt could be disproved then the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.|$|E

Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, writing: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". He countered criticism of the portrayal of New Directions' rival choirs, suggesting: [...] "at this point, everyone needs to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> show takes its jabs at everyone, but it always has a wink and a hug and {{lots and lots of}} love behind it." [...] Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson reviewed the episode positively, calling the [...] "Imagine" [...] performance [...] "a classic feel-good Glee moment, teeming with sappy but undeniable heart", while Aly Semigran of MTV deemed it her favorite musical moment from the show, feeling that it: [...] "honored the classic song in such a respectful way." ...|$|E
