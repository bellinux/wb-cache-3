5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen <b>radicals,</b> oxygen <b>radicals,</b> and hydroxy <b>radicals</b> react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine <b>radicals</b> (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other <b>radicals</b> to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid <b>radicals</b> produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction.

This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl <b>radicals</b> that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
