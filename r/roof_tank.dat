50|$|An {{external}} floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is {{a storage}} tank {{commonly used to}} store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate. It comprises an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats {{on the surface of}} the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> there is no vapor space (ullage) in the floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates breathing losses and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid. There is a rim seal system between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation.|$|E
50|$|Fixed roof {{tanks are}} {{typically}} used with products that have relatively low volatilities and flash points. Using a fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> to store a product with high volatility {{can lead to}} product losses as vapors escape the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|Floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> are broadly {{divided into}} {{external}} floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> (usually called floating <b>roof</b> tanks: FR <b>Tanks)</b> and internal floating <b>roof</b> types (IFR <b>Tanks).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tanks for a {{particular}} fluid are chosen according to the flash-point of that substance. Generally in refineries and especially for liquid fuels, there are fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tanks,</b> and floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> {{are meant}} for liquids with very high flash points, (e.g. fuel oil, water, bitumen etc.) Cone roofs, dome roofs and {{umbrella}} roofs are usual. These are insulated {{to prevent the}} clogging of certain materials, wherein the heat is provided by steam coils within the <b>tanks.</b> Dome <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> are meant for tanks having slightly higher storage pressure than that of atmosphere (e.g. slop oil).|$|R
50|$|The roof has {{support legs}} hanging {{down into the}} liquid. At low liquid levels the roof {{eventually}} lands and a vapor space forms between the liquid surface and the roof, similar to a fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> The support legs are usually retractable to increase the working volume of the tank.|$|E
50|$|During Deuchar's occupation, the {{servants}} quarters and buggy shed were built, and the gardens and avenue of trees were laid out. The house {{water supply and}} sewerage disposal system was also developed, with the water being pumped from the creek using a 2.5 horse-power Bailey engine, and the pump appears to have been set on a sandstone block platform. The water was pumped to a holding tank below the bathroom, then up to a 200-gallon lead lined wooden <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> supplying cold water for bath, shower and flushing toilet on the first floor. The large size of the <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> was probably due to the type of toilet system used, a rare feature at the time, which had been invented in 1778 and required high water pressure. The pump was also used to irrigate the gardens around the house.|$|E
50|$|A fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> {{is a type}} {{of storage}} tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many fixed roof tanks, allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. Fixed roof tanks without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, float gauges, and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|E

According to “Code of design for low expansion foam extinguishing system” and relative study results abroad, the fire fighting systems are calculated and designed to deal with full surface fires of large scale floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks.</b> It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities. The fire water supplying system is designed according to “Fire prevention code of petrochemical enterprise design”.

5000|$|In the UK, {{prior to}} the use of sealed {{expansion}} tanks, [...] "open" [...] tanks were installed in the roof space to accommodate the water's expansion; these had the disadvantage of being exposed to the cold air in the roof space. This, without effective loft insulation, could fall below freezing, and could cause the pipework supplying the tank to freeze. However, with good pipe and tank insulation, this was in practice quite rare. Although such systems were remarkably trouble free, there are concerns about the potability of water from roof tanks due to the possibility of contamination. The other major disadvantage is that the water pressure from a <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is considerably lower than mains water pressure, making the use of mixer taps sometimes unpredictable.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} {{it appears that}} the main flow of Glengallan Creek became {{diverted}} down Backwater Creek, for what reason is not known. By 1892 three dams had been constructed on Glengallan Creek to provide irrigation to the paddocks. Water was still being pumped from the creek in the 1890s, but by the early 1900s water was being supplied by a bore on the northwest of Mt Marshall to a holding tank near the woolshed, and the house water system was reliant on rain water. The original timber shingles to the roof of Glengallan were sheeted over with corrugated iron and stormwater drainage was introduced. Pipes were installed at both the northwest and southwest corners of the house, with the northwest pipe feeding into the stone lined channel that runs along the west side of house with sandstone capping pieces. Pipes also fed into the <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
40|$|Floating roofs {{are widely}} used to prevent {{evaporation}} of content in large cylindrical aboveground oil storage tanks. The 2003 Hokkaido Earthquake caused severe damages to the floating roofs due to sloshing. These accidents became a cause to establish structural integrity of the floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> in sloshing. However, many designers {{do not have a}} solution for the sloshing of floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> except for three-dimensional FEA computer codes. The three-dimensional FEA requires a long computational time and expenses. The sloshing of floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> is a coupling vibration problem with fluid and structure.

50|$|The {{house is}} set in {{established}} gardens with mature trees and still features {{some of the early}} outdoor structures and landscapes. The circular driveway {{at the front of the}} house is marked by the raised circular lawn with lantana hedge. Evidence of the former sweep of the driveway can be seen in the slight depression of the grounds to the north-west of the house. A landscaped garden on the northern side of the house consists of geometric garden beds set in concrete with concrete paths dating from about 1915. This area is lined by mature palms along its rear edge. A shed stands a short distance to the rear of this garden and includes some 19th century decoration, namely cast iron brackets. This was once the glass house and now stands as a timber framed structure with weatherboard cladding and a corrugated iron roof. There is also an underground brick water tank, 20 feet deep, the top of which is visible on the back lawn. This water tank is fed by another tank in the centre of the roof of the house not visible from the ground. This <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> catches the rain water which is then diverted into the underground tank. Similar tank constructions can be seen at nearby Baddow House and they date from the time of construction.|$|E
40|$|Storage {{of crude}} oil and {{petroleum}} products inevitably leads to evaporative losses. Those losses are important for the industrial plants mass balances, {{as well as for}} the environmental protection. In this paper, estimation of evaporative losses was performed using software program TANKS 409 d which was developed by the Agency for Environmental Protection of the United States - US EPA. Emissions were estimated for the following types of storage tanks: fixed conical <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> fixed dome <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> external floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> internal floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> and domed external floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> Obtained results show quantities of evaporated losses per tone of stored liquid. Crude oil fixed roof storage tank losses are cca 0. 5 kg per tone {{of crude oil}}. For floating roof, crude oil losses are 0. 001 kg/t. Fuel oil (diesel fuel and heating oil) have the smallest evaporation losses, which are in order of magnitude 10 - 3 kg/tone. Liquids with higher Reid Vapour Pressure have very high evaporative losses for tanks with fixed roof, up to 2. 07 kg/tone. In case of external floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> losses are 0. 32 kg/tone. The smallest losses are for internal floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> and domed external floating roof tank: 0. 072 and 0. 044, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the liquid with low volatility of low BTEX amount can be stored in tanks with fixed roof. In this case, the prevailing economic aspect, because the total amount of evaporative loss does not significantly affect the environment. On the other hand, storage of volatile derivatives with high levels of BTEX is not justified from the economic point of view or from the standpoint of the environment protection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{heat loss}} and surface {{temperature}} of the top surface and sidewall of large-scale floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is tested by the heat flow meter and surface temperature method.

Special attention is given on the calculation of thermal conductivity for the top surface and sidewall which finally deduced the total heat transfer coeffi-cient of large floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> Moreover, the heat loss of floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> in different working conditions is predicted.

40|$|Storage tanks {{have been}} widely used in many {{industrial}} particularly in the oil refinery and petrochemical industry which are to store a multitude of different product with crude oil as one if it. There are different types of tank such as fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> open <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> etc. Floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is which the roof floats directly on top of the product, with no vapour space and eliminating the possibility of flammable atmosphere. There are various industrial code and standard available for the basic requirement for tank design and construction. Commercial software are also available in the market for the basic design, hence tank designer would rely wholly on the software without detail understanding. Despite of the various standard and code, there is limited procedure and rules in designing the floating roof which result lots of floating roof failure and caused injuries and fatalities accident.

40|$|AbstractThe {{settlement}} data of {{oil storage}} tanks {{made of steel}} are measured by the measurement points located {{around the base of}} the tank wall. The measured settlement data need to be curve fitted in order to reflect the settlement distribution around the whole tank wall base.

The Fourier series expansion is used to analyze the measured settlement data, the fitting curves and mean square error according to different order are obtained. The fitting curve with minimum mean square error is selected as the most appropriate one that reflects the actual displacement of the tank base. The optimization method of curve fitting present is applied to analyze the measured settlement data obtained from the floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> and the fixed <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> Results show that different effects can be obtained with different order of the fitting curve.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{estimated}} that 95 % of rim seal fires are caused by lightning strikes.
