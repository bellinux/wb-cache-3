500|$|On Diorama, Silverchair {{worked with}} a new producer, David Bottrill, who {{replaced}} Nick Launay. Though Launay had produced the band's three previous albums, lead singer Daniel Johns decided that he needed someone [...] "who understood {{where he wanted to}} go". Johns believed Diorama would be [...] "the kind of record that people were either going to be into or were <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hate", and needed a producer who would understand the band's new direction. He interviewed several candidates, eventually choosing Bottrill and taking the role of co-producer himself.|$|E

500|$|In mid-September, the Brazilian singer Latino {{released}} the song [...] "Despedida de solteiro" [...] ("The Bachelor's Party"), {{which is supposed}} to be a cover of [...] "Gangnam Style". Many felt offended by his disrespectful lyrics, and some have called it a plagiarized copy of [...] "Gangnam Style". While Psy's original lyrics talk about the lifestyle of the Gangnam people, Latino's version is about a man that is enjoying his bachelor's party in a club, wanting (and having) sex with many women, so drunk that he says he does not know if he's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get married the next day.

My lawyer is following the case. I'm <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|When the Game Boy was released, Tajiri {{thought the}} system was perfect for his idea, {{especially}} because of the link cable, which he envisioned would allow players to trade Pokémon with each other. This concept of trading information was new to the video gaming industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition. [...] "I imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two Game Boys with special cables, and I went wow, that's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be something!"

Tajiri was also influenced by Square's Game Boy game The Final Fantasy Legend, noting {{in an interview that}} the game gave him the idea that more than just action games could be developed for the handheld.|$|E
500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{creation}} of the album, guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about [...] the band received for this decidedly [...] "non-scene" [...] record.

[...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|E

Michael C.

500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him.
