50|$|The Raggy Dolls is a 1980s British cartoon series which {{originally}} {{aired on}} ITV from 1986 until 1994. The series {{is set in}} Mr. Grimes' Toy Factory, where imperfect dolls are thrown into a <b>reject</b> <b>bin.</b> While unobserved by human eyes, the dolls come to life and {{climb out of the}} <b>reject</b> <b>bin</b> to have adventures. The series was designed to encourage children to think positively about physical disabilities, as well as teaching kindness, tolerance and humility towards others.|$|E
50|$|Sad Sack - A {{sample of}} {{a design that}} was deemed too {{expensive}} to mass-produce; his appearance is somewhat {{different from that of}} the others. He is the oldest of the seven Raggy Dolls in the <b>Reject</b> <b>Bin.</b> As his name suggests, he is very gloomy and cynical, but he still values his friendship with the other dolls.|$|E
50|$|M&M's Break' Em is {{a puzzle}} game for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, {{released}} in 2007 by Destination Software, Inc. (DSI). where you play as the Red M&M {{and try to}} stop Mr. Runch, a rotten and dangerous peanut, fiercely determined on {{being one of the}} M&Ms. He escaped the <b>reject</b> <b>bin</b> where he was discarded and he's on the loose in the Galaxy, where he is trying to kidnap and trap all of the M&M's into crystals until he can get what he wants: the chance to become a real M&M's candy.|$|E
5000|$|Bin Laden {{also stated}} that he viewed the House of Saud (the Saudi royal family) as apostates. [...] In Islam, the charge of {{apostasy}} is made against Muslims who have become non-believers and <b>reject</b> Islam. <b>Bin</b> Laden also objected to American alliances with the governments of Kuwait, Jordan, and Egypt.|$|R
5000|$|Mainstream politicians, {{including}} the Scottish National Party (which Souter has supported) largely ignored the poll result, and disputed {{whether it was}} a true reflection of public opinion. The then Communities Minister, Wendy Alexander MSP, criticised the poll stating [...] "I think what is significant about today's ballot is that two out of three voters <b>rejected,</b> or <b>binned</b> or simply ignored this glorified opinion poll." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{siege of}} Dammaj started in October 2011 when the Houthis, a Zaidi Shia-led rebel group which control the Saada Governorate, accused Sunni Salafis {{loyal to the}} Yemeni {{government}} of smuggling weapons into their religious center {{in the town of}} Dammaj and demanded they hand over their weapons and military posts in the town. As the Salafis refused, Houthi rebels responded by imposing a siege on Dammaj, closing the main entrances leading to the town. The town is controlled by the Houthis and the fighting was mainly centered on Dar al-Hadith religious school, which is run by Salafis, although its founder (imam Muqbil <b>bin</b> Hadi al-Wadi'i) <b>rejected</b> Osama <b>bin</b> Laden in the 1990s. The Salafis from Dammaj and the current imam of Dar al-Hadith, Sheikh Yahya Hajoori claims that they are totally against al-Qaeda and all that they stand for.|$|R
40|$|An electroexplosive-device (EED) tester was {{developed}} by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for the U. S. Army Munitions and Chemical Command under contract number DAAK 10 - 84 -C- 0206. The tester was designed to nondestructively evaluate (NDE) eight different electrothermal devices at production rates up to 45 parts per minute. The tester automatically removes the device to be tested from an input tray, places it in a test fixture, performs an electrothermal transient test, and places the device into an accept/output tray or a <b>reject</b> <b>bin,</b> depending on the quantitative decision made by an analysis computer. The entire NDE is done without hazard to the operator in a self-contained, purged enclosure. The accept/reject criteria are operator-selectable and are applied through use of Boolean statements. Test results and measurement accuracy {{are designed to be}} equal to those achieved using laboratory instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} two new online bin packing problems, {{the online}} Variable Cost and Size Bin Packing Problem (o-VCSBPP) and the online Generalized Bin Packing Problem (o-GBPP). We take two well-known bin packing algorithms to address them, the First Fit (FF) and the Best Fit (BF). We show that both algorithms have an asymptotic worst-case ratio bound equal to 2 for the o-VCSBPP and this bound is tight. When {{there are enough}} bins of a particular type to load all items, FF and BF also have an absolute worst-case ratio bound equal to 2 for the o-VCSBPP, and this bound is also tight. In addition, we prove that no worst-case ratio bound of FF and BF can be computed for the o-GBPP. Therefore, we consider a natural evolution of these algorithms, the First Fit with Rejection and the Best Fit with Rejection, able to <b>reject</b> inconvenient <b>bins</b> {{at the end of}} the process. Similarly, we prove that no worst-case ratio of these algorithms can be computed for the o-GBPP. Finally, we give sucient conditions under which algorithms do not admit any performance ratio, and conclude that the worst-case results obtained for the o-VCSBPP and the o-GBPP also hold for the oine variant of these two problem...|$|R
5000|$|Souter's {{campaign}} group {{approached the}} Electoral Reform Society to organise the ballot through its ballot services subsidiary. The society refused the request as it believed the poll [...] "would {{not be a}} legitimate democratic exercise to ask people to give an opinion on the repeal of Section 28 without knowing the detail of what would replace it". Many groups hostile to Souter's stance had called for a public boycott of the poll, and accordingly claimed that as only a minority voted this was a defeat for Souter and his supporters. Mainstream politicians, including the Scottish National Party (which Souter has supported) largely ignored his poll and disputed whether {{the result was a}} true reflection of public opinion, with the Scottish Executive stating that the public had been fed a diet of [...] "misinformation and lies" [...] by Souter's campaign group. The Communities Minister, Wendy Alexander MSP, criticised the poll, stating [...] "I think what is significant about today's ballot is that two out of three voters <b>rejected,</b> or <b>binned</b> or simply ignored this glorified opinion poll." [...] Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell stated that [...] "Brian Souter’s support for Section 28 is the moral equivalent of the business-funded campaign to maintain racial segregation in the Deep South of the USA in the 1950s." [...] Tatchell said that Souter's campaign was [...] "hateful" [...] and that it is clear that he was using his vast fortune to try to keep a cruel and [...] "bigoted law" [...] intact.|$|R
30|$|The IDI {{method used}} in this study for Saura data bases on the {{descriptions}} given by Palmer et al. (1995), but applying additional integration of complex time series or spectra and frequency decimation. For the five-beam scan experiment, we typically apply two spectral integrations and a subsequent frequency decimation by four to reduce the uncertainties of the individual points. For experiments with a large number of data points per beam, e.g., pointing exclusively toward zenith, a high spectral resolution and frequency span is available. In these cases it often appeared to be advantageous to utilize coherent integrations at first, but the resulting Nyquist frequency must permit the existing radial velocities to avoid aliasing. In addition, we clean the data by rejecting potentially erroneous scattering positions caused by ambiguous cross-spectral phases. The doubtful data points are detected as their radial velocity and associated detected zenith angle would exceed a horizontal velocity of 175  m/s. The weighting as described in Palmer et al. (1996) {{does not appear to be}} critical for the Saura. We, however, discard noisy data and with this unreliable scattering positions by applying a minimum SNR threshold of 3 to 6  dB to <b>reject</b> presumably unreliable <b>bins</b> of the cross-spectra.|$|R
500|$|Conversely, Andrew Harding {{has argued}} that the idea of {{substantive}} natural justice is vague and subjective, and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature. In his opinion, Article 12(1) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation. To determine whether legislation is discriminatory, a [...] is applied. It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice. Therefore, the extension of Article 12(1) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense. Further support for this argument {{can be found in the}} Privy Council's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context, their Lordships stating that they had to consider [...] "whether the consequence of the alteration [...] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice". The substantive review of legislation by the court was also <b>rejected</b> in Jabar <b>bin</b> Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor (1995), the Court of Appeal holding that [...] "any law which provides for the deprivation of a person's life or personal liberty, is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament. The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well." [...] Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law [...] "are the same in nature and function, except that they operate at different levels of our legal order, one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality, and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles".|$|R
