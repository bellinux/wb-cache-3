40|$|Developmental {{problems}} are often perceived as existing conditions, {{which must be}} alleviated. This often removes a policy from the factors that created {{the problem in the}} first instance. This paper suggests that a developmental problem must be defined as an internal behavioral tendency found in a system, so its causes can be determined before a corrective policy is initiated. Such a problem description is called a <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> in system dynamics modeling; it identifies the boundary of a model that could be built and experimented with to identify appropriate policy actions. The characteristics of a <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> and how it might differ from a historical record are stated. An experiential learning model reported earlier by the author elsewhere is applied to delineate the four learning cycles entailed in constructing a <b>reference</b> <b>mode.</b> This model is then applied to constructing a <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> addressing the food security problem in Asia using time series date from fourteen selected countries. Food security problem defined in this way would lead to policies that are different from those emphasizing increases in food production. 1 This paper emerged out of my efforts to teach system dynamics at WPI. I appreciate the encouragement of my colleagues and students, whose penetrating questions led to the growth of the problem definition process from one learning cycle to two, then to three and finally to four. I particularly appreciate the feedback from my colleague Isa Bar-On who reminded me that I was being lazy in my initial efforts in not bringing to fore all steps in the process...|$|E

40|$|Using {{conditional}} measurement on a beam splitter, {{we study}} {{the transformation of}} the quantum state of the signal mode within the concept of two-port non-unitary transformation. Allowing for arbitrary quantum states of both the input <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> and the output <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> on which the measurement is performed, we show that the non-unitary transformation operator can be given as an $s$-ordered operator product, where the value of $s$ is entirely determined by the absolute value of the beam splitter reflectance (or transmittance). The formalism generalizes previously obtained results that can be recovered by simple specification of the non-unitary transformation operator. As an application, we consider the generation of Schrödinger-cat-like states. An extension to mixed states and imperfect detection is outlined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe double-H quartz {{tuning fork}} has a (zyω) 5 ° cut shape[1], its {{structure}} and vibration mode are different with H quartz tuning fork clearly, {{and we have}} applied for a patent for {{the structure of the}} double-H quartz tuning fork gyroscope. It is desired that the driving signal has very high frequency stability and amplitude stability on the operation of the quartz tuning fork. But, the quartz tuning fork resonant frequency of the <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> may change with temperature, and if the driving signal frequency can’t automatically track the resonant frequency of the <b>reference</b> <b>mode,</b> the error signal will appear in the output angular rate signal. Based on the severe nonlinearity drift error induced by temperature change, a practical and precise composite model was proposed to compensate the error caused by temperature change. The double-H quartz tuning fork gyroscope temperature modeling was set up by test experiment and data processing at full temperature range, the accuracy of the double-H quartz tuning fork gyroscope was improved greatly by utilizing temperature compensation, and the experiment results indicate that the method is useful and feasible...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design new alternative methods for project tracking in creative industry environment. One of the research method is system dynamics modelling. A dynamics model accepts problems which were identified based on qualitative research and assessed using the system thinking method. A system dynamics model contains a project <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> which correctly and provably expresses the planned and actual project development in terms of scope and budget. <b>Reference</b> <b>mode</b> of the project was discovered on the basis of Earned Value Management method modification. System dynamics modelling suitability is demonstrated on a case study of a creative project called “Water for Everyone”. If the project is behind schedule, the simulation explains why it happened and forecasts further project development. Managers can use the modelling process to evaluate the impact of their decisions on the next stages of the project life cycle and adopt new management practices using scenarios. The published research is valuable for key stakeholders as it is practically focused on ascertaining essential information about the project progress...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a one-port mechanical resonance detection scheme utilized on a piezoelectric thin film driven silicon circular diaphragm resonator and discusses the limitations {{to such an}} approach in degenerate mode mass detection sensors. The sensor utilizes degenerated vibration modes of a radial symmetrical microstructure thereby providing both a sense and <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> allowing for minimization of environmental effects on performance. The circular diaphragm resonator was fabricated with thickness of 4. 5 µm and diameter of 140 µm. A PZT thin film of 0. 75 µm was patterned on the top surface {{for the purposes of}} excitation and vibration sensing. The device showed a resonant frequency of 5. 8 MHz for the (1, 1) mode. An electronic interface circuit was designed to cancel out the large static and parasitic capacitance allowing for electrical detection of the mechanical vibration thereby enabling the frequency split between the sense and <b>reference</b> <b>mode</b> to be measured accurately. The extracted motional current, proportional to the vibration velocity, was fed back to the drive to effectively increase the Q factor, and therefore device sensitivity, by more than a factor of 8. A software phase-locked loop was implemented to automatically track the resonant frequencies to allow for faster and accurate resonance detection. Results showed that by utilizing the absolute mode frequencies as an indication of sensor temperature, the variation in sensor temperature due to the heating from the drive electronics was accounted for and led to an ultimate measurement sensitivity of 2. 3 Hz...|$|E
