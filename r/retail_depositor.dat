In spite of the television images of long lines of depositors outside its branch offices, the run on Northern Rock was unlike the textbook <b>retail</b> <b>depositor</b> run caused by coordination failure. Also, contrary to received wisdom, its reliance on securitization was not an immediate factor in its failure. Rather, its problems stemmed from its high leverage coupled with reliance on institutional investors for short-term funding. When the de-leveraging in the credit markets began in August 2007, it was uniquely vulnerable to the shrinking of lender balance sheets arising from the tick-up in measured risks. Northern Rock shows that modern banking cannot be viewed separately from capital market developments. * I thank Charles Goodhart, Prasanna Gai and Stephen Morris for helpful discussions...|$|E
40|$|The U. K. bank Northern Rock {{became the}} first {{high-profile}} casualty of the global financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 when it suffered its depositor run in September 2007. In spite of the television images of long lines of depositors outside its branch offices, the run on Northern Rock was unlike the textbook <b>retail</b> <b>depositor</b> run caused by coordination failure. Also, contrary to received wisdom, its reliance on securitization was not an immediate factor in its failure. Rather, its problems stemmed from its high leverage coupled with reliance on institutional investors for short-term funding. When the de-leveraging in the credit markets began in August 2007, Northern Rock was uniquely vulnerable to the shrinking of lender balance sheets arising from the tick-up in measured risks. Financial regulation that relies on risk-weighted capital requirements is powerless against such runs. The Northern Rock case also offers lessons concerning the economics of short-term debt. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{financial}} services sector, {{the failure of a}} single institution can have a compounding effect on the sector, and on national and global economies. In particular, there is systemic risk from inter-institution lending, and this effect is more complex in Australia due to the small number of major players. In retail banking in Australia, following a similar practice in most developed countries, if an unsecured creditor is a <b>retail</b> <b>depositor,</b> their deposit is insured by the government. That is, if a retail bank fails, the Federal Government will make the depositors whole. The regulatory system, particularly the prudential regulatory system, is designed to protect depositors’ and borrowers’ interests, and this protects the interest of the government. The effect is that regulatory policy on banking has prioritised stability in consideration of the sovereign risk associated with the risk of retail bank failure. However, this approach also creates a policy dilemma. The dilemma concerns {{the extent to which the}} retail banking sector can attain the benefits of the vigorous rivalry from effective and efficient competition, without unduly risking stability and the potential of a devastating call on the public purse. Specifically, in the context of effective and efficient competition, there is limited competitiveness in retail banking in Australia. This is reflected in the static state of market share between the four major banks, and very slow and marginal improvements gains even by strong second tier competitors. Furthermore, the retail banking sector’s capacity for product and service innovation is limited. Although the absence of vigorous rivalry is conducive to stability within the retail banking sector, it is likely to detract from the welfare of retail banking consumers. Furthermore, the level of innovation may not be as high as is feasible and barriers, including prudential regulatory barriers to entry or expansion, mean that the extent of rivalry is unlikely to change without some form of promotion of competition. The paper consequently makes a four-point recommendation for the removal of the ‘four pillars’ policy:  	The four major banks are protected by an implicit government guarantee that impacts market operation with little observable benefit to consumers, and may be a source of consumer disutility.   	The four pillars policy has prompted increased vertical integration within the sector, particularly in the area of mortgage products.   	There are sufficient merger protections provided by Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).   	Competition and contestability arise when there are reasonably low barriers to entry and exit from the sector. It is not clear that low barriers to entry exist in Australia, and evidence to support this view comes from the failure of international banks to gain a significant toehold in the retail banking sector in Australia. One deterrent to entry is the regulatory focus on the four pillars. The authors recognise that this position is at odds with the view of the Financial System Inquiry. However, the rationale in the report of the Inquiry was to prevent mergers, and the current competition law achieves this objective. The paper recommends two specific policies to promote competition in retail banking without the structural intervention that would otherwise be required to improve the intensity of competition in the retail banking sector:  	Introduce bank account number portability. This would use ‘know your customer’ and central database systems in a similar form to those that have been used for mobile number portability in Australia for the last decade and a half.   	Introduce customer access to data held by banks to allow third parties to compare bank offerings across all banks.   Significantly, these two recommendations are consistent with the productivity proposals issued by the UK Government in July 2015. The research paper also examines crowd equity funding as a disruptive force in the banking sector, and recommends that crowd equity funding be permitted with the following safeguards:  	ASIC should take an active role in monitoring crowd equity funding and be willing to sue in case of fraudulent action.   	Any intermediary online platform should have a financial services licence with limited duty of care.   	There should be a cap for business raisings through crowd equity funding of $ 2 million in a 12 -month period.   Crowd equity funding is a social phenomenon. Through its use of social media, it has attracted people who have previously never been interested in investing in companies. Instead of being feared, this interest should be nurtured through the promotion of investors’ financial education...|$|E

40|$|On September 14, 2007, Northern Rock, a {{medium-sized}} bank specialising in residential mortgages, suffered the first substantial run of <b>retail</b> <b>depositors</b> in the UK since the 19 th century. It had previously adopted {{a policy of}} fast growth, largely financing itself by borrowing in wholesale markets and by securitisation. When the financial crisis struck in August, the wholesale funding markets closed to it and it {{could not get a}} further securitisation financed; so it became massively illiquid. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) had been focussing primarily on NR’s compliance with the Basel II capital adequacy requirement, and had been remiss in assessing the risks inherent in its overall business plan. After an unsuccessful review of alternative rescue policies, the authorities felt that a massive emergency loan from the Bank of England was the least bad alternative; closure would have probably led to contagion to other, similarly placed, banks. Unfortunately the news of the emergency lending leaked prematurely, and its interpretation in the media helped to trigger the run. The run was not stopped until the following Monday when the Chancellor of the Exchequer stepped in to guarantee all NR deposits, and then to provide 100 % deposit insurance to all other banks as well. bank run, emergency lending, financial supervision, deposit insurance, wholesale funding, securitisation...|$|R

The Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems (Core Principles) were first issued by IADI and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in June 2009, and updated by IADI in October 2014. IADI’s Core Principles promote best international standards in {{deposit insurance}} {{and support the}} stability and soundness of financial systems. IADI, {{in collaboration with the}} BCBS, IMF, the World Bank, European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI) and European Commission developed a Methodology for the Assessment of Compliance with the Core Principles. Such assessments include self-assessments and Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) reviews conducted by IMF and the World Bank, as well as country and peer review programs conducted by the FSB. Being a part of the FSB Compendium of Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems, the IADI Core Principles are used by international community in assessing the condition of financial systems. A comprehensive, credible and action-oriented assessment of a deposit insurer against the Core Principles identifies strengths and weaknesses in an existing system and forms a basis for improvement measures by policymakers. Proper application of the IADI Core Principles gives significant advantage in the pursuit of financial stability, pairing the right protection for <b>retail</b> <b>depositors</b> with more multifaceted aspects of crisis management.

40|$|A messy, disorderly and {{globally}} extremely serious economically disruptive {{disintegration of}} the euro zone {{and the collapse of}} its currency, a scenario some commentators call eurogeddon, is no longer just the talk of alarmists. At least two European governments have started working on contingency plans for such an eventuality, which would leave very few if any economies in the world untouched by the fallout. The euro was created on the premise that no extreme country-specific imbalance would ever pose a threat to the stability of the common currency area. An intergovernmental covenant on the Stability and Growth Pact was considered, on its own, to be sufficient. But recent crises in euro bond markets have highlighted the structural problems and the deficiencies of the euro architecture. Some analysts say the shock waves of eurozone governments defaulting on their debts would risk the collapse of the entire financial system, leaving banks unable to return money to <b>retail</b> <b>depositors</b> and destroying companies dependent on bank credit. On a broader front analysts at investment bank UBS warned that the most extreme consequences of a break-up include risks to basic property rights and the threat of civil disorder.

40|$|In late 2003 {{after two}} {{financial}} crises and {{many years of}} deliberation, the Russian Government introduced a deposit insurance scheme (DIS) aimed primarily at protecting the savings of the population. The DIS's stated objectives were to protect the right and legal interests of depositors, to strengthen {{public confidence in the}} banking system, and to encourage household savings. Recent official assessments of the scheme have been, at best, partial, have tended to use government statistics and have failed to establish a link between the banking sector outputs and the impact of the DIS. This thesis undertakes a detailed evaluation of the Russian DIS based on a comprehensive analysis of vast literature on deposit insurance schemes globally covering rationales for its establishment and its main features, {{as well as of the}} relevant Russian legislation and past attempts at evaluating the Russian DIS which were somewhat patchy. Adopting a cross-sectional, mixed methods approach, the study reports on the findings that emerged from a combination of surveys, interviews and observations conducted at six participating Russian banks in spring 2009. These were supplemented by documentary evidence from the banks and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency. To facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the data, a theoretical framework was devised, and included a set of success criteria and impact indicators. The results of the analysis indicate that the Russian DIS does not appear to have fully achieved its stated objectives. Irrefutably, the Russian Government failed to establish an effective institutional and regulatory environment which could have enforced uniform provision of information about the DIS to <b>retail</b> <b>depositors.</b> This is evidenced by visible differences among bank practices in relation to the implementation of the DIS. Consequently, as a result of these variations in implementation, the retail depositors’ understanding of the DIS and its perceived impact differs depending on which bank they patronise.

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of regulating banks and securities markets in many countries. The primary justification for bank regulation that is usually given is the avoidance of systemic risk, or in other words, the avoidance of financial crises. With securities markets it is usually argued the main purposes of regulation are investor protection and enhancing the efficiency of markets. Avoidance of systemic risk, investor protection and efficiency enhancement are not the only rationales. The achievement of broader social objectives, such as combating organized crime or facilitating home ownership, provides the justification for many other regulations. Table 1 summarizes the role of different types of banking and securities market regulations in achieving the four objectives of avoiding systemic risk, protecting <b>retail</b> investors and <b>depositors,</b> enhancing efficiency and achieving broader social objectives. It can be seen from Panel A that although banking regulation primarily prevents systemic risk most policies also impact a number of the other objectives. From Panel B securities market regulation is directed towards investor protection and efficiency enhancement. In recent years the relationship between banking regulation and securities market regulation has become an important topic. Emerging markets have been plagued by crises. The recent Asian crises are a good example. Most of these crises occurred in bank based financial systems and the non-contingent nature of banks' liabilities appears to have {{played an important role in}} causing the crises. Banking regulation failed to prevent the occurrence of the crises. This has led a number of observers to argue that Asian countries should rely more heavily on financial markets for raising funds and reduce the role of banks. This raises the important question of whether securities market regulation would need to be changed to focus more on systemic risk. The purpose of this paper is to consider the inter-relationship of bank regulation and securities regulation in order to consider whether a move away from a bank-based financial system towards a market-based system is desirable in terms of crisis prevention. Section 2 considers banking regulation while Section 3 focuses on the regulation of securities markets. As has been stressed, banking regulation is primarily designed to prevent systemic risk while securities regulation is primarily for investor protection and efficiency enhancement. But this does not necessarily imply that a switch from banking to market finance would reduce systemic risk. Sophisticated financial markets require the participation of many intermediaries and systemic risk may be created if any of these go bankrupt and there is contagion to the rest of the financial system. Changing regulation to prevent this may not be very effective. Section 4 argues that a better way to prevent systemic risk if there is a move towards market finance and away from bank finance is to structure bankruptcy law appropriately. Section 5 contains concluding remarks. ...|$|R
