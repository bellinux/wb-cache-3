25|$|First flew on 25 August 1973 and {{was used}} for spin recovery, angle of attack and fuel system testing, it was fitted with an {{anti-spin}} <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute.</b> The aircraft was loaned to NASA from 1976 for engine development trials.|$|E
25|$|Based on the MQM-74 Chukar target drone, the XBQM-108A was {{modified}} with a revised, delta wing with canard control surfaces. The XBQM-108A was {{fitted with a}} thrust vectoring system based {{on the use of}} vanes that deflected the engine's exhaust; the aircraft retained the Chukar's <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> and radio guidance system, {{with the addition of a}} radar altimeter and midcourse guidance unit based on that of the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile.|$|E
500|$|During {{the test}} on 13 July, the Hiroc reached a maximum height of , but lost thrust after 12.6 seconds {{and hit the}} ground at 48.5 seconds, [...] from the launch pad. Due to a mistake in packing, the payload <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> failed to open; a camera {{and a few other}} {{instruments}} survived, so the test was deemed a partial success.|$|E
50|$|The {{next four}} flights saw the nose cone <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> fail.|$|R
50|$|NIIPS {{has played}} a major role in {{parachute}} design and development for the Russian Space Program, including <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> for Soyuz, Buran, and Energia booster rockets and the Progress return capsule.|$|R
50|$|If the {{emergency}} {{happened on the}} launch pad, the LES would lift the Command Module to a sufficient height to allow the <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> to deploy safely before coming {{in contact with the}} ground.|$|R
2500|$|Flying club version, {{optimised}} {{for training}} etc. [...] Ballistic <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The Cirrus SR22 is {{equipped}} with a whole-plane emergency <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> system: [...] the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). This has contributed to its market success and has given it the name [...] "the plane with the parachute".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{options are}} to be offered, {{including}} a 3ft6in (1050mm) shorter span wing which will raise the cruising speed by 25mph (41km/h; 22kn) but also increase the stall speed by 32%, a retractable undercarriage and a ballistic <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute.</b> [...] Kits will be offered to meet either US Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) rules or European microlight regulations but flyaway aircraft will be built to LSA rules. [...] Other engines, such as Rotax variants in the 100-115hp (75-86kW) power range may be fitted.|$|E
50|$|BP-23 {{launched}} for A-002 to {{test the}} Launch Escape System and <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> on December 8, 1964. It was refurbished, designated BP-23A, and exercised the Launch Escape System again in Launch Pad Abort Test 2, June 29, 1965.|$|R
50|$|The first {{ballistic}} <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> were on {{the market}} in 1982, and the first deployment was in 1983. Between then and April 2007, over 225 people were aboard 201 aircraft which deployed BRS parachutes; most of whose lives were presumably saved by those parachute deployments.|$|R
40|$|The studies, the development, and {{the testing}} program {{that led to}} the design and {{delivery}} of all flight hardware are described. Special emphasis was placed on the <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes.</b> The parachutes were designed to deploy in a severe environment and safely lower to Earth an 85 ton rocket motor casing...|$|R
2500|$|The {{teardrop}} shaped pod {{is mounted}} below the wing and braced to it, {{with a single}} faired lift strut on each side from its lower part. [...] Access to the side-by-side seating is by large glazed doors. [...] There is a luggage area behind the seats and a rear transparency. [...] The tricycle undercarriage is short, placing the Sigma close to the ground. [...] All wheels are on cantilever spring legs and enclosed by fairings. [...] The nosewheel leg is horizontal and the wheel casters. [...] The Sigma can also be configured as a floatplane, the floats attached with a complex of struts. [...] A MVEN K-600-00 ballistic <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> is standard on Russian aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|N162CE was {{involved}} in an accident during a test flight on 19 March 2009 near Wichita, Kansas. During aggressive spin testing, with power on and in a cross-controlled condition, the aircraft entered a [...] "rapid and disorienting spin" [...] and the test pilot was unable to recover control of the aircraft. The test pilot successfully deployed the aircraft's ballistic <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute,</b> which stopped the spin, but, despite being designed to be jettisonable, could not be released from the aircraft. [...] Since the aircraft was too low for a bail-out, the pilot remained with the aircraft, which crash-landed, sustaining damage to the landing gear, but left the pilot uninjured. The pilot exited the aircraft and attempted to remove the parachute, which remained attached to the aircraft. Wind then dragged the aircraft [...] into a fence, leaving it inverted and heavily damaged. The accident left Cessna with no flying Skycatcher aircraft in the testing program.|$|E

50|$|Launch was by RATO booster or bungee catapult, and <b>recovery</b> by <b>parachute.</b>|$|R
50|$|First {{flight of}} the vehicle, {{launched}} on 15 August 2014 from Pipinas, Punta Indio Partido. It successfully tested propulsion, control, and navigation subsystems. 2,200 m apogee, 27 seconds flight time. It landed in the sea assisted by the <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes.</b> Once the vehicle is recovered it will be examined to determine whether further VEx-1 test rockets are required or VEx-2 can be implemented.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the terms}} [...] "solid rocket motor" [...] and [...] "solid rocket booster" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably, in {{technical}} use they have specific meanings. The term [...] "solid rocket motor" [...] applied to the propellant, case, igniter and nozzle. [...] "Solid rocket booster" [...] applied to the entire rocket assembly, which included the rocket motor {{as well as the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes,</b> electronic instrumentation, separation rockets, range safety destruct system, and thrust vector control.|$|R
50|$|The factory kit {{options include}} a {{complete}} cockpit enclosure, brakes, quick build option, Ballistic <b>Recovery</b> Systems <b>parachute</b> and steel tube powder coating.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{cannot be}} {{recovered from a}} spin using only their own flight control surfaces and must {{not be allowed to}} enter a spin under any circumstances. If an aircraft has not been certified for spin recovery, it should be assumed that spins are not recoverable and are unsafe in that aircraft. Important safety equipment, such as stall/spin <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes,</b> which generally are not installed on production aircraft, are used during testing and certification of aircraft for spins and spin recovery.|$|R
50|$|A {{parachute}} recoverable training round, the RSC-57, {{was developed}} which was {{powered by a}} reduced burn time rocket motor with the <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> replacing the warhead.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is powered}} by two Austro Engine AE55 rotary engines and {{will be able to}} lift a 250 lb sensor payload for 6.5 hours of flight endurance or four hours of hover endurance. It also has a <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute.</b>|$|E
50|$|The cockpit {{walls and}} windows are very thick, able to {{withstand}} an engine explosion. Additionally, the cockpit is detachable and is equipped with two rocket propelled parachutes (main and back-up). The aircraft {{will have a very}} large <b>recovery</b> <b>parachute</b> and a smaller anti-stall parachute.|$|E
50|$|The CM will be {{built of}} the aluminium-lithium alloy used on the Space Shuttle {{external}} tank, and the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. The CM will be covered in the same Nomex felt-like thermal protection blankets used on parts on the shuttle not subject to critical heating, such as the payload bay doors. The reusable <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> {{will be based on}} the parachutes used on both the Apollo spacecraft and the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, and will also use the same Nomex cloth for construction. Water landings will be the exclusive means of recovery for the Orion CM.|$|R

50|$|The decoys {{worked so}} well that the Air Force ordered another batch of ten, with a few minor improvements, and {{designated}} them Model 147NX. The initial Model 147Ns had been programmed to turn back and head for home in order to simulate a normal operational drone flight profile, {{and a few of}} them surprisingly did make it back, even with their limited fuel supply. They crashed, since they were not designed to be recovered, but the recovery system was not expensive and so the Model 147NX was fitted with <b>recovery</b> <b>parachutes</b> and gear, as well as a cheap camera. If the decoy survived the mission, it might provide useful intelligence.|$|R
