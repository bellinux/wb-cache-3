5|$|Following the {{re-election}} of President George W. Bush and Bayh's re-election as a Senator from Indiana, Bayh {{considered the}} possibility of running for president in 2008. Although Bush carried Bayh's home state by 20 points, Bayh won 61% of the vote, solidifying the Senator's appeal to moderate and <b>Republican</b> <b>voters.</b> After serving four years as {{the chair of the}} Democratic Leadership Council, Bayh hoped to even further demonstrate his position as a moderate by helping to found the Third Way Political Action Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, {{making the}} 1892 {{election}} a rematch {{of the one}} four years earlier. The tariff revisions {{of the past four}} years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position. Many westerners, traditionally <b>Republican</b> <b>voters,</b> defected to the new Populist Party candidate, James Weaver, who promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike rebounded against the Republicans as well, although the federal government did not take action.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. <b>Republican</b> <b>voters</b> were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, {{incumbent}} Pryce {{announced her}} retirement {{at the end}} of her elected term. The Democrats felt that the seat continued to be vulnerable. Kilroy announced her intention to again seek the 15th District seat in 2008. She ran against Republican Steve Stivers, a State Senator from the 16th District, Libertarian Mark M. Noble, and Independent candidate Don Elijah Eckhart. The race was considered to be one of the most important U.S. House of Representatives races to watch in the country. The last Democrat to hold the 15th district was Robert T. Secrest in the mid-1960s, but with <b>Republican</b> <b>voters</b> moving out of the district into the northern suburbs of Columbus, Ohio since the 1990s, the district became more evenly matched.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among <b>Republican</b> <b>voters.</b> A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 cash on hand from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E
5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul {{went on to win the}} straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average <b>Republican</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

5|$|On August 29, 2008, McCain {{revealed}} Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as {{his surprise}} choice for running mate. McCain {{was only the}} second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after Walter Mondale) to select a woman for his running mate and the first Republican to do so; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if McCain had been elected. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees, respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core <b>Republican</b> <b>voters</b> who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888. The legislative revisions {{of the past four}} years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners, traditionally <b>Republican</b> <b>voters,</b> defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.|$|E
25|$|The Manhattan Institute {{reported}} that 78% of likely <b>Republican</b> <b>voters</b> favor a proposal combining increased border security, tougher penalties for employers who hire illegal workers, and allowing illegal immigrants {{to register for}} a temporary worker program that includes a path to citizenship.

25|$|To counter vote {{fraud in}} the Democratic stronghold of New York City, Grant sent in tens of {{thousands}} of armed, uniformed federal marshals and other election officials to regulate the 1870 and subsequent elections.

On October 21, 1876 President Grant deployed troops to protect black and white <b>Republican</b> <b>voters</b> in Petersburg, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|In the November 2002 gubernatorial election, he {{defeated}} Republican State Attorney General Mike Fisher 53% to 44%. Rendell won {{not only}} Philadelphia County, which is heavily Democratic, but also traditionally Republican suburbs of Philadelphia, {{largely due to}} his popularity as mayor of Philadelphia. These traditionally <b>Republican</b> <b>voters</b> who backed Rendell were called Rendellicans {{in other parts of}} the state and were a key part of the success of his campaign.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Ron Paul, Congressman of Texas, began in early 2007 {{when he announced}} his candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination for President of the United States.

50|$|The Democratic {{strategy}} for {{victory in the}} South was highly reliant on paramilitary {{groups such as the}} Red Shirts and the White League.

They saw themselves as the military wing of the Democratic Party.|$|R
