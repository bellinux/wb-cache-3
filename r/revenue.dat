40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} ideology on tax <b>revenues</b> in Latin America, using a panel of 17 countries from 1990 to 2010. As a first approach, a fixed- effects model is used to identify the impact of ideology on taxation; left-leaning governments are associated with increases in total tax <b>revenues</b> and income tax <b>revenues</b> of 2. 1 and 1. 3 percent of GDP, respectively. There is no effect on <b>revenues</b> from VAT or social security taxes. To deal with endogeneity problems, an event study and a difference in difference methodology are used to track the behavior of <b>revenues</b> {{around the time of}} the shifts to the left. Tax <b>revenues</b> and income tax <b>revenues</b> increase by 1. 5 and 0. 8 percent of GDP when comparing <b>revenues</b> immediately before and after the shift in ideology. The pattern of tax <b>revenues</b> around ideological shifts suggests that the effects are causal. ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the <b>revenue</b> of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual <b>revenue</b> of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} <b>revenue</b> of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their <b>revenue</b> from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both <b>revenue</b> collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E

40|$|State {{and local}} {{government}} tax <b>revenues</b> dropped steeply following the most severe housing market contraction since the Great Depression. We identify five main channels through which the housing market affects state and local tax revenues: property tax <b>revenues,</b> transfer tax <b>revenues,</b> personal income tax <b>revenues,</b> direct sales tax <b>revenues</b> (through construction materials) and indirect sales tax <b>revenues</b> (through the link between housing wealth and consumption). We find that historically property tax <b>revenues</b> do not tend to decrease following house price declines. Similarly, property tax collections have yet to fall on average during the current housing market contraction. On the basis of state-level case studies we conclude that the current resilience of property tax receipts is due to significant lags between market and assessed values and the tendency of policy makers offset declines in the tax base with higher tax rates. The other four channels have had a relatively modest effect on state tax <b>revenues.</b> We calculate that the combined channels reduced tax <b>revenues</b> by $ 14 billion from 2005 to 2009, which is less than 2 percent of total state own-source <b>revenues</b> in 2005. We conclude that the recent contraction {{in state and local}} tax <b>revenues</b> has been driven primarily by the general economic recession, rather than the housing market per-se. I...|$|R
