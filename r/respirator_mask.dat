2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a <b>respirator</b> <b>mask</b> when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure. Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level[...] Severe exposure may result in [...] changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas {{has been used as a}} weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq.|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{protective}} masks {{were introduced}} more than 80 years ago. However, improvements {{can still be}} made. A model that predicts {{the effects of a}} respirator on a person would allow respirator design to proceed more rapidly.

A previously designed model, Coyne’s (2001) model, does not predict performance time, oxygen consumption and minute ventilation well when exercise intensity is above the anaerobic threshold. Coyne’s study aimed at exercise during steady state, and thus no transient effects were included in the study. The goals of this research were to: 1) extend Coyne’s (2001) model of the pulmonary effects while wearing a respirator to severe exercise conditions(exercise at an intensity above the anaerobic threshold); 2) modify the model to include transient effects; and 3) correctly predict exercise performance time with and without a <b>respirator</b> <b>mask.</b> This model emphasized respiratory responses and incorporated mathematical descriptions of experimental results obtained from exercising humans.

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that wearing a respirator increases the physiological load {{imposed on the}} user. However, there is little quantitative evidence {{of the impact of}} respiratory protection on thermal strain imposed on the user {{as a function of the}} total individual protective ensemble (IPE). This pilot study aims to use the novel technique of Thermal Imaging (TI) to assess the heat status of the face and thermal strain associated with wearing the S 10 respirator. The physiological (rectal and tympanic temperatures, heart rate), psychophysical (thermal sensation and discomfort, perceived exertion) and thermal effects (thermal imaging) of the S 10 respirator were measured in four healthy males (31 ± 4. 5 yrs). Each subject completed two 45 min trials consisting of acclimation (10 min), treadmill walking (30 min) and rest (5 min) in a hot environment (30 °C dry bulb and 60 % relative humidity), while wearing the UK MK IV overgarment with the S 10 <b>respirator</b> (<b>MASK)</b> and without (CON). Generally, there was no additional thermal strain while wearing the S 10 respirator. However, subjects reported thermal discomfort of the face as being significantly (p< 0. 05) more uncomfortable after 30 mins of exercise compared to being unmasked. In conclusion, the mask partially inhibited evaporative cooling of the face giving the user the perception of being more heat stressed than when unmasked, which was not matched by the recorded physiological strain. It is recommended that the design of the respirator require no significant alteration to reduce any perceived thermal load. RELEASE LIMITATIO...|$|E
