40|$|Exercise-related {{transient}} {{abdominal pain}} (ETAP), {{commonly referred to}} as ‘stitch’, is an ailment well known in many sporting activities. It is especially prevalent in activities that involve repetitive torso movement with the torso in an extended position, such as running and horse riding. Approximately 70 % of runners report experiencing the pain in the past year and in a single running event approximately one in five participants can be expected to suffer the condition. ETAP is a localized pain that is most common in the lateral aspects of the mid abdomen along the costal border, although it may occur in any region of the abdomen. It may also be related to shoulder tip pain, which is the <b>referred</b> <b>site</b> from tissue innervated by the phrenic nerve. ETAP tends to be sharp or stabbing when severe, and cramping, aching, or pulling when less intense. The condition is exacerbated by the postprandial state, with hypertonic beverages being particularly provocative. ETAP is most common in the young but is unrelated to sex or body type. Well trained athletes are not immune from the condition, although they may experience it less frequently. Several theories have been presented to explain the mechanism responsible for the pain, including ischemia of the diaphragm; stress on the supportive visceral ligaments that attach the abdominal organs to the diaphragm; gastrointestinal ischemia or distension; cramping of the abdominal musculature; ischemic pain resulting from compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament; aggravation of the spinal nerves; and irritation of the parietal peritoneum. Of these theories, irritation of the parietal peritoneum best explains the features of ETAP; however, further investigations are required. Strategies for managing the pain are largely anecdotal, especially given that its etiology remains to be fully elucidated. Commonly purported prevention strategies include avoiding large volumes of food and beverages for at least 2 hours prior to exercise, especially hypertonic compounds; improving posture, especially in the thoracic region; and supporting the abdominal organs by improving core strength or wearing a supportive broad belt. Techniques for gaining relief from the pain during an episode are equivocal. This article presents a contemporary understanding of ETAP, which historically has received little research attention but over the past 15 years has been more carefully studied...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if an interactive web-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme is a feasible alternative to conventional PR. Randomised controlled feasibility trial. Participants with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were recruited from PR assessments, primary care and community rehabilitation programmes. Patients randomised to conventional rehabilitation started the programme according to the standard care at their <b>referred</b> <b>site</b> on the next available date. 103 patients were recruited to the study and randomised: 52 to conventional rehabilitation (mean (±SD) age 66 (± 8) years, Medical Research Council (MRC) 3 (IQR 2 - 4)); 51 to the web arm (mean (±SD) age 66 (± 10) years, MRC 3 (IQR 2 - 4)). Participants had to be willing to participate in either arm of the trial, have internet access and be web literate. Patients randomised to the web-based programme worked through the website, exercising and recording their progress as well as reading educational material. Conventional PR consisted of twice weekly, 2 hourly sessions (an hour for exercise training and an hour for education). Recruitment rates, eligibility, patient preference and dropout and completion rates for both programmes were collected. Standard outcomes for a PR assessment including measures of exercise capacity and quality of life questionnaires were also evaluated. A statistically significant improvement (p≤ 0. 01) was observed within each group in the endurance shuttle walk test (WEB: mean change 189 ± 211. 1; PR classes: mean change 184. 5 ± 247. 4  s) and Chronic Respiratory disease Questionnaire-Dyspnoea (CRQ-D; WEB: mean change 0. 7 ± 1. 2; PR classes: mean change 0. 8 ± 1. 0). However, there were no significant differences between the groups in any outcome. Dropout rates were higher in the web-based programme (57 % vs 23 %). An interactive web-based PR programme is feasible and acceptable when compared with conventional PR. Future trials maybe around choice-based PR programmes for select patients enabling stratification of patient care. ISRCTN 03142263; Results.

40|$|Contrasting the day-night {{variation}} in thermal landscape, the higher local variation and irregularity on urban surface temperature pattern during daytime was observed and identified by landscape metrics {{compared with those}} of nighttime pattern. The diversity and fragmentation metrics had revealed the influence of urban development on the overall urban landscape pattern. Along with urban development, daytime pattern of urban thermal landscape presented more fragmentation, less diversity and uneven texture distribution within daytime observations. During the process of worldwide urbanization along with high rise and high density housing development in large cities, urban warming has received growing concern among many environmental issues related to urban landscape change. Due to the complicated interplay between urban environment and local climate, it is far from certain about the urban effects on local warming. In this literature, a systematic monitoring and analysis of the spatial dependency and heterogeneity of urban thermal landscape at city scale remains inadequate. The goal of this doctoral research is to develop a research framework incorporating geospatial statistics, thermal infrared remote sensing and landscape ecology to study the urban effect on local surface thermal landscape regarding both the pattern and process. GWR analysis offered an in-depth investigation of local effect on surface temperature variation which had been proven to be spatially varying and influenced by local weather condition with local environmental setting quantified with the <b>referred</b> <b>site</b> specific environmental factors. The local dominant factor accounted for most to the site specific surface temperature variation which varied significantly in space and time and prevented a general delineation of the relative association among environmental factors to surface temperature disparities. The effective adaptive measures could be devised locally with reference to day-night needs in the identification of this feature. In summary, global regression analysis confirmed the relationship between environmental factors and surface temperature and gave a general overview of urban effect on local surface warming. The distinctive mechanism of dominating day-night surface warming was uncovered by regression analysis. Vegetation played the most important role which could be referred as surface cooling in average to local surface temperature variation as compared with other measures of local environment during both daytime and nighttime. Besides the dominant role of local solar radiation on surface warming, building square footage demonstrated the second important influence on local surface temperature elevation during daytime. During nighttime, population density played a dominant role on nighttime surface warming among different parameters, with the second important contribution of nighttime surface warming coming from road density. While elevation and distance from coast demonstrated obvious cooling effect on surface temperature within most nighttime models. Located in a subtropical region, Hong Kong's development with high rise and high density housing made it a suitable site for studying urban effect on local warming. This research chose Hong Kong as the case study which hopes to enrich our knowledge regarding urban local thermal performance and add to our understanding of urban microclimate in hot-humid weather area.
