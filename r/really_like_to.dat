Ortega noted, [...] "Headley's story provides a damning account of life working for Scientology ..." [...] He concluded the review by commenting, [...] "Perhaps the best service that Headley provides with Blown for Good is giving non-Scientologists the sense of what it's <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work, {{day in and day}} out, in such a strange organization, from the lowliest laborer mucking out excrement in a Gold Base pond (Headley says shit was coming out of his ears and pores for days) to what kind of luxuries the celebrities and high-ranking members enjoy." ...|$|E

The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> talk about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother.

She remarked that based on the video's outcome that it was [...] "a little bit surprising" [...] to know that it was directed by a first-time director. Mike Sheffield of Spin viewed the music video as a [...] "love story" [...] and described it as being [...] "Valentine's Day + epic Emo balladry = Paramore's brand new video for 'The Only Exception'". Chesbro said that he was happy with the final product of the music video and that directing the video made him become more interested in directing videos, saying, [...] "I'd <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do more videos now [...] This video turned out so perfect that I'm worried nothing else will turn out as good.

He sought to play a larger creative role than he had on All I Want Is You, and produced most of Kaleidoscope Dream and either wrote or co-wrote every song on the album.

He spent almost two years in New York City, which he felt let him explore [...] "the edgy side" [...] {{of his life and}} consequently made his sonical approach grittier, saying in an interview for The Village Voice, [...] "I'm not the 'go to the club and pop bottles' kind of guy.

500|$|Victor {{was noted}} for his {{controversial}} relationship {{with both of}} his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a [...] father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father {{and more like a}} hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play so much, but you do it." ...|$|E

[...] With a final score of 1–0, Seattle secured their third straight appearance in the U.S. Open Cup final match. [...] Following the match, Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman complained about how hosts are determined for U.S. Open Cup matches saying, [...] "for me, {{this is one of the}} best events – the Lamar Hunt Open Cup – but I'd <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see it into a structure where it's not a bid system. A bid system is where one team will buy the games because they're bidding higher."

Case described Victor as being Sharon's hero and a [...] "father figure". However, their dynamic changes in January 2012 when Victor marries Sharon {{so that she can}} protect his assets while he is in jail; the non-romantic marriage is annulled days later. Several months later, they become romantically involved. Joshua Morrow told Soaps In Depth that he was puzzled as to why Nick had no [...] "legitimate anger" [...] about the relationship, while Braeden was also unhappy with the storyline, stating: [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play so much, but you do it." [...] Case described the relationship as incestuous: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things", calling it [...] "upsetting to the audience". The actress was also unfavorable of Sharon marrying Victor in August 2012, believing the writers could have handled the storyline other ways. The short-lived marriage between Victor and Sharon was considered an [...] "inside joke" [...] for the actors. Reflecting on the storyline, Case revealed: [...] "I didn’t understand how I was going to sell a love story between Sharon and Victor for obvious reasons.

I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months.

Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz".

500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
