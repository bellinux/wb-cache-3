25|$|People {{possess an}} {{inherent}} ensemble of basic beliefs about themselves, others, the world, etc. Such “naïve theories” are what compose our symbolic universe. One’s symbolic universe {{is part of}} a socially shared knowledge, transmitted principally as a result of education and social communication, with a large emphasis on the process of attachment through which parents impart their visions of the world, their symbolic universes, to their children. Such symbolic universes guide how we make sense of the world, and are composed of a relatively stable network of ideologies. Therefore, if one of these beliefs is compromised, the stability of the entire network could be jeopardized. It is very important for people to maintain a sense of stability within such a system of beliefs, so they have a natural psychological motivation to try to protect these beliefs. Because such beliefs have a fundamentally social origin, their <b>revalidation</b> can only be legitimized through a social consensus. Along these lines, aforementioned social rituals came {{to be used as a}} more structured way of re-substantiating beliefs that have been invalidated as a result of an emotional event.|$|E

40|$|We sketch an {{algorithmic}} {{framework to}} integrate (iterative) solvers of subsystems {{of a large}} nonlinear system into a joint iterative solution process. 1 Introduction Complex technical systems are often assembled from already existing components. The idea suggests itself to similarly synthesize numerical simulators of compound systems from available simulators of subsystems. This facilitates utilising knowledge about the subsystems and it spares the designer expensive <b>revalidations</b> of the subsystems simulators. Chemical Engineering {{seems to be the}} first scientific field where this integrational idea has been translated into action. There are quite some flow sheeting programms which couple numerical models of unit operations to simulate whole production plants: ASPEN+, SPEEDUP, gPROMS and PRO/II are just four of the better known systems. Block-oriented simulators (such as ASPEN+ and PRO/II) reduce the interactions of the unit operations to relatively few input/output variables. This is [...] ...|$|R

Health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQL) in asthmatics has shown relatively low correlations with parameters of asthma control {{and the relationship between}} the ACT and HRQL in asthmatics is yet unclear. Because <b>revalidations</b> of translated versions of questionnaires are critical for its utilization, we first sought to validate the Korean version of ACT and then to evaluate the relationship between the ACT and HRQL. Patients (n= 117) completed the ACT and asthma-related quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ) at 3 physician visits. Pulmonary function was measured and an asthma specialist rated asthma control. The Korean version of ACT was found to be reliable, valid, and responsive to changes in asthma control over time up to three consecutive visits. ACT scores correlated significantly (p= 0. 001) with symptoms domain (r= 0. 72), activity domain (r= 0. 65), emotional domain (r= 0. 69), and environmental domain (r= 0. 67) of AQLQ.

2500|$|Vallabhbhai Patel {{was one of}} {{the first}} Congress leaders to accept the {{partition}} of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He had been outraged by Jinnah's Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India, and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticised the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government, and the <b>revalidation</b> of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress's approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would, in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence. In December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant V. P. Menon on the latter's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had tired of the League's tactics, but he was criticised by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims, and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so. When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over what he saw as the practical unworkability of any Congress–League coalition, the rising violence, and the threat of civil war.

But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office has completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honorable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our own genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.Following Gandhi's denial but Congress' approval of the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets, and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither he nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} is to investigate the presence of Dante in four authors of the twentieth century and to discuss in what ways these authors contribute to our perception of Dante. This study begins with the analysis of Primo Levi’s reaction to Dante, and the first two chapters deal respectively with Levi’s troubled relationship with the monumentality of Dante in Levi’s personal culture and with the modern writer’s attempts at rejecting that very monumentality. In the third and fourth chapters, {{the focus is on the}} inclusion of Dante within Edoardo Sanguineti’s poetry, and on the issue of ideologically oriented exploitation of Dante both in Sanguineti’s novels and plays and in his critical analyses of the Comedy. The following chapters are about the presence of Dante in Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. In Beckett, a network of Dantean inclusions shows how Dante’s presence can be fertile, controversial, and yet apparently discarded. The last chapter discusses Seamus Heaney’s Dantisms and especially the question of translation as both a technical and a cultural issue. The result is the perception of a vital Dantean presence, which generates approaches and <b>revalidations</b> in spite of its apparent distance and of its cultural diversity.

40|$|The Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the IMA was {{established}} in 2006, by merging the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (CNMMN) with the Commission on Classification of Minerals (CCM). The roles of CNMNC are of prime importance for the mineralogical community: validation of new mineral species, validation of mineral names, nomenclature of minerals (redefinitions, discreditations, <b>revalidations,</b> renamings, modifications of chemical formulae, …), group nomenclature, classification issues. However, the guidelines of CNMNC are {{not always easy to}} establish, due to the complex crystal-chemistry of minerals, and to the diversity of scientific disciplines involved in Mineralogy. In this talk, we will describe a few examples of challenging nomenclature and classification issues, which were handled by the CNMNC these last years. (i) The first issue concerns the definition of new mineral species (Hatert & Burke, 2008) : what is the boundary between two species affected by complex substitution mechanisms? Are you allowed to define a mineral species with two atoms on the same crystallographic site? Or, on the contrary, is it possible to group crystallographic sites together for nomenclature purposes? (ii) The second issue concerns the naming of minerals (Hatert et al., 2013) : what are the guidelines for the use of chemical prefixes and suffixes? Are you allowed to modify historical mineral names for nomenclature purposes? How to use structural prefixes in mineral names? (iii) The last issue concerns mineral classification (Mills et al., 2009) : which are the guidelines to classify minerals? Is it possible to establish an official CNMNC-approved classification of minerals? By answering these questions, we hope to clarify some recent CNMNC guidelines and to explain the next steps of mineral nomenclature...|$|R
