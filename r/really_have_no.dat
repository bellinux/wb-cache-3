On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like you and me, {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea what to expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the Mexican economy {{struggling}} due to {{the complications}} of trade with the United States, the job market has also taken a tremendous hit. This is what may be considered the main motivation behind Mexican immigration to the U.S. [...] Due to the failing economy in their home country, {{many people have been}} forced to leave their homes and look for work in the United States simply to support their families. [...] Since the United States is a major contributor to the economic problems and lack of jobs in Mexico, undocumented workers should not be viewed in such a negative light by American citizens. These workers have been forced out of their jobs {{due to the}} United States and its negative influence on the Mexican economy. [...] These immigrants <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other choice but to come to America in search of jobs and a better life for their families. In a sense, these workers are only doing what is necessary based on the situation they have been put in by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|March – Jeffrey R. Holland and Marlin K. Jensen {{were interviewed}} in March with {{questions}} about various topics including homosexuality by PBS for a four-hour special called The Mormons. Jensen stated {{that he did not}} think the [...] "church could ever change its position" [...] on homosexual behavior. [...] "There's no room within the plan of salvation ... for homosexuality to be accepted" [...] or for someone to [...] "be romantically involved with someone of the same gender and ... be living in accord with God's plan." [...] He acknowledges that this [...] "creates a lot of pain" [...] and asks [...] "a tremendous amount of them" [...] since [...] "they <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> hope" [...] of [...] "fall in love" [...] in a way [...] "sanctioned by the church" [...] which is [...] "a very difficult thing". Holland stated that he doesn't [...] "anticipate that [...] would change [...] on homosexual behavior" [...] and that [...] "gay or lesbian inclinations" [...] will [...] "not exist post-mortality". He also used uses the phrase [...] "struggling with gender identity" [...] and [...] "gender confusion" [...] as synonyms for homosexuality.|$|E
