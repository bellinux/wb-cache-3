40|$|Orally {{disintegrating}} tablets (ODTs) are {{an emerging}} trend in novel {{drug delivery system}} and have received ever-increasing demand {{during the last few}} decades. ODTs are solid unit dosage forms, which disintegrates or dissolves rapidly in the mouth without chewing and water. This type of property in dosage form can be attained by addition of different excipients, in which disintegrants are the key adjuvant. In recent years, several newer agents have been developed known as super-disintegrants. Super-disintegrants are used to improve the efficacy of solid dosage form and influence the release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dosage</b> form. Diverse categories of super-disintegrants are such as synthetic, semi-synthetic, natural and co-processed blends etc. These have been employed to develop effectual ODTs and to overcome the limitations of conventional tablet dosage forms. The plant derived natural super disintegrants comply with many requirements of pharmaceutical excipients as they are non-toxic, stable, easily available, associated with less regulatory issues as compared to their synthetic counterpart and inexpensive; also these can be easily modified into more polar form. This review discuss about the development of various kind of natural super-disintegrating agents, along with their role in the tablet disintegration and as potent candidate to be used in ODTs, which are being used in the formulation to provide the safer, effective drug delivery with patient compliance...|$|E

40|$|UNLABELLED: Essentials We {{developed}} a new algorithm to optimize vitamin K antagonist dose finding. Validation was by comparing actual dosing to algorithm predictions. Predicted and actual dosing of well performing centers were highly associated. The method is promising and should be tested in a randomized trial. SUMMARY: Background Oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have a narrow therapeutic window and thus require frequent monitoring of its intensity by the international normalized ratio (INR). Improvement of VKA dosing defined as more time in therapeutic range (TTR) can reduce thrombotic disease and bleeding. Computerized decision support programs (CDSs) are used to optimize VKA dosing, but the effects are heterogeneous. CDSs significantly improve the proportion {{of time in the}} therapeutic INR range for initiation therapy but not the quality of anticoagulant management in an outpatient setting. One of the major problems of VKA dose finding is that the INR is a ratio and does not present linearity. We {{developed a}} new dose-finding algorithm, based on a novel bidirectional factor (BF). This BF is linear transformation of the nonlinear INR. Methods We compared the outcomes of the new algorithm, called BF-N, with dose finding performed at three highly ranked Dutch anticoagulation centers, using both acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. Results The outcomes of the BF-N algorithm showed a linear correlation with VKA doses of the three centers (y = 1. 001 x, r(2) 0. 999 for acenocoumarol and y = 0. 999 x, r(2) 0. 999 for phenprocoumon), {{with a standard deviation of}} 3. 83 %.

Methods: Administrative claims processed by a major Swiss health insurer between 2005 and 2008 were analysed. Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) {{with at least one}} prescription for adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab were identified. All-cause and disease-specific costs, as well as daily costs of treatment, were calculated. Dosing patterns and discontinuation rates were analysed. Results: A total of 555 IRD patients were identified. All-cause costs during the 12 months after the index event were 20, 555 CHF in the etanercept group, 24, 152 CHF in the adalimumab group, and 27, 614 CHF in the infliximab group. The most important cost driver was mean TNF inhibitor drug cost, which was 15, 613 CHF in the etanercept group, 19, 166 CHF in the adalimumab group, and 21, 313 CHF in the infliximab group. Discontinuation rates during the first year after the index event were 46. 8 % in etanercept, 41. 3 % in adalimumab, and 51. 2 % in the infliximab group. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>dosage</b> increase were 13. 3 % in the etanercept group, 13. 0 % in the adalimumab group, and 14. 1 % in the infliximab group.

The results showed thatthe best organic activator in decreasing C/N ratio of compost was chicken manure, withdecomposition rate 10, 77 unit/week. The best dosage activator in decreasing C/N ratio of compostwas 45 % (w/w), with decomposition rate 17, 51 unit/week. Increasing <b>dosage</b> <b>of</b> activator increasedthe decomposition rate, except for chicken manure.

On {{the premise}} of using the five <b>dosage</b> levels <b>of</b> {{recycled}} coarse aggregate, the paper primary study on the drying shrinkage and water absorption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> recycled concrete hollow block {{in order to determine}} the maximum <b>dosage</b> <b>of</b> recycled coarse aggregate, then find out the relationship between the drying shrinkage and the water absorption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> recycled concrete hollow block. The results showed that: the maximum <b>dosage</b> <b>of</b> recycled coarse aggregate can reach 100 %; there is a quadratic relationship between the drying shrinkage and the water absorption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the block...|$|R
40|$|Arable soils {{located in}} the {{vicinity}} of urban and industrial area are considered vulnerable to heavy metals pollution. Chemical inactivation, an in situ remediation method that used inexpensive chemicals to reduce pollutant solubility in polluted soil, was examined on a Cd-spiked arable soil. The study was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ameliorants and fertilizers normally recommended for crop cultivation, using tomato as the test plant, {{from the point of view}} to reduce soil Cd extractability and plant Cd concentration. A 100 -day greenhouse experiment in a completely randomized design consisting <b>of</b> three <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> rationale <b>dosage</b> <b>of</b> ameliorants and fertilizers (RDAF) [0, 50, 100 %] and four levels of soil Cd spike [0, 10, 20, 40 mg Cd kg- 1 soil, using 3 CdSO 4. 8 H 2 O] in triplicate was conducted. The 100 % <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> RDAF applied was: 4 ton dolomite ha- 1, 30 ton cow dung ha- 1, 150 kg N ha- 1 (½ Urea + ½ Ammonium Sulfate), 150 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 (SP- 36) and 100 kg K 2 O ha- 1 (KCl). Significant reductions in soil extractable Cd (CdNH 4 OAc-EDTA) [from 13. 35 to 8. 77 mg kg- 1, 34 %] and plant shoots-Cd (Cdps) [from 8. 66 to 5. 46 ìg g- 1, 37 %] were measured at 100 % RDAF treatment as compared to the control soil, indicating the occurrence of an in situ soil Cd inactivation and plant element selective-uptake phenomenon. Multiple regression analysis that incorporating all 36 data pairs resulted in the following equations: (1) soil CdNH 4 OAc-EDTA = – 0. 18 pHH 2 O + 0. 21 PBray# 1 + 0. 51 organic-C – 0. 57 exch. -Mg + 0. 65 Cdaqua regia (R 2 = 0. 76), and (2) Cdps = 0. 08 Nps – 0. 17 Kps – 0. 19 Mgps – 0. 24 Pps + 0. 27 Sps – 0. 41 Caps (R 2 = 0. 54, 3 outliers removed). These results suggest that a proper amelioration and fertilization program may be prospective to be recommended as a low-cost Cd pollution remediation strategy for arable soils...|$|R
