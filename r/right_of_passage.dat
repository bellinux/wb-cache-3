5|$|This {{conference was}} {{followed}} by an eight-hour meeting in October 1915 at Paghman and more audiences at Kabul. The message {{was the same as}} at the first audience. The meetings would typically begin with Habibullah describing his daily routine, followed by words from von Hentig on politics and history. Next the discussions veered towards Afghanistan's position on the propositions of allowing Central Powers troops the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> breaking with Britain, and declaring independence. The expedition members expected a Persian move to the Central side, and held out on hopes that this would convince the Emir to join as well. Niedermayer argued that German victory was imminent; he outlined the compromised and isolated position Afghanistan would find herself in if she was still allied to Britain. At times the Emir met with the Indian and German delegates separately, promising to consider their propositions, but never committing himself. He sought concrete proof that the Turco-German assurances of military and financial assistance were feasible. In a letter to Prince Henry of Reuss in Tehran (a message that was intercepted and delivered to the Russians instead), von Hentig asked for Turkish troops. Walter Röhr later wrote to the prince that a thousand Turkish troops armed with machine guns—along with another German expedition headed by himself—should be able to draw Afghanistan into the war. Meanwhile, Niedermayer advised Habibullah on how to reform his army with mobile units and modern weaponry.|$|E

25|$|In 109 BC, Emperor Wu started {{yet another}} {{territorial}} expansion campaign. Nearly a century earlier, a Chinese General named Wiman {{had taken the}} throne of Gojoseon and had established Wiman Joseon at Wanggeom-seong (王險), modern Pyongyang), which became a nominal Han vassal. When Wiman's grandson King Ugeo (衛右渠, 위우거) refused to permit Jin's ambassadors to reach China through his territories, Emperor Wei sent an ambassador She He (涉何) to Wanggeom to negotiate a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> with King Ugeo, but King Ugeo refused and had a general escort She back to Han territory. When they got close to Han borders, She assassinated the general and claimed to Emperor Wu that he had defeated Joseon in battle. Emperor Wu, unaware of his deception, made him the military commander of the Commandery of Liaodong (modern central Liaoning). King Ugeo, offended, made a raid on Liaodong and killed She. In response, Emperor Wu commissioned a two-pronged attack (one by land and one by sea) against Joseon. Initially, Joseon offered to become a vassal, but peace negotiations broke down by the Chinese forces' refusal to let a Joseon force escort its crown prince to Chang'an {{to pay tribute to}} Emperor Wu. Han took over the Joseon lands in 108 BC and established four commanderies.|$|E

500|$|In the Cabinet {{meeting of}} the next morning, Butler raised the issue once more, informing them that Indonesia was {{attempting}} to prevent the innocent passage of the Victorious through the Sunda Strait on the pretext of naval exercises. Thorneycroft then spoke, stating that Sukarno would [...] "gain in prestige" [...] if he stopped the vessels from sailing through and that he might close other waters to the Royal Navy should he be successful. He acknowledged that he had originally planned to send the carrier through the Strait herself, but after discussion with Head and Begg decided to send the destroyers through instead, and send the Victorious north around Sumatra. The ships would {{still be able to}} uphold the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> while forcing Sukarno to either attack them or let them through. If Indonesia did attack the ships, [...] "it would be an act of war... and we [...] should have to retaliate in force." [...] Though the Cabinet noted that the destroyers could be lost if attacked, it was deemed necessary not to bend to Sukarno. Britain and Indonesia were on the precipice of all-out war.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{indemnity}} fund {{wound up}} in the hands of Norman Kittson, who had pioneered steamship operations on the Red River as a means of handling a burgeoning trade with the Hudson's Bay Company. [...] The Ojibwe had accused Kittson of trespassing on their territory, cutting timber for fuel and starting forest fires. [...] At one point they had demanded tribute for the continued right to pass along the river—the [...] "exactions forcibly levied" [...] referred to in the text of the treaty. But Kittson's shipping operations [...] were already faltering as the Hudson's Bay Company withdrew from dependence on supply through the St. Paul and the Red River routes and re-established direct shipping from England via Hudson Bay, and the Sioux Uprising effectively ended the trade for most of the 1860s. The treaty indemnity payments thus may be seen as a politically inspired bailing out of Kittson from a losing position, using the excuse of Indian [...] "depredations" [...] which had been no more than a demand for payment by the Ojibwe for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> now being exacted from them.|$|E

60|$|Jethro upon inquiry {{found that}} there were wells at the camping-places along the whole route. The people were wild and savage, the Egyptian power {{extending}} only from the seashore {{to the foot of the}} hills, some fifteen miles away. Occasionally expeditions were got up to punish the tribesmen for their raids upon the cultivated land of the coast, but it was seldom that the troops could come upon them, for, knowing every foot of the mountains, these eluded all search by their heavy-armed adversaries. Jethro found that the custom was for merchants traveling across this country to pay a fixed sum in goods for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> There were two chiefs claiming jurisdiction over the road, and a messenger was at once dispatched to the nearest of these with the offer of the usual payment and a request for an escort.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} the school was {{extremely}} excited this summer by a proceeding of Mr. Tomkins, the brewer, who suddenly closed up the footway called Randall's Alley, declaring {{that there was no}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> through a certain field {{at the back of his}} brewery. Not only the school, but the town was indignant, and the Mays especially so. It had been the doctor's way to school forty years ago, and there were recollections connected with it that made him regard it with personal affection. Norman, too, could not bear to lose it; he had not entirely conquered his reluctance to pass that spot in the High Street, and the loss of the alley would be a positive deprivation to him. Almost every native of Stoneborough felt strongly the encroachment of the brewer, and the boys, of course, carried the sentiment to exaggeration.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Passage</b> is {{a limited}} edition hand made book with {{original}} art artworks by 23 international artists. Each artist who made a print for the book addressed the research question of the boundary. Often associated with the territory or border of a country, boundaries have changed significantly {{over the course of}} human history. The idea of having national pavilions at the Venice Biennale representing the essence of an identity has been increasingly questioned in the context of today’s globalized world. In recent years, many curators of the biennale have strongly encouraged the idea of using the national pavilion in more experimental ways by suggesting that boundaries are constantly subject to change. <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Passage</b> {{is a limited}} edition publication of 100 copies. The photographic artists participating engage with the discourse of globalism {{while at the same time}} critically examining their position in their local regions. They offer a critical perspective on their current situation within a local as well as national context and as part of the international community. The invited artists address complex issues of individual identity, territorial borders, society, economics, and immigration in this age of advanced photographic technology and globalization. Each invited photographic artist responded to the theme by submitting a photographic that has been printed at A 4 and signed. The publication was assembled during a 3 day performance. The audience was invited to choose in which order the individual pages will be placed, making each publication an original artwork. <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Passage</b> was also part of Venice Agendas 2015.
