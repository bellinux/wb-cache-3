5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> {{again in}} the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

5|$|Comprising {{the nascent}} motion picture genres of horror and science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror pictures were the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> and attacked their putative betters. Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E

However, Milan and Crema again <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> in open {{rebellion against the}} emperor's rule after the Diet of Roncaglia ordered the restoration of imperial rights, including the emperor's rights to levy taxes in the Northern Italian towns. Géza sent his envoys to Barbarossa's camp and promised to dispatch further reinforcements against the rebellious towns.|$|E

Trying {{to bolster his}} waning power, Apokaukos {{began a series of}} proscriptions in the capital, and even ordered a new prison constructed for political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, Apokaukos suddenly decided to inspect the new prison, without being escorted by his bodyguard.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the French Revolution, groups of royalists loyal to the House of Bourbon <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> against the new government. One group was the Chouans of Brittany, led by Jean Chouan. They allied {{themselves}} with counter-revolutionary forces in Vendée and by 1793 the Revolt in the Vendée had begun. The insurrection was put down by the republic, and within two years the royalist forces had been routed.|$|E
5|$|Montejo the Younger next {{sent his}} cousin to Chauaca {{where most of}} the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua Maya {{resisted}} fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish. The Cupul Maya also <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> against the newly imposed Spanish domination, and also their opposition was quickly put down. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province, reaching the east coast at Pole. Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel, and nine Spaniards drowned in the attempted crossing. Another Spanish conquistador was killed by hostile Maya. Rumours of this setback grew in the telling and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> against their would-be European overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{was born}} in Venice, the only son of Doge Otto Orseolo. His mother was a sister of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary; {{historian}} Gyula Kristó suggests that he {{was born in}} 1010 or 1011. The Venetians <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> and deposed Otto Orseolo in 1026. Peter did not follow his father, who fled to the Byzantine court in Constantinople; he instead went to Hungary, where his uncle appointed him commander of the royal army.|$|E

Sopron soon accepted Ladislaus's suzerainty and Ottokar II promised to renounce of all towns he occupied in western Hungary. However, new armed conflicts began in Hungary during 1277: the Transylvanian Saxons captured and destroyed Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania), the see of the bishop of Transylvania, and the Babonići <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> in rebellion in Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|The Styrian noblemen <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> in {{rebellion}} against Béla's governor Stephen Gutkeled and routed him in early 1258.

5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were {{challenges to the}} Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some extent}} a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people <b>rose</b> <b>up</b> against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the challenges to the social order were quashed.|$|E
5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol <b>rose</b> <b>up,</b> as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E
