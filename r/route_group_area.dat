40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} work was to study {{the effect of the}} route of anti-IBDV vaccine {{administration}} on elevation of antibody titre and protective efficacy against Gumboro disease in addition the maternally derived antibodies titre (MDA) declining pattern was also studied. For this purpose 125 one day old progeny chicks from a known vaccinated dams were reared at an isolated pens and tested to determine anti IBDV antibody titre at day one (MDA) and day 17. At day 17 birds were divided into 5 groups; A, B, C and D based on the administration route of anti-IBDV vaccine while group E was not vaccinated and acted as negative control. Group A was vaccinated via intranasal (I/N) <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> B was vaccinated via drinking water (oral) <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> C was vaccinated via subcutaneous <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> D was vaccinated via spraying (Inhalation) <b>route.</b> Each <b>group</b> was vaccinated twice at day 17 (Primary) and at day 24 (booster). Fifteen days post booster dose, sera samples were tested and birds were challenged to study the protective efficacy of the vaccine in each group. The mean antibody titre and coefficient of variation of group B were found to be superior to other groups. The protective efficacy parameters including mortality rate, gross lesions grading, bursa to body weight X 10 ratio and histopathologic changes grading were found to be better in group B than in other- 3 groups...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Group</b> <b>Areas</b> Act, the <b>Group</b> <b>Areas</b> Act, 1950 was promulgated on 7 July 1950, {{and it was}} {{implemented}} {{over a period of}} several years. It was amended by Parliament in 1952, 1955 (twice), 1956 and 1957. Later in 1957 it was repealed and re-enacted in consolidated form as the <b>Group</b> <b>Areas</b> Act, 1957, which was amended in 1961, 1962, and 1965. In 1966 this version was in turn repealed and re-enacted as the <b>Group</b> <b>Areas</b> Act, 1966, which was subsequently amended in 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982, and 1984. It was repealed (along with many other discriminatory laws) on 30 June 1991 by the Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigated developmental {{changes in}} children’s representations of large-scale environments {{as reflected in}} spontaneous gestures and speech produced during route descriptions Four-, five-, and six-year-olds (N = 122) described the route from their nursery school to their own homes. Analysis of the children’s gestures showed that some 5 - and 6 -year-olds produced gestures that represented survey mapping, and they were categorized as a survey group. Children who did not produce such gestures were categorized as a <b>route</b> <b>group.</b> A comparison {{of the two groups}} revealed no significant differences in speech indices, with the exception that the survey group showed significantly fewer right/left terms. As for gesture, the survey group produced more gestures than the <b>route</b> <b>group.</b> These results imply that an initial form of survey-map representation is acquired beginning at late preschool age...|$|R

50|$|A group {{switching}} centre (GSC) was a United Kingdom telephone exchange {{used to provide}} local and trunk routing to local exchanges within its own and if required, adjacent <b>group</b> <b>areas.</b> It formed {{a component of the}} trunk mechanisation hierarchy that was commenced in 1939. The concept of group {{switching centre}}s became important with the introduction in the United Kingdom of subscriber trunk dialling (STD) in 1958, initially from Bristol central telephone exchange. They were typically located towards the centre of their corresponding <b>group</b> <b>area,</b> usually in a large town or city, and serviced a group of local and dependent telephone exchanges within their home and adjacent <b>group</b> <b>areas.</b> From 1 January 1958, the British network was divided into 639 charging <b>groups.</b> These <b>areas</b> provided the basis for tariff calculations for telephone calls.|$|R
