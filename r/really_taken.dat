500|$|Often informing his {{superiors}} of critical situations, Zelenka earned the nickname [...] "Mr. Bad News" [...] among fans. In {{an interview with}} David Nykl, TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens referred to Zelenka as a [...] "popular" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] character, and compared Zelenka's apparitions in Atlantis {{to those of the}} Stargate SG-1 character Walter Harriman, [...] "a bit like the icing on the cake". Another interviewer mentioned that, following a [...] "warm reception", the [...] "fans have <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> [...] to heart". When GateWorld hypothesized that viewers were looking forward to an episode where the [...] "underdog" [...] Zelenka saves the day instead of McKay, Nykl replied that the set-up dynamic earns the character more sympathy from the audience. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the category [...] "Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male".|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the early medieval Serbian Principality and the Vlastimirović dynasty is {{recorded}} in the work De Administrando Imperio ("On the Governance of the Empire", [...] ), compiled by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus ( [...] 913–959). The DAI drew information on the Serbs from, among others, a Serbian source. The work mentions the first Serbian ruler, who is without a name but known conventionally as the [...] "Unknown Archon", who led the Serbs from the north to the Balkans. He received the protection of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), and {{was said to have}} died long before the Bulgar invasion of 680. Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Porphyrogenitus stressed that the Serbs had always been under Imperial rule. His account on the first Christianization of the Serbs can be dated to 632–638; this might have been Porphyrogenitus' construction, or may have <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> place, encompassing a limited group of chiefs and then very poorly received by the wider layers of the tribe.|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, Cooper {{felt that}} she had been sidelined by former {{producer}} Lucy Allan and that Jacqui had lost her identity. New executive producer Paul Marquess also felt that Cooper had been under used. He decided to split Jacqui away {{from the rest of the}} McQueens, his reason for which being that there was so much [...] "talent" [...] in terms of acting within the family, he felt Cooper or Jacqui didn't need that [...] "support system". He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: [...] "he seemed to like what I did and he's worked on it and developed it. Paul has <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> me under his wing, he's worked me so hard and he's given me opportunities that I could only have dreamt of." [...] Speaking of her approach to playing Jacqui, Cooper has said: [...] "I try to tame Claire back because I'm a really emotional, sensitive person and very different from Jacqui, so I do work hard and I feel very privileged." ...|$|E

500|$|Piliero had {{the concept}} nearly {{finished}} {{by the time}} he met with Spears. Both wanted to explore fun ways for Spears to be inappropriate in the video, who had several ideas, such as a cop frisking her. Having seen Spears on How I Met Your Mother and Saturday Night Live, Piliero felt that none of her videos had <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> advantage of her comedic timing, saying, [...] "She never had a music video where she could show her acting chops and have fun with comedy while being super badass. That was my goal from day one: I wanted her to be funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as much fun as possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It just felt like the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

2500|$|Because tax {{benefits}} for charitable donations {{are limited in}} Japan, a culture of charity donations has never <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> root. [...] For example, the ratio of charitable donations by individuals in Japan is 52.5%, compared with 82.7% for the US. [...] Also, Japanese culture emphasizes modesty, which means that Japanese people are generally reluctant to do good deeds in public view. [...] Therefore, the Tiger Mask movement assuages both cultural inhibitions towards charitable deeds; it gives people in Japan a reason to donate while allowing {{them to do so}} anonymously.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{not officially}} confirmed, Ralf Hütter {{suggested}} that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf and Florian—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: [...] "We've just never <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> {{a look at those}} albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of Polaroids in those days." [...] Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.|$|E

2500|$|In the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin {{was very}} {{impressed}} by Taylorism, which he and Joseph Stalin sought to incorporate into Soviet manufacturing. Taylorism and the mass production methods of Henry Ford thus became highly influential {{during the early years}} of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, [...] " [...] Frederick Taylor's methods have never <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> root in the Soviet Union." [...] The voluntaristic approach of the Stakhanovite movement in the 1930s of setting individual records was diametrically opposed to Taylor's systematic approach and proved to be counter-productive. The stop-and-go of the production process – workers having nothing to do at the beginning of a month and 'storming' during illegal extra shifts at the end of the month – which prevailed even in the 1980s had nothing to do with the successfully taylorized plants e.g., of Toyota which are characterized by continuous production processes (heijunka) which are continuously improved (kaizen).|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{focus for}} the industry's export efforts was the United Kingdom. The late 1970s and early 1980s were not only {{pioneering}} times for production but also marketing and as with many New Zealand products, wine was only <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> seriously at home when it was noticed and praised overseas and in particular by British wine commentators and critics. [...] For much {{of the history of}} New Zealand wine exportation the United Kingdom market, with its lack of indigenous production, great thirst and sophisticated wine pallate has been either the principal or only market. In the last decade [...] the British market's overwhelming importance has eroded; while still the single largest export market, it now (2006) makes up only one third of total exports by value, only slightly larger than the American and Australian markets. [...] Japan is a particularly strong importer of high-end New Zealand wines: in 2006, it spent NZ$14.44 per liter of wine imported, compared to New Zealand's average price of NZ$8.87/L.|$|E

2500|$|Although the CARICOM Skills Certificate regime pre-dates {{the formal}} inauguration of the CSME (Skills Certificates have been {{available}} since 1997, while the CSME was only formally instituted in 2005 following provisional application of the CSME protocols in 2001) the number of Skills Certificates issued to qualifying CARICOM nationals has only <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> off since the CSME was instituted.

[...] Gaskarth calld [...] "Heroes" [...] the [...] "no-so-find farewell closer" [...] that is also the [...] "most pop-punk song" [...] on the record, in tribute to their roots. He classed it as an ironic song since it mocks the concept of [...] "people idolising bands and all the drama that goes along with that when those bands try to evolve their sound as they grow up." [...] He said it was an [...] "important final song and point to make for this album specifically as we've <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> some risks and stretched ourselves."

2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat down to write an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've <b>really</b> <b>taken</b> my time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
