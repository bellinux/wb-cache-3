5|$|Axanthism is a {{condition}} common in reptiles and amphibians, in which xanthophore metabolism is affected rather than synthesis of melanin, resulting in reduction or absence of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> pteridine pigments.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{function}} of pigments in plants is photosynthesis, which uses the green pigment chlorophyll {{along with several}} <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> pigments including porphyrins, carotenoids, anthocyanins and betalains.|$|E
5|$|The regimental colours of green, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow,</b> {{which appear}} on the regimental tie and Stable belt, were decided on in the late 19th century. One officer (who was also a Conservative MP) {{suggested}} green with a red stripe, but this was objected to because it {{was similar to the}} Rifle Brigade. Another officer (a Liberal MP) suggested adding yellow, which was agreed. The joke was that <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> were Liberal colours, and the Liberal MP got away with this under his rival's nose.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (<b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow,</b> is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E

They are aposematically colored in black <b>and</b> contrasting <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellows,</b> <b>and</b> some species in the Appalachian Mountains resemble species of Brachoria where they co-occur, a phenomenon known as Müllerian mimicry.|$|R
5|$|Plumbe {{designed}} the estate with five classes of houses. Although {{the houses were}} built to the same five basic designs, each street was given a distinct style of design and ornamentation. Varying mixes of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> bricks, and variations in window design and ornamental motifs, were used to give each street a distinct identity. All were designed with front and back gardens. Corner houses were given distinctive designs and turrets.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, <b>red,</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow,</b> there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E

5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured. The floor {{was covered by}} marble and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> bricks and pieces of bricks {{were used for the}} atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, {{light blue}} {{collared}} dolman, sometimes {{with a black}} pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant was}} {{introduced}} into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century. In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple. The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time. The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> carrots, {{as does the}} 12th-century Arab-Andalusian agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam. Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 14th century, and in Japan in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Their {{colouration}} is variable; black {{combined with}} <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> {{is a common}} pattern, and many species have golden-coloured pubescence (hair). Many other species are brightly coloured, which warns predators to avoid them. The formicine ant Camponotus bendigensis is similar in appearance to M. fulvipes, and data suggest C. bengdigensis is a batesian mimic of M. fulvipes. The number of malpighian tubules differs between castes; in M. dispar, males have 16 tubules, queens range from 23 to 26, and workers have 21 to 29.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry {{describes}} unusual {{cases where}} deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by Emsley {{as a possible}} answer for the theoretical difficulties a predator species faces when associating an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals, such as the coral snake, with unprofitability when the predator has {{an increased risk of}} death, negating any learned behaviour. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier. This scenario is a little more difficult to understand, since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks. The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry), is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place: instinctive genetic programming to be wary of certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings. Hand-reared turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> rings. Other colours with the same pattern, and even <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. This provides an alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry. See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject.|$|E
