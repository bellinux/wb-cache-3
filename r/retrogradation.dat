40|$|The {{high-grade}} metamorphic Sobrado-Teijeiro complex forms part of {{the peripheral}} belt of the Ordenes basin. The fault-bounded elliptical complex consists of a central unit of highly serpentinized ultramafic rocks, surrounded by (partly retrograded) mafic granulite facies rocks, highgrade paragneisses and orthogneisses. The area studied comprises the northern {{part of the}} complex. Here the ultramafic rocks are almost completely serpentinized and only in a few specimens relics of olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and amphibole have been found. Paragneisses, consisting of K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, biotite, muscovite and garnet, form a rim around the mafic and ultramafic rocks. Coarse-grained orthogneisses, belonging to two different bodies, form the outermost parts of the complex. Mafic rocks occur in between the serpentinites and the paragneisses. Several phases of metamorphism and deformation can be discerned. A first phase of metamorphism under conditions of the clinopyroxenealmandine subfacies gave rise to a granoblastic-polygonal fabric consisting of rather jadeite-rich clinopyroxene, garnet and plagioclase. During a second phase of metamorphism, preceded and accompanied by deformation, recrystallization of the original assemblage and growth of brown hornblende at the expense of clinopyroxene occurred, giving rise to blastomylonitic and granulitic textures. Further <b>retrogradations</b> took place under amphibolite and greenschist facies conditions. This sequence of events resulted in a rather heterogeneous unit, ranging from essentially nonaltered granofelses, via blastomylonites to amphibolites and greenschists in which hardly any relics of high-grade minerals are encountered...|$|R

Shen is famous for discovering the concept of true north and magnetic declination towards the North Pole by calculating a more accurate measurement of the astronomical meridian, and fixed the calculated position of the pole star that had shifted over the centuries. This allowed sailors to navigate the seas more accurately with the magnetic needle compass, also first described by Shen. [...] Shen was made famous for his written description of Bi Sheng, the inventor of movable type printing. Shen was also interested in geology, as he formulated a theory of geomorphology and climate change over time after making observations of strange natural phenomena. Using contemporary knowledge of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses, he theorized that the sun and moon were spherical in shape, not flat, while expanding upon the reasoning of earlier Chinese astronomical theorists. Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen used cosmological hypotheses when describing the variations of planetary motion, including <b>retrogradation.</b> One of Shen's greatest achievements, aided by Wei Pu, was correcting the lunar error by diligently recording and plotting the moon's orbital path three times a night {{over a period of}} five years. Unfortunately Shen had many political rivals at court who were determined to sabotage his work.

2500|$|Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 BC–c. 190 BC) {{responded by}} {{introducing}} two new mechanisms that allowed a planet to vary its distance and speed: the eccentric deferent and the deferent and epicycle. The deferent is a circle carrying the planet around the Earth. (The word deferent {{comes from the}} Latin ferro, ferre, meaning [...] "to carry.") An eccentric deferent is slightly off-center from Earth. In a deferent and epicycle model, the deferent carries a small circle, the epicycle, which carries the planet. The deferent-and-epicycle model can mimic the eccentric model, as shown by Apollonius' theorem. It can also explain <b>retrogradation,</b> which happens when planets appear to reverse their motion through the zodiac for a short time.

2500|$|Mixing is a {{critical}} step in batter preparation since overmixing causes the gluten to develop excessively and create a batter with too high of a viscosity {{that is difficult to}} pour and does not expand easily. A thick batter that is difficult spreading in the baking iron has an increased water activity of around 0.85. The increased viscosity made it harder for water to evaporate from the waffle causing an increase in water activity. The control waffles with a softer texture had a water activity of 0.74 after cooking. The Aw is less because the softer texture allows the water to evaporate. With an increased storage time, waffle physical and textural properties changes regardless of the batter viscosity. [...] Aged waffles shrink because air bubbles leak out and the structure starts to condense. Hardness and viscosity also increases as time goes by.

40|$|At Cabo Ortegal, paragneisses {{are found}} in {{association}} with amphibolites, metagabbros, amphibolized eclogites, amphibolized (plagio) pyrigarnites, and serpentinized ultrabasic rocks. On the basis of petrographical and chemical evidence, their geological history was reconstructed as follows: Precambrian sedimentation of graywackes, was rapidly succeeded by intrusion of gabbroic sills and stocks and by emplacement of ultrabasic rocks. During an orogeny of supposed Precambrian age, the rocks in the area were subjected to mesozonal metamorphism in {{the upper part of}} the sequence and to catazonal metamorphism in the lower parts. Mesozonally-metamorphosed gneisses formed staurolitealmandine subfacies associations; their gabbroic inclusions were transformed into amphibolites. Catazonally-metamorphosed gneisses became partially anatexitic, and kyanite-almandine associations with or without biotite were formed in the unmelted portions (restite). Gabbro sills were altered into foliated eclogites (± a-zoisite ± kyanite ± carinthine) in the eastern part of the area and into non-foliated (plagio) pyrigarnite (high-pressure granulite) in its central and western parts. The ultrabasites were transformed into garnet peridotites. Evidence of isoclinal folding has been found in the eclogites and, less conspicuously, in the ultrabasic rocks. Renewed local intrusion of gabbro was followed by catazonal retrograde metamorphism (hornblende-clinopyroxene-almandine subfacies grade) in zones affected by pegmatoid injection or by penetrative deformation. Retrograde alterations could only be demonstrated for the mafic rocks from the appearance of greenish-brown hornblende or the formation of a new foliation. The newly-intruded gabbros were partly metamorphosed and acquired a flaser texture. After the Precambrian orogeny, gabbroic and granitic rocks once again intruded locally; the age of their intrusion is placed at 500 ± m. y. by analogy with similar intrusions in southern Galicia. These rocks were altered into schistose amphibolite and orthogneiss during the Hercynian orogeny; the metamorphic rocks were remetamorphosed and (re) folded under amphibolite facies conditions (kyanite-almandine-muscovite subfacies grade over the whole of the investigated area). In the paragneisses an assemblage of biotite + muscovite ± garnet ± kyanite was formed, while quartz and plagioclase recrystallized. Two consecutive phases of deformation caused isoclinal folds, followed in most cases by open folding. In the eclogites and in the (plagio) - pyrigarnites, the association blue-green hornblende + plagioclase + epidote ± garnet was formed secondarily after the catazonal associations. The eclogites were boudinaged; internal folding did not take place, and amphibolization was confined to the rims of boudins and pegmatoid injections as well as to narrow zones of penetrative deformation. More intensive tectonization (internal isoclinal folding, overprinted by open folds) caused the (plagio) pyrigarnites to be more extensively retrograded during the Hercynian orogeny. They were altered for the most part into laminated (garnet) amphibolites. The metagabbros were likewise altered into laminated (garnet) amphibolites, with textures ranging from mylonitic to gabbroic. In the ultrabasic rocks, garnet peridotites were replaced by amphibole or chlorite peridotites. Isoclinal as well as open folds were formed. During the Hercynian orogeny, the stratigraphie sequence was overturned in the eastern as well as in the western part of the area (formation of a ”mushroom-shaped” dome); and in the western part a zone of overthrust with isoclinally-folded blastomylonites, boudinaged ultrabasites, and microfolded amphibolites was formed. Post-Hercynian activities consisted mainly of ubiquitous hydrothermal action accompanied by local greenschist-facies <b>retrogradations</b> in most of the rocks and by extensive serpentinization in the ultrabasites. Normal faulting, resulting in mainly vertical block-movements, accompanied locally by brecciation or mylonitization, and small-scale emplacement of tonalitic and gabbroic dykes, also took place after the Hercynian orogenesis...|$|R
2500|$|Several {{forces are}} {{involved}} in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a bending force (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab pull force (FSP) is caused by the negative buoyancy of the plate driving the plate to greater depths. The resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). [...] The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a <b>retrogradation</b> of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.|$|E

And these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the [...] scorn of the [...] "utilitarians"--of rough pedants, who arrogated to [...] themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the [...] scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, [...] upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our [...] enjoyments were keen--days when mirth was a word unknown, so [...] solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days, [...] blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest [...] solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble [...] exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by [...] opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil [...] days. The great [...] "movement"--that was the cant term--went on: a [...] diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art--the Arts--arose supreme, [...] and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated [...] them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty [...] of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and [...] still-increasing dominion over her elements.

60|$|When, {{leaving the}} {{development}} of single plants and animals, we pass {{to that of the}} Earth's flora and fauna, the course of our argument again becomes clear and simple. Though, as was admitted {{in the first part of}} this article, the fragmentary facts Paleontology has accumulated, do not clearly warrant us in saying that, in the lapse of geologic time, there have been evolved more heterogeneous organisms, and more heterogeneous assemblages of organisms, yet we shall now see that there must ever have been a tendency towards these results. We shall find that the production of many effects by one cause, which as already shown, has been all along increasing the physical heterogeneity of the Earth, has further involved an increasing heterogeneity in its flora and fauna, individually and collectively. An illustration will make this clear. Suppose that by a series of upheavals, occurring, as they are now known to do, at long intervals, the East Indian Archipelago were to be, step by step, raised into a continent, and a chain of mountains formed along the axis of elevation. By the first of these upheavals, the plants and animals inhabiting Borneo, Sumatra, New Guinea, and the rest, would be subjected to slightly modified sets of conditions. The climate in general would be altered in temperature, in humidity, and in its periodical variations; while the local differences would be multiplied. These modifications would affect, perhaps inappreciably, the entire flora and fauna of the region. The change of level would produce additional modifications: varying in different species, and also in different members of the same species, according to their distance from the axis of elevation. Plants, growing only on the sea-shore in special localities, might become extinct. Others, living only in swamps of a certain humidity, would, if they survived at all, probably undergo visible changes of appearance. While still greater alterations would occur in the plants gradually spreading over the lands newly raised above the sea. The animals and insects living on these modified plants, would themselves be in some degree modified by change of food, as well as by change of climate; and the modification would be more marked where, from the dwindling or disappearance of one kind of plant, an allied kind was eaten. In the lapse of the many generations arising before the next upheaval, the sensible or insensible alterations thus produced in each species would become organized--there would be a more or less complete adaptation to the new conditions. The next upheaval would superinduce further organic changes, implying wider divergences from the primary forms; and so repeatedly. But now let it be observed that the revolution thus resulting would not be a substitution of a thousand more or less modified species for the thousand original species; but in place of the thousand original species there would arise several thousand species, or varieties, or changed forms. Each species being distributed over an area of some extent, and tending continually to colonize the new area exposed, its different members would be subject to different sets of changes. Plants and animals spreading towards the equator would not be affected in the same way as others spreading from it. Those spreading towards the new shores would undergo changes unlike the changes undergone by those spreading into the mountains. Thus, each original race of organisms, would become the root from which diverged several races differing more or less from it and from each other; and while some of these might subsequently disappear, probably more than one would survive in the next geologic period: the very dispersion itself increasing the chances of survival. Not only would there be certain modifications thus caused by change of physical conditions and food, but also in some cases other modifications caused by change of habit. The fauna of each island, peopling, step by step, the newly-raised tracts, would eventually come in contact with the faunas of other islands; and some members of these other faunas would be unlike any creatures before seen. Herbivores meeting with new beasts of prey, would, in some cases, be led into modes of defence or escape differing from those previously used; and simultaneously the beasts of prey would modify their modes of pursuit and attack. We know that when circumstances demand it, such changes of habit do take place in animals; and we know that if the new habits become the dominant ones, they must eventually in some degree alter the organization. Observe now, however, a further consequence. There must arise not simply a tendency towards the differentiation of each race of organisms into several races; but also a tendency to the occasional production of a somewhat higher organism. Taken in the mass these divergent varieties which have been caused by fresh physical conditions and habits of life, will exhibit changes quite indefinite in kind and degree; and changes that do not necessarily constitute an advance. Probably in most cases the modified type will be neither more nor less heterogeneous than the original one. In some cases the habits of life adopted being simpler than before, a less heterogeneous structure will result: there will be a <b>retrogradation.</b> But it must now and then occur, that some division of a species, falling into circumstances which give it rather more complex experiences, and demand actions somewhat more involved, will have certain of its organs further differentiated in proportionately small degrees,--will become slightly more heterogeneous. Thus, in the natural course of things, there will from time to time arise an increased heterogeneity both of the Earth's flora and fauna, and of individual races included in them. Omitting detailed explanations, and allowing for the qualifications which cannot here be specified, we think it is clear that geological mutations have all along tended to complicate the forms of life, whether regarded separately or collectively. The same causes which have led to the evolution of the Earth's crust from the simple into the complex, have simultaneously led to a parallel evolution of the Life upon its surface. In this case, as in previous ones, we see that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is consequent upon the universal principle, that every active force produces more than one change.|$|E

An eccentric deferent is slightly off-center from Earth. In a deferent and epicycle model, the deferent carries a small circle, the epicycle, which carries the planet. The deferent-and-epicycle model can mimic the eccentric model, as shown by Apollonius' theorem. It can also explain <b>retrogradation,</b> which happens when planets appear to reverse their motion through the zodiac for a short time. Modern historians of astronomy have determined that Eudoxus' models could only have approximated <b>retrogradation</b> crudely for some planets, {{and not at all}} for others.|$|E
5000|$|Permutation may {{be applied}} to smaller sets as well. However, {{transformation}} operations of such smaller sets do not necessarily result in permutation the original set. Here {{is an example of}} non-permutation of trichords, using <b>retrogradation,</b> inversion, and retrograde-inversion, combined in each case with transposition, as found within in the tone row (or twelve-tone series) from Anton Weberns Concerto: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{third and}} fourth {{together}} explain <b>retrogradation,</b> when a planet appears to slow down, then briefly reverse its motion through the zodiac. By inclining the axes of the two spheres with respect to each other, and rotating them in opposite directions but with equal periods, Eudoxus could make a point on the inner sphere trace out a figure-eight shape, or hippopede.|$|E

Amylopectin molecules with longer branched structure, increases {{the tendency to}} form strong gels. Granule size do not directly impact starch performance, {{but it is one}} of the main factors affecting starch gelatinization and <b>retrogradation.</b> High amylopectin starches will have a stable gel, but will be softer than high amylose gels.|$|E

Food additives such as sucrose, sorbitol or glycerol may {{be added to}} increase viscosity and therefore increase gelatinization. Additives that slow down <b>retrogradation</b> are not usually added since amylopectin has a very stable shelf life due to its high amylopectin content.|$|E
