40|$|Drugs and {{metabolites}} {{are eliminated}} from the body by metabolism and excretion. The kidney makes the major contribution to excretion of unchanged drug and also to excretion of metabolites. Net renal excretion {{is a combination of}} three processes - glomerular filtration, tubular secretion and tubular reabsorption. Renal function has traditionally been determined by measuring plasma creatinine and estimating creatinine clearance. However, estimated creatinine clearance measures only glomerular filtration with a small contribution from active secretion. There is accumulating evidence of poor correlation between estimated creatinine clearance and renal drug clearance in different clinical settings, challenging the 2 ̆ 7 intact nephron hypothesis 2 ̆ 7 and suggesting that renal drug handling pathways may not decline in parallel. Furthermore, it is evident that renal drug handling is altered to a clinically significant extent in a number of disease states, necessitating dosage adjustment not just based on filtration. These observations suggest that a re-evaluation of markers of renal function is required. Methods that measure all renal handling pathways would allow informed dosage individualisation using an understanding of renal excretion pathways and patient characteristics. Methodologies have been described to determine individually each of the <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> pathways. However, their simultaneous assessment has only recently been investigated. A cocktail of markers to measure simultaneously the individual renal handling pathways have now been developed, and evaluated in healthy volunteers. This review outlines the different <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> pathways and the possible markers {{that can be used for}} their measurement. Diseases and other physiological conditions causing altered <b>renal</b> drug <b>elimination</b> are presented, and the potential application of a cocktail of markers for the simultaneous measurement of drug handling is evaluated. Further investigation of the effects of disease processes on renal drug handling should include people with HIV infection, transplant recipients (renal and liver) and people with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, changes in renal function in the elderly, the effect of sex on renal function, assessment of living kidney donors prior to transplantation and the investigation of renal drug interactions would also be potential applications. Once renal drug handling pathways are characterised in a patient population, the implications for accurate dosage individualisation can be assessed. The simultaneous measurement of <b>renal</b> function <b>elimination</b> pathways of drugs and metabolites has the potential to assist in understanding how renal function changes with different disease states or physiological conditions.

40|$|The {{uricosuric}} agent probenecid is co-administered with the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP {{to produce a}} chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that probenecid serves to elevate concentrations of MPTP in the brain by reducing <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> of the toxin. However, this mechanism has never been formally demonstrated to date and is questioned by our previous data showing that intracerebral concentrations of MPP(+), the active metabolite of MPTP, are not modified by co-injection of probenecid. In this study, we investigated the potentiating effects of probenecid in vivo and in vitro arguing against the possibility of altered metabolism or impaired <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> of MPTP. We find that probenecid (i) is toxic in itself to several neuronal populations apart from dopaminergic neurons, and (ii) that it also potentiates the effects of other mitochondrial complex I inhibitors such as rotenone. On a mechanistic level, we show that probenecid is able to lower intracellular ATP concentrations and that its toxic action on neuronal cells can be reversed by extracellular ATP. Probenecid can potentiate the effect of mitochondrial toxins due to its impact on ATP metabolism and could therefore be useful to model atypical parkinsonian syndromes...|$|R
40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{illustrate}} the complex interaction between ontogeny, i. e., age-dependent maturation, genetic polymorphisms and <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> clearance during infancy, based on developmental disposition of intravenous tramadol during infancy. BACKGROUND: Tramadol (M) is metabolized by O-demethylation (cytochrome P 450 [CYP] 2 D 6) to the pharmacodynamic active metabolite O-demethyl tramadol (M 1). This metabolite is subsequently eliminated by renal route while M 1 formation will in part depend on ontogeny, i. e., age-dependent activity and CYP 2 D 6 polymorphisms. However, these pathways do not mature simultaneously. METHODS: A pooled pharmacokinetic analysis of earlier reported time-concentration profiles in neonates and infants was performed with subsequent simulation {{of the impact}} of ontogeny, polymorphisms and <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> clearance during infancy. RESULTS: Tramadol plasma time-concentration profile changes with postmenstrual age. The highest metabolite concentrations occur in the 52 -week infant, where M 1 formation clearance (hepatic, CYP 2 D 6) is already mature but metabolite elimination clearance (through glomerular filtration rate) is immature. DISCUSSION: The phenotypic observations might in part explain unanticipated (side-) effects of tramadol. In addition to the compound-specific clinical implications, it is important to stress that the maturational trends in the elimination processes described can be considered for other compounds (e. g., codeine) that undergo similar elimination route...|$|R

This study is designed to compare the efficacy of PQ elimination with hemoperfusion (HP) and kidneys, taking into account the functional deterioration of the kidneys. The amount of renal and HP excretion of PQ were measured during the procedure of HP in patients with acute PQ intoxication. The PQ clearance and the actual amount of PQ elimination by the HP cartridge during the HP procedure were 111 ± 11 mL/min (range; 13. 2 - 162. 2 mL/min) and 251. 4 ± 506. 3 mg (range; 4. 6 - 1, 655. 7) each.

Male Wistar rats underwent bile duct ligation (BDL rats). Pair-fed sham-operated rats served as controls. BSP renal clearance was performed by conventional techniques. Renal organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1 (Oatp 1) expression was evaluated by immunoblotting and IHC. Excreted, filtered, and secreted loads of BSP were all higher in BDL rats compared with Sham rats.

Studies were performed with drug-free perfusate and perfusate containing cefdinir alone to establish the baseline physiology and investigate cefdinir <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> characteristics. To investigate cefdinir renal transport mechanisms, inhibition studies were conducted by coperfusing cefdinir with inhibitors of the renal organic anion (probenecid), organic cation (tetraethylammonium), or dipeptide (glycylsarcosine) transport system. Cefdinir concentrations in biological samples were determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Differences between treatments and controls were evaluated using analysis of variance and Dunnett's test. The excretion ratio (ER; the renal clearance corrected for the fraction unbound and glomerular filtration rate) for cefdinir was 5. 94, a value indicating net renal tubular secretion. Anionic, cationic, and dipeptide transport inhibitors all significantly affected the cefdinir ER. With probenecid, the ER was reduced to 0. 59, clearly demonstrating a significant reabsorptive component to cefdinir renal disposition. This finding was confirmed by glycylsarcosine studies, in which the ER was elevated to 7. 95, indicating that reabsorption was mediated, at least in part, by the dipeptide transporter system.

Interventions: Neuromuscular transmission was monitored mechanomyographically. The time course of action of maintenance doses and plasma concentration-response relationships were determined before, during, and after OPE.

Measurements and Main Results: Hypothermic CPB prolonged the duration of action of coincided with a lower plasma concentration at a twitch response of 5 % of control. The duration of action of maintenance doses returned to prehypothermic CPB level after rewarming to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 37 degrees C. The plasma concentration-response relationship did not return to precooling control value, probably owing to persisting peripheral hypothermia. Both the <b>renal</b> <b>elimination</b> of rocuronium and the plasma concentration decay after the last maintenance dose under normothermic conditions resembled values obtained in patients not undergoing hypothermic CPB.

Previously developed PBPK models of PFOA exposure in the rat have not been parameterized to specifically account for transporter-mediated <b>renal</b> <b>elimination.</b> We developed a PBPK model for PFOA in male and female rats to explore the role of Oat 1, Oat 3, and Oatp 1 a 1 in sex-specific renal reabsorption and excretion of PFOA.

Model predicted concentrations of PFOA in the liver, serum, and urine showed good agreement with experimental data for both male and female rats indicating that in vitro derived physiological descriptions of transporter-mediated renal reabsorption can successfully predict sex-dependent excretion of PFOA in the rat. This study supports the hypothesis that sex-specific serum half-lives for PFOA are largely driven by expression of transporters in the kidney and {{contribute to the development of}} PBPK modeling as a tool for evaluating the role of transporters in renal clearance.
