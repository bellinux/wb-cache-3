40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{commission}} was to undertake historic paint research on the chairlift, at Dudley Zoological Gardens, to determine if evidence survives of the original or early decorative schemes. The elements sampled include (where appropriate) – painted elements of the chair lift, including the iron support structures of the <b>roller</b> system, <b>chairs</b> and surrounding timber. The aim is to ascertain the original paint scheme colours used following the Chairlift’s installation in 1958, and to produce specifications to replicate researched colours in modern materials...|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{conducted}} by the Fire Safety Engineering Group (FSEG) of the University of Greenwich (UoG) under contract to the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). This document represents the final report for the second series of trials conducted by FSEG {{on behalf of the}} CPNI. The overall aim of this project was to design, conduct and analyse a series of pedestrian flow trials to explore the impact of Hostile Vehicle Mitigation Measures (i. e. a Bollard Array, BA) upon pedestrian flows of simulated evacuation conditions. This report describes the performance of the second trial campaign and the subsequent analysis of the data produced. FSEG, in consultation with CPNI, designed a series of trials in order to examine the impact that the presence of a bollard array (BA) might have upon an established pedestrian flow. The trials were conducted in two campaigns, the first in 2013 and the second in 2014. The trials were specifically designed to investigate the impact of several key parameters on the exit flow. Within the first trial campaign the following parameters were investigated: population density, BA position (large stand-off distances), a single bollard placed in the centre of the exit and the presence of a cross-flow. Within the second trial campaign these were: exit width, BA position (small stand-off distances) and the presence of luggage. As these effects were expected to be dependent on population density, two initial population densities were examined in the first trial campaign, 3 p/m 2 and 4 p/m 2. These conditions reflected the maximum engineering design densities and were deemed representative of the conditions typically experienced by station users during egress at peak periods. The results from the first trial campaign suggested that at low population densities the impact of the BA was less significant. Thus the second trial campaign, reported here, concentrated on the higher crowd density of 4 p/m 2. The second trial campaign, consisting of three trial series was conducted over a single weekend in March 2014 (29 and 30 March). These trials were conducted, as with the first trial campaign, on University of Greenwich grounds, in the Queen Anne Courtyard. On Day 1 24 trials were conducted, 9 in Trial Series 1 (TS 1) and 15 in TS 2 while on Day 2, 21 trials were conducted in TS 3. Up to 192 people participated in the TS 1 and TS 2 trials which began at 09 : 00 and were completed by around 15 : 50. Up to 249 people participated in the TS 3 trials which began at 09 : 00 and were completed at around 14 : 40. TS 1 was intended to further investigate the relationship between the proximity of the BA and the exit and the flows generated. While large stand-off distances (3 m and 6 m) were explored in the first trial campaign, the second trial campaign investigated small stand-off distances, in particular between 0 m and 3 m from the exit. Thus the 2. 4 m exit width, with 1 m, 1. 5 m and 2 m stand-off distances were investigated. TS 2 was intended to examine the impact of encumbrance upon the egress flow produced given the presence of the BA at 0 m. These trials used the 2. 4 m wide exit. Participants were provided with a range of encumbrance including hand bags, brief cases, small roller bags, large <b>roller</b> bags, push <b>chairs</b> and bicycles. Three levels of encumbrance were investigated; one in which 0...|$|R
