5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E

50|$|Since {{only the}} brakes on the driving wheels can easily be inboard, the CitroÃ«n 2CV had {{inertial}} dampers on its <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> to damp only wheel bounce.|$|R
25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs.</b> Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacturer}} was the Keystone Match & Machine Company, {{founded in}} 1894 and offering bicycles from 1896. [...] In 1899 the company offered an interesting but complicated steam car. It featured runabout coachwork and was powered by three small single-cylinder steam engines built {{into each of}} its <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> {{in a way that}} they worked as a radial engine. It was tried to avoid the use of sprockets, chains and a differential gear as each wheel worked completely independent from the other. The vehicle could reach a maximum speed of 20 mph.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|E
500|$|Though {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, a bike {{may become}} longitudinally unstable under sufficient acceleration or deceleration, and Euler's second law {{can be used}} to analyze the ground reaction forces generated. For example, the normal (vertical) ground reaction forces at the wheels for a bike with a wheelbase [...] and a center of mass at height [...] and at a distance [...] in front of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> and for simplicity, with both wheels locked, can be expressed as: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, {{after the}} advent of {{freewheel}} coasting mechanisms, the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel. [...] The coaster brake was contained in the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling, thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear. [...] In the United States, the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout {{the first half of}} the 20th century, often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle.|$|E
50|$|The current Autobike uses {{three main}} {{components}} in its automatic transmission. In order to provide the system with power, the front <b>wheel</b> uses a <b>hub</b> dynamo to generate electricity. Wires connect the dynamo through the frame to the bottom bracket area where it joins a small onboard computer with sensors that detect the rider's speed and cadence. The computer uses this information to actuate a motorised shifter mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel's</b> <b>hub</b> gear to change the gear ratio. The rear hub used is the Nuvinci N360 CVP which is a continuously variable transmission using a planetary gear system that can be shifted smoothly at any time, under any load.|$|R
50|$|The Marks-Moir car evolved {{through several}} {{iterations}} between 1921 and 1935. It was initially {{a collaboration between}} Dr A.R. Marks and W. Moir who designed an unconventional, chassis-less car to be manufactured in Australia.The original design was built in England in 1922. It was a two-seater that featured a body made of laminated wood. The motor, supplied by Wolsely, was mounted longitudinally behind the front seats. Two chains took the drive to the solid rear axle and differential action occurred within the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs.</b> This increased ground clearance and minimized power loss compared to more orthodox driveline configurations. It was exhibited at Australia House in London for some months before Marks and Moir bought the prototype and some components to Australia.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five main bearing crankshafts to increase rigidity and the transmission, axles and <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the fully floating design of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators to overload their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|R

50|$|Mobike {{bicycles}} are {{powered by}} a small generator installed on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> to power the lock. The patented disc brake is said to withstand over 10,000 kilometres of riding without failure.|$|E
5000|$|Spoking {{patterns}} may be [...] or semi-tangential. For {{a normal}} wheel size and spoke count, only {{the latter is}} suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> or <b>hub</b> brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both <b>wheels.</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>wheels</b> may also incorporate radial spoking on the non-drive side and semi-tangential spoking on the drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial spoking on the drive side of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{stub axle}} {{is one of}} the two front axles that carries a <b>wheel</b> in a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> drive vehicle.

He placed 18th.|$|E
5000|$|Some more {{sophisticated}} models {{are able to}} measure the rider's power in terms of watts. These units incorporate elements that measure torque at the crank, or <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> or tension on the chain. This technology {{began in the late}} 1980s. (See Team Strawberry for the early development and testing stages of this technology.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Motor Wheel had a 2 {{cycle engine}} which {{produced}} 1HP {{and had two}} flywheel magnetos, bronze bearings and a float feed carburetor. The complete kit came with a <b>wheel,</b> <b>hub</b> tire, shock-absorbing spring sprocket holder, wheel sprocket and chain, handlebar controls for choke, throttle and engine shutoff, three quart gas tank and gas line, and all necessary fittings to adapt the engine and <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> unit to any 26" [...] bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Road wheels were non-detachable {{and of the}} {{artillery}} wheel type. Each had 14 wood spokes. Front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> had the same dimensions with 36 x 4.5 in. pneumatic tires. Model G had very big <b>wheels</b> <b>hubs</b> which gave the car a characteristic look. Suspension consisted of a semi-elliptical leaf springs in front and elliptical at the rear. There were two brakes; one actuated the transmission by a lever outside of the bodywork that actuated, the other, operated by pedal, the differential.|$|R
50|$|The older, {{traditional}} sensors have {{a magnet}} {{attached to a}} spoke of either the front or <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> A sensor based either on the Hall effect, or on a magnetic reed switch, {{is attached to the}} fork or the rear of the frame. The sensor detects when the magnet passes once per rotation of the wheel. Alternatively, a sensor may be attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Distance is determined by counting the number of rotations, which translates into the number of wheel circumferences passed. Speed is calculated from distance against lapsed time period.|$|R
50|$|The three-speed bicycle is {{a bicycle}} that uses {{internal}} hub gears at the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> to provide three gear ratios. Typically, in low gear, the rear sprocket turns {{faster than the}} wheel; in middle gear, the rear sprocket turns {{at the same speed}} as the wheel; in high gear, the rear wheel turns faster than the sprocket.|$|E

Because of this, power should theoretically be measured less than the crank based power meters.Because these units are built into the rear wheel, it is simple to interchange between bikes as long as the wheels are compatible.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{innovative}} electromechanical device which integrates a brushless DC (BLDC) hub motor with a speed-changing <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> stored on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> of an electric bicycle. It combines a power source and a speed-changing mechanism to simultaneously provide functions of power generation and transmission for electric bicycles. As part of the proposed integrated device, the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> consists of a basic planetary gear train providing three forward speeds including a low-speed gear, a direct drive, and a high-speed gear. Each gear is manually controlled by the shift control sleeve to selectively engage or disengage four pawl-and-ratchet clutches based on its clutching sequence table. The number of gear teeth of each gear element of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> is synthesized. The BLDC hub motor is an exterior-rotor-type permanent-magnet synchronous motor. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) software is employed to facilitate the motor design and performance analysis. An analysis of the power transmission path at each gear is provided to verify the validity of the proposed design. The results of this work are beneficial to the embodiment, design, and development of novel electromechanical devices for the power and transmission systems of electric bicycles...|$|R
50|$|For 1992, a {{turbocharged}} 2.0 litre 16 {{valve engine}} (150 kW/204 bhp C20LET, the turbocharged {{version of the}} C20XE) {{was added to the}} range. With four wheel drive, a six speed Getrag manual transmission (F28/6) and a claimed top speed of 245 km/h (152 mph), this flagship model finally gave the Calibra the dynamics to match its looks. The Turbo model was also notable for the five stud <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> and the extreme negative camber (inward lean) of its <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> which is apparent even from a cursory visual inspection. However, it was not a strong seller.|$|R
50|$|A {{semi-trailing}} {{arm suspension}} is a supple {{independent rear suspension}} system for automobiles where each <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground. Trailing-arm and multilink suspension designs are much more commonly used for the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room. Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front suspension and trailing-arm rear axle.|$|R
