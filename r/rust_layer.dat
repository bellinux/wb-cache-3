Corrosion does not initiate under deliquescent NaCl droplets {{smaller than a}} critical size. The mechanisms of corrosion initiation and propagation were identified. The effects of diverse natural environments on the formation and aging of iron oxide products were identified. Part I On carbon steel that were exposed to Hawaiʻi's marine test sites for 30 min, corrosion did not initiate under small seawater droplets (D 80 %), while occurred under larger droplets and sometimes propagated {{in the form of}} filiform corrosion. In addition, anodic polarization showed the steel passivated under small NaCl droplets and corroded actively under larger droplets. In situ and ex situ Raman spectra from the rust species that formed during the corrosion process showed that green rust (GR) formed close to the corrosion pit (i. e., anodic site) while lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) clusters precipitated in regions outside of the GR region (i. e., cathodic site). Similarly, the rust formed in Evans' droplet experiments was also indentified as GR and lepidocrocite using In situ Raman spectroscopy. Part II The corrosion products formed on 1008 steel that were exposed to Hawaiʻi's diverse micro-climates for 1 year period were characterized using micro-Raman analysis, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.

40|$|International audienceWeathering steel was {{designed}} to resist against the atmospheric impact due {{to the development of}} a characteristic <b>rust</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the metal by reducing the corrosion rate. This <b>rust</b> <b>layer</b> is formed by different iron (oxy-hydr) oxides that acts as a barrier and provides the protective ability. In order to check the conservation state trough the protective capability, it is necessary to calculate the so-called protective ability index (PAI). It mainly takes into account the ratio (α/γ) between the mass of goethite (α-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), present in the <b>rust</b> <b>layer</b> of weathering steel. Raman spectroscopy, apart from a qualitative technique, is recently becoming a semi quantitative approach. Therefore, it is a valuable tool for the calculation of the mentioned index. This paper is a widening of a previous work in which it was uncovered a problem in different weathering steel sculptures which are exposed to a Cl− and SO 2 -rich urban atmosphere because they present different esthetical problems on their surfaces, such as detachments of steel chips, discolorations and irregularities. In order to relate these problems on the surface and the <b>rust</b> <b>layer</b> composition, PAI calculations were performed from the phase identification obtained from Raman imaging and using spectra decomposition to quantify each compounds. Although goethite and lepidocrocite were the most commonly detected compounds, hematite, akaganeite and magnetite were also identified.

The mechanism of the corrosion process, as influenced by bacteria, has been studied extensively.

Previous study have indicated that SO 2 in the marine atmosphere can greatly promote the stress corrosion cracking of high-strength steel due to acidification of thin electrolyte layer and reproduction of H+ through FeSO 4. E 690 steel, as a newly-developed high strength steel, is very promising to be widely used in offshore platform in the near future for its excellent performance.
