5|$|The {{middle section}} of the column, forming a type of capital, is a high-relief {{sculpture}} {{of the head of}} a bat executed in the curved lines of the Maya style, with small eyes and eyebrows formed by two small volutes. The leaf-shaped nose is characteristic of the Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus). The mouth is open, exposing the partly preserved fangs, and a prominent tongue extends downwards. A band of double triangles <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the sculpture with a carved cord or rope and may symbolise the bat's wings.|$|E
5|$|M-189 {{starts at}} the Wisconsin state line {{in the middle of}} a bridge {{crossing}} the Brule River that connects to WIS139. The highway runs to the northeast away from the river through forests. The trunkline turns north and curving to the east to run past Laurel Lake. The highway forks at the junction with Caspian Cutoff Road (County Road 651); M-189 takes the northwesterly fork and <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the west side of Caspian. The roadway passes the Iron River County Club as the highway begins to parallel the Iron River. M-189 follows Selden Road north through the southside of the city of Iron River, continuing as 4th Street into downtown. The trunkline ends at a junction with US2 (Adams Street) in the middle of town.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand, {{which can}} seat 1,757 spectators, is an all-seated stand which <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> {{two-thirds of the}} pitch. It {{contains}} the dressing rooms, club offices, ticket offices and hospitality suites, and contains a number of supporting pillars. The stand has open corners to either side, {{one of which is}} where the supporters' club is located, and to the rear has windscreens to either side. At the front of it is the Family Stand, which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers. Opposite is the Popular Stand, a covered all-seated stand, which contains a number of supporting pillars and holds a television gantry on its roof. It can seat 1,652 spectators.|$|E

These {{consist of a}} chronological display which <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.|$|E
5|$|The scoring {{started in}} the first period after some three minutes when Red Bethea caught a 25-yard pass from Goof Bowyer and ran the {{additional}} 10 yards for a touchdown. Bethea also had a 14-yard touchdown run in the second period, and a 58-yard touchdown run in the third. Royce Goodbread had two touchdowns, on end <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the Sewanee line of 15 and 25 yards. Ed Sauls also had two touchdowns, including the second-half kickoff return for 75 yards and a score. Bowyer, Cawthon, Clark, and McClellan all had one touchdown each. Bowyer netted four extra points, and the Gators had another conversion due to a Sewanee penalty.|$|E
5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the fa√ßade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E

5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the base of the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E

5|$|In March 1839, white {{settlers}} arrived from Adelaide, {{the capital of}} the colony of South Australia, to establish Port Lincoln on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula. There were significant clashes between settlers and Aboriginal people in the years that followed, as settlers spread out to establish pastoral <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> the township. In 1842, soldiers were sent to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to help protect the settlers, but the remoteness from Adelaide, and the vaguely defined powers and limited policing resources of the Government Resident, the local representative of the colonial government, meant that there were serious limitations on the rule of law in the region. This was especially true with respect to Aboriginal people, who were supposed to be treated as British subjects {{in the same way as}} the settlers. In common with other areas of South Australia, and Australia as a whole, settlers on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes resulted in violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man, the only such sentence in South Australia's pioneer history. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|Lower North East Road <b>runs</b> <b>around</b> Anstey Hill {{and up the}} {{escarpment}} of the Burnside-Eden Fault Zone. It {{connects the}} suburbsformerly villagesof Hope Valley and Houghton. Three roads were surveyed and built to connect the same locations. The first was a private road constructed by George Anstey in 1841although officially surveyed in 1844to reach his estate, as a mostly straight-line extension of Grand Junction Road. It followed {{the base of a}} gully, before rising steeply up Anstey Hill. From 1842 to 1846, Anstey constructed a replacement private road with a devil's elbow (double hairpin bend) that followed the land's contours more closely. As Chairman of Roads for the District of Yatala, Anstey allocated most of the district's funding to his road, leading to a public outcry that forced him from office in 1851. This ungravelled road became known as Anstey Hill Road and remained in use for 20 years. New Road, later renamed Houghton Road and subsequently Lower North East Road, was constructed in 1873 as a replacement. It was longer than the preceding roads but lacked a devil's elbow, was more evenly sloped, and was paved in 1930. It now separates {{a small part of the}} parkthat contains Klopper's quarries and the Gun Emplacementfrom the rest. Remains of the two previous roads can be seen near Klopper's quarries.|$|E
