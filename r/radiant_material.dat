40|$|This {{study is}} focused on {{investigating}} the effectiveness of low heat accumulation asphalt mixture {{and its impact on}} the urban heat environment. Infrared radiation experiments showed that the temperature of the asphalt mixture decreased with the increase in far-infrared <b>radiant</b> <b>material.</b> The results also revealed that, compared to asphalt with 0 % far-infrared radiant content, the asphalt material with a certain ratio of far-infrared radiation material had higher stability at high and low temperatures as well as good water absorption capacity. The Marshall stability of the specimen mixed with 6 % far-infrared radiant was higher by 12. 2 % and had a residual stability of up to 98. 9 %. Moreover, the low-temperature splitting tensile strength of the asphalt mixture with 6 % far-infrared radiation material increased by 21. 3 %. The friction coefficient of the asphalt mixtures with 6 % and 12 % far-infrared radiation material increased by 17. 7 % and 26. 9 %, respectively...|$|E

40|$|In the mid- 1950 s, a young U. S. Air Force {{engineer}} named Clark Beck {{began work}} {{with what is}} now one of NASA s most prolific spinoffs, the radiant barrier technology. Beck s work involved creating materials that could withstand the immense heat created by passage through the Earth s atmosphere. He was working on structures and resources that could withstand the fluctuations in temperature created by a skip reentry, where a craft would skip along the surface of the atmosphere, gradually making inroads sufficient for reentry, a process that took the craft from extreme heat to frigid cold every few seconds. The material also needed to withstand millions of pounds of pressure per inch of bending without twisting, the simulated force of reentry. Without reflective material, the craft would get what Beck refers to as "red hot wings," and without the required flexibility, the craft would break apart. One result of Beck s work was the discovery of the useful properties of <b>radiant</b> barrier <b>material.</b> The Space Agency used Beck s design work for the materials that went into building the space capsules, heat resistant instrument panels, and, in conjunction with the Air Force, an early spacecraft prototype, the DynaSoar, that looks remarkably similar to the present-day Space Shuttle. NASA used the thin, shiny, silver material to protect the first space explorers from the harsh environment of space, which could range from - 460 F to 541 F. If the engineers had used conventional insulation for the space suits, the fabric would have been 7 -feet thick, a little awkward for even the most nimble of astronauts to maneuver. Radiant barrier technology was clearly the solution. It reflected the astronaut s body heat back into the suit to keep him warm, {{while at the same time}} reflecting radiant energy from the Sun outward to keep him cool. The <b>radiant</b> barrier <b>material</b> reflected more than 95 percent of the radiant energy away from the wearer, while tiny holes in the fabric allowed moisture to escape and longer heat waves to get through. This amazing fabric had an added benefit that made it ideal for its space-bound application: It weighed only 17 pounds per 1, 000 square feet. NASA has used this material ever since the Gemini and Apollo missions, on virtually all of its spacecraft, and even on unmanned missions as thermal protection for instruments...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present the calibration process of a computer model of a naturally-ventilated house built in southern Brazil. The house was monitored over two seven-day periods by using Hobo data loggers. The EnergyPlus computer program was used to create a computer model for the house; parameters related to air infiltration and natural ventilation were modeled by using the AirflowNetwork. The internal air temperatures obtained from the simulations were compared with those measured in the house. During the calibration process, parameters such as thermal resistance and absorptance of the <b>materials,</b> <b>radiant</b> heat gain generated by equipment, and coefficients related to air infiltration and natural ventilation were changed. In general, results obtained from the simulations were adequate. However, air temperature obtained from the simulations were higher than the actual figures when natural ventilation was considered.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} how heat {{development in the}} pulp chamber and coronal surface of natural teeth with and without cusps subjected to irradiance using light-emitting diode (LED) –light-curing units (LCUs) is associated with (i) irradiance, (ii) time, (iii) distance, and (iv) <b>radiant</b> exposure. <b>Materials</b> and methods: Three different LED-LCUs were used. Their irradiance was measured with a calibrated spectrometer (BlueLight Analytics Inc., Halifax, Canada). An experimental rig was constructed to control the thermal environment of the teeth. The LED-LCU tip position was accurately controlled by a gantry system. Tooth surface temperature was measured by thermography (ThermaCAM S 65 HS, FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, USA) and pulp chamber temperature with a thermocouple. LED-LCU tip distance and irradiation times tested were 0, 2, and 4 mm and 10, 20, and 30 s, respectively. Ethical permission was not required {{for the use of}} extracted teeth. Results: Maximum surface and pulp chamber temperatures were recorded in tooth without cusps (58. 1 °C ± 0. 9 °C and 43. 1 °C ± 0. 9 °C, respectively). Radiant exposure explained the largest amount of variance in temperature, being more affected by time than irradiance. Conclusions: At all combinations of variables tested, repeated measurements produced consistent results indicating the reliability of the method used. Increased exposure time seems to be the factor most likely to cause tissue damage. Clinical relevance: Risk of superficial tissue damage at irradiances > 1200 mW/cm 2 is evident. There is a risk of pulp damage when only thin dentin is left at higher irradiances (> 1200 mW/cm 2). Clinicians should be aware of LED-LCU settings and possible high temperature generated...|$|R
50|$|Reflective {{insulation}} and radiant barriers reduce the radiation of heat {{to or from}} the surface of a <b>material.</b> <b>Radiant</b> barriers will reflect radiant energy. A radiant barrier by itself will not affect heat conducted through the material by direct contact or heat transferred by moist air rising or convection. For this reason, trying to associate R-values with radiant barriers is difficult and inappropriate. The R-value test measures heat transfer through the material, not to or from its surface. There is no standard test designed to measure the reflection of radiated heat energy alone. Radiated heat is a significant means of heat transfer; the sun's heat arrives by radiating through space and not by conduction or convection. At night the absence of heat (i.e. cold) is the exact same phenomenon, with the heat radiating described mathematically as the linear opposite. Radiant barriers prevent radiant heat transfer equally in both directions. However, heat flow to and from surfaces also occurs via convection, which in some geometries is different in different directions.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the increase in temperature of ultrasound gel under an infant <b>radiant</b> heat warmer. <b>Materials</b> and methods Ten 10 millilitre blobs of ultrasound gel (EcoGel 200, Eco-Med Pharmaceuticals Inc., Ontario, Canada) were placed on an open cot under a radiant warmer (V- 3200 N Atom Infant-Warmer, Atom Medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) set at maximum heat output. The temperature of the gel blobs was taken with an electronic thermometer (Orion 290 A, Orion Research Inc., Boston, USA) every 10 minutes up to 60 minutes. The mean temperature of the 10 blobs were compared using the student t test. Results The gel increased in temperature from a mean of 21. 57 degrees C (SD = 0. 29) to 26. 76 degrees C (SD= 0. 4) after 60 minutes - an increase of 5. 19 degrees C. The rise in temperature reached a plateau after 30 - 40 minutes. The room temperature was 24. 9 degrees C. Conclusion The temperature of ultrasound gel under a radiant heat warmer increases by less than 6 degrees C. It is therefore unlikely that ultrasound gel placed under a radiant heat warmer for less than 1 hour would lead to thermal injury in the neonate...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanisms that}} enable short pulses of high-intensity ultraviolet laser radiation to remove tissue, {{in a process}} known as laser ablation, remain obscure. The thermodynamic response of biological tissue to pulsed laser irradiation was investigated by measuring and subsequently analyzing the stress transients generated by pulsed argon fluorine (ArF, lambda = 193 nm) and krypton fluorine (KrF, lambda = 248 nm) excimer laser irradiation of porcine dermis using thin-film piezoelectric transducers. For radiant exposures that do not cause material removal, the stress transients are consistent with rapid thermal expansion of the tissue. At the threshold radiant exposure for ablation, the peak stress amplitude generated by 248 nm irradiation is more than an order of magnitude larger than that produced by 193 nm irradiation. For <b>radiant</b> exposures where <b>material</b> removal is achieved, the temporal structure of the stress transient indicates that the onset of material removal occurs during irradiation. In this regime, the variation of the peak compressive stress with radiant exposure is consistent with laser-induced rapid surface vaporization. For 193 nm irradiation, ionization of the ablated material occurs at even greater radiant exposures and is accompanied by a change in the variation of peak stress with radiant exposure consistent with a plasma-mediated ablation process. These results suggest that absorption of ultraviolet laser radiation by the extracellular matrix of tissue leads to decomposition of tissue on the time scale of the laser pulse. The difference in volumetric energy density at ablation threshold between the two wavelengths indicates that the larger stresses generated by 248 nm irradiation may facilitate the onset of material removal. However, once material removal is achieved, the stress measurements demonstrate that energy not directly responsible for target decomposition contributes to increasing the specific energy of the plume (and plasma, when present), which drives the gas dynamic expansion of ablated material. This provides direct evidence that ultraviolet laser ablation of soft biological tissues is a surface-mediated process and not explosive in nature...|$|R

Incandescent lighting is highly inefficient. One possible {{solution is to}} replace the traditional filament with an ordered photonic crystal filament that will increase {{the efficiency of the}} lamp. This work details steps towards the fabrication of such a filament with the fabrication of monolithic three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3 DOM) metallic photonic crystals. The 3 DOM metallic materials produced in this work were comprised of W, Mo and alloys of those materials. The 3 DOM W materials were produced from the precursors tungsten(VI) chloride, tungsten(V) ethoxide, tungstic acid, peroxotungstic acid, ammonium metatungstate (AMT) and an acetylated peroxotungstic acid (APTA). 3 DOM Mo was produced from the precursors ammonium molybdate (AMo) and an acetylated peroxomolybdic acid (APMoA). To fabricate 3 DOM W/Mo materials combinations of precursors of AMT and AMo were utilized or a combination of the syntheses APTA and APMoA to create APTA/APMoA was employed. A variety of synthetic conditions were optimized to produce large monolithic pieces of 3 DOM W and 3 DOM W/Mo with dimensions of up to 1 × 1 × 0. 3 cm 3. These conditions included varying the solvent mixture, precursor concentrations, reduction conditions and precursor infiltration technique. The 3 DOM metallic monoliths were tested for thermal stability using both joule heating and radiant heating techniques in N 2 atmospheres. Joule heating at 40 W for 15 min destroyed the nanostructure of the <b>material.</b> <b>Radiant</b> heating was employed to study the grain coarsening. At 800 ºC the 3 DOM W monolith exhibited grain coarsening and needle formation caused by H 2 O in the system. Needle formation could be eliminated by rigorous evacuation or by the incorporation of Mo as an alloy. 3 DOM W/Mo alloys at 95 : 5 wt% maintained their nanostructure and relative grain size at 800 ºC but were coarsened at 1000 ºC. At both temperatures the material did not produce needles even in the presence of minute amounts of water. The effect of Mo on the nanostructure was studied by in situ TEM heating to 1000 ºC. In 3 DOM W/Mo alloys it is postulated that the Mo has a pinning effect on the dislocations in the structure. These methods provide a route towards fabricating 3 DOM metallic photonic crystals for thermal emission...|$|R
