40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} calibrate the frequency response characteristics of fast <b>response</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers. The method is shown to give good results up to frequencies of at least 50 kHz. Then the frequency response of a pressure measurement system, consisting of a short tube followed by one of these transducers, is calibrated. A theoretical model describing the frequency response of the same pressure measurement system is translated into a computer program and shown to provide excellent agreement with the measurements. This model is then also used to compute response times of measurement systems. Using the computer model, a test setup is designed to measure high frequency components at low pressures with a microphone, which is shown in situ to give good results.

40|$|The {{transonic}} flow characteristics of highly loaded turbine guide vanes are complex. A typical {{transonic flow}} field deals with steady and unsteady shocks, separation bubbles and trailing edge shocks. This leads to further {{investigation of the}} shock waveboundary layer interaction. To get a more detailed understanding of the flow field a spatial pressure and temperature resolution on the blade surface is required. Initially, steady <b>response</b> <b>pressure</b> (PSP) and temperature (TSP) sensitive paints were applied to the suction side surface of a turbine guide vane in a transonic linear cascade (EGG) at DLR Göttingen.

Participants were 310 female hospital nurses (Age: M= 33. 83; SD= 8. 70). Measures included the Effort Reward Imbalance Inventory, to assess effort, reward, ERI-ratio and overcommitment; the General Health Questionnaire- 12 and the Brief Personal Survey-Revised, to measure stress responses; the Hulbert Index of Sexual Desire and the Index of Sexual Satisfaction, to evaluate sexual health. Results showed that the ERI variables are independent predictors of nurses’ stress <b>responses</b> (<b>pressure,</b> psychological distress). The percentage of explained variance ranged from 2. 3 % to 24. 6 %. ERI variables also predicted nurses’ sexual desire and sexual satisfaction.

Mechanical stress in the heart can result in the integrin-mediated activation of focal adhesion kinase and the subsequent recruitment of the Grb 2 adapter molecule. Grb 2, in turn, can activate MAPK cascades via an interaction with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS and with other signaling intermediates. We analyzed {{the role of the}} Grb 2 adapter protein and p 38 MAPK in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice with haploinsufficiency of the Grb 2 gene (Grb 2 +/– mice) appear normal at birth but have defective T cell signaling.
