5|$|The {{etymology}} of Buffalo Creek is unknown. No buffalo {{have ever}} been definitely observed on the creek, although there are rumors about old buffalo wallows.

5|$|Z.sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic {{behavior}} when encountering other {{males of}} the same species. This behavior may include many {{of the same}} elements as courtship, such as <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> spreading the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

5|$|Married {{women were}} {{responsible}} for the day-to-day running of the household.

5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> upgrading.|$|E
5|$|The Legislature of Oklahoma {{consists}} of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{opened in}} 1869 {{and served as}} an {{embarkation}} point for paddle steamer excursions for almost exactly 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> heritage grants allowed the pier to be dismantled for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the National Piers Society, and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now, once again, offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.|$|E
5|$|The striped honeyeater {{has most}} often been {{observed}} singly or in twos, and occasionally in small flocks. When not breeding {{it has been}} recorded feeding in loose mobile groups, drinking in mixed groups with miners, and travelling in small groups. It engages in {{a high level of}} social activity, including perching closely and allopreening, and when feeding in groups chasing, calling and scolding. The non-breeding striped honeyeater is vocal, calling while feeding and perching, though only occasionally calling in flight. It has been recorded engaged in a display of wing <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> calling, and performing duets and call-and-response song.|$|E

5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as Under Secretary of State in 1954, Smith {{continued to}} serve the Eisenhower administration in various posts.

Smith was a consultant at the Special Projects Office (Disarmament) in the Executive Office of the President from 1955 to 1956. He also served as Chairman of the Advisory Council of the President's Committee on Fund <b>Raising,</b> <b>and</b> as a member-at-large from 1958 to 1961.

5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> tilting its head.|$|E

5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Colonel Godfrey Irving was {{appointed}} temporary CGS on 24 May 1915, replacing Legge. His chief responsibility was overseeing {{the expansion of}} the training establishment in Australia to provide reinforcements for the AIF units overseas, and <b>raising</b> <b>and</b> training what would become the 2nd Division. Colonel Hubert Foster took over as CGS in January 1916. However, following a period of ill-health Legge had been relieved of command of his division and returned to Australia. Resuming his post as CGS in October 1917, he remained in the position until 1920. In this position Legge's role was primarily one of dealing with politicians in Australia, and providing reinforcements for the AIF overseas.|$|E
