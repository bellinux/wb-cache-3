5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover {{took charge of}} this project, and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
500|$|Additional clues {{are found}} in the Four Seedlings, a quadrilaterally {{symmetrical}} system made up of four suns. [...] Centuries ago, the leaders of the Old Empire <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> was causing hostile aliens to flee {{from the center of the}} galaxy. The greatest minds from each of the races gathered at this location, where they discovered that the Crystal Planet was slowly eradicating all life. In a last act, they sent a human named Commander McConnell to end it, but he failed. [...] At the start of the game, the Crystal Planet is slowly moving through the galaxy. The planet causes nearby stars to flare up and destroy all life in the system.|$|E
2500|$|Warren {{finally found}} Griffin about [...] {{north of the}} return at the Chimneys. Griffin had pushed ahead of Crawford's {{division}} and had gone even further {{to the right of}} the end of the refused segment of the Confederate line. Griffin <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> was wrong when he did not come up against fortifications after marching about [...] and only finding Munford's outposts as opposition.|$|E

2500|$|In {{accordance}} {{with his usual}} practice Lucan had gone forward at daybreak to inspect the redoubts and outposts, accompanied by his staff: Lord George Paget, Lord William Paulet, and Major Thomas McMahon. As they approached Canrobert's Hill, two signal flags were observed, signifying {{the approach of the}} Russians. Paget, commanding officer of the 4th Light Dragoons (and commanding officer of the Light Brigade in Cardigan's absence), later recalled the moment when they <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> was wrong: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a little}} after 4:00, Officer Simonsen phoned Warden Powell, who was {{across the street at}} his residence. [...] Simonsen told the warden there was a {{disturbance}} inside the prison and that someone had been knifed. [...] Under duress from Myles and Smart, the officer told the warden little else, and Powell rushed through Tower 7 along with two guards to see what the [...] "disturbance" [...] was. [...] As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked through the doorway. [...] His escort <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. [...] The guards on top of this tower knew something was wrong and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.|$|E
2500|$|As {{tensions}} grew {{between the}} suffragists and President Wilson, he <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> {{had to be}} done quickly to end the highly publicized protests and clashes between the police and suffragists. [...] He requested that Congress convene for a special session in May 1919. [...] On May 21 the House of Representatives passed the Susan B. Anthony amendment 304 to 89, and on June 4, the Senate passed it 66 to 30. [...] Surprisingly, the suffragists were very subdued at the announcement of this victory. [...] The suffragists battle was not yet over; they still had to make sure a majority of the states ratified the amendment. Finally in August 1920, Tennessee became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the Anthony amendment, and Burns' quest for federal suffrage was finally over.|$|E

2500|$|James Tague was {{a spectator}} and {{witness to the}} assassination. He {{received}} a minor wound to his right cheek while standing [...] away from the depository's sixth floor easternmost window, [...] in front of and slightly {{to the right of}} President Kennedy's head facing direction and more than [...] below the top of the President's head. Tague's injury occurred when a bullet or bullet fragment with no copper casing struck the nearby Main Street south curb. A deputy sheriff noticed some blood on Tague's cheek, and Tague <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> had stung his face during the shooting. When Tague pointed to where he had been standing, the police officer noticed a bullet smear on a nearby curb. Nine months later the FBI removed the curb, and a spectrographic analysis revealed metallic residue consistent with that of the lead core in Oswald's ammunition. Tague testified before the Warren Commission and was asked if he remembered which of the three shots struck him; he stated that it was the second or third shot. When the Warren Commission attorney pressed him further, Tague stated he was struck concurrent with the second shot.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> significant was about to happen. Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E
2500|$|... 6.82 {{million people}} watched the episode. Coupled with that night's episode of King of the Hill, it won its {{hour in the}} 18-49 demographic. Since airing, the episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Rene Rosa of UGO wrote: [...] "When the self-referential jokes about the episode’s switch to HD were {{the things that made}} me laugh the most, and they last only a few seconds, I <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> was not good. This may be 'The Sharpest. Episode. Ever.' but is definitely not the funniest. Still, there are some genuinely endearing bitter-sweet moments in the episode, [...] but still it’s not enough to drive the show into the un-chartable funny waters that it used to live in." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "If it seems like there's a lot going on, that's because there is. The episode could have easily been just one thing—Homer deals with his Vance inferiority complex, or he sets out to discover the truth of the election from the former principal, or it could have been entirely a flashback episode. But instead, The Simpsons tries to do all three, one for each commercial break. The show has been around for 20 years; I would imagine that there would be plenty to mine from digging deep into a simpler story line for 19 minutes. Instead, 'Take My Life, Please' crushes under the weight of its bloated plot—not to mention that the overexplanation of jokes wasn't helping matters." ...|$|E

60|$|Her words amazed him. He {{had never}} given her credit for such insight, such perceptions. It seemed, indeed, {{as though she}} had <b>realized</b> <b>{{something}}</b> of which he himself was not yet conscious, and yet something which might very well exist.|$|E

5000|$|Critic Joe Viglione of Allmusic called Strange Conversation [...] "an {{impressive}} and ambitious {{work that is}} evidence of the sophistication enveloping the Kris Delmhorst catalog and one hopes that these important musings get noticed beyond the cult that <b>realizes</b> <b>something</b> very special is happening here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ashley Dominique from Geeked Out Nation gave a B rate to the episode. [...] ""Total Eclipse of the Heart" [...] {{moved the}} Augustine Project plot forward in an {{interesting}} way, but only Tyler seems to <b>realize</b> <b>something</b> shady is up with Katherine and Nadia." ...|$|R
60|$|Frank had no {{idea how}} much an eagle weighed, but he <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> of the {{capabilities}} of a bird that could carry off this fish apparently without an effort, and, what was more astonishing, drag the tremendously muscular creature out of the water which was its home.

6000|$|Gradually {{the walls}} he hated, the {{entangling}} relationship he feared, returned upon him; {{and though he}} <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> of the revealing character of his reticence, he had not the will to break it.

60|$|Young as I was I <b>realized</b> <b>something</b> of {{the burden}} which had fallen upon my mother, and when one night I was awakened from deep sleep by hearing her calling out in pain, begging piteously for help, I shuddered in my bed, realizing with childish, {{intuitive}} knowledge that she was passing through a cruel convulsion {{which could not be}} softened or put aside. I went to sleep again at last, and when I woke, I had a little sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "Move, Numa!" [...] he {{commanded}} and placing a palm against the tawny shoulder {{he pushed the}} lion aside.

But they imagined it was in themselves, and after a short spell of rattles, they steadied up and tried harder than ever. The motions they went through trying to stop that jumping jackrabbit of a ball were ludicrous in the extreme.|$|E
