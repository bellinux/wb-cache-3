40|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>type</b> {{warehouses}} {{are different}} from general buildings in the kinds, amount, and arrangement of stored goods, so the fire risk of <b>rack</b> <b>type</b> warehouses is different from those buildings. The fire pattern of <b>rack</b> <b>type</b> warehouses is different in combustion characteristic and storing condition of stored goods. The initial fire burning rate is different in the surface condition of materials, but the running time of fire is closely related {{with the kinds of}} stored materials and stored conditions. The stored goods of the warehouse are consisted of diverse combustibles, combustible liquid, and so on. Fire detection time may be delayed because the residents are less than office and commercial buildings. If fire detectors installed in <b>rack</b> <b>type</b> warehouses are inadaptable, the fire of the warehouse may be the great fire because of delaying of fire detection. In this paper, we studied what kinds of fire detectors are optimized in early detecting of <b>rack</b> <b>type</b> warehouse fire by real-scale fire tests. The fire detectors used in the tests are rate of rise type, fixed type, photo electric type, and aspirating type detectors. We considered optimum fire detecting method in <b>rack</b> <b>type</b> warehouses suggested by the response characteristic and comparative analysis of the fire detectors...|$|R

Several nets may be connected together. Seeds are planted on the nets in September, often helped by the process of installing nets in multiple layers to facilitate the clinging of the seeds to the net; the layers of nets are separated and re-installed once the seeds are well attached. The nets are subsequently moved to a farming area. The <b>rack</b> <b>type</b> nets installed at gim farms are submerged during high tide and exposed to the sun at low tide; this limited exposure to the sun allows for a certain amount of photosynthesis thats helps maintain the original flavor of the gim. Farming gim using the rack technique is an eco-friendly cultivation method.|$|R

This is relevant for the classification of finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebras whose group of group-likes is non-abelian. We deal mainly with simple racks. We recall the notion of <b>rack</b> of <b>type</b> D, collect the known lists of simple <b>racks</b> of <b>type</b> D and include preliminary results for the open cases.
