The pharmacokinetic profile of both drugs in plasma were best described by a 2 -compartmental model with 1 st-order rate constants. Plasma {{disposition of}} closantel and <b>rafoxanide</b> were characterised by a rapid distribution (t 1 / 2 (a) of &lt; 30 min), long elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 (b) of 17. 0 + 4. 0 days for closantel and 7. 2 + 0. 6 days for <b>rafoxanide),</b> small apparent volume of distribution (Vss of &lt; 0. 15 ℓ/kg) and a slow rate of total body clearance (Cl of &lt; 0. 01 mℓ/min/kg). The area under the drug plasma concentration curve (AUC) of closantel at 5 mg/kg was nearly {{twice as large as}} that of <b>rafoxanide</b> at 7. 5 mg/kg resulting from the slower t 1 / 2 (b) observed with closantel compared to <b>rafoxanide.</b> Large individual differences were observed in the rate measurements of distribution (k 12, k 21 and t 1 / 2 (a)), whereas the parameters of elimination (k 10, t 1 / 2 (b) and Cl), were more consistent between animals. A dose proportional increase in AUC was observed for closantel administered at 5 and 15 mg/kg. A low, constant salivary concentration of closantel (mean of 0. 04 + 0. 05 mg/mℓ) and <b>rafoxanide</b> (mean of 0. 07 + 0. 04 mg/mℓ) was observed during the 24 -h examination period after dosing...|$|E

Primary pharmacokinetic parameters for bioavailability and disposition of <b>rafoxanide</b> in plasma for both routes of administration were determined by noncompartmental and non-linear, 1 -compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis, respectively. Significantly (P &lt; 0. 05) higher peak plasma concentrations (cmax) of <b>rafoxanide</b> and a more rapid rate of absorption (c. 3. 5 times) was observed in sheep after intra-abomasal (i-a) administration compared to intraruminal (i. r.) administration.

40|$|The {{stability}} and the partitioning of closantel and <b>rafoxanide</b> in ruminal fluid (RF) was examined in vitro. Stability was evaluated in two studies in a ruminal fluid-artificial saliva (RF-AS) mixture containing either drug. Drug concentrations were measured in samples collected sequentially from four batches of RF-AS fortified with either closantel or <b>rafoxanide</b> {{in one study}} and in four separately incubated aliquots of a RF-AS mixture of each drug in the second study at the start and at various intervals during a 24 h incubation period. The viability of the in vitro RF-AS incubation model was validated {{by the presence of}} digoxin degradation (T 1 / 2 of 39. 1 ± 13 h) and by the absence of significant time related differences (P> 0. 5) in volume of gas produced, pH and methylene blue reduction time of the RF-AS drug mixture. Partitioning of closantel and <b>rafoxanide</b> was determined by measuring the relative drug concentration of the fluid and particulate phases in RF fortified with either drug at different concentrations. Closantel and <b>rafoxanide</b> were shown to be stable in a RF-AS mixture and were not subjected to any significant biodegradation. An initial marked reduction in drug concentration measured in the RF-AS mixture during the first 2 h of incubation was attributed to the attachment of both drugs onto particulate matter.

40|$|The {{halogenated}} salicylanilides are a {{large group}} of compounds developed mainly for their antiparasitic activity in animals. Several halogenated salicylanilides with potent antiparasitic activity have been synthesised of which only closantel, niclosamide, oxyclozanide, <b>rafoxanide</b> and resorantel are commercially available. Closantel and <b>rafoxanide,</b> which represent the most important drugs in the group, are used extensively for the control of Haemonchus spp. and Fasciola spp. infestations in sheep and cattle and Oestrus ovis in sheep {{in many parts of the}} world.

40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} {{various levels of}} {{hexachloroethane}} and <b>rafoxanide</b> on cross breed goats were investigated. Goats received hexachloroethane showed no gain in body weights. The clinical signs were very clear in goats received 29. 5 g/animal (the therapeutic dose) and deaths in those received 44. 25 g/animal (one and half the therapeutic dose). The main signs were diarrhea, tympany, salivation and nervous signs accompanied by inco-ordination, staggering, twitching in neck, paddling, paralysis and recumbency. These signs were transient in goats given 29. 5 g/animal and more severe leading to death in goats drenched with 44. 25 g/animal. In both groups lesions included liver fatty change, proliferous bile duct, congestion, haemosiderosis and haemorrhage. Also infiltration of mononuclear cells in kidney and intestine were observed in goats dosed with the therapeutic dose. The drug caused reduction in serum total protein, albumin, globulin and increase in serum enzymes activities GOT and γGT, creatinine, urea beside the decrease in minerals levels sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorous. The drug also resulted in anaemia. Goats received <b>rafoxanide</b> at the therapeutic dose 3 ml/ 10 kg and 3 times the therapeutic dose 9 ml/ 10 kg showed increase in weight gains and no clinical or histopathological signs were observed.

INTRODUCfiON. Th ~ first report in South Africa of resistance of gastro-mtestmal nematodes to the modern anthelmintics al?-peared in 1975 (Berger, 1975). However, no systematic search has ever been conducted in South Africa for resis-tant strains, and in every case the resistance came to light because of complaints by consumers or during the course of routine investigations (Van Wyk & Gerber, 1980). During the past decade resitance has escalated to the extent that many cases are occurring with ever increasing frequency, and we have already found resistance to an impressive array of anthelmintics and an increasing number of strains of Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcincta and Moniezia expansa. This paper describes trials with 2 strains of H. contor-tus which were tested for resistance to <b>rafoxanide</b> and other anthelmintics.

40|$|On the {{strength}} of a complaint of suspected resistance to closantel, a field strain of Haemonchus contortus was isolated from sheep on a farm near Pretoria and tested for resistance to the remedy, both without exposure to closantel in the laboratory (designated the "unselected" substrain of the parasite) and after a single selection with closantel (called the "selected" substrain). For comparative purpose a few sheep were treated with <b>rafoxanide</b> to ascertain whether the efficacy of this drug was unchanged. While the unselected substrain appeared to show only slight increased resistance to the residual effect of closantel drenched at a dosage rate of 5 mg/kg, there was a dramatic increase in resistance after one selection. The, residual efficacy (determined by the modified NPM test of Groeneveld & Reinecke, 1969, as outlined by Reinecke, 1973), 13 - 14 days after treatment with closantel was reduced from the registered claim of the remedy in South Africa of > 80 % effective in > 80 % of the treated flock to "ineffective", or < 50 % effective in < 50 % of the treated flock. Furthermore, there also appeared to be a slight increase in the resistance of this substrain to <b>rafoxanide,</b> as its efficacy was reduced from 99 - 100 % to about 92 %. This sharp reduction in efficacy after a single selection with closantel seemed to indicate that the slight increase in resistance of the unselected substrain was probably due not to possible variation in the repeatability of the trail method but to repeated treatment with closantel on the farm.

40|$|Objective of {{the work}} was to study a {{potential}} association between trematode infections in pregnant ewes and concentrations β-hydroxybutyrate, which is a ketone body found in animals with pregnancy toxaemia. After administration of a long-acting nematocide, 80 pregnant sheep, infected with trematodes, were allocated as follows; primigravidae ewes in group P-A remained untreated and in group P-B were given netobimin; multigravidae ewes in group M-A remained untreated, in group M-B were given netobimin and in group M-C were given <b>rafoxanide.</b> We collected faecal samples for trematode epg counting and blood samples for measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Mean faecal epg counts of D. dendriticum and F. hepatica decreased significantly after netobimin administration; mean faecal epg counts of F. hepatica, but not of D. dendriticum, decreased significantly after <b>rafoxanide</b> administration. Between P-A and P-B, the difference in mean blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations was significant (P = 0. 036) immediately after lambing. Between M-A or M-C and M-B, it was significant (P ≤ 0. 002) 28 days after trematocide administration and immediately after lambing; between M-A and M-C, no significant difference was evident. Immediately after lambing, mean blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentration in primiparous/multiparous ewes with Dicrocoelium faecal output ≤ 150 epg was 0. 21 / 0. 64 mmol L- 1, respectively, and in primiparous/multiparous ewes with Dicrocoelium faecal output > 150 epg was 0. 40 / 0. 93 mmol L- 1, respectively (P = 0. 704 /< 0. 001, respectively).

C. 2. 5. 1. 18) activity {{and the development of}} salicylanilide resistance in Fasciola hepatica was investigated. Various isolates of F. hepatica with varying susceptibilities to salicylanilides were isolated and maintained in the laboratory. Individual flukes of these isolates were surveyed for their level of GST activity and a correlation between the level of GST activity and drug efficacy was found. In contrast to most other studies, a decrease in GST activity was associated with an increase in drug resistance. Evidence was collected to show that this may be a selective process since flukes which had survived exposure to <b>rafoxanide</b> and closantel in vivo (in sheep) had lower activity levels of GST than flukes from untreated sheep. Treatment with other flukicides (oxyclozanide, luxabendazole and triclabendazole) did not have this effect. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with closantel induced selection of particular isoenzymes in different isolates of F. hepatica having different degrees of susceptibility to closantel. However, no single isoenzyme or isoenzyme profile was associated with resistance and, in total, up to 8 different isoenzymes could be present in a single isolate. Thus, GST has some potential as a marker enzyme for salicylanilide resistance in F. hepatica. However, the precise role of GST in resistance is unclear and the extensive inter- and intra-isolate variation in activity levels and isoenzyme characteristics of this enzyme indicate the need for considerably more study before application in field situations...|$|E

After correction for sample weight changes during cooking, no major losses were observed for residues of oxyclozanide, clorsulon, closantel, ivermectin, albendazole, mebendazole or fenbendazole. However, significant losses were observed for nitroxynil (78 % in fried muscle, 96 % in roast muscle), levamisole (11 % in fried muscle, 42 % in fried liver), <b>rafoxanide</b> (17 % in fried muscle, 18 % in roast muscle) and triclabendazole (23 % in fried liver, 47 % in roast muscle). Migration of residues from muscle into expressed cooking juices varied between drugs, constituting 0 % to 17 % (levamisole) of total residues remaining after cooking. With the exception of nitroxynil, residues of anthelmintic drugs were generally resistant to degradation during roasting and shallow frying. Conventional cooking cannot, therefore, be considered a safeguard against ingestion of residues of anthelmintic veterinary drugs in beef...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade in South Africa {{there has been a}} continual {{increase}} in sheep of strains of gastrointestinal helminths resistant to the modern anthelmintics. Five strains of Haemonchus contortus are described in this paper. Despite the fact that 2 of the 5 strains were tested for susceptibility only to ivermectin, a total of 10 instances of resistance were found. Four of the 5 strains were resistant to ivermectin, 2 to closantel, 2 to <b>rafoxanide</b> and 2 to the benzimidazoles. One of these strains was concurrently resistant to 3 different anthelmintic groups, namely, the ivermectins, the benzimidazoles and the salicylanilides. Resistance to ivermectin developed in 2 strains of H. contortus after a history of only 3 treatments with this compound in one instance and 11 treatments in the other. In the latter case drenching with ivermectin was well interspersed with that of other anthelmintics. This rapid development of resistance suggests that there may be cross-resistance between ivermectin and another anthelmintic group. Two of the ivermectin resistant strains were recovered from separate properties in the south-western Cape Province, where Ostertagia circumcincta, which is usually the dominant parasite in this region, was virtually eliminated by the anthelmintic treatment. On each of these properties it was apparently replaced by a resistant strain of H. contortus. A serious threat to control is the dissemination of worm strains with multiple resistance to anthelmintics. The strain of H. contortus resistant to 3 anthelmintic groups has already been widely dispersed, as the farmer concerned suddenly decided to give up farming with sheep and to sell his flock.

40|$|Arabian camel urine is reputed in our honourable sunna and flake {{medicine}} {{for the treatment}} {{of a wide variety of}} health problems in particular liver ailments. Pharmacological and therapeutic efflects of camel urine were performed through in vivo and in vitroexperiments, with a comparative physical, biochemicaland analytical analysis to know the constituents of livestock urine (Camelus dromedarius). The physical and biochemical investigation depicted that camel urine has an alkaline pH 9. 5 ± 0. 5, with a pronounced amount of potassium 7. 25 ± 0. 05 mmol/L, urea 14. 2 ± 3. 3 mg/L, and total protein 8. 87 ± 3. 3 g/L, sodium, uric acid and creatinine were slightly low when compared to other species. Pharmacological preliminary screening effect of camel urine on isolated tissue stripsof differed species (rats/rabbits and chick) revealed in an stimulant effect on rat fundus which was blocked by cyprohyptadine. Rabbit intestine showed a dose dependant stimulant response to diluted urine, crude urine has a marked (relaxant) effect followed by transient contraction on first washing, it was blocked by atropine. Rat duodenum showed relaxant response. Camel urine and Camel urine chlorofomic extract has a significant antihepatotoxic effect at P< 0. 05, it was proven experimentally by using hepatotoxic agaents (CCL 4 and paracetamol) and compared to Silymarin (natural hepatoprotective drug). Camel urine protein precipitate and camle urine (diluted) has a significant cellular changes on Bovine kidney and liver cell culture. Clinical trails were also conducted {{for the treatment of}} naturally infected calves with (F. gigantic) early moring female camel urine and compared to the liver fluke commercial drug (<b>Rafoxanide).</b> Livestock urine particularly that of Camelus dromedariuswere subjected to chemical and chromatographic investigations. Extraction, separation and fractionation of camel urine revealed the presence of alkaloid substances, purine basesand essential amino acids. IR techniques revealed the presence of identical compounds but not similar in 4 different aged female camel urine...|$|E
