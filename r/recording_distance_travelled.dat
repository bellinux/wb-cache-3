40|$|ABSTRACT: Patterns of {{foraging}} behaviour {{are described}} {{for a local}} assemblage of wrasses (Labridae) at the within-habitat scale of 2 fringing reef sites at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, {{to examine the relationship}} between locomotor abilities and foraging patterns. Focal individual censuses were used to <b>record</b> the <b>distances</b> <b>travelled</b> by individuals over 30 s and 5 min time periods, and their substratum microhabitat preferences during searching and feeding. Size of short-term foraging ranges, estimated by linear start-to-finish distances, appeared to be driven largely by the shape of the foraging path. Two major foraging modes were identified: directed (widely-foraging) and convoluted (restricted). Within each mode, a strong positive relationship was observed between estimated locomotory ability and foraging distances. Four major groups of foraging-microhabitat preferences were apparent: neutral foraging and positive selection towards aggregates, dead coral heads, or live coral. A weak relationship between foraging mode and estimated patch size of preferred microhabitats was observed, with species having a directed foraging mode most frequently selecting more spatially discrete microhabitats...|$|R

50|$|The {{popularity}} of the event continued to grow and it soon {{became apparent that the}} number of entries was growing beyond the capacity of the Road Safety Centre. As a result, in 1992 the event was moved to the Adelaide International Raceway at Virginia, SA. This site easily catered for the increased number of entries. The wider, flatter track saw <b>records</b> for the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> in the 24 hour endurance race increase. A major disadvantage of this site has been its openness and exposure to weather. Wind, dust and an uninteresting track layout had the committee looking for alternatives. 1996 marked the last time that petrol driven hybrids were allowed to participate. At various stages throughout the history of the 24 hour race there have been categories for petrol and solar hybrids as well as a commuter category where more than one rider was in the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Piston SystemsThe {{pressure}} release {{in this system}} is realized through movement of a spring-tensioned piston. When pressure should be released, a linear motor pulls back the plunger piston and opens up more space for the fluid. The system was used for example in the ABS I (1988) and ABS II (1993) of BMW. The ABS II differed in size and an electronically controlled friction clutch was mounted on the shaft instead of a plunger. Further displacement sensors <b>record</b> the <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> of the piston to allow the control unit a more precise regulation. Honda also uses this system of pressure modulation for big sports and touring bikes.|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of "one-trial tolerance" {{to the effects}} of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (CDP) in the elevated plus maze was re-examined. Unlike previous experiments, pre-exposure to the maze resulted in habituation and a consequential reduction in time spent on the open arms. The habituation effect was measured by <b>recording</b> the actual <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by the rats in the maze and this was found to be significantly reduced by pre-exposure. Pre-exposure to the maze in the presence of CDP resulted in a reduced response to its "anxiolytic-like" effects (increasing time on the open arms compared to vehicle control rats). However, although the time spent on the open arms was reduced by pre-exposure, CDP significantly increased the time spent on the open arms by rats pre-exposed under a non-drugged state. These results suggest that rats do not become tolerant {{to the effects of}} CDP, but rather the reduced response to CDP after pre-exposure is due to habituation of exploratory behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Mate-guarding is an {{important}} determinant of male reproductive success {{in a number of}} species. Little is known however about the constraints of this behaviour, e. g. the associated energetic costs. We investigated these costs in long-tailed macaques where alpha males mate guard females to a lesser extent than predicted by the priority of access model. The study was carried out during two mating periods on three wild groups living in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia. We combined behavioural observations on males' locomotion and feeding activity, GPS <b>records</b> of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> and non-invasive measurements of urinary C-peptide (UCP), a physiological indicator of male energetic status. Mate-guarding led to a decrease in feeding time and fruit consumption suggesting a reduced intake of energy. At the same time, vertical locomotion was reduced, which potentially saved energy. These findings, together with the fact that we did not find an effect of mate-guarding on UCP levels, suggest that energy intake and expenditure was balanced during mate-guarding in our study males. Mate-guarding thus seems to not be energetically costly under all circumstances. Given that in strictly seasonal rhesus macaques, high-ranking males lose physical condition over the mating period, we hypothesise that the energetic costs of mate-guarding vary inter-specifically depending on the degree of seasonality and that males of non-strictly seasonal species might be better adapted to maintain balanced energetic condition year-round. Finally, our results illustrate the importance of combining behavioural assessments of both energy intake and expenditure with physiological measures when investigating energetic costs of behavioural strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that time series {{analyses}} of road safety and risk can be improved by using demographic data. We demonstrate that the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by drivers or riders of a certain age reflects the fluctuations over the years of the number of people of that age within the population. We further demonstrate that the change over time of per capita <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> i. e. <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> per person, is often less subject to stochastic fluctuations, and therefore more smooth than the total <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> for drivers of that age. This smoothness is used to obtain forecasts of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> or to average out year-to-year fluctuations of data of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> Analysis of such data stratified by age group, gender or both reveals that, for most travel modes, per capita <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> is to a large extent constant or slowly changing over time. The consequences for the evaluation of risk, i. e. casualties per <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> with and without the use of population data, are explored.

It is shown that the analyses and forecasts of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> could gain substantially by incorporating demographic data, as compared to an analysis with data of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> alone.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> is a {{critical}} component of American life, generating immense impacts on a variety of aspects of the society. In 1995, American households took about 656 million long distance domestic trips (100 + miles, one way), which totaled 1 billion person trips. Compared to the well-studied intra-urban <b>travel,</b> long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> needs further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts, for which the long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> data serve as a substantial basis. While MPOs periodically collect both supply and demand data to support the development of regional models, supply-side data reflecting transportation service and costs at corridor, interregional, and national level are scarce. To merge the gap, {{there is a need to}} establish a national data framework, with available datasets integrated to support implementing quantitative methods on a national highway network to resolve network loading issues for long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> This research intends to address this imperative. The research scope embraces the long <b>distance</b> passenger <b>travel</b> on national highways within the contiguous United States. The framework developed comprises not only a data warehouse where a plethora of datasets reside and interact, but also a complete modeling methodology to infer network loading conditions of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> Applying the national data framework approach, this research answers a pivotal question: how can we gain knowledge and insights of distributive patterns of long <b>distance</b> passenger <b>travel</b> at interregional level given existing data resources?
