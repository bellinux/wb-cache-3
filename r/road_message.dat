40|$|While <b>road</b> safety <b>messages</b> {{that focus}} on {{physical}} threats have shown some effectiveness, messages that include social threats and gains/rewards may be an alternative approach to encourage safer driving behaviours. In addition to message frame and type, motor vehicle advertising exposure may also influence the persuasiveness of <b>road</b> safety <b>messages.</b> Using qualitative methods this preliminary study explored young drivers’ (N = 17, 11 males) perceptions of the persuasiveness of four anti-speeding messages and a fictional high performance vehicle advertisement. The majority of males perceived the social loss/gain-framed messages to be more persuasive (sense of responsibility and personal relevance themes), whereas females tended to perceive the physical loss/ gain-frame messages (social esteem theme) to be more persuasive. Males appeared to be, while females appeared not to be, persuaded by the vehicle advertisement. The findings suggest that a range of <b>road</b> safety <b>messages</b> {{may be required to}} reach and influence young drivers...|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{discussed}} and presented DHRP, Direction based Hazard Routing Protocol for transmission of <b>road</b> hazard <b>messages</b> in highways {{with the use of}} smart RSUs. RSUs provide a feasible and cost-effective option for disseminating <b>road</b> hazard <b>messages</b> and provide a reliable alternate to V 2 V communication, especially, in highways where the vehicular traffic is sparse. DHRP would be used for disseminating information about different fixed road hazards such as road blocks, tree fall, boulders on road, and other obstacles to the vehicles approaching the hazardous locations. DHRP carries out selective transmission of hazard message based on the location of hazard and the direction in which the vehicles are travelling. As RSUs would be responsible for disseminating <b>road</b> hazard <b>messages</b> to the vehicles, the network overhead is highly reduced and high reliability can be achieved. The protocol was implemented and tested using SUMO and NS 2.33 simulators for transmission range of 250  m. As future work, it is proposed to extend the protocol for RSU deployment with large interspacing and also to highways with varied traffic.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{transmission}} of fixed <b>road</b> hazard <b>messages</b> in highways {{with the use}} of smart RSUs. Fixed road hazards would include tree or boulder fall. In highways with sparse traffic, the vehicle encountering the hazard {{is likely to be the}} primary source of information about the hazard. V 2 V communication would not be a feasible option as the vehicular traffic is not dense. Hence, V 2 R communication has been proposed for timely delivery of the <b>road</b> hazard <b>messages.</b> Vehicles which receive such hazardous message in advance would be able to take appropriate measures, like re-routing, to avoid the hazardous location.|$|R

40|$|Hybrid Sensors and Vehicular Networks (HSVN), {{represent}} a hybrid network, which uses {{several generations of}} Ad-Hoc networks. It is used especially in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The HSVN allows making collaboration between the Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) deployed {{on the border of}} the road and the Vehicular Network (VANET). This collaboration is defined by messages exchanged between the two networks for the purpose to inform the drivers {{about the state of the}} road, provide road safety information and more information about traffic on the road. Moreover, this collaboration created by HSVN, also allows the use of a network and the advantage of improving another network. For example, the dissemination of information between the sensors quickly decreases its energy, and therefore, we can use vehicles that do not have energy constraint to disseminate the information between sensors. On the other hand, to solve the disconnection problem in VANET, the sensors can be used as gateways that allow sending the messages received by one vehicle to another. However, because of the short communication range of the sensor and its low capacity of storage and processing of data, it is difficult to ensure the exchange of <b>road</b> <b>messages</b> between it and the vehicle, which can be moving at high speed at the time of exchange. This represents the time where the vehicle is in communication range with the sensor. This work is the proposition of a communication protocol between the sensors and the vehicle used in HSVN. The latter has as the purpose to ensure the exchange of <b>road</b> <b>messages</b> in the available time of exchange...|$|R
30|$|Hence, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} RSUs provide a {{feasible}} option for disseminating <b>road</b> safety <b>messages</b> and provide a reliable alternate to V 2 V communication, especially, in areas where the vehicular traffic is sparse. Concepts of store and selective forwarding can reduce the network load and improve reliability.|$|R

40|$|Using Gray and McNaughton’s revised RST, {{this study}} {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} the Behavioural Approach System (BAS) and the Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS) influence the processing of gain-framed and loss-framed <b>road</b> safety <b>messages</b> and subsequent message acceptance. It was predicted that stronger BAS sensitivity and FFFS sensitivity would be associated with greater processing and acceptance of the gain-framed messages and loss-framed messages, respectively. Young drivers (N = 80, aged 17 – 25 years) viewed one of four <b>road</b> safety <b>messages</b> and completed a lexical decision task to assess message processing. Both self-report (e. g., Corr-Cooper RST-PQ) and behavioural measures (i. e., CARROT and Q-Task) were used to assess BAS and FFFS traits. Message acceptance was measured via self-report ratings of message effectiveness, behavioural intentions, attitudes and subsequent driving behaviour. The results are discussed in the context of the effect that differences in reward and punishment sensitivities may have on message processing and message acceptance...|$|R

40|$|Young Australian drivers aged 17 – 25 {{years are}} {{overwhelmingly}} represented in road fatalities where speed is a factor. In the combined LGAs of Armidale Dumaresq, Guyra, Uralla and Walcha in the 5 years 1999 - 2003 inclusive, 43 % of speeding related casualty crashes involved a young driver aged less than 25 years. This is {{despite the fact}} that the 17 - 25 age group account for only 25 % of the driving population in this area. Young male drivers account for the majority of these crashes and also tend to have a higher number of driving offences and accrue more penalties for road traffic offences, especially speeding. By analysing data from questionnaires by male and female participants this research project has been able to evaluate road safety advertisements to determine which ones are most effective to young drivers, what features of these advertisements are effective, how males differ from females in their receptiveness and preferences for road safety advertisements and specifically how to target young people especially young men in conveying <b>road</b> safety <b>messages.</b> Finally this research project has identified factors that are important in the production of media road safety advertisements and has made recommendations for how best to convey effective <b>road</b> safety <b>messages</b> to young Australian drivers in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Adopting {{a traffic}} safety culture approach, this paper {{identifies}} and discusses the ongoing challenge of promoting the <b>road</b> safety <b>message</b> in Australia. It is widely acknowledged that mass {{media and public}} education initiatives have {{played a critical role}} in the significant positive changes witnessed in community attitudes to road safety in the last three to four decades. It could be argued that mass media and education have had a direct influence on behaviours and attitudes, as well as an indirect influence through signposting and awareness raising functions in conjunction with enforcement. Great achievements have been made in reducing fatalities on Australia’s roads; a concept which is well understood among the international road safety fraternity. How well these achievements are appreciated by the general Australian community however, is not clear. This paper explores the lessons that can be learnt from successes in attitudinal and behaviour change in regard to seatbelt use and drink driving in Australia. It also identifies and discusses key challenges associated with achieving further positive changes in community attitudes and behaviours, particularly in relation to behaviours that may not be perceived by the community as dangerous, such as speeding and mobile phone use while driving. Potential strategies for future mass media and public education campaigns to target these challenges are suggested, including ways of harnessing the power of contemporary traffic law enforcement techniques, such as point-to-point speed enforcement and in-vehicle technologies, to help spread the <b>road</b> safety <b>message...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{protocol}} proposes {{the deployment}} of RSUs relatively {{close to each other}} with capability of communicating with its neighboring RSUs and with the vehicles travelling on the highway. The communication range (CR) of RSUs would extend to single and multi-lane highways so that all the lanes are within its communication zone. As RSUs are stationary infrastructure, the use of RSUs improves the reliability of the transmission of messages. The messages can also be broadcast by the RSUs with minimal delay to the vehicles moving towards the hazard location. Hence, the use of RSUs can guarantee the reliable and speedy delivery of <b>road</b> hazard <b>messages</b> to vehicles.|$|R

30|$|Dissemination of {{hazardous}} message on highways where the traffic is sparse is a challenging task in VANET. In urban areas, {{the density of}} vehicles is generally very high, and V 2 V communication would be a viable option for disseminating <b>road</b> safety <b>messages.</b> The civic authorities would be physically monitoring the city roads {{to ensure that they}} are clean and hazard free. But on highways, intimating road hazard information to the highway authority may itself be a challenging task if the traffic is sparse.

The vehicle can store the message and disseminate to other vehicles approaching the hazard location (Ozan et al. 2007). However, the direction of travel of the vehicle which is carrying the hazard message may not be the direction to which it has to forward the message.|$|R
