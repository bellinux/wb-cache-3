5|$|A <b>regular</b> {{tessellation}} is {{a highly}} symmetric, edge-to-edge tiling made up of <b>regular</b> polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three <b>regular</b> tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or <b>regular</b> hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} third {{during the}} <b>regular</b> season, the Thorns {{advanced to the}} playoffs where they defeated second-place team FC Kansas City 3–2 during overtime.

5|$|Allen {{played as}} an inside linebacker {{throughout}} the preseason in 1993, {{but he was}} again cut to the practice squad {{before the start of}} the <b>regular</b> season. He was quickly brought back to the active roster and recorded five tackles in the Lions' season-opening win against the Toronto Argonauts. Allen saw <b>regular</b> playing time for the first time in his career, playing in fifteen <b>regular</b> season games for the Lions. He played mostly as a middle linebacker, but he briefly replaced Tyrone Jones twice at the outside linebacker position while he was recovering illness and injury. Allen finished the <b>regular</b> season with 67 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. He also recovered a fumble in the Western Semi-Final, but the Lions went on to lose 9–17 to the Stampeders.|$|E
50|$|British {{fortunes}} {{reached their}} high point in August, 1780, when Lord Charles Cornwallis's force of British <b>regulars</b> and Loyalists inflicted a seemingly-decisive defeat on Patriot forces at the Battle of Camden. A {{substantial number of}} Cornwallis's three thousand men were Loyalists—North Carolina Loyalist <b>regulars</b> and militia, a Northern unit called the Volunteers of Ireland, and the infantry and cavalry of the British Legion. Lord Cornwallis did not oppose his Loyalists to the Patriot militia, and send his British <b>regulars</b> against the Continental <b>regulars.</b> Instead, the Loyalists faced the Patriot <b>regulars,</b> and the British attacked the inexperienced Patriot militia, routing them, exposing the Patriot flank, and causing the collapse and total rout of the whole Patriot army.|$|R

5|$|Almon {{was signed}} by the BC Lions and {{attended}} their training camp in 2003. He was cut {{before the start of}} the <b>regular</b> season. He was later activated due to injuries and played in a single <b>regular</b> season game for the Lions.|$|E
5|$|Also {{benefiting from}} the {{offensive}} line's strength was Tech quarterback Bryan Randall. Randall finished the <b>regular</b> season with 1,957passing yards and 12passing touchdowns, completing 140 of his 225passes during the process. He also was successful running the ball, carrying it for 527yards and three touchdowns during the <b>regular</b> season.|$|E

West Virginia finished the <b>regular</b> season ranked seven times in the final rankings of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), a predecessor to the CFP. The Bowl Coalition, a predecessor to the CFP and BCS systems, ranked WVU 3rd in its final standings at {{the conclusion}} of the 1993 <b>regular</b> season. Since the end of the 2016 season, the Mountaineers are 43–109–2 against opponents ranked in the AP Poll.|$|E

50|$|The British {{casualty}} return gave 25 British <b>regulars,</b> 3 militiamen and 3 Native Americans killed; 63 <b>regulars,</b> 6 militiamen and 3 Native Americans wounded; and 9 <b>regulars</b> missing: a {{total of}} 31 killed, 72 wounded and 9 missing. Of these, 13 killed, 32 wounded and 6 missing were from the Royal Scots, who had endured a heavy cannonade while grounded in their boats. The Americans took 5 prisoners.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>regular</b> season, {{the team}} which has the most points is awarded the title of <b>regular</b> season champion. The league in the past {{generally}} takes a several week break between the <b>regular</b> season and postseason. As with the <b>regular</b> season, the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled {{the end of the}} <b>regular</b> season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the <b>regular</b> season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.|$|E
5|$|Britain, therefore, {{began the}} war with six <b>regular</b> and 14 reserve {{infantry}} divisions. During the war, a further six <b>regular,</b> 14 Territorial, 36 Kitchener's Army and six other divisions, including the Naval Division from the Royal Navy were formed.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During {{the last two games}} of the <b>regular</b> season, however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. The Virginia Tech defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive secondary. Safety Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during the <b>regular</b> season, returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the <b>regular</b> season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the <b>regular</b> season.|$|E

50|$|General Howe led {{the light}} {{infantry}} companies and grenadiers in {{the assault on}} the American left flank, expecting an easy effort against Stark's recently arrived troops. His light infantry were set along the narrow beach, in column, in order to turn the far left flank of the colonial position. The grenadiers were deployed in the middle. They lined up four deep and several hundred across. As the <b>regulars</b> closed, John Simpson, a New Hampshire man, prematurely fired, drawing an ineffective volley of return fire from the <b>regulars.</b> When the <b>regulars</b> finally closed within range, both sides opened fire. The colonists inflicted heavy casualties on the <b>regulars,</b> using the fence to steady and aim their muskets, and benefit from a modicum of cover. With this devastating barrage of musket fire, the <b>regulars</b> retreated in disarray, and the militia held their ground.|$|R
5|$|During the 2nd century some {{units with}} the new names numerus ("group") and vexillatio ("detachment") appear in the diploma record. Their size is uncertain, but was likely smaller than the <b>regular</b> alae and cohortes, as {{originally}} they were probably detachments from the latter, acquiring independent status after long-term separation. As these units are mentioned in diplomas, they were presumably part of the <b>regular</b> auxiliary organisation. But numeri was also a generic term used for barbarian units outside the <b>regular</b> auxilia. (see section 2.4 Irregular units, below).|$|E

50|$|In March 2010, the <b>Regulars</b> {{oversaw the}} {{successful}} second free parliamentary elections in Iraq. In April 2010, Command Sergeant Major (CSM) William Gentry conducted {{a change of}} responsibility with CSM Joseph Dallas. CSM Dallas returned to the <b>Regulars</b> after working at the brigade as the Operations Sergeant Major. In May, the <b>Regulars</b> took over additional battlespace when they conducted a RIP/TOA with 2-3 IN Patriots and assumed control of the Muqdadiyah Qada. On 11 June 2010 two more <b>Regulars</b> were killed conducting combat operations in Jalula, Iraq: SGT Israel O’Bryan and SPC William Yauch. In July 2010, the <b>Regulars</b> began their redeployment to home station with the final Regulars’ soldiers landing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord on 6 August 2010. The official RIP/TOA with 2-21 IN Gimlets from Schofield Barracks, HI took place on 25 July 2010. In the end, the <b>Regulars</b> had conducted four reliefs in place and assumed five separate battalions' battlespaces while helping train ISF to maintain security and working closely with ISF to increase government and civil capacity. In addition, their efforts were instrumental in conducting the second free parliamentary election in Iraq's history.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to leading {{the team in}} points both in the <b>regular</b> season and playoffs, Clarke also holds the records for the most appearances and most assists for the Flyers in both <b>regular</b> season and playoffs. Fellow Stanley Cup winner Barber has scored the most goals for the team with his 420 <b>regular</b> season and 53 playoff goals. Rick Tocchet spent the most time in the penalty box during the <b>regular</b> season for the Flyers, accruing 1,817 minutes in total, while Dave Schultz's 363 penalty minutes are the most by a Flyer in the playoffs. Among goaltenders, Roman Cechmanek boasts the best goals against average and save percentage in the <b>regular</b> season (excluding Marc D'Amour and Robbie Moore, neither of whom made more than five appearances).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>regular</b> and reserve armies, all former <b>Regular</b> Army personnel (known as the <b>Regular</b> Reserve) may be recalled for duty as needed. The <b>Regular</b> Reserve has two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in <b>Regular</b> Army service. Category D is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. <b>Regular</b> Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 <b>Regular</b> Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full <b>Regular</b> Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).|$|E

5|$|In {{order of}} {{distance}} from Neptune, the <b>regular</b> moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, S/2004 N 1, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune's rotational period is 0.6713 day) {{and thus are}} being tidally decelerated. Naiad, the closest <b>regular</b> moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of S/2004 N 1), whereas Proteus is the largest <b>regular</b> moon and the second largest moon of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a <b>regular</b> tessellation has both identical <b>regular</b> tiles and identical <b>regular</b> corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such <b>regular</b> tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and <b>regular</b> hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
50|$|West Ham were {{surprisingly}} relegated, {{following a}} disastrous season.
