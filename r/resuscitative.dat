2500|$|A <b>resuscitative</b> hysterotomy, [...] {{also known}} as a peri-mortem {{caesarean}} delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal cardiac arrest has occurred, to assist in resuscitation of the mother by removing the aortocaval compression generated by the gravid uterus. Unlike other forms of caesarean section, the welfare of the fetus is a secondary priority only, and the procedure may be performed even prior to the limit of fetal viability if it is judged to be of benefit to the mother.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960 {{the three}} {{investigators}} reported their findings on 20 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest in JAMA. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) survived and were {{discharged from the}} hospital. Many of the patients were in cardiac arrest {{as a result of}} anaesthesia. Three patients were documented to be in ventricular fibrillation. The duration of chest compression varied from less than 1minute to 65minutes. The JAMA article was very straightforward: chest compression buys time until the external defibrillator arrives on the scene. As the authors write in the article, [...] "Anyone, anywhere, can now initiate cardiac <b>resuscitative</b> procedures. All that is needed is two hands". However, respiration received relatively little attention in the 1960 JAMA article. Many of the patients had been intubated and thus the need for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was not necessary. It was not long however, before this newly discovered technique was used in conjunction with the longer held techniques of artificial respiration.|$|E
5000|$|Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation (EPR) is an {{experimental}} medical procedure developed to rapidly preserve the organism during ischemia, using hypothermia, drugs, and fluids, to [...] "buy time" [...] for transport and <b>resuscitative</b> surgery. Trials are {{being done to}} test the feasibility of rapidly inducing profound hypothermia (< 10oC) with an aortic flush in trauma victims that have suffered CA and failed standard <b>resuscitative</b> efforts to enable <b>resuscitative</b> surgery and delayed resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome variable will be survival to hospital discharge with minimal neurologic dysfunction.|$|E

50|$|For <b>resuscitative</b> {{thoracotomy}} to be indicated, {{signs of}} life must also be present, including cardiac electrical activity and a systolic blood pressure >70 mm Hg. In blunt trauma, if {{signs of life}}, such as eye dilatation, are found {{en route to the}} hospital by first responders, but not found when the patient arrives, then further <b>resuscitative</b> interventions are contraindicated; however; when first responders find signs of life and cardiopulmonary resuscitation time is under 15 minutes, the procedure is indicated.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{those who}} undergo <b>resuscitative</b> {{thoracotomy}} do not recover—only 10% of those receiving it after sustaining a blunt injury and 15-30% {{of those with}} penetrating trauma survive.|$|E

50|$|During {{pregnancy}} when a {{woman is}} lying on her back, the uterus may compress the inferior vena cava and thus decrease venous return. It is therefore recommended that the uterus be pushed to the woman's left; {{if this is not}} effective, either roll the woman 30° or healthcare professionals should consider emergency <b>resuscitative</b> hysterotomy.|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{debate around}} organ {{donation}} concerns with {{the definition of}} death. Because if the accepted definition if death is [...] "incorrect," [...] removing a heart from a donor who was established dead under the [...] "wrong" [...] criteria is tantamount to murder. With life-support and cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitative</b> technology, establishing the moment of death becomes more complicated and opinionated.|$|E
50|$|Foxx died in 1967 at age 59 in Miami, Florida. He {{became ill}} while eating dinner {{with his brother}} and {{was taken to a}} hospital, where <b>resuscitative</b> efforts failed. An autopsy showed that Foxx had choked on a piece of food. The year before, Foxx's second wife, Dorothy, had also died of choking. Foxx is buried at Flagler Memorial Park in Miami.|$|E
50|$|The American Heart Association first added <b>resuscitative</b> {{hysterotomy}} to its recommended {{guidelines for}} cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care in 1992, based on limited case report evidence. Many case reports {{have since been}} published reporting that, in maternal cardiac arrest, evacuation of the uterus {{is often associated with}} abrupt return of spontaneous circulation or other improvement in the mother's condition.|$|E
50|$|Improved protocols, {{including}} {{adherence to}} standardized practice, {{may also help}} ameliorate the chance {{and the effect of}} complications. For example, limb protection padding and a snug tourniquet application prevents tissue damage, while sufficient but not excessive tourniquet pressure ensures that anesthetics remain within the limb without risking injury. Should complications occur, constant physiological monitoring and ready access to <b>resuscitative</b> drugs and equipment facilitates a speedy response.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} way that {{external}} compression tourniquets reduce or eliminate arterial blood flow, aortic cross clamping has the same effect. The <b>Resuscitative</b> Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) device achieves this as well. By design, these devices induce ischemia to the lower extremities (as a secondary effect, or less commonly as their primary use). Releasing the cross clamp or removing the REBOA initiates reperfusion, and IR injury to the lower extremities may follow.|$|E

50|$|Other than a scalpel, no {{specialised}} surgical {{equipment is}} needed for a <b>resuscitative</b> hysterotomy.

50|$|A <b>resuscitative</b> {{thoracotomy}} {{is indicated}} when severe injuries within the thoracic cavity (such as hemorrhage) prevent the physiologic functions needed to sustain life. The injury may also affect a specific organ {{such as the}} heart, which can develop an air embolism or a cardiac tamponade (which prevents the heart from beating properly). Other indications {{for the use of}} this procedure would be the appearance of blood from a thoracostomy tube placed that returns more than 1000-1500 mL of blood, or ≥200 mL of blood per hour.|$|E

50|$|A <b>resuscitative</b> hysterotomy, also {{referred}} to as a perimortem Caesarean section (PMCS) or perimortem Caesarean delivery (PMCD), is a hysterotomy performed to resuscitate a woman in middle to late pregnancy who has entered cardiac arrest. Combined with a laparotomy, the procedure results in a Caesarean section that removes the fetus, thereby abolishing the aortocaval compression caused by the pregnant uterus. This improves the mother's chances of return of spontaneous circulation, and may potentially also deliver a viable neonate. The procedure may be performed by obstetricians, emergency physicians or surgeons depending on the situation.|$|E
50|$|Do not {{resuscitate}} {{orders are}} similar to those used in the United States. In 1995, the Canadian Medical Association, Canadian Hospital Association, Canadian Nursing Association, and Catholic Health Association of Canada worked with Canadian Bar Association clarify and create a Joint Statement on <b>Resuscitative</b> Interventions guideline for use to determine when and how DNR orders are assigned. DNR orders must be discussed by doctors with the patient or patient agents or patient's significant others. Unilateral DNR by medical professionals can only be used if the patient is in a vegetative state.|$|E
50|$|The medical section {{provides}} Level II {{medical support}} as USASOC asset {{managed by the}} brigade surgeon and constitutes {{the nucleus of the}} capability of receiving a conventional Army Forward Surgical Team.

The support includes unit-level medical support and health services, logistics, emergency medical and <b>resuscitative</b> treatment for all classes of patients; emergency dental treatment, physical therapy and preventive medicine support, while maintaining Standard Army Management Information Systems and providing veterinary support.|$|E
5000|$|The crystalloid fluid used in initial <b>resuscitative</b> efforts {{does not}} contain any {{clotting}} factors or erythrocytes (red blood cells). Its use {{may result in a}} dilution of clotting factors and erythrocytes, and therefore poorer control of bleeding and impaired oxygen transport to tissues causing further ischemic damage. Additionally, crystalloids have an acidic pH, and the administration of large quantities of isotonic or slightly hypertonic crystalloid solutions such as 0.9% normal saline or Lactated Ringer's can cause or aggravate metabolic acidosis, another component of the [...] "Triad of Death" [...] leading to a decrease in myocardial (heart muscle) function.|$|E
5000|$|A Mobile Trauma Bay is a {{containerized}} ambulance bay {{mounted on}} a Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR).It holds state-of-the-art medical equipment and carries a Shock Trauma Platoon, generally consisting of one doctor, a nurse and three corpsmen, providing advanced <b>resuscitative</b> care to critically injured service members within the first hour after a traumatic injury (the [...] "golden hour"). It takes emergency medical care far forward, saving more lives. [...] Over 98% of the wounded Marines who {{make it into the}} MTB, make it out alive.The MTB was designed and developed by James L.

5000|$|A <b>resuscitative</b> {{thoracotomy}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as an emergency department thoracotomy, trauma thoracotomy or, colloquially, as [...] "cracking the chest") is a thoracotomy performed to resuscitate a major trauma patient who has sustained severe thoracic or abdominal trauma and who has entered cardiac arrest because of this. The procedure allows immediate {{direct access to the}} thoracic cavity, permitting rescuers to control hemorrhage, relieve cardiac tamponade, repair or control major injuries to the heart, lungs or thoracic vasculature, and perform direct cardiac massage or defibrillation. For most persons with thoracic trauma the procedure is not necessary; only 15% of those with thoracic injury require the procedure.|$|E
50|$|EU {{sometimes}} occurs {{only when}} someone exercises within 30 minutes of eating particular foods, such as wheat or shellfish. For these individuals, exercising alone or eating the injuring food without exercising produces no symptoms. EU can be diagnosed {{by having the}} patient exercise and then observing the symptoms. This method must be used with caution and only with the appropriate <b>resuscitative</b> measures at hand. EU can be differentiated from cholinergic urticaria by the hot water immersion test. In this test, the patient is immersed in water at 43 °C (109.4 °F). Someone with EU will not develop hives, while a person with cholinergic urticaria will develop the characteristic small hives, especially on the neck and chest.|$|E
50|$|As Cincinnati was {{the home}} of baseball's first {{professional}} team, the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, the Reds traditionally played {{the first game of}} the major league season at home. On April 1, 1996, the Reds were playing the Montreal Expos, and McSherry was assigned to work home plate. Seven pitches into the game, McSherry called a timeout, spoke briefly to Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee, and walked slowly towards the Reds' dugout. Moments after signaling for the second base umpire to come in and replace him, McSherry stumbled and collapsed. <b>Resuscitative</b> efforts were begun on McSherry and he was taken to University Hospital in Cincinnati, but he was pronounced dead within the hour. He was 51 years old.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{decision}} to operate has been made, the procedure should be performed immediately at the site where cardiac arrest has taken place and standard basic and advanced life support resuscitation methods should continue throughout. These should include manual displacement of the uterus towards the patient's left side, to reduce aortocaval compression. If the arrest occurs in a healthcare facility that has staff on site {{who are capable of}} performing a <b>resuscitative</b> hysterotomy (such as at a hospital), the patient should not be moved to an operating theatre as this will delay the procedure. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests may need to be transported to a healthcare facility first if qualified staff are not immediately available.|$|E

The SORT is a robust medical team {{that is capable of}} providing expeditionary, combat health support along with prolonged field care through CASEVAC of opportunity and also offering advanced trauma and <b>resuscitative</b> care with holding and CASEVAC management. The SORT is conceived as being adaptive and modular to provide forward support for SOF in austere locations. The SOMEDD also contains medical logistic, medical maintenance and dental assets.|$|E
