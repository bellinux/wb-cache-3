40|$|The {{coast of}} Bohai Bay, {{north-western}} Yellow Sea, {{is critical for}} waterbirds migrating along the East Asia-Australasian Flyway. Between 1994 and 2010, a total of 450 km 2 of offshore area, including 218 km 2 of intertidal flats (one third of the original tidal area in the bay), has been reclaimed along the bay for two industrial projects. This has caused the northward migrants to become concentrated in an ever smaller remaining area, our core study site. The spring peak numbers of two Red Knot subspecies in the East Asia-Australasian Flyway, Calidris canutus piersmai and C. c. rogersi, in this so far little affected area increased from 13 % in 2007 to 62 % in 2010 of the global populations; the spring peak numbers of Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea increased from 3 % in 2007 to 23 % in 2010 of the flyway population. The decline in the extent of intertidal mudflats also affected <b>Relict</b> <b>Gulls</b> Larus relictus, listed by IUCN as ‘Vulnerable’; during normal winters 56 % of the global population moved from the wintering habitats that were removed in Tianjin to the relatively intact areas around Tangshan. Densities of wintering Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, and spring-staging Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus and Sanderling Calidris alba have also increased in the remaining areas. With the proposed continuation of land reclamation in Bohai Bay, we predict waterbird densities in the remaining areas to increase {{to a point of}} collapse. To evaluate the future of these fragile, shared international resources, it is vital to promote an immediate conservation action plan for the remaining coastal wetlands in this region, and continued population monitoring {{to determine the effects of}} this action. ...|$|R

40|$|Lakes in arid and {{semi-arid}} regions have an irreplaceable {{and important}} role in the local environment and wildlife habitat protection. <b>Relict</b> <b>Gull</b> (Larus relictus), which is listed as a “vulnerable” bird species in the IUCN Red List, uses only islands in lakes for habitat. The habitat with the largest colonies in Hongjian Lake (HL), which is located in Shaanxi Province in China, has been severely threatened by persistent lake shrinkage, yet the variations {{in the area of the}} lake and the islands are poorly understood due to a lack of in situ observations. In this study, using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, 336 Landsat remote sensing images from 1988 – 2015 were used to extract the monthly HL water area and lake island area, and the driving factors were investigated by correlation analysis. The results show that the lake area during 1988 – 2015 exhibited large fluctuations and an overall downward trend of − 0. 94 km 2 /year, and that the lake area ranged from 55. 02 km 2 in 1997 to 30. 90 km 2 in 2015. The cumulative anomaly analysis diagnosed the lake variations as two sub-periods with different characteristics and leading driving factors. The average and change trend were 52. 88 and 0. 21 km 2 /year during 1988 – 1998 and 38. 85 and − 1. 04 km 2 /year during 1999 – 2015, respectively. During 1988 – 1998, the relatively high precipitation, low evapotranspiration, and low levels of human activity resulted in a weak increase in the area of HL. However, in 1999 – 2015, the more severe human activity as well as climate warming resulted in a fast decrease in the area of HL. The variations in lake island area were dependent on the area of HL, which ranged from 0. 02 km 2 to 0. 22 km 2. As the lake size declined, the islands successively outcropped in the form of the four island zones, and the two zones located in Northwest and South of HL were the most important habitats for <b>Relict</b> <b>Gull.</b> The formation of these island zones can provide enough space for <b>Relict</b> <b>Gull</b> breeding...|$|E

The discussion focuses on the Ordos <b>Relict</b> <b>Gull</b> Reserve in the Inner Mongolia region of China. The study evaluated reserve records of water and soil conditions and interpreted satellite images to identify lake-level and land-cover changes at the reserve. The Ordos Relict Gulls seem to have abandoned the reserve following ecotourism development and established new colonies in northern Shaanxi. We argue that ecotourism—especially ersatz ecotourism—in certain nature reserves is an unsustainable practice rooted in the conventional wisdom that economic development spurs environmental protection as suggested by the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The article concludes that environmental protection rather than economic growth is of vital importance in nature-society interactions in environmentally fragile poor areas. We call for prohibitions on tourism in such nature reserves to enhance sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Hydrological {{predictions}} in ungauged lakes {{are one of}} {{the most}} important issues in hydrological sciences. The habitat of the <b>Relict</b> <b>Gull</b> (Larus relictus) in the Erdos Larus relictus National Nature Reserve (ELRNNR) has been seriously endangered by lake shrinkage, yet the hydrological processes in the catchment are poorly understood due to the lack of in-situ observations. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the variation in lake streamflow and its drivers. In this study, we employed the remote sensing technique and empirical equation to quantify the time series of lake water budgets, and integrated a water balance model and climate elasticity method to further examine ELRNNR basin streamflow variations from 1974 to 2013. The results show that lake variations went through three phases with significant differences: The rapidly expanding sub-period (1974 – 1979), the relatively stable sub-period (1980 – 1999), and the dramatically shrinking sub-period (2000 – 2013). Both climate variation (expressed by precipitation and evapotranspiration) and human activities were quantified as drivers of streamflow variation, and the driving forces in the three phases had different contributions. As human activities gradually intensified, the contributions of human disturbances on streamflow variation obviously increased, accounting for 22. 3 % during 1980 – 1999 and up to 59. 2 % during 2000 – 2013. Intensified human interferences and climate warming have jointly led to the lake shrinkage since 1999. This study provides a useful reference to quantify lake streamflow and its drivers in ungauged basins...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Relict</b> <b>Gull</b> Larus relictus is a {{globally}} {{vulnerable species}} {{and one of}} the least known birds, so understanding its seasonal movements and migration will facilitate the development of effective conservation plans for its protection. We repeatedly satellite-tracked 11 adult Relict Gulls from the Ordos sub-population in Hongjian Nur, China, over 33 migration seasons and conducted extensive ground surveys. Relict Gulls traveled ∼ 800  km between Hongjian Nur in northern China to the coast of eastern China in a predominantly longitudinal migration, following a clockwise loop migration pattern. The gulls migrated faster in spring (4 ±  2 d) than in autumn (15 ±  13 d) due to a time-minimization strategy for breeding, and they showed considerable between-individual variation in the timing of the autumn migration, probably due to differences in the timing of breeding. Gulls that made at least two round trips exhibited high flexibility in spring migration timing, suggesting a stronger influence of local environment conditions over endogenous controls. There was also high route flexibility among different years, probably due to variations in meteorological or habitat conditions at stopover sites. Relict Gulls stayed for a remarkably long time (234 ±  17 d) on their major wintering grounds in Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay, between which there were notable dispersals. Pre-breeding dispersals away from the breeding area were distinct, which seemed to be a strategy to cope with the degradation of breeding habitat at Hongjian Nur. Overwhelming lake shrinkage on the breeding ground and at stopover sites and loss of intertidal flats on the wintering grounds are regarded as the main threats to Relict Gulls. It is crucial to make protection administrations aware of the great significance of key sites along migration routes and to promote the establishment of protected areas in these regions...|$|E
