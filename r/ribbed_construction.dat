40|$|Idelfonso Sánchez del Río {{is a less}} known {{pioneer of}} {{reinforced}} concrete shells in Spain who through his career designed and patented <b>ribbed</b> <b>construction</b> systems for large spanning slabs and vaults and in particular shell enclosures using a hybrid system of concrete and masonry infills. The module called “dovela-onda” or wave-voussoir was made of large ceramic blocks forming a short barrel with flanges at the edges. This paper aims to discuss the technical innovations of this system and assess its structural efficiency. The design and construction process will be studied through literature published by Sánchez del Rio and surveys of two case studies in Oviedo (Spain), the Sports Hall (1977) and a warehouse in Granda. In order to assess their structural efficiency, his own calculation process will be verified by thrust line analysis and Finite Element spatial elastic modelling. The FE model allows the failure mode {{and the distribution of}} the loads to be assessed, and gives further insight to the behaviour of the scheme and the design and construction process...|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built to replace an 1888 {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge; workers used the old bridge to begin construction of the present bridge's box steel <b>ribs.</b> <b>Construction</b> was made difficult by the great depth of the river at the bridge site and by the water traffic during construction. Construction workers used the cables of the old bridge to support the arch prior to completion by running cables from the arch, over the cables to an anchor on the far side.

5000|$|The unusual {{appearance}} of the Parnall Imp was entirely due to its wings, for it was otherwise a conventional two-seat, single-engined biplane of its time. Harold Bolas stated that he designed them to be simple and to allow the best possible view from {{either of the two}} cockpits. The simplicity came from the complete absence of the rigging wires that braced conventional biplanes and needed constant attention. Instead, the Imp had a cantilever lower wing which had not only to support itself but also most of the forces on the upper wing. These lower wings were unswept and rectangular, with an aspect ratio of about 4.9, though the ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edge and about 40% of the chord. Since as cantilevers they had to be internally braced, the airfoil section was fairly thick, a variation on RAF31. Rather than the usual (in Britain) double-spar and <b>rib</b> <b>construction,</b> Bolas used multiple spanwise stringers or false spars, with longitudinal formers or airfoil shaped ribs, the whole covered in stress-bearing spruce veneer. [...] This stressed skin chiefly carried the bending loads. The Imp was a single-bay biplane, with a single, strongly outward-leaning wide chord streamlined strut on each side, connecting the centre of the lower wing to the upper one. [...] Though the upper wing was not a cantilever, it was constructed {{in the same way as}} the lower and joined to the fuselage from below at mid wing with a pair of N-shaped cabane struts. This upper wing was also straight and parallel-edged, with the same chord as the lower one, but greater in span and strongly swept at about 14.5o. [...] As a result, the leading edge at the centre was above the engine bulkhead, and the trailing edge at the tips beyond and aft of those of the lower plane. With the assistance of a large cutout in the trailing edge, this arrangement provided a clear upward view from both cockpits.The wings did not fold, but two people could dismantle both sets in about two minutes, first unclipping the bottom of the interplane strut, folding it and unhooking the centre section from the cabane for each upper wing in turn. The absence of ailerons on the upper plane simplified this procedure. The lower wings could then be detached with the release of catches and the removal of pins.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a structural modification {{to the conventional}} arch bridge {{and the development of}} a simple, effective erection method for potentially difficult job sites where the working space is limited due to traffic requirement. The modification proposes the use of the straight chord members to approximate a curved arch <b>rib.</b> In <b>construction,</b> each leg-chord member can first be erected vertically with precast units or by cast-in-place at springing in form of columns, with the leg base sitting on a temporarily restrained hinge device at springing. A prefabricated closure-chord using lightweight steel box girder or truss can then be attached to the top of erected leg-chord at an inclined angle with the help of guying towers and lifting cranes to ensure stability during the erection. After the connection of closure-chord to the leg-chord, the twin-leafs on both sides can be rotated from plumb position down to meet at the closure. Completed frame then forms an arch structure that serves as a self-supported system for the concrete placement of the final closure-chord section and the construction of spandrel columns and deck. A detailed comparison of structural characteristics, advantages and disadvantages will be discussed. Additionally, a study including laboratory testing, construction simulation and 3 D finite element analysis for a prototype bridge will be included in the presentation...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of structural concepts for noncircular fuselage configurations is presented. For an unconventional flying-wing type aircraft, {{in which the}} fuselage is inside the wing, multiple fuselage bays with non-circular sections need to be considered. In a conventional circular fuselage section, internal pressure is carried efficiently by a thin skin via hoop tension. If the section is non-circular, internal pressure loads also induce large bending stresses. The structure must also withstand additional bending and compression loads from aerodynamic and gravitational forces. Flat and vaulted shell structural configurations for such an unconventional, non-circular pressurized fuselage of a large flying-wing were studied.

5000|$|The top, {{back and}} ribs of an {{acoustic}} guitar body are very thin (1-2 mm), so a flexible {{piece of wood}} called lining is glued into the corners where the rib meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints. Solid linings are often used in classical guitars, while kerfed lining is most often found in steel string acoustics. Kerfed lining is also called kerfing because it is scored, or [...] "kerfed"(incompletely sawn through), {{to allow it to}} bend with the shape of the <b>rib).</b> During final <b>construction,</b> a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called purfling.

40|$|Many causes are {{responsible}} for secondary anomalies of the outer ear, such as: car accidents, sport- or work-related accidents, assaults, bites from animals or humans, benign or malignant tumours, burns {{and the effects of}} surgical interventions of the ear (plastic surgery on the ear or attempts at correction of primary malformations of the ear). The anatomical complexity of the ear makes its reconstruction particularly complicated with post-operative results that are often disappointing. The Authors describe their experience in the reconstruction of a partially amputated outer ear following a dog bite. The therapeutic protocol required various surgical stages. Initially, a cutaneous expander was applied {{at the level of the}} mastoid in order to ensure a sufficient quantity of local skin. The second stage was to remove cartilage from the <b>ribs,</b> followed by <b>construction</b> of a cartilaginous model of the ear and its insertion into the subcutaneous mastoid region after removal of the cutaneous expander and any residual ear cartilage. The last stage was to separate the neo-formed outer ear from the mastoid skin with the insertion of a cartilage graft to the posterior region of the reconstructed ear. This graft was covered by the occipital fascia rotated at 180 degrees and by a skin graft removed from the pubis. The postoperative result was satisfactory with recuperation of a good aesthetic appearance of the ear. Aim of the present report is to describe the surgical technique employed in the reconstruction of secondary anomalies of the ear and to highlight errors committed during this procedure. These considerations have allowed us to stress some fundamental elements in the reconstruction of the ear. In particular, the watershed was the awareness that we had to create a cartilaginous model that respected, as far as possible, the anatomy of the outer ear with all its ridges, trenches and cavities. This as well as ensuring a sufficient quantity of local skin in order to cover the cartilaginous graft and, therefore, reduce the risk of exposing the cartilage and subsequent infection, to guarantee an optimal end result...|$|R
40|$|Hadron {{properties}} in dense medium are {{treated in a}} unified way in a skyrmion model constructed with an effective Lagrangian, in which the rho and omega vector mesons are introduced as hidden gauge bosons, valid up to O(p^ 4) terms in chiral expansion including the homogeneous Wess-Zumino terms. All the low energy constants - apart from f_pi and m_rho - are fixed by the master formula derived from the relation between 5 -D hQCD and 4 -D HLS. This allows one to pin down the density n_ 1 / 2 at which the skyrmions in medium fractionize into half-skyrmions, bringing in a drastic change in the EoS of dense matter. We find that the U(1) field that figures in the CS term in the hQCD action or equivalently the omega field in the hWZ term in the dimensionally reduced HLS action {{plays a crucial role}} in the half-skyrmion phase. The importance of the omega degree of freedom may be connected to what happens in the instanton structure of elementary baryon noticed in hQCD. The most striking and intriguing in what is found in the model is that f_pi that smoothly drops with increasing density in the skyrmion phase stops decreasing at n_ 1 / 2 and remains nearly constant in the half-skyrmion phase. In accordance with the large N_c consideration, the baryon mass also stays non-scaling in the half-skyrmion phase. This feature which is reminiscent of the parity-doublet baryon model with a chirally invariant mass m_ 0 is supported by the nuclear EFT with the parameters of the Lagrangian scaling modified at the skyrmion-half-skyrmion phase transition. It also matches with one-loop RG analysis based on HLS. A link between a non-vanishing m_ 0 and the origin of nucleon mass distinctive from dynamically generated mass is suggested. We briefly discuss the possible consequences of the topology change found in this paper on the forthcoming experiments at the <b>RIB</b> machines under <b>construction.</b> Comment: REVTeX, 13 pages, 6 figures, to be published in Phys.

40|$|In 1883 Auguste Choisy {{published}} his book L=art de bâtir chez les Byzantins. In it he explained, {{for the first}} time, {{all the details of}} the geometry and construction of byzantine vaults. The main source was the direct study of the monuments, interpreting his observations in the light of traditional vaulting techniques. He is explicit about this: *ma seule ressource était d'interroger les monuments eux mêmes, ou mieux encore de rapprocher les uns des autres les faits anciens et les traditions contemporaines+ (Choisy 1883, 3). Choisy concentrated his attention on the vaults, as he was convinced that the vault governs the whole architectural system: *Toutes les circonstances de la construction découlent ainsi de la nature de la voûte byzantine; et j'ai cru qu'il convenait de ranger les faits autour de cet élément fondamental du système+ (4). The other fundamental principle is the economy of construction, as the vaults *... s'y subordonnent dans l'économie générale des édifices+. The observations were made during a six month mission of the Adminiatration des des Ponts et Chaussées the year 1875 (Mandoul 2008, 29). The next year he published a *Note sur la construction des voûtes sans cintrage pendant la période byzantine+ (Choisy 1876), were he resumed the main results concerning the technique of vaulting without centring. The book had an enormous impact on contemporary historians of byzantine architecture. It was cited and praised by the new light it threw to the constructive aspects, for its clarity and rigour of exposition, and for their superb plates. Eventually, his theories were incorporated in the manuals and histories of Byzantine architecture. The book of Choisy concentrated on *l=art de bâtir+. The interest on the technical aspects of architecture almost disappeared after the First World War, maybe due to the coming of the modern architecture and the new materials (iron, steel and reinforced concrete). As a concequence Choisy=s works on *l=art de bâtir+ were almost systematically ignored. The first specifical study of Byzantine construction after the Second World Ward was written by Ward-Perkins (1958) and it has been considered, since then, the standard reference for Byzantine construction. Ward-Perkins ignore the work of Choisy making a passing criticism of his geometrical theories of Byzantine vaults. However, the detailed description of wall construction made by Ward-perkins coincides pretty well with that of Choisy (7 - 13). He apparently was unaware that the whole theory of Byzantine vaulting without theory centring is Choisy=s. Besides, he attributes to Giovanonni the detailed description of the use brick <b>ribs</b> in vaults <b>construction.</b> In all, it appears that Ward-Perkins did not read carefully Choisy=s book on Byzantine construction nor was familiar with the history of vault construction. The consquence was that subsequent authors didn=t take seriously Choisy=s work or simply ignored. Sanpaolesi (1971) in a work with the suggestive title *Strutture a cupola autoportanti+ simply ignore him. To Mango (1975), author of one of the standard manuals on Byzantine architecture, Choisy is superseded; Krautheimer (1984) did not consider Choisy in treating, summarily, the vaulting problems. Robert Ousterhout author of a book on the Master Builders of Byzantium (1998) considers Choisy *outdated+, being *more than a century old+. Even in detailed archeological studies of vaulted structures his work is ignored (Deichmann 1979). There are some exceptions in specialised studies on vault construction: Besenval (1984), Cejka (1978) and Storz (1994). It must be said from the beginning, that Choisy=s L=art de bâtir chez les Byzantins is still the best source for anyone interested in understanding the geometry, construction and structural behaviour of Byzantine vaulted buildings. In what follows, we will try to demonstrate that this assertion is true...|$|R
