5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific <b>rain</b> <b>event</b> in four decades. An elderly man was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{performances}} of seven single-column models (SCMs) by comparing simulated surface precipitation with observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site from January 1999 to December 2001. Results show that although most SCMs can reproduce the observed precipitation reasonably well, there are significant and interesting differences in their details. In the cold season, the model-observation differences in the frequency and mean intensity of <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> tend to compensate each other for most SCMs. In the warm season, most SCMs produce more <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> in daytime than in nighttime, whereas the observations have more <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> in nighttime. The mean intensities of <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> in these SCMs are much stronger in daytime, but weaker in nighttime, than the observations. The higher frequency of <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> during warm-season daytime in most SCMs {{is related to the}} fact that most SCMs produce a spurious precipitation peak around the regime of weak vertical motions but rich in moisture content. The models also show distinct biases between nighttime and daytime in simulating significant <b>rain</b> <b>events.</b> In nighttime, all the SCMs have a lower frequency of moderate-to-strong <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> than the observations for both seasons. In daytime, most SCMs have a higher frequency of moderate-to-strong <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> than the observations, especially in the warm season. Further analysis reveals distinct meteorological backgrounds for large underestimation and overestimation events. The former occur in the strong ascending regimes with negative low-level horizontal heat and moisture advection, whereas the latter occur in the weak or moderate ascending regimes with positive low-level horizontal heat and moisture advection...|$|R

30|$|The {{availability}} {{performances of}} both FSO links and RF links significantly depend on meteorological conditions. Low atmospheric visibility causes the deep attenuation of optical {{light on the}} FSO links while heavy <b>rain</b> <b>events,</b> snow <b>events,</b> and <b>rain</b> with snow <b>events</b> cause deep attenuation on the RF links. Therefore, fog events {{have a significant impact}} on the availability performance of FSO links while <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the availability performance of RF links. The concurrent occurrence of dense fog <b>events</b> and heavy <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> are seldom. Therefore, hybrid FSO/RF systems which consist of an FSO link backed up by an RF link can achieve higher link availability performance than a separate FSO or RF link due to the fact that the RF part of hybrid FSO/RF system may mitigate the influence of dense fog events and the FSO part can mitigate heavy <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> [18, 19].|$|R

2500|$|The UH {{technique}} {{provides a}} practical and relatively easy-to-apply tool for quantifying {{the effect of}} a unit of rainfall on the corresponding runoff from a particular drainage basin.

[...] Nevertheless, application of UH methods typically yields a reasonable approximation of the flood response of natural watersheds. [...] The linear assumptions underlying UH theory allows for the variation in storm intensity over time (i.e., the storm hyetograph) to be simulated by applying the principles of superposition and proportionality to separate storm components to determine the resulting cumulative hydrograph.

40|$|International audienceFreezing rain {{is a major}} {{atmospheric}} hazard in mid-latitude {{nations of}} the globe. Among all Canadian hydrometeorological hazards, freezing rain {{is associated with the}} highest damage costs per event. Using synoptic weather typing to identify the occurrence of freezing <b>rain</b> <b>events,</b> this study estimates changes in future freezing <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> under future climate scenarios for south-central Canada. Synoptic weather typing consists of principal components analysis, an average linkage clustering procedure (i. e., a hierarchical agglomerative cluster method), and discriminant function analysis (a nonhierarchical method). Meteorological data used in the analysis included hourly surface observations from 15 selected weather stations and six atmospheric levels of six-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) upper-air reanalysis weather variables for the winter months (November?April) of 1958 / 59 ? 2000 / 01. A statistical downscaling method was used to downscale four general circulation model (GCM) scenarios to the selected weather stations. Using downscaled scenarios, discriminant function analysis was used to project the occurrence of future weather types. The within-type frequency of future freezing <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> is assumed to be directly proportional to the change in frequency of future freezing rain-related weather types The results showed that with warming temperatures in a future climate, percentage increases in the occurrence of freezing <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> in the north of the study area are likely to be greater than those in the south. By the 2050 s, freezing <b>rain</b> <b>events</b> for the three colder months (December?February) could increase by about 85 % (95 % confidence interval ? CI: ± 13 %), 60 % (95 % CI: ± 9 %), and 40 % (95 % CI: ± 6 %) in northern Ontario, eastern Ontario (including Montreal, Quebec), and southern Ontario, respectively. The increase by the 2080 s could be even greater: about 135 % (95 % CI: ± 20 %), 95 % (95 % CI: ± 13 %), and 45 % (95 % CI: ± 9 %).
