40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{and behavior of}} grounding systems are important {{in order to minimize}} dangerous electrical shock. Up to this date, little publication has been made on the field test compared to laboratory and computational method. This could be due to the difficulty to carry out the field test as it requires {{a lot of time and}} high cost for man power and transportation to handle the heavy and bulky equipment. So far, most studies investigated the grounding systems under low-magnitude or low frequency test (steady-state). In this present study, the characteristic profile of grounding systems under impulse condition on two types of grounding systems configurations purposely built inside Multimedia University (MMU) area were investigated. The two types of grounding systems namely the <b>rod</b> <b>beds</b> grounding systems and the MMU combined grid with multiple rods grounding systems are located at different area. From these field experiments, the resistance of the grounding systems are obtained under steady state and impulse conditions. The results from this work provide the closest link to the real grounding systems under impulse conditions...|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal <b>rod</b> from her <b>bed</b> frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{checking}} of computations of various experiments at the critical facility for the high temperature pebble bed reactor (KAHTER). In particular computational methods are tested which are {{to be used for}} treating the cavity and for calculating the efficiency of absorber <b>rods</b> in pebble <b>bed</b> reactors with OTTO-Ioading. In addition, with regard to a top reflectorinstrumentation, the effects of disturbances in the upper core region on the shape of neutron flux in the top reflector are studied. In the diffusion calculations for determination of critical masses and neutron flux distributions of various core configurations, standard diffusion programs are used such as the 2 D-code DIFF- 2 D and the 2 - and 3 -dimensional program CITATION, as weIl as recently developed diffusion codes. To the latter belong the program HRMC/DIFF-H, which treats the cavity by means of transport theory, and the finite element code DIFGEN. For comparison, Monte Carlo calculations are performed with the MORSE-K code...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} on how a mosquito uses its legs and feet to function in this world. Studying Scanning Electron Microscopy photos (SEM) of mosquitoes and comparing these to previous research and the SEMs of other insects, several hypotheses were made of the function of mosquito legs and feet. These educated speculations were supported in part by experiments which were used to determine the presence of protein and chitin using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrscopy (FTIR) and Coomassie Blue protein staining. The conclusions from this research are that a mosquito uses its claws to climb rough surfaces made of particles that are larger than the mosquito claw tip. Given this, a mosquito is able to hold onto the surface using friction. For smooth surfaces, the mosquito uses the setae on its foot for adherence. The foot pad excretes a fluid made of a water and lipid soluble substance that uses viscous forces to cause a sticky effect. Finally, its super-hydrophobic scales, made of chitin <b>rods</b> in a <b>bed</b> of protein, on its legs help to hold it up on the surface of water. The mechanics behind this continue to be explored...|$|R
40|$|Strengthening of masonry {{structures}} with FRP <b>rods</b> embedded into <b>bed</b> joints is {{an innovative}} technique investigated {{up to now}} only in few research works, where the objective was shear or flexural improvement (Tinazzi & al., 2000). As most of the masonry structures are load bearing and their static problems are hence related to high compressive stresses, the present work focuses on confinement of masonry members. Depending on the actual condition of the structural member, the FRP confinement can be either a strengthening or a repairing technique. After seismic events or when dealing with historical masonry structures, the application of confining reinforcement is usually a balance of the two approaches, which aims to re-establish safe conditions under new actions. In order to simulate those different cases, in the present research {{the evaluation of the}} technique involved also pre-damaged masonry walls subjected, after reparation, to monotonic and cyclic axial compressive loads. An extensive selection of materials and reinforcement configurations was preventively performed, pointing out the mechanical parameters affecting the anchoring strength and effective length. Particularly, studies on bond were carried out considering the different stress conditions under which a masonry member can stand, for example, {{at the time of the}} application and under severe actions. Further research could be developed to validate the repairing effectiveness of masonry assemblages under long-term sustained load, which is the typical condition of bearing members of historical masonry structures as towers, bridges and pillars...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{full-sized}} Peach Bottom Reactor. {{fuel elements}} were fabricated in a cooperative effort by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Gulf General Atomic (GGA) {{as part of}} the National HTGR Fuel Recycle Development Program. These elements contain bonded fuel <b>rods</b> and loose <b>beds</b> of particles made from several combinations of fertile and fissile particles of interest for present and future use in the High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR). The portion of the fuel prepared for these elements by ORNL is described in detail in this report, and it is in conjunction with the GGA report (GA- 10109) a complete fabrication description of the test. In addition, this report describes the results obtained to date from postirradiation examination of the first two elements removed from the Peach Bottom Reactor, RTE- 7 and - 4. The fuel examined had relatively low exposure, up to about 1. 5 x 10 {sup 21 } neutrons/cm* fast (> 0. 18 MeV) fluence, compared with the peak anticipated HTGR fluence of 8. 0 x 10 {sup 21 }, but it has performed well at this exposure. Dimensional data indicate greater irradiation shrinkage than expected from accelerated test data to higher exposures. This suggests that either the method of extrapolation of the higher exposure data back to low exposure is faulty, or the behavior of the coated particles in the neutron spectrum characteristic of the accelerated tests does not adequately represent the behavior in an HTGR spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Gas-solid {{fluidized}} beds {{have found}} wide industrial applications compared to fixed beds due to low pressure drop and good solid fluid mixing. Some {{of the important}} applications of gas–solid fluidized beds are in dairy, cement, food, and pharmaceutical industries for varied operations which include drying, cooling, coating and agglomeration. This permits a continuous automatically controlled operation with ease of handling and rapid mixing of solids leading to near isothermal conditions throughout the bed, thereby minimizing overheating in case of heat sensitive products. Mixing of solids is a common processing step widely used in industry. It is extensively employed {{in the manufacture of}} ceramics plastics, fertilizers, detergents, glass pharmaceuticals, processed food and cattle feed and in the powder metallurgy industry. Mixing index concept is a very much important factor in fluidization. Mixing index is the ratio of fraction of jetsam in the top portion of bed to the fraction in a well- mixed bed. Mixing index’s value from 0 to 1 corresponds to complete segregation and complete mixing respectively. A mathematical model of a real chemical process is a mathematical description which describes experimental facts and establishes relationship among the process variables. Mathematical modeling is an activity in which qualitative and quantitative representation or abstractions of the real process are carried out using mathematical symbols. In building a mathematical model, a real process is reduced to its bare essentials, and the resultant scheme is described by a mathematical formalism selected according to the complexity of the process. The resulting model could be either analytical or numerical in nature depending upon the method used for obtaining the solution. It is important that the model should also represent with sufficient accuracy qualitative and quantitative properties of the prototype process and should adequately fit the real process. For a check on this requirement, the observation made on the process should be compared with predictions derived from the model under identical ivconditions. Thus, a mathematical model of a real process is a mathematical description combining experimental facts and establishing relationships between the process and variables. Mixtures of solid particles of different sizes and/or densities tend to separate during fluidization. Particles that sink to the gas distributor are referred to as jetsam, while those that float on the fluidized bed surface are referred to as flotsam. Mixing and Segregation behavior of mixture particles is of practical importance because particle distributions in the fluidized bed influences the chemical reaction, bed expansion, and various mass and heat transfer properties in the fluidized beds. Many studies {{have been made in the}} past in order to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict the behaviour of mixing and segregation, including the investigation of factors affecting the mixing/segregation, the development of predictive empirical and theoretical correlations, as well as mathematical and numerical models. A theoretical model has been developed on the basis of “counter flow solid circulation model”. Considering both vertical and horizontal movement of the jetsam particles as some particles displace horizontally due to the bursting of bubbles, the dispersion model in the form of the differential equation is written and this is solved by finite difference method. For calculating concentration of jetsam particles and mixing index at any height of the bed, a c-language program is written. The numerical results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. It is observed that both the concentration of the jetsam particles and mixing index decreases with the height of particles layers in the bed (measured from the distributor). It is also observed that the unpromoted bed gives better mixing index values than promoted bed due to its greater flow area. Optimum fraction of bed materials with respect to its distribution ion the upward and downward streams during the fluidization process can be taken up to 20 %. When static bed height, operating fluidization velocity and jetsam particles composition values increases, for all the cases corresponding mixing index values decreases. It is seen that mixing index values of disc promoted <b>bed</b> and <b>rod</b> promoted fluidized <b>bed</b> are nearly same although flow area of <b>rod</b> promoted fluidized <b>bed</b> is greater than disc promoted fluidized bed...|$|R
40|$|Photoreceptor {{metabolism}} of cGMP and its regulation {{were characterized}} in isolated toad retinas by determining {{the intensity and}} time dependence of light-induced changes in the following metabolic parameters: cGMP hydrolytic flux determined by the rate of 18 O incorporation from 18 O-water into retinal guanine nucleotide α-phosphoryls; changes in the total (protein-bound and unbound) concentrations of the guanine nucletodie metabolic intermediates; {{and changes in the}} concentration of metabolic (unbound) GDP calculated from the fraction of the α-GDP that undergoes labeling with 18 O. The latter is interpreted to reflect the state of the equilibrium between GDP-GTP-complexed forms of G-protein. With narrow band 500 nm light that preferentially stimulates <b>ared</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptors, a range of intensities covering approximately 5 log units produced increases of over 10 -fold in cGMP metabolic flux. However, the characteristics of the cGMP metabolic response over the first 2. 5 log units of intensity are readily distinguishable from those at higher intensities which exhibit progressive attenuation by an intensity- and time-dependent process. Over the range of low intensities (0. 6 - 3 log photons·μm- 2 ·s- 1) the metabolic response is characterized by 1) increases in cGMP hydrolytic flux of up to 8 -fold as a logarithmic function of intensity of photic stimulation that are sustained for at least 200 s; 2) small increases or no change in the concentration of total cGMP; 3) large increases of up to 10 -fold in the concentration of metabolically active GDP as a linear function of intensity with no significant change in the tissue concentrations of total GDP or GTP; and 4) amplification of the photosignal by the metabolism of approximately 10, 000 molecules of cGMP per photoisomerization with the major site of amplification {{at the level of the}} interaction of bleached rhodopsin with G-protein. The attenuated cGMP hydrolytic response observed in a high light intensity range (3 - 5. 39 log photons·μm- 2 ·s- 1) exhibits the following characteristics: 1) a progressive decline in the magnitude of the light-accelerated cGMP hydrolytic flux response with respect to the photon flux which at the highest intensities leads to relative declines in the cGMP flux after 20 s of illumination and more pronounced decreases after 200 s of illumination; 2) progressive decreases of as much as 25 % at 20 s and up to 50 % at 200 s in the total cGMP concentration that are proportional to the suppression observed in light-enhanced cGMP hydrolytic flux; and 3) decreases from the maximal levels achieved in the concentration of metabolic (unbound) GDP with no change in total GDP or GTP concentration. The widely held view of a light-activated cascade directed only toward phosphodiesterase cannot account for any of the above features of cGMP metabolism in the intact photoreceptor. To sustain a cGMP flux that is severalfold greater than that in the dark-adapted state, continuous illumination must activate the entire cGMP metabolic cycle, which consists of phosphodiesterase, guanylyl cyclase, and the enzymes phosphorylating GMP and GDP. This mechanism is also consistent with the observation that concentrations of cGMP, GDP, and GTP remain nearly constant during low intensity photic stimulation. To produce the time-dependent attenuation in light-activated flux with the accompanying reductions in total cGMP concentration, intense and extended illumination must result in a gradual down-regulation of light-activated guanylyl cyclase. This perspective contradicts the currently held view of the mechanisim, outcome, and purpose of light-induced alterations in cGMP metabolism. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
