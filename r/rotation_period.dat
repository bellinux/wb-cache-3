5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred {{over the course of}} billions of years. The <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt.

SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d).

40|$|We {{determine}} <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> of {{a sample}} of 48 late F-type to mid-M dwarf stars using time-series high-resolution spectroscopy of the Ca II H&K and H-alpha chromospheric activity indicators. We find good agreement between the <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> obtained from each of these two indicators. An empirical relationship between the level of chromospheric emission measured by log (R'HK) and the spectroscopic <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> is reported. This relation is largely independent of the spectral type and the metallicity of the stars {{and can be used}} to make a reliable prediction of <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> for late K to mid-M dwarfs with low levels of activity. For some stars in the sample, the measured spectroscopic <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> coincide, or are very close, to the orbital periods of postulated planets. In such cases, further studies are needed to clarify whether the associated periodic radial velocity signals reveal the existence of planets or are due to magnetic activity.

5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Based on the star's chromospheric activity, HD 28185 is {{estimated}} to have an age of around 2,900 million years. On the other hand, evolutionary models give an age of around 7,500 million years and a mass 0.99 times that of our Sun. The higher luminosity and longer <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> favour an older age for the star.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
40|$|We {{intended}} to compile {{the most complete}} catalog of bona fide members and candidate members of the beta Pictoris association, and to measure their <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> and basic properties from our own observations, public archives, and exploring the literature. We carried out a multi-observatories campaign to get our own photometric time series and collected all archived public photometric data time series for the stars in our catalog. Each time series was analyzed with the Lomb-Scargle and CLEAN periodograms {{to search for the}} stellar <b>rotation</b> <b>periods.</b> We complemented the measured rotational properties with detailed information on multiplicity, membership, and projected rotational velocity available in the literature and discussed star by star. We measured the <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> of 112 out of 117 among bona fide members and candidate members of the beta Pictoris association and, whenever possible, we also measured the luminosity, radius, and inclination of the stellar rotation axis. This represents to date the largest catalog of <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> of any young loose stellar association. We provided an extensive catalog of <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> together with other relevant basic properties useful to explore a number of open issues, such as the causes of spread of <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> among coeval stars, evolution of angular momentum, and lithium-rotation connection.

The <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> delineate a tight sequence in the NGC 6811 color-period diagram from ~ 1 day at mid-F to ~ 11 days at early-K spectral type. This result extends to ~ 1 Gyr similar prior results in the ~ 600 Myr Hyades and Praesepe clusters, suggesting that <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> for cool dwarf stars delineate a well-defined surface in the 3 -dimensional space of color (mass), rotation, and age.

5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move {{into and out of}} the line of sight as it rotates.

Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity.

40|$|In this study, we {{undertook}} a deep photometric examination of a narrowly-defined sample of solar analogs in the Kepler field, {{with the goals}} of producing a uniform and statistically meaningful sample of such stars, comparing the properties of planet hosts to those of the general stellar population, and examining the behavior of rotation and photometric activity among stars with similar overall physical parameters. We successfully derived photometric activity indicators and <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> for 95 planet hosts (Kepler objects of interest [KOIs]) and 954 solar analogs without detected planets; 573 of these <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> are reported here for the first time. <b>Rotation</b> <b>periods</b> average roughly 20  d, but the distribution has a wide dispersion, with a tail extending to P >  35  d which appears to be inconsistent with published gyrochronological relations.

However, we are able to state that the solar activity level derived from Virgo data is consistent with the majority of stars with similar <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> in our sample. Finally, our KOI sample is consistently approximately 0. 3  dex more variable than our non-KOIs; we ascribe the difference to a selection effect due to low orbital obliquity in the planet-hosting stars and derive a mean obliquity for our sample of χ = 6 + 5 °- 6, similar to that seen in the solar system...|$|R
40|$|We re-analyze all archival Chandra/ACIS {{observations}} of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to study the X-ray properties of a large sample of pre–main-sequence (PMS) stars with optically determined <b>rotation</b> <b>periods.</b> Our goal is to elucidate the origins of X-rays in PMS stars by seeking out connections between the X-rays and the mechanisms most likely driving their production—rotation and accretion. Stars in our sample have LX/Lbol near, but below, the “saturation ” value of 10 − 3. In addition, in this sample X-ray luminosity is significantly correlated with stellar rotation, {{in the sense of}} decreasing LX/Lbol with more rapid rotation. These findings suggest that stars with optical <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> are in the “super-saturated ” regime of the rotation-activity relationship, consistent with their Rossby numbers. However, we also find that stars with optical <b>rotation</b> <b>periods</b> are significantly biased to high LX.

5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's <b>rotation</b> <b>period,</b> which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity.

5|$|In 1644, the Italian Jesuit Daniello Bartoli {{reported}} seeing two darker patches on Mars. During the oppositions of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its closest {{approaches to the}} Earth, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his student Francesco Maria Grimaldi noted patches of differing reflectivity on Mars. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. On November 28, 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as Syrtis Major Planum, and possibly one of the polar ice caps. The same year, he succeeded in measuring the <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> of the planet, giving it as approximately 24 hours. He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars, guessing that it is about 60% {{of the size of}} the Earth, which compares well with the modern value of 53%. Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars's southern polar ice cap was by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, in 1666. That same year, he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a <b>rotation</b> <b>period</b> of 24h 40m.
