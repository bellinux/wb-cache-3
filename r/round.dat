25|$|<b>Rounding</b> {{a number}} twice in {{succession}} to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as <b>rounding</b> once to the final precision except {{in the case of}} directed <b>rounding.</b> For instance <b>rounding</b> 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when <b>rounding</b> to integer using <b>rounding</b> half to even, but would give 9 when <b>rounded</b> to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield discuss the implications of double <b>rounding</b> when comparing data <b>rounded</b> to one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.|$|R
