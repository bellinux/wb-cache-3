5|$|Many {{texts from}} the Roman Empire {{refer to the}} mysteries of Isis, but the only source to {{describe}} them {{is a work of}} fiction, the novel Metamorphoses, written in the second century CE by Apuleius. In it, the initiate undergoes elaborate ritual purification before descending into the innermost part of Isis's temple, where he has an intense <b>religious</b> <b>experience,</b> seeing the gods in person.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{feminism}} {{is a movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E

50|$|Norman Habel defines <b>religious</b> <b>experiences</b> as the {{structured}} way {{in which}} a believer enters into a relationship with, or gains an awareness of, the sacred {{within the context of a}} particular religious tradition (Habel, O'Donoghue and Maddox: 1993). <b>Religious</b> <b>experiences</b> are by their very nature preternatural; that is, out of the ordinary or beyond the natural order of things. They may be difficult to distinguish observationally from psychopathological states such as psychoses or other forms of altered awareness (Charlesworth: 1988). Not all preternatural experiences are considered to be <b>religious</b> <b>experiences.</b> Following Habel's definition, psychopathological states or drug-induced states of awareness are not considered to be <b>religious</b> <b>experiences</b> because they are mostly not performed within the context of a particular religious tradition.|$|R
5|$|Michael Persinger is a {{neurophysiologist}} who {{has worked}} at Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of <b>religious</b> <b>experience.</b> Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched and examined the physiological and neurological causes of religious belief systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent psychiatry at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which may have affected unidentified flying object sightings in Washington. Suess and Persinger performed similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm <b>religious</b> <b>experience,</b> indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E

25|$|Honko {{asserted}} that, in some cases, {{a society}} reenacts a myth {{in an attempt}} to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age.

Similarly, Barthes argued that modern culture explores <b>religious</b> <b>experience.</b> Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.|$|E

40|$|The Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) {{in recent}} years is {{beginning}} to become more popular. This project evolves around the development of the field as well as critiques of the field.

Many themes arise out of this research that paves the way for trying to understand <b>religious</b> <b>experiences.</b> Overall, the project focuses on interpreting the conversion narratives {{to gain a better understanding}} of religious conversions for the sake of anthropology, philosophy, and cognitive psychology...|$|R

25|$|It is {{well known}} that strict churches are strong and growing in the {{contemporary}} United States, whereas liberal ones are declining. For Iannaccone's <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> is a jointly produced collective good. Thus members of a church face a collective action problem. Strict churches, which often impose costly and esoteric requirements on their members, are able to solve this problem by weeding out potential free riders, since only the very committed would join the church {{in the face of such}} requirements. Consistent with the notion that <b>religious</b> <b>experience</b> is a collective good, Iannaccone et al. show that churches that extract more resources from their members (in the form of time and money) tend to grow in membership.|$|E
25|$|Religion {{has several}} definitions. Religions that are {{organized}} {{can be seen}} as cultural systems, with corresponding behavior and practice.
