40|$|The {{average time}} between two occurrences {{of the same}} event, {{referred}} to as its <b>return</b> <b>time</b> (or <b>return</b> period), is a useful statistical concept for practical applications. For instance insurances or public agency may be interested by the <b>return</b> <b>time</b> of a 10 m flood of the Seine river in Paris. However, due to their scarcity, reliably estimating <b>return</b> <b>times</b> for rare events is very difficult using either observational data or direct numerical simulations. For rare events, an estimator for <b>return</b> <b>times</b> can be built from the extrema of the observable on trajectory blocks. Here, we show that this estimator can be improved to remain accurate for <b>return</b> <b>times</b> {{of the order of}} the block size. More importantly, we show that this approach can be generalised to estimate <b>return</b> <b>times</b> from numerical algorithms specifically designed to sample rare events. So far those algorithms often compute probabilities, rather than <b>return</b> <b>times.</b> The approach we propose provides a computationally extremely efficient way to estimate numerically the <b>return</b> <b>times</b> of rare events for a dynamical system, gaining several orders of magnitude of computational costs. We illustrate the method on two kinds of observables, instantaneous and time-averaged, using two different rare event algorithms, for a simple stochastic process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As an example of realistic applications to complex systems, we finally discuss extreme values of the drag on an object in a turbulent flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was the study of reproductive performance in postpartum dairy cows with different parities. Twenty Holstein dairy cows were assigned into two equal primiparous and multiparous groups. Body weight and body condition score (based on 1 - 5 scoring) were measured every other week, starting from two weeks before calving till pregnancy confirmation. Daily milk yield was also recorded. Reproductive parameters including days from calving to the uterus <b>returning</b> <b>time,</b> to the initiation time of clinical oestrus signs, to the first time of insemination and number of insemination per pregnancy were recorded. Meanwhile, blood serum concentrations of estrogen and progesterone were measured. Results indicated that, the mean (±SE) of body weight and milk production was significantly higher for multiparous cows. Blood serum concentration of estrogen (mean ±SE) was significantly lower for primiparous cows (61. 86 ± 17. 91 vs. 71. 39 ± 17. 02 pg/ml). The number of insemination per pregnancy and estrus frequency did not differ between both groups.

40|$|Background: Increased {{large artery}} {{stiffness}} {{is a major}} determinant of systolic pressure and indicator of cardiovascular events. The reflected wave, its arrival <b>time</b> (<b>return</b> <b>time)</b> and magnitude, contributes to systolic pressure, and is a supposed indicator of aortic stiffness. With aortic stiffening, the <b>return</b> <b>time</b> is assumed to decrease inversely with PWV as 2 L/PWV, where L is the aortic length. However, several studies reported that the inflection point of aortic pressure, a surrogate of <b>return</b> <b>time,</b> varies little with aortic stiffness. Methods: We studied the effects of aortic stiffness on wave reflection in an anatomically accurate arterial model. <b>Return</b> <b>time</b> is time difference of forward, P-f, and backward, P-b, pressure. <b>Return</b> <b>time,</b> inflection and shoulder points, augmentation index, and reflection magnitude (P-b/P-f) were calculated by standard rules. Results: Peripheral resistance does not affect reflection directly, but only through pressure (stiffness) changes. Magnitude of reflected waves depend about equally on aortic geometry (taper, branches) and distal aortic reflection. Therefore, relations of augmentation index and reflection magnitude with stiffness are nonlinear and complex; augmentation index is most sensitive to stiffness. Between PWV 6 and 12 m/s, representing ages of 20 - 80 years, <b>return</b> <b>time</b> and inflection and shoulder points change differently with stiffness and PWV cannot be derived from them. Pulse pressure is strongly dependent on aortic stiffness. Taper changes <b>return</b> <b>time</b> by a factor 2, but has little effect on reflection magnitude, augmentation index, and inflection point. Conclusion: Accurate quantitative information on arterial stiffness cannot be obtained from reflection parameters. The augmentation index is most sensitive to stiffness change...|$|R

Rice-based oral rehydration formula is an oral rehydration formula that is good for diarrhea in children because it can help to overcome dehydration condition and frequent defecation. Aim To know the effect of rice-based oral rehydration formula on admission duration in children with acute unsevire dehydration diarrhea. Methods This research was a quasi experimental research with descriptive analysis. Eleven subjects were included in this research after passing inclusion procedures process. Those subjects {{were divided into two}} groups, test group and control group. There were 50 - 100 ml every-defecation doses of rice-based oral rehydration formula for test group and 50 - 100 ml every-defecation doses of glucose-based oral rehydration formula (WHO standard) for control group. Every subject was recorded about their early body weight in the first four-hour oral rehydration treatment and late body weight in the last treatment day, defecation frequency, fecal consistency, and oralyte consumpsion in every 24 hours, and admission duration in the last treatment day. Results and Conclusion Fecal consistency <b>returning</b> <b>time</b> mean in test group was shorter than control group. Those were 24. 000 ± 0. 000 hours and 45. 143 ± 24. 518 hours.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{conditions}} that influence the <b>return</b> <b>time,</b> {{the time it takes}} before energy returns from a set of satellite oscillators attached to a primary structure. Two methods are presented to estimate the <b>return</b> <b>time.</b> One estimate is based on an analysis of the reaction force on a rigid base by a finite number of oscillators as compared with an infinite number of continuously distributed oscillators. The result gives a lower-bound estimate for the <b>return</b> <b>time.</b> A more accurate estimation results from considering the dynamic behavior of a set of oscillators as waves in a waveguide. Such an analogy explains energy flow between a primary structure and the oscillators in terms of pseudowaves and shows that a nonlinear frequency distribution of the oscillators leads to pseudodispersive waves. The resulting approximate expressions show the influence of the natural frequency distribution within the set of oscillators, and of their number, on the <b>return</b> <b>time</b> as compared with the asymptotic case of a continuous set with infinite oscillators. In the paper we also introduce a new method based on a Hilbert envelope to estimate the apparent damping loss factor of the primary structure during the <b>return</b> <b>time</b> considering transient energy flow from the primary structure before any energy reflects back from the attached oscillators. The expressions developed for <b>return</b> <b>time</b> and damping factor show close agreement with direct numerical simulations. The paper concludes with a discussion of the <b>return</b> <b>time</b> and its relation to apparent damping and optimum frequency distribution within a set of oscillators that maximize these quantities. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
