25|$|The {{occupancy}} of {{the energy}} bands in a semiconductor is set by {{the position of the}} Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the band edge, lowering the occupancy of the channel. The effect is to increase the gate voltage necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the figure.

25|$|If an {{external}} voltage is placed across the diode {{with the same}} polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues {{to act as an}} insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless electron–hole pairs are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see photodiode).

25|$|Reverse-active (or inverse-active or inverted): By {{reversing}} the biasing {{conditions of the}} forward-active region, a bipolar transistor goes into reverse-active mode. In this mode, the emitter and collector regions switch roles. Because most BJTs are designed to maximize current gain in forward-active mode, the βF in inverted mode is several times smaller (2–3 times for the ordinary germanium transistor). This transistor mode is seldom used, usually being considered only for failsafe conditions and some types of bipolar logic.

40|$|The {{study of}} solar cells {{subjected}} to <b>reverse</b> <b>biasing</b> is of fundamental importance since {{the reliability of}} an entire solar panel can {{be influenced by the}} presence of leakage paths on a single solar cell. The particular situation of <b>reverse</b> <b>biasing</b> can occur when, in a module, a solar cell is shadowed and the illuminated solar cells force the generated current through the shadowed solar cell that is <b>reverse</b> <b>biased.</b> The situation is further aggravated by the fact that reverse current crowds in localized shunt paths ("hot spots") that are related to the presence of semiconductor defects. In this biasing condition the shadowed solar cell acts as a load and it can dissipate tens of watts with the risk of high temperature and damaging of the encapsulating materials. In this paper we study the effects of <b>reverse</b> <b>biasing</b> on metal wrap through (MWT) solar cells. This cell structure is particularly sensitive to reverse-bias, due to the presence of via holes in the junction. The presence of "hot spots" can be related to the through hole metallization pattern: this leads {{to the conclusion that the}} MWT production process may strongly affect the reliability of this technology and should be optimized to avoid the formation of parasitic reverse current paths in the crystal structure...|$|R
25|$|These {{can be made}} {{to conduct}} in <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> (backward), and are {{correctly}} termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called Zener breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode {{to be used as a}} precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E
25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{ability of}} a PV module to {{withstand}} the effects of periodic hot-spot heating that occurs when cells are operated under <b>reverse</b> <b>biased</b> conditions {{is one of the}} quality characteristics that are verified within IEC qualification testing. The extent of hot-spot heating of solar cells is closely related to the properties of the semi-conductor material. Locally concentrated shunt defects are caused by non-uniformity. The extent of defects is correlated with the slope of the reverse IV-characteristic. In this paper the operational behaviour of crystalline cell types were investigated under <b>reverse</b> <b>biased</b> conditions. These conditions occur within the interconnection circuit of modules when cells are mismatched or totally or partially shadowed, possibly leading to thermal overload (hot-spot heating). This study is focused on the electrical as well as the thermal characterisation of solar cells that are operated under the <b>reverse</b> <b>biased</b> conditions. In connection with <b>reverse</b> <b>biased</b> operating conditions this study is focused on the following points: To identify the cell parameters for a comprehensive description of the electrical and thermal operational behaviour. The knowledge of these parameters is important for design of effective bypass diode concepts in modules. This paper is an insight into the applicability of the simplified method to select the worst case hot-spot cell in a module. The selection of this cell is the first step of hot-spot safety testing.
