Magnetic tapes were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a single period {{problem in a}} supply chain in which a Stackelberg {{manufacturer}} supplies a product to a retailer who faces customer returns and demand uncertainty. We show that the manufacturer incurs a significant profit loss with and without a buyback policy if it fails to account for customer returns in the wholesale price decision. Under {{the assumption that the}} retailer is better informed than the manufacturer on customer <b>returns</b> <b>information,</b> we show that without a buyback policy, the retailer prefers not to share if the manufacturer overestimates while it prefers to share customer <b>returns</b> <b>information</b> if the manufacturer underestimates this information. If the manufacturer offers a buyback policy, we have the opposite results. We also discuss incentives to share the customer <b>returns</b> <b>information</b> and {{some of the issues that}} are raised in sharing this <b>information.</b> Customer <b>returns</b> <b>Information</b> sharing Customer <b>returns</b> policies Buyback policies...|$|R
2500|$|JavaScript {{processes}} {{messages from}} a queue {{one at a}} time. Upon loading a new message, JavaScript calls a function associated with that message, which creates a call stack frame (the function's arguments and local variables). The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. Upon function completion, when the stack is empty, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as [...] "run to completion" [...] because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program input/output is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to <b>return</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
