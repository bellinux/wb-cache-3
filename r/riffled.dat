In front lay a quiet pond, whose surface was so still that it might have been a sheet of clear glass. On his left the familiar mountain-range beyond the farm appeared bluer and nearer than usual, owing to the intense heat. To the right the undulating karroo, covered with wild-flowers, and dotted with clumps of mimosa-bush, terminated abruptly in a lake which stretched away, in some places like a sea, to the horizon. Islands innumerable studded the smooth surface of this lake, and were reflected in its crystal depths. Not a breath of air <b>riffled</b> its surface, and there was a warm sunny brightness, a stillness, a deep quietude, about the whole scene which were powerfully suggestive of heavenly peace and rest.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of benthic (up to 0. 05 m depth) and hyporheic (0. 25 and 0. 5 m depth) macroinvertebrates from downwelling zones at the heads of <b>riffles</b> and upwelling zones at the tails of <b>riffles</b> was examined in two studies on a 4 th order chalk stream in Dorset, England. In the first study, differences in benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate community composition between the head and tail of a single <b>riffle</b> were investigated. In the second study, a replicated design involving eight <b>riffles</b> {{was used to compare}} benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate community composition both between heads and tails of the same <b>riffles</b> and between <b>riffles.</b> In the first (single <b>riffle)</b> study there were significantly higher mean numbers of benthic invertebrates and families at the <b>riffle</b> head (715 individuals and 13. 8 families per 0. 0225 m 2) compared to the tail (192 individuals and 8. 7 families). ANOSIM analysis also showed that the community structure of head and tail benthic samples was significantly different. In the second (replicated <b>riffle)</b> study, there were also significantly more benthic invertebrates at <b>riffle</b> heads (= 594 per 0. 0225 m 2) compared to tails (= 417 per 0. 0225 m 2), although {{this was not the case}} for families, and community structure also differed significantly between <b>riffle</b> heads and tails. In contrast, in the hyporheic zone, there were no significant differences between the total numbers of invertebrates in the <b>riffle</b> heads and tails, or between <b>riffles,</b> although a significant difference in family richness between <b>riffle</b> head and tail samples was identified in the first study. Community analysis revealed progressively poorer separation of <b>riffle</b> head and tail samples at 0. 25 m and 0. 5 m hyporheic depths. Whilst being able to identify clear differences in benthic communities from <b>riffles</b> heads and tails, the physically heterogeneous nature of the <b>riffle</b> habitats studied made it difficult to account for the consistent differences in macroinvertebrate communities observed with the physical variables measure...|$|R
40|$|Pools and <b>riffles</b> are {{sedimentary}} bed features {{found in}} many natural streams. Their rhythmic spacing along the stream length generates flow and substrate variability, which provides a variety of habitat conditions required for different aquatic species and for the same specie {{at different stages of}} its life. Pools and <b>riffles</b> can be degraded by physical removal or by flow regulation, which has made addition and conservation of pools and <b>riffles</b> a major focus of many restoration projects. In this paper we examine different flow-sediment mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of pools and <b>riffles.</b> These mechanisms include differential sediment mobility, variable <b>riffle</b> elevation control, fast sediment sorting and <b>riffle</b> armouring during floods, all of which are incorporated in a simple unsteady 1 D flow and sediment transport model. With the help of the model we investigate conditions under which pools and <b>riffles</b> will be sustainable or degrade, which constitutes vital information for either restoring or maintaining pool and <b>riffle</b> habitats...|$|R

50|$|To {{perform the}} trick, {{the book is}} held by the binding {{in one hand and}} <b>riffled</b> with the other; for right handed magicians this will {{normally}} mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand. By carefully grasping the right side close to the edge, the fingers or thumb are only touching the wider pages, so when the book is <b>riffled</b> two pages flip each time, the wider page under the thumb, and the narrower one on top of it. This way the audience is always seeing the face side of a wide page and the back of a narrow one. To complete the trick, the book is simply <b>riffled</b> with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of lotic fauna is widely acknowledged to be patchy reflecting {{the interaction between}} biotic and abiotic factors. In an in-situ field study, the {{distribution of}} benthic and hyporheic invertebrates in the heads (downwelling) and tails (upwelling) of <b>riffles</b> were examined during stable baseflow conditions. <b>Riffle</b> heads were found to contain {{a greater proportion of}} interstitial fine sediment than <b>riffle</b> tails. Significant differences in the composition of benthic communities were associated with the amount of fine sediment. <b>Riffle</b> tail habitats supported a greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates sensitive to fine sediment such as EPT taxa.

In contrast, no significant differences in the hyporheic community were recorded between <b>riffle</b> heads and tails. We hypothesise that clogging of hyporheic interstices with fine sediments may have resulted in the homogenization of the invertebrate community by limiting faunal movement into the hyporheic zone at both the <b>riffle</b> head and tail.

40|$|Abstract – Improvement of walleye Stizostedion vitreum {{spawning}} {{habitat in}} streams {{is becoming increasingly}} common in Minnesota, but most projects have not been rigorously evalu-ated. A “U”-shaped <b>riffle</b> design was evaluated for stability, and for ability to increase walleye fry production. This design can be fit to the form and profile of many stream types, and should be stable over time. We built “U”-shaped <b>riffles</b> in two streams to improve walleye spawning habitat, and sampled newly hatched walleye fry in both streams {{for two years before}} and after <b>riffle</b> installation. Substrate samples were also collected to compare <b>riffle</b> versus non-riffle egg abundance. Cobble and gravel substrates have been maintained in the <b>riffles</b> over the three years since their construction, despite high sediment loads and flood events in both streams. Although fry catch rates did not increase substantially after adding <b>riffles</b> to the Pelican River, walleye were observed spawning on the <b>riffles.</b> Developing walleye eggs were found in the <b>riffles,</b> but not in unmodified reaches of the stream. In Ada Brook, more fry and fewer viable eggs were caught in drift nets downstream from the <b>riffles</b> than upstream. <b>Riffles</b> may trap and hold walleye eggs, preventing them from rolling and drifting downstream. The chance removal of beaver dams up-stream from a study reach in the spring of 2001 caused a flood {{at the end of the}} walleye spawning season. The high discharge apparently attracted a late run of walleye, suggesting that beaver dam removal could be coordinated with the spawning season to increase stream discharge and attract greater numbers of fish...|$|R

50|$|<b>Riffles</b> are biologically very important, {{because many}} aquatic species rely {{on them in}} one way or another.

40|$|Despite the {{occurrence}} of pool-riffle sequences in many rivers there are few data concerning pool-riffle unit morphology. Of many criteria proposed to identify pool-riffle units, only two methods {{can be regarded as}} objective and robust. These are the â��zero-crossingâ�� and the â��control-pointâ�� methods. In this paper statistics are developed from the â��zero-crossingâ�� method to describe the streamwise morphology of 275 <b>riffles</b> and 285 pools which form a near-continuous 32. 1 km of the bed of the River Severn in Shropshire, England. Yalinâ��s theoretical relationship between pool:riffle unit length (ï�¬p) and channel width (W) : ï�¬p = 3 W applies to the River Severn. Reach-average <b>riffle</b> height (H) is a constant proportion of bankfull depth (h); typically H ï�� 0. 16 h. <b>Riffle</b> height is a positive function of <b>riffle</b> length. Pool depth is a positive function of pool length. However both <b>riffle</b> length and pool length increase more rapidly than the bed-level amplitude; such that long <b>riffles</b> or pools are relatively â��flatâ��. As channel gradient reduces, bedforms flatten and become more asymmetric as <b>riffle</b> stoss sides and the proximal slope of pools lengthen at the expense of <b>riffle</b> lee sides and pool distal slopes. The statistical relationships between <b>riffle</b> height, length and water depth are similar to those for equilibrium subaqueous dunes. The Severn data are partially consistent with Yalinâ��s theoretical analysis relating <b>riffle</b> bedform length (Lr) to water depth i. e. Lr = ï�¡ 2 ï�°h wherein ï�¡ ï�� 1 for steep near-equilibrium bedforms but ï�¡ ï�� 2 to 3 as the relative depth decreases and <b>riffles</b> become long-low features. A consideration of turbulence data indicates that the frequency of coherent turbulent-flow structures associated with the riffle-pool mixing length is of the order of 60 seconds. The morphological and dynamic similarity of the River Severn <b>riffles</b> with dunes raises intriguing questions with respect to self-similar, convergent organization of periodic alluvial bedforms and to bedform dynamic classification particularly...|$|R
