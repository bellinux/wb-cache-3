ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the {{screen-printed}} solar cells fabricated on three types of silicon materials; float zone (FZ), HEM multicrystalline and EFG ribbon with POCl 3 and belt furnace diffused emitters. The belt furnace diffused emitters involved one- and two-side phosphorus spin-on to assess the contaminating effect of the IR belt. The solar cells with POCl 3 emitters and co-firing of screen-printed contacts produced efficiencies of 17. 3 % on FZ, 16. 4 % on HEM and 15. 5 % on EFG <b>ribbon</b> <b>silicon.</b> Solar cells with two-side phosphorus emitters diffused on the belt furnace, produced efficiencies of 17. 2 %, 16. 0 %, and 15. 1 %, respectively, on FZ, HEM and EFG <b>ribbon</b> <b>silicon.</b> However, appreciably lower efficiencies of 15. 5 %, 15. 5 %, and 14. 1 % were obtained, respectively, on FZ, HEM and EFG <b>ribbon</b> <b>silicon</b> for belt-diffused emitters with only one-side phosphorus spin-on with the other side on the belt. This difference in efficiency is reflected in Voc loss for the belt-diffused emitters compared to the POCl(3) emitter cells. The IQE measurements supported that solar cells with belt-diffused emitter with two-side phosphorus spin-on and POCl(3) emitter cells had comparable Jsc. However, the cell with phosphorus spin-on on one-side gave much lower IQE because of poor bulk lifetime or the contamination due to direct contact with the belt. These results indicate that the belt emitters can account for appreciable loss in the performance of the many current commercial cells; however, this loss can be regained by applying phosphorus dopant to both side of the wafer...|$|E

In this work, we propose a method to remove dislocations based on a high temperature treatment. Dislocation density reductions of> 95 % are achieved in commercial <b>ribbon</b> <b>silicon</b> with a double-sided silicon nitride coating via high temperature annealing under ambient conditions. The dislocation density reduction follows temperature-dependent and time-dependent models developed by Kuhlmann et al. for the annealing of dislocations in face-centered cubic metals.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that during the time from 1970 to 1976 the {{efficiency}} of solar cells has increased from 10. 5 to 15. 5 %.

30|$|High {{absorptivity}} of a direct-gap semiconductor {{has also}} an important consequence {{with respect to the}} quality of material used in solar cells. Since the direct-gap semiconductor can absorb solar radiation at its thickness much smaller than that of the Si wafer (or ribbon), the requirements for chemical purity and crystalline perfection of the absorber layer become much weaker. Indeed, to collect photogenerated charge carriers, it is necessary to have a diffusion length of minority carriers in excess of the thickness of the absorber layer. It follows from this that in the solar cell based on direct-gap semiconductor, the diffusion length L may be about 2 orders smaller, i.e. the carrier lifetime τ can be shorter by 4 (!) orders of magnitude (L ~ τ 1 / 2) compared with silicon. Thus, the manufacture of thin-film solar modules based on the direct-gap semiconductors does not require high purification and crystallinity of the material as it is needed in the production of modules based on crystalline, polycrystalline, or <b>ribbon</b> <b>silicon.</b>|$|E

To improve the bulk minority carrier lifetime in String <b>Ribbon</b> <b>silicon,</b> SiN(x) induced defect passivation during a post deposition anneal is investigated.

In addition, it is found that controlled rapid cooling can be used to enhance the defect passivation process. A model is proposed which relates the high temperature passivation to the release of hydrogen from the SiN(x) film, the injection of vacancies from backside AI alloying, and the retention of hydrogen at defect sites.

The same heat treatment after PS formation increased the lifetime by a factor of 8. 33, indicating that PS alone is quite effective in raising the lifetime of web. Al gettering by itself raised the lifetime of as-grown web by a factor of 15, but the simultaneous annealing heat treatment increased the lifetime by a factor of 42, indicating a positive synergistic interaction between PS and Al. Finally, simultaneous phosphorus and Al diffusion, after PS formation, raised the as-grown web lifetime by a factor of 58. String ribbon Si, which has a low oxygen content and responds more favorably to hydrogenation, did not show much improvement due to PS+Al. Instead it showed greater response to SiN+Al treatment, suggesting that Al+PS induced lifetime enhancement is due to gettering and not hydrogenation.
