40|$|Many {{applications}} including antenna beamforming and <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> processing, require broadband <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> combiners [1]–[3]. The key specifications of an <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> combiner include low loss, compact size, {{compatibility with}} existing RF systems and very good channel isolation [4]. Several structures {{have been proposed}} for realising <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> combiners, such as resistive signal adders [5], Wilkinson combiners [6] and active signal adders [7]. All these structures have limitations that make them unattractive for broadband <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> processing. For example, while resistive adders are broadband devices, their power losses are quite high (due to the skin effect). Wilkinson combiners have relatively low RF losses, however, their most common problem is poor interport isolation [8]. Active RF combiners are capable of adding gain to the output [9]. However, such combiners cannot accurately control the combination ratio, and also their operating frequency band is typically narrow...|$|R
50|$|After the <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> arrive the destination, the {{receiver}} can not obtain the data {{directly from the}} <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> because there are coded and multiplied <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> existing at the same time. As for the multiple <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> problem, an electric filter is used. The frequency of each RF signal is usually different from other <b>RF</b> <b>signals.</b> An electronic filter can select only one RF signal {{on the basis of}} its carrier frequency, while rejecting all other <b>RF</b> <b>signals.</b> One example of this operation is selecting a channel on a television receiver. With only one RF signal that passes through the electric filter, only the one corresponding video signal is received, with no interference from the other <b>RF</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
