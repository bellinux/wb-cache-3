50|$|The {{interior}} is simple yet impressive: the nave, with its stone pillars and gothic arches, is spacious; exposed wooden arches support a <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> of diagonal tongue and groove, v-jointed red cedar; {{and the walls}} are rendered. Each aisle has its own roof, above which a sequence of cusped windows in the clerestory permits natural lighting of the nave.|$|E
50|$|The school, {{which opened}} in 1910, was at first run by the Sisters of Nicolette, who also ran the Notre Dame parish school.

50|$|The interior's most {{striking}} {{feature is the}} lofty vaulted roof, formed of four bays of lime-washed shuttered concrete, divided by slender sandstone arches (the stone came from the now-redundant local Capler quarry). At Brockhampton, Lethaby predicted the Modern Movement's short-lived passion for patterned concrete surfaces, by leaving the internal face of the Nave's <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> unplastered.|$|E
5000|$|The Quattroporte Executive GT was a comfort- and luxury-oriented specification; it came {{equipped}} with wood-rimmed steering wheel, an alcantara suede interior <b>roof</b> <b>lining,</b> ventilated, adaptive, massaging rear seats, rear air conditioning controls, veneered [...] rear tables, and curtain shades {{on the rear}} windows.

50|$|The 2007 model also {{includes}} less visible mechanical changes. The {{keyless entry system}} was improved. Reinforcements to the body shell improve overall chassis rigidity. The front dampers of the MacPherson strut suspension have been re-tuned to quicken steering response and reduce understeer. The hydraulic dampers of the multi-link rear suspension were also re-tuned to match the front suspension changes. Mazda engineers and designers addressed concerns regarding cabin noise level by redesigning or changing multiple systems and adding sound-deadening material to the <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> and hood panel.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{wanting to}} protect {{all of the}} {{interior}} of the boot (floor, sides and back of seats including the <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> and bumper bar) can use a heavy duty polyester boot liner.

50|$|The first {{dedicated}} market {{building on}} the site was built in 1774 consisting of a roof supported by pillars. It had no external walls. A new market called the New Market was opened in 1830 which was a walled structure with a <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> the walls. The interior market space was open to the elements. The open walled structure was replaced with a new red brick building which opened in July 1897. The new building was entirely roofed and by December 1897, electric lighting had been introduced. This building was hit during the Luftwaffe bombing raids in 1941 destroying the roof and {{the interior of the}} building. During the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, the market was held as an outdoor market at site where the market building once stood.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} opened on 4 August 1878 and {{a report in}} a local newspaper, The Toowoomba Chronicle and Darling Downs Advertiser, {{provides}} {{a description of the}} ceremony and the building, which is described as [...] "domestic Gothic very freely treated". This alludes to the simple design of the building in a Gothic revival style; a style widely employed on the churches of many Christian religious denominations {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. Among the elements which contributed to the style and which are found on the Neil Street Wesleyan Methodist Church is the steeply pitched roof, lancet window openings, stained glass panels, broach spire and internal fittings such as carved joinery, heavy timber trusses and, when constructed, a richly painted and gilded <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> and internal decoration.|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the chapel}} {{is a single}} space, divided into seven bays by the heavy hammer beam roof trusses. The {{cavities}} created between the hammerbeam and the <b>roof</b> <b>lining</b> is infilled with a carved timber detail. Likewise, the cavity between the collar beam and the roof is infilled with timber battening, {{similar to that of}} the battening in the gables of the exterior of the church. The line of the roof truss continues on the internal wall with slender timber pilasters. The walls of the church are lined with vertical timber boards and the ceiling is lined with similar boards running parallel to the nave of the church. At the western end of the chapel is a small platform extending on which sits three pieces of furniture; a lectern, altar table and chair, all designed in keeping with the building.|$|E
50|$|The Sydney School, {{also the}} Nuts and Berries style, {{refers to an}} {{architectural}} style {{by a group of}} architects in Australia who reacted against international Modernism with their own regionalist style during the 1960s. In contrast to the purism of the international style, they were drawn to rustic materials, clinker bricks, low gutter <b>lines,</b> and raked <b>roof</b> <b>lines</b> rather than flat <b>roof</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
