5|$|Jordan's yearly {{income from}} the {{endorsements}} {{is estimated to be}} over forty million dollars. In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and <b>road</b> <b>games.</b> Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US $30million per season. An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1billion.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, Michigan lost 75–52 in its rivalry {{game against}} (#8 AP/#8 Coaches) Michigan State. Among those in {{attendance}} were Rick Snyder, Matthew Stafford, Mark Dantonio, Brady Hoke, and Lloyd Carr.

Though they sat in 14th place in the 15-team Western Conference, the Flames ended November only five points out of a playoff spot. The organization reached a milestone during the month, as Curtis Glencross scored the 10,000th goal {{in the history of the}} Flames franchise during a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on November 26.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to <b>road</b> <b>games.</b> In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E

Wake Forest {{recovered}} from its second loss of the season to earn a 38-24 victory against Maryland—its first since 1998—clinching the Atlantic Division championship and earning a bid to the ACC Championship Game.

The Tar Heels {{started out}} with an 8-0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 Michigan in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79-78 on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back <b>road</b> <b>games</b> against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into {{the last week of}} the regular season (their first #1 ranking {{since the start of the}} 1987–88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, defeating #16-seed East Carolina (85-65), #8-seed Rhode Island (112-67), #4-seed Arkansas (80-74) and #2-seed Cincinnati (75-68) to reach the Final Four in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{hoped to}} build on the success of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two <b>road</b> <b>games</b> of the season.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 regular season, Parker {{recorded}} similar averages as {{the previous}} two seasons for points and rebounds, and slightly increased his assists per game average.

For the third time in four years, San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix; Parker had an outstanding first round series, averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game. In the next round against Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, the Spurs dropped the first two <b>road</b> <b>games</b> before responding with a strong win in the third game. In that game, Parker recorded a double-double with 31 points and 11 assists. The experienced Spurs took seven games to defeat the Hornets, but were unable to get past the Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E

5|$|The Lakers hold several NBA {{records as}} a team {{including}} most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive <b>road</b> <b>games</b> won (16) both of which came during the 1971–72 season. Highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85), and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72). They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31). The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017. The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99). They also used to hold the record for most wins {{at home in the}} regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) before the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season.|$|E
5|$|Ginóbili {{was to play}} an {{even bigger}} role for the Spurs the {{following}} season, reaching career high averages in points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goal percentage. With this improvement, Ginobili was named an NBA All-Star {{for the second time}} in his career. On 11 February 2008, Ginóbili scored 34 points and recorded 15 rebounds in a 93–88 win over the Toronto Raptors, becoming the first guard in Spurs' history to have at least 15 points and 15 rebounds in a game. On 21 April 2008, the NBA announced that Ginóbili had won the 2008 Sixth Man Award; only a couple of weeks later, the Argentine was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. In the playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Suns 4–1 in the first round, Ginóbili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two <b>road</b> <b>games.</b> San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games, the Argentine played another strong series, leading the Spurs in points and assists per game (21.3 and 6.0 respectively). However, San Antonio lost to arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games, and once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Werblin's co-owners {{gave him}} an ultimatum– either buy them out or be bought out. He chose the latter option, {{reportedly}} profiting $1.4million for his 1963 investment of $250,000. Prior to Werblin's departure, the Jets had considered firing Ewbank. They attempted to secure Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, but Lombardi decided to remain in Green Bay one more season. The season started with the usual three <b>road</b> <b>games</b> due to the team's status as secondary tenant to the Mets at Shea Stadium. The Jets rose {{to the top of}} the AFL East; they had lost only two games by mid-November and built a three-game lead over second-place Houston. New York's next game was at Oakland. In what became known as the Heidi Game, the Jets took a 32–29 lead with 68seconds left, only to have Oakland score two touchdowns to win the game. However, the touchdowns went unseen by much of the national TV audience, as NBC had switched at 7:00p.m. to a TV movie of Heidi. Nevertheless, the Jets won their remaining games to finish 11–3. In the playoffs, the Jets defeated the Raiders for the AFL Championship at Shea Stadium, 27–23, a game in which Namath threw three touchdowns, including the game winner to Don Maynard in the fourth quarter.|$|E
