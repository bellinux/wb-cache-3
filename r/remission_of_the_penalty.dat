(Digest 4, 4, 37) But {{as regards}} the {{provisions}} of the Lex Julia....a man who confesses that he has committed the offence adultery has no right to ask for a <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> on the ground that he was under age; nor, as I have said, will any remission be allowed if he commits any of those offences which the statute punishes {{in the same way as}} adultery; as, for example, if he marries a woman who is detected in adultery and he declines to divorce her, or where he makes a profit from her adultery, or accepts a bribe to conceal illicit intercourse which he detects, or lends his house for the commission of adultery or illicit intercourse within it; youth, as I said, is no excuse in the face of clear enactments, when a man who, though he appeals to the law, himself transgresses it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Medical therapy of {{autoimmune}} hypophysitis with immunosuppressive {{drugs can}} be effective to induce <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease by treating both pituitary dysfunction and compression symptoms. We describe <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a 41 -yr-old man with autoimmune hypophysitis in whom prednisone therapy induced <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease but {{was followed by a}} sudden relapse after withdrawal. A second trial of corticosteroid was started and succeeded in inducing <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. Eight months after the second withdrawal pituitary function was restored, pituitary mass had disappeared, only partial diabetes insipidus remained unchanged. Review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature identified 30 articles, among case reports and case series, reporting a total of 44 cases of autoimmune hypophysitis treated with glucocorticoids and/or azathioprine. Combining all the cases, medical therapy resulted to be effective in reducing the pituitary mass in 84 %, in improving anterior pituitary function in 45 %, and in restoring posterior pituitary function in 41 %.

30|$|<b>The</b> P-spline {{approach}} <b>of</b> Currie et al.
