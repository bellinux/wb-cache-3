5|$|Two of Daniels' other tax {{proposals}} were approved: {{a tax on}} liquor and beverages to fund {{the construction of the}} Lucas Oil Stadium and a tax on <b>rental</b> <b>cars</b> to expand the Indiana Convention Center. The new source of funding resulted in a state take-over of a project initially started by the City of Indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between Daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project. The state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city.|$|E
50|$|Consolidated <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> {{facilities}} often {{result in}} higher <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> fees, long distances between facilities and the airports they serve, and frustration over consolidated <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> shuttles, {{which can be}} crowded.|$|R
50|$|A {{consolidated}} <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> facility (CRCF) is {{a complex}} that hosts numerous <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> agencies. They are often found at airports in the United States. The incentive for building consolidated facilities are numerous, including: less congestion on surface streets, more convenience for <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> company employees, greater efficiencies for <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> companies, and numerous environmental benefits from reduced emissions to consolidated, professionally managed fueling stations. Typical services to the <b>rental</b> <b>car</b> companies include onsite offices, fueling, car wash, car prep (vacuums, windshield wiper fluids, and trash services), and light maintenance areas.|$|R

5|$|After Emil {{was arrested}} in 1933, Kristel fled to Zurich, where she studied {{education}} and psychology at the University of Zurich. She returned to Berlin in 1934, where she too worked at the car rental agency. In 1936, Emil arranged with Quaker friends in the United States for Kristel to attend Swarthmore College there. She visited Fuchs in England en route to America, where she eventually married an American communist, Robert Heineman, and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She became a permanent resident in the United States in May 1938. In 1936, Kittowski and Elisabeth were arrested again, and the <b>rental</b> <b>cars</b> were impounded. Gerhard and Karin fled to Czechoslovakia. Elisabeth was released and {{went to live with}} Emil, while Kittowski, sentenced to six years, later escaped from prison and also made his way to Czechoslovakia. In August 1939, Elisabeth committed suicide by throwing herself from a train, leaving Emil to raise young Klaus.|$|E
5|$|About {{two weeks}} after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500people in 18shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400people in shelters elsewhere. Many others were either {{residing}} with relatives or staying at their damaged properties. The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000litres (20,000gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies. The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, {{due to the lack of}} medications or emergency medical equipment. About 60FEMA personnel worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their stay on the island, the group assisted 163people, mostly for minor issues. Overall, there were about 100FEMA workers involved on the island, although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and <b>rental</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, Kitase knew {{he wanted}} a {{thematic}} combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing <b>rental</b> <b>cars</b> for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in VII. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E

25|$|Fees will {{be charged}} using the {{existing}} FasTrak transponders used for tolling on the Bay Area bridges, and a network of cameras.

Carpoolers probably would not get a discount because they already have toll-free pass through the Bay Area bridges. The study made the assumption that tolls at the Bay Area bridges will remain the same.|$|E
