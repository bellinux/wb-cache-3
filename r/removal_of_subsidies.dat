5|$|Kirchner {{proposed}} a fiscal austerity program in early 2012, including the gradual <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies.</b> The proposal {{turned out to}} be unpopular, and was not implemented. She opted instead to send a bill to Congress for the renationalization of YPF, privatized in 1993, blaming the Spanish company Repsol for the energy trade deficit. The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by a 207-32 margin. It was criticized as an authoritarian move, as there was no negotiation with Repsol. As well, the Vaca Muerta oil field had been discovered by this time. However, YPF was unable to afford the costs to exploit the oil at the site, and the rights to drill at Vaca Muerta were sold to the Chevron Corporation. The costs of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. Outages usually took place on the hottest days of the summer season, as the use of air conditioning increased electricity consumption to peak levels.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the response}} of the agricultural sector to the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> on refined petroleum in Nigeria, given its strategic role as a critical sector. Using a dynamic energy-environment CGE model based on the 2006 Nigerian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), the study presents the results of {{the response of}} the agricultural sector to three different simulation scenarios. These include a partial (50 percent), gradual and a one shot (complete) <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> on imported refined oil in Nigeria. The results provided evidence that a complete or one shot <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>subsidy</b> is more favourable in terms of better performance of the agricultural sector as many of the key macroeconomic variables increased under the complete removal simulation scenario. It is recommended that a one shot <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>subsidy</b> will strengthen the agricultural sector performance and outputs, even though prices will move up in the short term. The long term benefits to the sector when funds are allocated to infrastructural and technological development will support overall growth and enhance food security in Nigeria...|$|R

25|$|Al-Bashir has {{achieved}} {{economic growth in}} Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil. However, economic growth has not been shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage points up from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies,</b> as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration {{in the value of}} the Sudanese pound (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).|$|E

[...] The branch was dieselised in 1968, and at this stage, despite the relaxation of laws and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> that had benefited rail, it was still necessary to run two trains daily. [...] In July 1975, a major storm severely damaged pine growth in the Balmoral State Forest, and the resulting timber that had to be transported resulted in a surge for the line. [...] Multiple trains were required to run daily, sometimes hauled by two locomotives, and this traffic lasted for two years. [...] When it finally ceased in late 1977, the line suddenly became uneconomic. No other traffic existed that was sufficient to justify the line's continued existence, and closure occurred on 15 January 1978.|$|E

50|$|A case which {{provides}} compelling {{evidence for the}} removal of government subsidies to correct explicit market failure is that of Iran, where the energy industry is heavily subsidised. This means that oil prices are one tenth the world price, and using cars is a cheap and convenient mode of transport. The World Bank calculates that if the $37 billion a year subsidy were removed, then carbon emissions would be reduced by 49 percent. A further advantage is that as fuel becomes more expensive, car manufacturers within the country are forced to produce more energy-efficient models to meet market demand. Evidently, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> can have far-reaching environmental implications.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study are {{to shed light on}} the characteristics, policies and system <b>of</b> energy <b>subsidy</b> in Jordan; to identify the economic impact and the reform measures <b>of</b> the energy <b>subsidy.</b> The research methodology is descriptive and analytical based on a questionnaire to survey the viewpoints of a convenient sample of economic experts on the research questions. The study concludes that although the energy subsidy has a positive social impact on the poor, it has unfortunately negative impacts on governmental budget, distorted the energy pricing mechanism and led to inefficient utilization of the scarce economic and financial resources. The study recommends rationalizing the energy subsidy in the short run by directing it to the targeted underprivileged consumers and the gradual <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> in the long-run. Such a step should be accompanied by social net programs to alleviate the burden of hiking energy prices on the poor. ...|$|R
