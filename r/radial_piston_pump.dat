50|$|Radial {{piston pumps}} are used {{especially}} for high pressure and relatively small flows. Pressures {{of up to}} 650 bar are normal. In fact variable displacement is possible. The pump is designed {{in such a way}} that the plungers are connected to a floating ring. This floating ring can be moved horizontally by a control lever & thus causes an eccentricity in the centre of rotation of the plungers. The amount of eccentricity can be controlled to vary the discharge. The suction & discharge can be totally reversed seamlessly by shifting the eccentricity to the opposite side. Hence both quantity & direction can be varied in a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump,</b> just as in the Swash plate pump.|$|E

The cylinder radials in one, two {{or several}} superimposed layers (stars) {{are driven by}} bearing fitted eccentrically on the drive shaft (piston pressure stroke), then being returned to their idle position by springs (piston intake stroke). The fluid being delivered by the various cylinders is collected via manifolds feeding one joint pressure port. The pump housing shells are load-bearing elements supporting the cylinders and shaft bearings. The pumps run very smoothly as the drive shaft is statically balanced via counter weights.

40|$|Most present wind, wave, and {{tidal energy}} systems require {{expensive}} power conditioning systems that reduce overall efficiency. This new design eliminates power conditioning all, or nearly all, of the time. Wind, wave, and tidal energy systems can transmit their energy to pumps that send high-pressure fluid {{to a central}} power production area. The central power production area can consist {{of a series of}} hydraulic generators. The hydraulic generators can be variable displacement generators such that the RPM, and thus the voltage, remains constant, eliminating the need for further power conditioning. A series of wind blades is attached to a series of <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pumps,</b> which pump fluid to a series of axial piston motors attached to generators. As the wind is reduced, the amount of energy is reduced, and the number of active hydraulic generators can be reduced to maintain a nearly constant RPM. If the axial piston motors have variable displacement, an exact RPM can be maintained for all, or nearly all, wind speeds. Analyses have been performed that show over 20 % performance improvements with this technique over conventional wind turbine...|$|R

40|$|Due to many advantages, {{swash plate}} pumps are wide spread in {{hydraulic}} systems. The main advantages are the through drive capability, the adjustability {{and most of}} all, the high power density. Their application range is limited, historically, to 450 bar including medium and higher volume sizes. In higher pressure range, constant pumps such as wobbling disks or <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pumps</b> are normally used. This is because the higher stressed parts can be dimensioned much bigger. Pumps with lower power such as constant displacement gear pumps are generally used in low price applications. In order to enlarge the application range of swash plate pumps, their advantages have to be further improved and strengthened. This paper shows by example how {{the pressure of the}} basic series A 4 VSO was increased up to a nominal pressure of 630 bar and the historical pressure mark of 450 bar could be exceeded. This increase in pressure level enables for example steel treatment manufacturers to reduce their component sizes without the need of a pressure transducer. Furthermore the power density of the redesigned HA 4 VSO was increased by 36 %, compared to the standard A 4 VSO, by significantly increasing the self-priming speed. On {{the other side of the}} application range, in lower power mobile applications such as small tractors, forklift and skid steer loader, there is an increasing demand for less exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The energy saving potential by changing from a hydraulic system with constant hydraulic pumps to variable hydraulic pumps is already proven on high power applications. By developing the variable axial <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> A 1 VO to the requirements of lower horse power application, it is now also possible to realize such savings in lower horse power applications. Furthermore efficiency of the pump itself can be improved. An example of this is shown by way of the new A 4 series 33...|$|R
50|$|In the ABC system, a {{computer}} detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls {{the action of}} the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic <b>pump.</b> A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one acceleration sensor measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a spring strut, beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A suspension strut, consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder {{in the direction of the}} suspension strut, and change the suspension length. This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz.|$|R
40|$|Tidal energy, {{offshore}} wind energy, and onshore wind energy {{can be converted}} to electricity at a central ground location by means of converting their respective energies into high-pressure hydraulic flows that are transmitted to a system of generators by high-pressure pipelines. The high-pressure flows are then efficiently converted to electricity by a central power plant, and the low-pressure outlet flow is returned. The Department of Energy (DOE) is presently supporting a project led by Sunlight Photonics to demonstrate a 15 kilowatt tidal hydraulic power generation system in the laboratory and possibly later submerged in the ocean. All gears and submerged electronics are completely eliminated. A second portion of this DOE project involves sizing and costing a 15 megawatt tidal energy system for a commercial tidal energy plant. For this task, Atlantis Resources Corporation's 18 -m diameter demonstrated tidal blades are rated to operate in a nominal 2. 6 m/sec tidal flow to produce approximately one megawatt per set of tidal blades. Fifteen units would be submerged in a deep tidal area, such as in Maine's Western Passage. All would be connected to a high-pressure (20 megapascals, 2900 pounds per square inch) line that is 35 cm ID. The high-pressure HEPG fluid flow is transported 500 -m to on-shore hydraulic generators. HEPG is an environmentally-friendly, biodegradable, water-miscible fluid. Hydraulic adaptations to ORPC's cross-flow turbines are also discussed. For 15 megawatt of wind energy that is onshore or offshore, a gearless, high efficiency, <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> can replace each set of top-mounted gear-generators. The fluid is then pumped to a central, easily serviceable generator location.

40|$|Agarwal, Pulkit. M. S. M. E., Purdue University, December 2014. Modeling of High Pressure Radial Piston Pumps. Major Professor: Andrea Vacca, School of Mechanical Engineering A {{comprehensive}} multi-domain simulation {{tool for}} investigating {{the operation of}} radial piston machines has been developed in the present study. The simulation tool is capable of analyzing the displacing action of the machine parts {{as well as the}} power losses occurring in the lubricating interfaces which makes it useful for supporting the design process of radial piston units. The reference machine analyzed in this study is a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> of rotating cam type design used for high pressure applications. Though the modeling process and calculations in this analysis pertain mostly to this specific design, the concepts involved and numerical procedure can be applied to generic designs of radial piston machines. A lumped parameter based model for complete hydraulic system of the pump has been formulated which can predict the main flow parameters in the pump namely flow rate and pressure at pump outlet. This model can be easily coupled with other hydraulic components present in a circuit to model the systems level performance of the machine. However, an improvement in pump design calls for a detailed investigation of internal components present in the pump specifically the lubricating interfaces present in the pump. The lumped parameter model is capable of generating boundary conditions to simulate the flow behavior in these lubricating interfaces. A separate model for piston-cylinder interface and cam-piston interface has been developed in this study to incorporate the detailed features involved in each of them. The piston/cylinder lubricating interface represents {{one of the most critical}} design elements of radial piston machines. The interface performs the functions of a hydrodynamic bearing by supporting the radial loads acting on the piston, seals the high pressure fluid in the displacement chamber and reduces friction between the moving parts. However, operating in the Elastohydrodyamic Lubrication (EHL) regime, it also represents one of the main sources of power loss due to viscous friction and leakage flow. An accurate prediction of instantaneous film thickness, pressure field, and load carrying ability is necessary to create more efficient interface designs. For this purpose, a fully coupled numerical solver has been developed to capture fluid-structure interaction phenomena in the lubricating interface at isothermal fluid conditions. This model considers the piston micro-motion during one complete cycle of pump operation. The radial loads acting on the piston have a significant influence on piston micro-motion and hence the power losses in piston-cylinder interface. These loads are caused majorly by the friction forces existing between the cam and piston. A more accurate evaluation of performance parameters in the piston-cylinder interface can be achieved by calculating the instantaneous friction acting between the cam and piston under lubricating conditions. Different approaches for evaluating this friction coefficient were considered ranging from a simplified assumptions of pure sliding, pure rolling to a detailed analysis of lubricant flow between the cam-piston surfaces. For this purpose, a line contact EHL model was developed that can predict viscous friction forces generated between the cam and piston at changing surface velocities and contact loads. Also, instantaneous pressure field and film thickness can be predicted to a reasonable accuracy. This model is capable of analyzing multiple configurations of cam-piston interface design. The numerical results presented in this thesis provide detailed information of the pump performance parameters at different operating conditions thereby confirming the utility of the simulation tool to support the design process of these units and assist in creation of more energy efficient pumps. Validation of the numerical model developed in this study with experimental results can be a part of future work...|$|E
40|$|Addressing {{the urgent}} need to develop LCOE {{competitive}} renewable energy solutions for US energy security and to replace fossil-fuel generation with the associated benefits to environment impacts including a reduction in CO 2 emissions, this Project focused on the advantages of using hydraulic energy transfer (HET) in large-scale Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems for harvesting off-shore tidal energy in US waters. A recent DOE resource assessment, identifies water power resources have a potential to meet 15 % of the US electric supply by 2030, with MHK technologies being a major component. The work covered a TRL- 4 laboratory proof-in-concept demonstration plus modeling of a 15 MW full scale system based on an approach patented by NASA-JPL, in which submerged high-ratio gearboxes and electrical generators in conventional MHK turbine systems are replaced by a submerged hydraulic radial pump coupled to on-shore hydraulic motors driving a generator. The advantages are; first, the mean-time-between-failure (MTBF), or maintenance, can be extended from approximately 1 to 5 years and second, the range of tidal flow speeds which can be efficiently harvested can be extended beyond that of a conventional submerged generator. The approach uses scalable, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, facilitating scale-up and commercialization. All {{the objectives of the}} Project have been successfully met (1) A TRL 4 system was designed, constructed and tested. It simulates a tidal energy turbine, with a 2 -m diameter blade in up to a 2. 9 m/sec flow. The system consists of a drive motor assembly providing appropriate torque and RPM, attached to a <b>radial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump.</b> The pump circulates pressurized, environmentally-friendly, HEES hydraulic fluid in a closed loop to an axial piston motor which drives an electrical generator, with a resistive load. The performance of the components, subsystems and system were evaluated during simulated tidal cycles. The pump is contained in a tank for immersion testing. The COTS pump and motor were selected to scale to MW size and were oversized for the TRL- 4 demonstration, operating at only 1 - 6 % of rated values. Nevertheless, in for 2 - 18 kW drive power, in agreement with manufacturer performance data, we measured efficiencies of 85 - 90 % and 75 - 80 % for the pump and motor, respectively. These efficiencies being 95 - 96 % at higher operating powers. (2) Two follow-on paths were identified. In both cases conventional turbine systems can be modified, replacing existing gear box and generator with a hydraulic pump and on-shore components. On a conventional path, a TRL 5 / 6 15 kW turbine system can be engineered and tested on a barge at an existing site in Maine. Alternatively, on an accelerated path, a TRL- 8 100 kW system can be engineered and tested by modifying a team member's existing MHK turbines, with barge and grid-connected test sites in-place. On both paths the work can be expedited and cost effective by reusing TRL- 4 components, modifying existing turbines and using established test sites. (3) Sizing, performance modeling and costing of a scaled 15 MW system, suitable for operation in Maine's Western Passage, was performed. COTS components are identified and the performance projections are favorable. The estimated LCOE is comparable to wind generation with peak production at high demand times. (4) We determined that a similar HET approach can be extended to on-shore and off-shore wind turbine systems. These are very large energy resources which can be addressed in parallel for even great National benefit. (5) Preliminary results on this project were presented at two International Conferences on renewable energy in 2012, providing a timely dissemination of information. We have thus demonstrated a proof-in-concept of a novel, tidal HET system that eliminates all submerged gears and electronics to improve reliability. Hydraulic pump efficiencies of 90 % have been confirmed in simulated tidal flows between 1 and 3 m/s, and at only 1 - 6 % of rated power. Total system efficiencies have also been modeled, up to MW-scale, for tidal, and wind, systems. Projected efficiencies are between 81 % (full rated flow) and 86 % (1 / 3 rated flow). This high efficiency in a wide operating range compares favorably with conventional systems having a performance range of 87 % (full rated flow) to 0 % (1 / 3 rated flow) efficiency. An accelerated path to commercialization is identified, leveraging conventional MHK system technology and COTS components to meet {{the urgent need}} for renewable energy generation...|$|E
