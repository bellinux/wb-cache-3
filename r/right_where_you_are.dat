2500|$|Wilson {{favored a}} form of basic income guarantee; synthesizing several ideas under the acronym RICH. [...] His ideas are {{set forth in the}} essay [...] "The RICH Economy" [...] found in The Illuminati Papers. In an article {{critical}} of capitalism Wilson self-identified as a [...] "libertarian socialist", saying that [...] "I ask only one thing of skeptics: don’t bring up Soviet Russia, please. That horrible example of State Capitalism {{has nothing to do with}} what I, and other libertarian socialists, would offer as an alternative to the present system." [...] In his book <b>Right</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> Sitting Now he praises the German anarchist economist Silvio Gesell.|$|E

Or, say, no, stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> You," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to me, [...] "stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and I'll {{give you a}} dollar to just hold that horror; you understand, just keep on registering it. Don't do another thing, just register that face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I thought. Well, Betty, hostile Injuns are hidin' and waitin' fer you in them high rushes <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> makin' fer," [...] said Wetzel. Then he {{shouldered}} {{his rifle}} and walked rapidly away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, nigger," [...] Peter said, taking, as captor, {{the lead}} in the matter, [...] "jest tell us <b>right</b> away <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> going and who sent you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, don't, then; stay <b>right</b> there <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Oh-um!" [...] gaped Hartley, {{stretching}} himself; [...] "it's {{about time}} f'r breakfast, I guess. Want y'r hands washed and y'r hair combed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{standing}} <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> sir," [...] he replied (Captain Lige moved), [...] "and he proposed that I should buy his influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pull him up," [...] cried Corporal Payne, and {{his voice}} was a little strained. [...] "Stop <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> before we fire on you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you fellows don't go back I'll shoot," [...] {{returned}} {{the fellow who}} resembled Dave. [...] "Stop <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are!</b> Don't dare to come a step closer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Joan, I've {{got such}} a {{wonderful}} thing to tell you about! You would never imagine it. I've had a dream, and in the dream I saw <b>you</b> <b>right</b> here <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> standing now, and" ...|$|R

6000|$|Next, {{turning to}} me, he added: [...] "You're {{welcome to the}} horse, but it will <b>be</b> supper-time before <b>you</b> fetch Coombs' homestead, and you mayn't get much then. So lie <b>right</b> back <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> until dinner's ready, and tell us the best news of the Old Country. Jess was born there." ...|$|R
6000|$|Okanagan {{glanced at}} him severely. [...] "I guess you'll lie <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and keep very still, or I'll make a hole through the other leg," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you come}} any closer," [...] one warned him, flourishing his club with the {{advertisement}} of braining him. [...] "You stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{until you get}} your orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{sit down}} carefully, <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> {{and you will}} be able to watch my people. It is the night of our regular hop--if you listen you can hear the {{orchestra}} tuning up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] called Curtis. [...] "Keep {{your people}} quiet <b>right</b> <b>where</b> they <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> must help me. I depend on you. You must not alarm them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, John," [...] said Mrs. Smiley. [...] "Them's {{the sentiments}} of a man, and I, as a woman having a <b>right</b> to speak <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> concerned, quite approve of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't ask; {{it is one}} who has a <b>right</b> {{to command}} <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> concerned. Be {{sure that it is}} kindly meant, though it may seem folly to us. Nay, don't be angry, laugh at it, as I do, and let me run away, please." ...|$|R
6000|$|Okanagan {{may have}} heard her, though the words were almost indistinguishable. [...] "You lie <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> for another ten minutes, and keep warm, miss," [...] he said; [...] "then I'll show you something." ...|$|E
6000|$|Happy Jack laughed. [...] "You're {{welcome to}} {{stay as long as}} you like, Unc' Billy," [...] he said. [...] "You better stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> and I'll go tell old Mrs. Possum where you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} man, who now {{took down the}} rifle from the wall. [...] "Not just yet. You're going to stop <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> The boys can do without me, and I'll keep you company." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sitting". He would lie in bed at night thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here we are!" [...] exclaimed Beatrice, as {{the train}} stopped, {{and at the same}} moment a loud voice called out, [...] "All <b>right!</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> Alex?" [...] upon which Alexander tumbled across Henrietta to feel for the handle of the carriage-door, replying, [...] "Here, old fellow, let us out. Have you brought Dumpling?" [...] And Uncle Geoffrey and Beatrice exclaimed, [...] "How d'ye do, Carey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've bowled {{him over}} right enough," [...] Dick smiled. [...] "I could not {{reconcile}} his staying on, under the circumstances, with what I knew of him. But with you not permitting him to go, and he as mad {{as a man}} has a <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> concerned, I can understand. He's {{a whole lot better}} than a good sort. They don't make many like him. He will make you happy--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Henry, {{and make}} {{yourself}} comfortable," [...] said Gif. [...] "As long as you're {{willing to do}} your share of the work around here, you shall have your share of whatever there is to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Grimes," [...] {{broke in}} the detective, sternly, [...] "you sit <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> I know you, and {{you ought to}} know me;" [...] and the detective took a step forward and looked the man full in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{need for}} you to rush," [...] drawled the man, much as if he enjoyed keeping the boys in suspense, [...] "for if you stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> you will see them. They've got to come back this way, sure." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the filming}} of Keith wrapped, McCartney began working on his second album, <b>Right</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want Me, co-writing {{all but one of}} the songs {{featured}} in it. <b>Right</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want Me <b>is</b> more mature than his debut, reflecting his musical and personal growth since he recorded his debut album at age 15. Released by Hollywood Records on September 19, 2006, the album reached number 14 on the Billboard 200. The lead single of the album, [...] "Right <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want Me", began receiving airplay on July 11, 2006. Although he did not launch a full tour, he did various promotional shows in Italy and the United States.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Whitefoot didn't {{appear at}} all anxious to go. She {{began to make}} excuses for staying <b>right</b> <b>where</b> they <b>were.</b> <b>You</b> see, she had a great love for that old home. They were sitting just outside the doorway talking about the matter when Whitefoot {{caught a glimpse of}} a swiftly moving form not far off. It was Shadow the Weasel. Neither of them breathed. Shadow passed without looking in their direction. When he was out of sight, Mrs. Whitefoot shivered.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{surviving}} prisoners arrived in Balanga, the overcrowded conditions and poor hygiene caused dysentery {{and other diseases}} to spread rapidly. The Japanese did not provide the prisoners with medical care, so U.S. medical personnel tended to the sick and wounded with few or no supplies. Upon arrival at the San Fernando railhead, prisoners were stuffed into sweltering, brutally hot metal box cars for the one-hour trip to Capas, in 110 F heat. At least 100 prisoners were pushed into each of the trains' unventilated boxcars. The trains had no sanitation facilities, and disease continued to take a heavy toll on the prisoners. According to Staff Sargent Alf Larson: The train consisted of six or seven World War I-era boxcars. … They packed us in the cars like sardines, so tight you couldn’t sit down. Then they shut the door. If you passed out, you couldn’t fall down. If someone {{had to go to}} the toilet, <b>you</b> went <b>right</b> there <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> It was close to summer and the weather was hot and humid, hotter than Billy Blazes! We were on the train from early morning to late afternoon without getting out. People died in the railroad cars.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, if you're {{telling the}} truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you may stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> {{and take}} care of my daughter. If she wants to climb {{mountains}} or shoot rapids, it's to be done; but you'll fix things so it can be done safely. You're in charge of this outfit, and not that major man." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Sally Steel, {{for it was}} my neighbor's sister, {{shouted to}} {{somebody}} through the window, {{and then turned to}} the man who rose from a corner. [...] "You just stay <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> When I call cookie I'll see he comes. I've been running this place as it ought to be run, and you won't know Gaspard's when you get about, Rancher Ormesby." ...|$|E
