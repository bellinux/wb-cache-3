5|$|Using a {{coronagraph}} on the Subaru {{telescope in}} Hawaii in 2005, astronomers {{were able to}} further constrain {{the size of a}} planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5–10 times the mass of Jupiter. The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric. No evidence was found of the blobs <b>reported</b> <b>earlier,</b> casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet. The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow-up observations by Hughes et al. (2012) and the Herschel Space Telescope.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, both new {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was <b>reported</b> <b>earlier</b> in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives.|$|E

40|$|Self-report is a time- and {{cost-efficient}} screening {{measure that}} {{has the potential to be}} useful as a stand-alone means of recruiting adults for participation in reading research. We report on a sample of university students (N = 46) recruited using the Adult Reading History Questionnaire – Revised, half of whom <b>reported</b> <b>early</b> difficulty with reading acquisition. As a group, those <b>reporting</b> <b>early</b> difficulty with reading had poorer current reading skills than those who did not. Some (n = 13) of those who <b>reported</b> <b>early</b> reading difficulty appear to have compensated for this. We conclude that self-report has the potential to be used as an effective screening measure in research targeting adults with a history of early reading difficulties. ISSN 1918 - 522...|$|R

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{characterization of}} line graphs was proven by [...] (and <b>reported</b> <b>earlier</b> without proof by [...] ). He {{showed that there}} are nine minimal graphs that are not line graphs, such that any graph {{that is not a}} line graph has one of these nine graphs as an induced subgraph. That is, a graph is a line graph if and only if no subset of its vertices induces one of these nine graphs. In the example above, the four topmost vertices induce a claw (that is, a complete bipartite graph K1,3), shown on the top left of the illustration of forbidden subgraphs. Therefore, by Beineke's characterization, this example cannot be a line graph. For graphs with minimum degree at least 5, only the six subgraphs in the left and right columns of the figure are needed in the characterization. Line graphs of multigraphs may be similarly characterized by three of Beineke's nine forbidden subgraphs.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{emergence}} of cardiovascular disease as {{a major cause of}} death in the Western world {{in the middle of the}} 20th century, the lipid hypothesis received greater attention. In the 1940s, a University of Minnesota researcher, Ancel Keys, postulated that the apparent epidemic of heart attacks in middle-aged American men was related to their mode of life and possibly modifiable physical characteristics. He first explored this idea in a group of Minnesota business and professional men that he recruited into a prospective study in 1947, the first of many cohort studies eventually mounted internationally. The men were followed through 1981 and the first major report appeared in 1963. After fifteen years follow-up, the study confirmed the results of larger studies that <b>reported</b> <b>earlier</b> on the predictive value for heart attack of several risk factors, blood pressure, blood cholesterol level, and cigarette smoking. Meanwhile, in the mid-1950s, with improved methods and design, Keys recruited collaborating researchers in seven countries to mount the first cross-cultural comparison of heart attack risk in populations of men engaged in traditional occupations in cultures contrasting in diet, especially in the proportion of fat calories of different composition, the Seven Countries Study still under observation today. Even before the study had begun, there had been criticism of its methods. Yerushalmy and Hilleboe pointed out that Keys had selected for the study the countries that would give him the results he wanted, while leaving out data from sixteen countries that would not. They also pointed out that Keys was studying a [...] "tenuous association" [...] rather than any possible proof of causation.|$|E
