40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{cultural}} challenge of Indo-Malay Archipelago in globalization context in remaking cultural identity. The Malayness as an instrument for remaking the shared identity of this community in global context refers to origins, language and cultural background and the values of Islam that undergoes a dynamic adaptation in global and local <b>contexts.</b> <b>Reconstructing</b> a <b>shared</b> language and collective memory as starting point is indeed necessary to fully recount the progressive unfolding of identity. The original cultural forms with which a social group came into existence set the parameters for its further development. Focusing on the relations between existing ethnic identities could only be interpreted with reference to their cultural starting points in past time. The formation of ethnic identity is affected by primordial and instrumental factors which reflected in narratives, performances and interethnic relation. In global context, the ethnic and foreign languages and local tradition already shaped, and would reshape ethnic identity {{of the people in}} the Straits of Melaka prior to the Western colonialism until global era. The reflection of this combination exists in ethno-poetic, language and cultural changes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResuming {{suspended}} {{activities is}} fundamental to knowledge work. As activities grow in complexity or fade from memory, they become increasingly difficult to cognitively resume. Motivated by the efficiency of images for cueing autobiographical memory, we conducted two studies of how visual histories of computer-mediated activity might aid users in restoring the mental context of suspended activities. In the first exploratory study we demonstrate that users provided a visual history consisting of small thumbnail images of their desktop can <b>reconstruct</b> detailed mental <b>contexts</b> of earlier computer work. In the second observational study we examine methods and cues that web developers, scientific writers, and graphic designers currently use to restore mental context. We find that participants from all three professions engage in situated sensemaking, <b>reconstructing</b> <b>context</b> by generating stories to explain cues in their documents with implicit meaning, such as sudden changes in writing quality or the shape of blocks of code. We identify characteristics of each activity that influence the information, artifacts, and strategies participants used to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>context.</b> We conclude that visual histories can help users <b>reconstruct</b> mental <b>context,</b> but that challenges remain in designing lightweight image-based cues that help users <b>reconstruct</b> <b>context</b> {{for a range of}} activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a {{word sense disambiguation}} method by <b>reconstructing</b> the <b>context</b> using the correlation between words. Firstly, we figure out the relevance between words though the statistical quantity(co-occurrence frequency, the average distance and the information entropy) from the corpus. Secondly, we see the words that have lager correlation value between ambiguous word than other words in the context as the important words, and use this kind of words to <b>reconstruct</b> the <b>context,</b> then we use the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>context</b> as the new context of the ambiguous words. In the end, we use the method of the sememe co-occurrence data[10] for word sense disambiguation. The experimental results have proved the feasibility of this method...|$|R

This article presents an in-depth analysis of <b>context</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviours that built up around use of the Hermes interactive office door display system received during deployment. The Hermes system provided a groupware application supporting asynchronous messaging facilities, analogous to a digital form of Post-it notes, in order to explore the use of situated display systems to support awareness and coordination in an office environment. From this analysis we distil a set of issues relating to <b>context</b> <b>sharing</b> ranging from privacy concerns to ease of use; each supported through qualitative data from user interviews and questionnaires...|$|R

With the recent proliferation of smart phones, they become useful tools to implement high-confidence cyber-physical systems. Among many applications, <b>context</b> <b>sharing</b> systems in mobile environment attract attention with the popularization of social media. Mobile <b>context</b> <b>sharing</b> systems can share more information than web-based social network services because they can {{use a variety of}} information frommobile sensors. To <b>share</b> high-level <b>contexts</b> such as activity, emotion, and user relationship, a user had to annotate them manually in previous works. This paper proposes a mobile <b>context</b> <b>sharing</b> system that can recognize high-level contexts automatically by using Bayesian networks based on mobile logs. We have developed a ContextViewer application which consists of a phonebook and a map browser to show the feasibility of the system. Experiments of evaluating Bayesian networks and performing the SUS test confirm that the proposed system is useful. 1...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{mobile phones}} {{in the near}} future will adapt their applications, services, and look-and-feel based on their usage and environment. This ability of the devices to adapt based on user’s context {{provides}} new challenges in areas of <b>context</b> <b>sharing,</b> <b>context</b> management, and in the associated area of privacy. Inadequate relationship models make control over disclosure impossible, which manifests itself in either sharing too much information- compromising ones privacy, or sharing too little- con-straining the use of <b>context</b> in a <b>shared</b> environment. In this paper, we define a new pseudo-hierarchical tag based relationship model to overcome the constraints of control over disclosure.

Similarly, a <b>shared</b> academic <b>background</b> increases the likelihood of matching between di¤erent venture capitalists by 42 % when they syndicate portfolio company investments. Finally, a <b>shared</b> academic <b>background</b> improves portfolio com-pany performance. For example, when an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist attended the same Top 3 academic institution, the likelihood that the investment will result in an initial public o¤ering or acquisition increases by 42 %. This is the incremental e¤ect of having attended the same Top 3 academic institution. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that <b>shared</b> academic <b>backgrounds</b> help reduce information gaps in the venture capital industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Complex Web-based {{information}} systems involving multiple entities and their dynamic mobile-based collaborations require efficient techniques for <b>context</b> information <b>sharing.</b> Sharing {{control is a}} requirement for preserving the privacy of personal <b>context</b> and <b>shared</b> <b>context.</b> Our <b>sharing</b> control mechanism is hybrid, based on sharing control rules defined by enterprise {{as well as by}} individuals users. Our complex scenario involves multiple entities which require prioritization and conflict handling mechanism for entities and their policy rules. This paper presents a sharing control model, Web servicesbased architecture and its implementation with a running example. The system is evaluated by comparing our hybrid sharing control policy with enterprise-defined role-based policy and shows effectiveness of our hybrid policy in collaborative information sharing environments.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the feature {{interaction}} problem arises primarily from <b>sharing</b> of <b>context</b> and hence features should be structured and analysed through a notation that makes context explicit. We support this argument with three sets of evidence. Firstly, we express feature interaction through Zave and Jackson’s entailment relation. With the entailment relation, we structure a feature as a relation between three sets of descriptions: requirement, context, and specification. We show that feature interactions arise due to <b>shared</b> <b>context.</b> Secondly, we examine the literature on sources of feature interactions and conclude that inconsistencies between requirements are ultimately manifested on <b>shared</b> <b>context.</b> Finally, we study feature interaction taxonomies and show that in the characterisation of feature interactions in taxonomies, <b>context</b> <b>sharing</b> is central...|$|R

30|$|Activity {{theory is}} not the only way to {{approach}} studies of work, but it does provide an efficient way to bootstrap one’s knowledge of a work context. It also helps designers identify specific work activities that deserve more intensive study, as through cognitive task analysis [41, 42]. Most importantly, however, activity theory helps technology developers build relationships with the people whose work they seek to impact: as Kuutti points out, activity theory “…aims at <b>reconstructing</b> <b>contexts</b> in practice so that people are not just objects or subordinate parts, but regain their role as creators” [43].
