His strategic sense justly leads him to see that the authority of the teachings of the synoptic Gospels, touching the nature of the spiritual world, turns upon the acceptance or the rejection of the Gadarene and other like stories.

5000|$|The Society {{said the}} {{denunciation}} of [...] "commercial Jews" [...] in the Declaration [...] "clearly did {{not refer to}} the Jewish people in general, and it is regrettable if it has been misunderstood and has given cause for any offense." [...] It explained that Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>rejected</b> antisemitic views, and that the [...] "high ideals" [...] they shared with the Nazis were those of family values and religious freedom.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Witnesses</b> <b>reject</b> the {{doctrine}} of universal salvation, {{as well as that}} of predestination or fate.

500|$|Washington {{was convicted}} and sentenced to 50 years in prison. His {{conviction}} was subsequently upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas's highest criminal court, in 1966. The Court of Criminal Appeals, which reasoned that the Compulsory Process Clause did not affect how the state treated the [...] "competency" [...] of a <b>witness,</b> <b>rejected</b> Washington's plea that Fuller should have been allowed to testify. Washington then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case, and the Supreme Court granted review.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} {{heard in the}} local court. In court, the man did not request a defense attorney, but he was given one, because the court felt he could not pursue his own {{interest}} and rights by himself. During the whole hearing, the man denied the charges. At one time, he told that gypsies had broken into his house shortly before Christmas 1960, but the theory was immediately <b>rejected.</b> Many <b>witnesses</b> told the court how Hilkka had complained about her husband hitting her, and her injuries. She had repeatedly visited the doctor because of her injuries. This was the best case, {{in addition to the}} evidence, that the prosecutor had in aid of him. One piece of evidence that was ignored was the husband's loans from the library: from April to December 1960, he had borrowed 75 crime fiction novels from the library, of which many were about murder, including the murder of one's wife.|$|R
50|$|In Christianity, a martyr, in {{accordance}} with the meaning of the original Greek martys in the New Testament, is one who brings a testimony, usually written or verbal. In particular, the testimony is that of the Christian Gospel, or more generally, the Word of God. A Christian witness is a biblical witness whether or not death follows. However, over time many Christian testimonies were <b>rejected,</b> and the <b>witnesses</b> put to death, and the word martyr developed its present sense. Where death ensues, the witnesses follow the example of Jesus in offering up their lives for truth.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary {{usage of}} the term bloodless surgery refers to both {{invasive}} and noninvasive medical techniques and protocols, and the phrase itself is somewhat confusing. The expression does not mean [...] "surgery that makes no use of blood or blood transfusion". Rather, it refers to surgery performed without transfusion of allogeneic blood. Champions of bloodless surgery do, however, transfuse products made from allogeneic blood and they also make use of pre-donated blood for autologous transfusion. Interest in bloodless surgery has arisen for several reasons. Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>reject</b> blood transfusions on religious grounds; others may be concerned about bloodborne diseases, such as hepatitis and AIDS.|$|R
50|$|However, not all {{of these}} Councils have been universally {{recognised}} as ecumenical. In addition, the Catholic Church also has convened numerous other councils which it deems as having the same authority, making a total of twenty-one Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church. The Assyrian Church of the East accepts only the first two, and Oriental Orthodoxy only three. Pope Sergius I rejected the Quinisext Council of 692 (see also Pentarchy). The Fourth Council of Constantinople of 869-870 and 879-880 is disputed by Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

50|$|Quarry {{grew up as}} {{a member}} of the Jehovah's Witnesses, which he later {{characterized}} as a cult that controls its members 24 hours a day. Quarry grew up in a sheltered lifestyle and did not even participate in organized sports until age 24, when he first became exposed to mixed martial arts. After a period of self-discovery, Quarry <b>rejected</b> his Jehovah's <b>Witness</b> upbringing, which caused him to become alienated from his family and former friends.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{according}} to Fishman, {{he participated in}} a conspiracy with church staff to deflect accusations of church involvement, by submitting fake documents and making false statements to his defense team.

Fishman pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of obstruction, and the court sentenced him on July 20, 1990 to five years imprisonment in the Butner Federal Correctional Institution. Fishman later claimed that the church hired Scientologist inmate Luis Martinez to kill him in prison. He was paroled in mid-1993.|$|R

Mameha catches on to it and warns her against it because of the kindness Nobu has shown her. She wants Sayuri to accept him as her danna and not end up like Hatsumomo did. She refuses and enlists Pumpkin's help to have Nobu catch her seemingly being intimate with the Colonel. However, because of her secret resentment of Sayuri, Pumpkin brings the Chairman instead, having full knowledge of Sayuri's feelings towards him. When Sayuri confronts her, Pumpkin coldly tells her that she did a lot of favors for her in the past and she stole her chances of being adopted by Mother.

Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion. Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1983, Israel {{issued an}} {{extradition}} request for Demjanjuk {{to stand trial}} on Israeli soil under the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law of 1950. Demjanjuk appealed his deportation with the case heard on 8 July 1985. During the appeal, {{the authenticity of the}} identity card was questioned when it was argued that the card's number, 1393, had been issued in June/July 1942 with the seal of SS Commissioner, Odilo Globocnik, who had in fact been dismissed from this post in March 1942 at which time his seal was destroyed. The three identity cards supplied by the KGB that the experts had used to compare their paper and ink with Demjanjuk's card to prove its authenticity were also disputed. Among other contentions such as graphic inconsistencies, the cards, all dated 1942, carried Waffen SS stamps despite their not taking control of the Trawniki until 1943. Two bore the signature of Corporal Teufel when he was at that time a sergeant while the other card, which had been issued earlier in the year when Teufel was still a corporal, had his rank listed as sergeant. The cards were also signed by Captain Hermann Hoefle, who was actually a major. The court ruled on this claim: the record before us lends no support to this very serious charge, and we <b>reject</b> it. <b>Witnesses</b> fully qualified to testify on the subject stated their opinions that the Trawniki documents were authentic. Even if this documentary evidence had been rejected, the eyewitness evidence alone was found sufficient.

2500|$|On 3 May 2009, an American man, {{identified}} as John Yettaw, swam across Inya Lake {{to her house}} uninvited and was arrested {{when he made his}} return trip three days later. He had attempted to make a similar trip two years earlier, but for unknown reasons was turned away. He later claimed at trial that he was motivated by a divine vision requiring him to notify her of an impending terrorist assassination attempt. On 13 May, Suu Kyi was arrested for violating the terms of her house arrest because the swimmer, who pleaded exhaustion, was allowed to stay in her house for two days before he attempted the swim back. Suu Kyi was later taken to Insein Prison, where she could have faced up to five years confinement for the intrusion. The trial of Suu Kyi and her two maids began on 18 May and a small number of protesters gathered outside. Diplomats and journalists were barred from attending the trial; however, on one occasion, several diplomats from Russia, Thailand and Singapore and journalists were allowed to meet Suu Kyi. The prosecution had originally planned to call 22 witnesses. It also accused John Yettaw of embarrassing the country. During the ongoing defence case, Suu Kyi said she was innocent. The defence was allowed to call only one witness (out of four), while the prosecution was permitted to call 14 <b>witnesses.</b> The court <b>rejected</b> two character <b>witnesses,</b> NLD members Tin Oo and Win Tin, and permitted the defence to call only a legal expert.

60|$|This, omitting many {{technical}} details, {{and much}} that is matter of more dispute than common, is a statement, rough, and as popular as possible, of the ideas expressed in Mr. Gurney's remarkable essay on hallucinations. {186} Here, then, we have a rude working notion of various ways in which hallucinations may be produced. But there are many degrees in being hallucinated, or enphantosme, as the old French has it. If {{we are interested in}} the most popular kind of hallucinations, ghosts and wraiths, we first discard like Le Loyer, the evidence of many kinds of witnesses, diversely but undeniably hallucinated. A man whose eyes are so vicious as habitually to give him false information is not accepted as a witness, nor a man whose brain is drugged with alcohol, nor a man whose 'central terminus' is abandoned to religious excitement, to remorse, to grief, to anxiety, to an apprehension of secret enemies, nor even to a habit of being hallucinated, though, like Nicolai, he knows that his visionary friends are unreal. Thus we would not listen credulously to a ghost story out of his own experience from a man whose eyes were untrustworthy, nor from a short-sighted man who had recognised a dead or dying friend on the street, nor from a drunkard. A tale of a vision of a religious character from Pascal, or from a Red Indian boy during his Medicine Fast, or even from a colonel of dragoons who fell at Prestonpans, might be interesting, but would not be evidence for our special purpose. The ghosts beheld by conscience-stricken murderers, by sorrowing widowers, by spiritualists in dark rooms, haunted by humbugs, or those seen by lunatics, or by children, or by timid people in lonely old houses, or by people who, though sane at the time, go mad twenty years later, or by sane people habitually visionary, these and many other ghosts, we must begin, like Le Loyer, by <b>rejecting.</b> These <b>witnesses</b> have too much cerebral activity at the wrong time and place. They start their hallucinations from the external terminus, the unhealthy organ of sense; from the morbid central terminus; or from some dilapidated cerebral station along the line. But, when we have, in a sane man's experience, say one hallucination whether that hallucination does, or does not coincide with a crisis in the life, or perhaps with the death of the person who seems to be seen, what are we to think? Or again, when several witnesses simultaneously have the same hallucination,--not to be explained as a common misinterpretation of a real object,--what are we to think? This is the true question of ghosts and wraiths. That apparitions, so named by the world, do appear, is certain, just as it is certain that visionary rats appear to drunkards in delirium tremens. But, as we are only to take the evidence of sane and healthy witnesses, who were neither in anxiety, grief, or other excitement, when they perceived their one hallucination, {{there seems to be a}} difference between their hallucinations and those of alcoholism, fanaticism, sorrow, or anxiety. Now the common mistakes in dealing with this topic have been to make too much, or to make too little, of the coincidences between the hallucinatory appearance of an absent person, and his death, or some other grave crisis affecting him. Too little is made of such coincidences by Dr. Hibbert, in his Philosophy of Apparitions (p. 231). He 'attempts a physical explanation of many ghost stories which may be considered most authentic'. So he says, but he only touches on three, the apparition of Claverhouse, on the night of Killiecrankie, to Lord Balcarres, in an Edinburgh prison; the apparition of her dead mother to Miss Lee, in 1662; and the apparition of his wife, who had born a dead child on that day in England, to Dr. Donne in Paris, early in the seventeenth century.|$|R
