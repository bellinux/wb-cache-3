50|$|A pocket square {{should always}} be worn with morning dress. They may be made from linen, cotton, or silk. Whilst a simple white linen square with <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> is classic, they may instead be a solid colour or {{patterned}} and should always complement the neckwear.|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric rolling of {{thin strip}} has become {{important}} {{due to a}} significant decrease of rolling force, which contributes to obtain the extremely thin strip, to reduce the rolling passes, and to save the energy by a decrease of anneal treatment. In asymmetric rolling of thin strip, <b>edges</b> of work <b>rolls</b> may contact and deform when no or small work roll bending force is applied. Work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact forms a new deformation feature. In this paper, the effects of initial thickness of strip and friction coefficient on the rolling pressure, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact length and strip crown during asymmetric rolling of thin strip with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact effect has been discussed, and the calculated rolling force with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact is compared with the measured value...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of {{cold rolling}} of thin strip with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact was {{performed}} using a developed modified influence function method. Surface roughness of the rolled strip {{on a cold}} rolling mill was characterized by a surface profilometer. <b>Roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact and related surface roughness transfer are discussed. The focus of this work on cold rolling of thin strip was to justify the roll bite contact mechanics and to analyse the friction in the roll bite {{and the effect of}} the friction on the strip profile and the surface finish. The work roll wear and its value are also discussed. The work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact affects the work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> wear significantly. The strip surface finish becomes better after rolling, and the calculated rolling forces are in good agreement with the measured values...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric rolling {{can reduce}} the {{thickness}} of rolled strip and rolling load significantly. In this paper, the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss was analysed theoretically and the rolling pressure, intermediate force between the work roll and backup roll, the work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force, the strip profile after rolling are obtained for this special asymmetric rolling. The rolling pressure, intermediate force, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force and the strip profile are compared for various roll speed ratios, reduction and friction coefficients. Simulation result shows that the roll speed ratio and reduction have significant influence on the profile of rolled strip, and the calculated rolling forces {{are consistent with the}} measured values. The effect of friction in the roll bite on mechanics of the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the cold}} rolling {{experiments}} of ultra thin steel strip {{were carried out}} on an experimental rolling mill. The cold rolling of ultra thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss was analysed theoretically, and the rolling force, intermediate force between the work roll and backup <b>roll,</b> the <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force, the strip shape after rolling are obtained for this special rolling, and they are compared for various reduction and friction coefficients. Simulation {{results show that the}} reduction has a significant influence on the shape of rolled strip, and the calculated rolling forces and strip profile are consistent with the measured values. The effect of friction in the roll bite on cold rolling of ultra thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss is also discussed.

40|$|A {{procedure}} to design blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> terminations for arbitrary rim shape compact range main reflectors is presented. The reflector may be center-fed or offset-fed. The design procedure {{leads to a}} reflector which has a continuous and smooth surface. This procedure also ensures small diffracted fields from the junction between the paraboloid and the blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> while satisfying certain constraints regarding the maximum height of the reflector and minimum operating frequency of the system. The prescribed procedure is used to design several reflectors {{and the performance of}} these reflectors is presented...|$|R
40|$|An {{influence}} function method {{has been developed}} to simulate the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip with work <b>roll</b> kiss at <b>edges.</b> The numerical simulation model was obtained based on the deformation compatibility of the roll system in rolling and lateral directions. The strip plastic deformation has been considered in the formulation, which is {{significantly different from the}} traditional theory of metal rolling. The rolling mechanics and crown of the strip with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss, which are new findings for cold rolling of thin strip, are obtained. A comparison of the rolling force, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force and the strip crown after rolling has been conducted for various cross shear regions in the roll bite. Results show that the calculated strip crown is in good agreement with Ameasured value, and the rolling force and strip crown decrease with an increase of cross shear regions, as well as the work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force and edge wear decrease. The friction also has an influence on the profile of the rolled thin strip...|$|R
40|$|Compact ranges offer many {{advantages}} over {{other types of}} ranges, {{and as a result}} much effort is being directed toward the improvement of their performance. The use of concave edge contours and blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> terminations to reduce the unwanted energy diffracted into the target zone from the termination of the main reflector is discussed. The proposed shaping of the edge contour minimizes the diffracted fields by virtue of reducing the spread factor; whereas, the blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> terminations reduce the diffracted fields by creating a smooth transition in the reflected field. Two design examples are treated in order to illustrate these concepts...|$|R

50|$|Introduced in June 2000, the {{redesigned}} American Series model added Schaller {{staggered tuning}} machines, a new neck shape with <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> and a 4-ply white pearloid pickguard. The body was changed from alder to poplar, and the finishes {{were limited to}} Black and 3-color Sunburst. Other features remained {{the same as the}} 1998 Hot Rodded model. Fender has since stopped making the American Nashville series although a limited number can still be found for purchase.|$|E
50|$|The M1942 {{design was}} a result of wartime demands. The <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> on the shell was eliminated, {{creating}} an unfinished edge along the rim. This edge slightly flared out, along the base of the skirt. The elimination of the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> expedited the manufacturing process and reduced the amount of metal used in each helmet. Shell paint colors were typically matte gray-green (Heer) or gray-blue (Luftwaffe), and the decals were eliminated in 1943 to speed up production and reduce the helmet's combat visibility. Greater manufacturing flaws were also observed in M1942 helmets made late in the war.|$|R
40|$|Multi-pass slab vertical-horizontal (V-H) {{rolling process}} with {{variable}} <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> shape have been simulated with explicit dynamic {{finite element method}} and updating geometric method. The distributions of plastic strain contour in slab during rolling process with different <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and under different rolling stage have been obtained. The results show that there exist two thin strain assembling zones in slab when the flat <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> is used, and there just exist one strain assembling zone in slab when the <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> with groove is used. And compared the deformation equality between flat <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> with groove, the later {{is better than the}} former, which supplies the theory prove to the slab deformation distribution during V-H rolling process and is helpful for predicting the slab texture...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric rolling is used {{to produce}} thinner strip, which can reduce rolling force significantly. When a thinner strip is rolled on a rolling mill, work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> may contact each other, which affects the {{mechanics}} of this special asymmetric rolling and the crown of the rolled strip. In this paper, the authors developed a numerical model to simulate this special rolling and obtained the rolling force, intermediate force, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact force, the crown of the rolled strip and the edge contact length. The effects of the initial thickness of strip and the friction variation at upper and lower work rolls on the rolling force and crown of the rolled strip are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Visually, a {{very sharp}} knife has an edge that {{is too small to}} see with the eye; it may even be hard or {{impossible}} to focus in a microscope. The shape near the edge can be highlighted by rotating the knife and watching changes in reflection. Nicks and <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> can also be seen, as the rolled edge provides a reflective surface, while a properly straightened edge will be invisible when viewed head-on.|$|E
