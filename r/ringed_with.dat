Ostrach itself lies almost at {{the northern end of}} this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a day or so later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages <b>ringed</b> <b>with</b> nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E

25|$|Dale Head {{is named}} for its {{position}} {{at the head of}} the Newlands Valley. This stretches away due north for three and a half miles before debouching into the floodplain of the Derwent between Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite Lake. The eastern wall of the valley is formed by the High Spy to Catbells ridge, separating it from Borrowdale. Entering on the western side are a series of side valleys which drain the main mass of the North Western Fells. The source of Newlands Beck does not however flow from the apex of Dale Head as might be supposed from the name. Instead it has its birth at the col between the main summit and the eastern top, High Scawdel (1,815ft). The northern face of the fell forming the dalehead is <b>ringed</b> <b>with</b> crags. The main faces are Dalehead Crags and Great Gable, not to be confused with the fell of that name.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortified}} camp at Sidi Omar was <b>ringed</b> <b>with</b> barbed wire, trenches and minefields. On 11 June 1940, the 11th Hussars in Rolls-Royce and Morris CS9 armoured cars {{closed up}} to the frontier wire, crossed during the night and exchanged fire with the garrison at Sidi Omar. Sidi Omar was captured on 16 December, during Operation Compass by the 7th Hussars, 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2nd RTR) and the 4th Royal Horse Artillery (4th RHA). After a bombardment, the British tanks charged the fort, one broke through the wall and after another tank drove through the hole, the garrison began to surrender. The Italians had concentrated their firepower on the east wall facing Egypt and had been surprised by an attack from the west. The fall of the fort left the way clear for the British to send reinforcements and supplies to the forces further north on the coast, free from the possibility of attack from the inland flank.|$|E
25|$|The Chief of the German General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn {{intended}} {{to split the}} British and French alliance in 1916 and end the war, before the Central Powers were crushed by Allied material superiority. To obtain decisive victory, Falkenhayn needed {{to find a way}} to break through the Western Front and defeat the strategic reserves, which the Allies could move into the path of a breakthrough. Falkenhayn planned to provoke the French into attacking, by threatening a sensitive point close to the existing front line. Falkenhayn chose to attack towards Verdun over the Meuse Heights, to capture ground which overlooked Verdun and make it untenable. The French would have to conduct a counter-offensive, on ground dominated by the German army and <b>ringed</b> <b>with</b> masses of heavy artillery, inevitably leading to huge losses and bringing the French army close to collapse. The British would have no choice but to begin a hasty relief-offensive, to divert German attention from Verdun but would also suffer huge losses. If these defeats were not enough, Germany would attack both armies and end the western alliance for good.|$|E
40|$|Red {{blood cell}} transfusions remain {{one of the}} {{cornerstones}} in supportive care of lower-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We hypothesized that patients develop oxidant mediated tissue injury through the formation of toxic iron species, caused either by red blood cell transfusions or by ineffective erythropoiesis. We analyzed serum samples from 100 lower-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes at six-month intervals for transferrin saturation, hepcidin- 25, growth differentiation factor 15, soluble transferrin receptor, non-transferrin bound iron and labile plasma iron in order to evaluate temporal changes in iron metabolism and presence of potentially toxic iron species {{and their impact on}} survival. Hepcidin levels were low in 34 patients <b>with</b> <b>ringed</b> sideroblasts compared to 66 patients without. Increases of hepcidin and non-transferrin bound iron levels were visible early in follow-up of all transfusion dependent patient groups. Hepcidin levels significantly decreased over time in transfusion independent patients <b>with</b> <b>ringed</b> sideroblasts. Increased soluble transferrin receptor levels in transfusion-independent patients <b>with</b> <b>ringed</b> sideroblasts confirmed the presence of ineffective erythropoiesis and suppression of hepcidin production in these patients. Detectable labile plasma iron levels in combination with high transferrin saturation levels occurred almost exclusively in patients <b>with</b> <b>ringed</b> sideroblasts and all transfusion dependent patient groups. Detectable labile plasma iron levels in transfusion dependent patients without ringed sideroblasts were associated with decreased survival. IN CONCLUSION: toxic iron species occurred in all transfusion dependent patients and in transfusion independent patients <b>with</b> <b>ringed</b> sideroblasts. Labile plasma iron appeared to be a clinically relevant measure for potential iron toxicity and a prognostic factor for survival in transfusion dependent patients.

25|$|The boats {{continued}} {{their search for}} Mavromicali's galley along the shore towards Cape Kitries. On 8 February, near Scardamoula, they sighted a vessel {{that appeared to be}} their quarry, but were unable to catch it before it took refuge in a port. Williams sent all his boats into the port to demand that the surrender of the galliot. The boats then left, having received a promise that Mavromicali would sail to Zante or Napoli di Romania the following morning. Not trusting Mavromicali's word, Zebra anchored only 300 yards from the galliot. When Williams tried to send a further message to Mavromicali, the emissaries were rebuffed and although Williams wanted to respond by seizing the galliot the seas were too rough. In the morning, Williams saw that the hills were <b>ringed</b> <b>with</b> armed men and when the British reminded Mavromicali of his agreement, the Governor made no reply. Eventually Zebra fired a carronade at the bow of the galley, dismounting one of the galliot's four guns. Mavromicalli agreed to give up his ship and the British then seized her. Zebra sailed on 10 February with her capture and arrived in Zante on the next evening.|$|E
25|$|According to Bernard Lewis {{and other}} scholars, the {{earliest}} verses of the Quran were largely sympathetic to Jews. Mohammed admired them as monotheists and {{saw them as}} natural adherents to the new faith and Jewish practices helped model early Islamic behavior, such as midday prayer, prayers on Friday, Ramadan fasting (modelled after the Jewish Yom Kippur fast on the tenth of the month of Tishrei), and most famously the fact that until 623 Muslims prayed toward Jerusalem, not Mecca. After his flight (al-hijra) from Mecca in 622 Mohammad with his followers settled in Yathrib, subsequently renamed Medina al-Nabi ('City of the Prophet') where he managed {{to draw up a}} 'social contract', widely referred to as the 'Constitution of Medina'. This contract, known as the Leaf (ṣaḥīfa) upheld the peaceful coexistence between Muslims, Jews and Christians, defining them all, under given conditions, as constituting the umma, or community of that city, and granting the latter freedom of religious thought and practice. Yathrib/Medina was not homogeneous. Alongside the 200 odd emigrants from Mecca (the Muhājirūn), who had followed Mohammad, its population consisted of the Faithful of Medina (Anṣār, 'the helpers'), Arab pagans, three Jewish tribes and some Christians. The foundational 'constitution' sought to establish, {{for the first time in}} history according to Ali Khan, a formal agreement guaranteeing interfaith conviviality, albeit <b>ringed</b> <b>with</b> articles emphasizing strategic cooperation in the defense of the city.|$|E
