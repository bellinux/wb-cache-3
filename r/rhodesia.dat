5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, <b>Rhodesia</b> (renamed from Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> after Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in <b>Rhodesia,</b> which had recently renamed itself the <b>Rhodesia</b> Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the <b>Rhodesia</b> Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession {{with the end of the}} federation).|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Southern <b>Rhodesia,</b> Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland formed the Federation of <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland in August 1953, Huggins became the amalgamated body's first Prime Minister. Salisbury was {{designated}} the Federal capital, and the United Party renamed itself the United <b>Rhodesia</b> Party. Garfield Todd {{took over as}} Southern Rhodesia's Prime Minister. Huggins headed the Federal government for three years, then retired in November 1956 after a combined 23 years as a national leader. The United <b>Rhodesia</b> Party merged with the Federal Party to become the United Federal Party (UFP) in November 1957, and the liberal Todd was voted out of office by the more right-wing members of his party four months later, in February 1958. He was replaced by Sir Edgar Whitehead. Todd led {{his own version of}} the United <b>Rhodesia</b> Party against the UFP and the Dominion Party in June the same year, but failed to win a single seat—the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, with the Dominion Party taking the remainder.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> a self-governing colony within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910. Following {{the intervention of the}} war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.|$|E

5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st <b>Rhodesia</b> Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd <b>Rhodesia</b> Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st <b>Rhodesia</b> Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved {{that they might have}} to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd <b>Rhodesia</b> Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd <b>Rhodesia</b> Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern <b>Rhodesia,</b> were also attached to the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Born in Salisbury, Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner {{mother and}} a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to Northern <b>Rhodesia,</b> became {{involved}} with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded {{in the formation of}} the Federation of <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to apartheid South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{application}} by the British colony of Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> to the International Olympic Committee, {{the country was}} allowed to compete as an independent nation for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This {{was one of two}} British Crown colonies that were permitted to participate independently that year, the other being Malta. Southern <b>Rhodesia,</b> as it was known at the time, competed under the name of <b>Rhodesia.</b> Two athletes from Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> were selected to compete in the 1928 games, both in boxing; Cecil Bissett in the lightweight and Leonard Hall in the welterweight weight division. This was the least number of athletes sent to a Summer Olympics by <b>Rhodesia,</b> and from the 1980 Summer Olympics as Zimbabwe.|$|E

5|$|In April 1972 Van der Byl {{sparked a}} row over the {{agreement}} which <b>Rhodesia</b> and the United Kingdom {{had made in}} November 1971. Under this agreement, <b>Rhodesia</b> had agreed to certain concessions to African nationalism {{in return for the}} prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the agreement was to be delayed until the Pearce Commission reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of <b>Rhodesia.</b> Van der Byl insisted that <b>Rhodesia</b> would not implement any part of the agreement unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the European, Asian and Coloured (mixed race) populations of <b>Rhodesia</b> were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside <b>Rhodesia</b> had hoped that the government would implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported against it.|$|E
5|$|Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> did {{not appear}} at the Olympics again until 1960, {{although}} Rhodesian athletes {{had the option of}} competing internationally for South Africa. Leonard Hall, for example, won a gold medal in the welterweight division of the 1930 British Empire Games under the South African banner. By the time of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> was part of the Federation of <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland (which included what is now Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) that entered the Games under the banner of <b>Rhodesia.</b> Fourteen athletes — nine men and five women — took part in six sports: track and field, boxing, diving, sailing, shooting, and swimming. Competing in the Flying Dutchman class, sailors Alan David Butler and Christopher Bevan finished fourth, which was Rhodesia's best result under that name. After the Federation dissolved in 1963, Nyasaland became Malawi, while Northern and Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> began competing separately. The North entered the Games as Northern <b>Rhodesia,</b> but left under the flag of Zambia, while the South remained Southern <b>Rhodesia.</b> It sent 25 men (including its field hockey squad) and four women; both the field hockey team and the Flying Dutchman crew finished 11th, while no individual athlete placed better than 17th.|$|E

5|$|The flag of Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> was a blue ensign, later {{changed to}} a sky-blue ensign, with the coat of arms of Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> on it. The flag was in use in Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> (later Zimbabwe) during 1923–53 and 1963–65. It was also used by the unrecognised <b>Rhodesia</b> between 1965 and 1968. The flag was {{initially}} used unofficially internally before being approved for use outside of the colony by the Colonial Office in 1937. The colour was changed to sky blue in 1964 to protest the treatment of Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> after its inclusion in the failed Federation of <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland.|$|E

5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern <b>Rhodesia.</b> Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern <b>Rhodesia.</b> There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E

5|$|Copperbelt was a {{province}} in Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> which was rich in deposits of the mineral. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, {{was the leading}} light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered large copper deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed the boundary between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North-Eastern <b>Rhodesia</b> and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed {{the boundary between the}} BSAC-administered territory of North-Western <b>Rhodesia</b> (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although the boundary with Angola was not marked on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern <b>Rhodesia</b> and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western <b>Rhodesia</b> and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern <b>Rhodesia</b> was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and the boundary between North-Western <b>Rhodesia</b> and Southern <b>Rhodesia</b> became the Zambezi River in 1898. Northern <b>Rhodesia</b> was under BSAC control until 1924, when it became part of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland.

After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.|$|E
