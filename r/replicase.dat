5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA <b>replicase</b> enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
25|$|During their research, Eigen and Schuster also {{considered}} types of protein and nucleotide coupling other than hypercycles. One such alternative {{was a model}} with one <b>replicase</b> that performed polymerase functionality {{and that was a}} translational product of one of the RNA matrices existing among the quasispecies. This RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysed the replication of sequences that had specific motifs recognized by this <b>replicase.</b> The other RNA matrices, or just one of their strands, provided translational products which had specific anticodons and were responsible for unique assignment and transportation of amino acids.|$|E
25|$|Another model {{based on}} {{cellular}} automata, {{taking into account}} a simpler replicating network of continuously mutating parasites and their interactions with one <b>replicase</b> species, was proposed by Takeuchi and Hogeweg and exhibited an emergent travelling wave pattern. Surprisingly, travelling waves not only proved to be stable against moderately strong parasites, if the parasites' mutation rate is not too high, but the emergent pattern itself was generated {{as a result of}} interactions between parasites and <b>replicase</b> species. The same technique was used to model systems that include formation of complexes. Finally, hypercycle simulation extending to three dimensions showed the emergence of the three-dimensional analogue of a spiral wave, namely, the scroll wave.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{years of}} study, {{it is still}} not clear how life emerged from inanimate matter and evolved into the complex forms that we observe today. One of the most {{recognized}} hypotheses for the origins of life, the RNA World hypothesis, assumes that life was sparked by prebiotic replicating RNA chains. In this paper, we address the problems caused by the interplay between hypothetical prebiotic RNA <b>replicases</b> and RNA parasitic species. We consider the coexistence of parasite RNAs and RNA <b>replicases</b> as well as the impact of parasites on the further evolution of <b>replicases.</b> For these purposes, we used multi-agent modeling techniques that allow for realistic assumptions regarding the movement and spatial interactions of modeled species. The general model used in this study is based on work by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. Our results confirm that the coexistence of parasite RNAs and <b>replicases</b> is possible in a spatially extended system, even if we take into consideration more realistic assumptions than Takeuchi and Hogeweg. However, we also showed that the presence of trade-off that takes into the account an RNA folding process could still pose a serious obstacle to the evolution of replication. We conclude that this might be a cause for one of the greatest transitions in life that took place early in evolution-the separation of the function between DNA templates and protein enzymes, with a central role for RNA species...|$|R
40|$|According {{to current}} models, dimeric DNA Polymerases {{coordinate}} the replication of DNA leading and lagging strands. However, it was recently shown that trimeric DNA Polymerases, assembled in vitro, replicate the lagging strand {{more efficiently than}} dimeric <b>replicases.</b> Here we show that the τ, α, ε, and θ subunits of Escherichia coli DNA Polymerase III can be assembled in vivo, yielding the trimeric τ 3 α 3 ε 3 θ 3 complex. Further, we propose a molecular model of this complex, whose catalytic action was investigated using model DNA substrates. Our observations indicate that trimeric DNA <b>replicases</b> reduce the gap between leading and lagging strand synthesis...|$|R

The concept of recombination of viral RNA with transgene products is critically analyzed and potential risks associated with commercialization of transgenic plants with viral inserts and its effects on bio-safety, are highlighted...|$|R
25|$|Recombinant alphavirus-based vectors {{have been}} used to improve DNA {{vaccination}} efficiency. The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus replicon, replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural <b>replicase</b> genes intact. The Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus {{have been used}} to build recombinant alphavirus replicons. Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells and are only transiently expressed. Alphavirus <b>replicase</b> genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it {{may be due to the}} high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.|$|E
25|$|For {{translation}} to occur, eukaryotic mRNAs {{require a}} 5' Cap structure. This means that viruses {{must also have}} one. This normally consists of 7MeGpppN where N is normally adenine or guanine. The viruses encode a protein, normally a <b>replicase,</b> with a methyltransferase activity to allow this.|$|E
25|$|In virology, {{the term}} {{may also be}} used when {{referring}} to mRNA synthesis from an RNA molecule (i.e., RNA replication). For instance, the genome of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA -) virus may be template for a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA +). This is because the positive-sense strand contains the information needed to translate the viral proteins for viral replication afterwards. This process is catalyzed by a viral RNA <b>replicase.</b>|$|E
40|$|Copy-choice RNA {{recombination}} {{occurs during}} viral RNA synthesis when the viral transcription complex switches templates. We demonstrate that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from bovine viral diarrhea virus and the <b>replicases</b> from three plant-infecting RNA viruses can produce easily detectable recombination products in vitro by switching templates during elongative RNA synthesis. Template sequence and/or structure, and NTP availability affected {{the frequency of}} template switch by the transcription complex. Our results provide biochemical support for copy-choice recombination and establish assays for mechanistic analyses of intermolecular RNA recombination in vitro...|$|R
50|$|The {{isolation}} of enzymes from infected tissue {{can also provide}} {{the basis of a}} biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease. For example, humans can make neither RNA <b>replicases</b> nor reverse transcriptase, and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections. The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection, although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function.|$|R
50|$|Biochemical {{and genetic}} {{analyses}} {{showed that the}} enzyme systems that replicate viral RNA molecules (reverse transcriptases and RNA <b>replicases)</b> lack molecular proofreading (3' to 5' exonuclease) activity, and that RNA sequences do not benefit from extensive repair systems analogous to those that exist for maintaining and repairing DNA sequences. Consequently, RNA genomes appear {{to be subject to}} significantly higher mutation rates than DNA genomes. For example, mutations in HIV-1 that lead to the emergence of viral mutants that are insensitive to antiviral drugs are common, and constitute a major clinical challenge.|$|R
25|$|Some viruses use the {{production}} of subgenomic RNAs to ensure the translation of all proteins within their genomes. In this process the first protein encoded on the genome, and this {{the first to be}} translated, is a <b>replicase.</b> This protein will act {{on the rest of the}} genome producing negative strand sub-genomic RNAs then act upon these to form positive strand sub-genomic RNAs that are essentially mRNAs ready for translation.|$|E
25|$|Within minutes, {{bacterial}} ribosomes start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, RNA <b>replicase</b> is synthesized {{early in}} the process. Proteins modify the bacterial RNA polymerase so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host’s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on {{to become part of}} new virions within the cell, helper proteins that help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Walter Fiers (University of Ghent, Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of bacteriophage MS2 (1976).|$|E
25|$|Replication {{machineries}} {{consist of}} factors involved in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In {{most of the}} bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called replisomes or DNA <b>replicase</b> systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.|$|E
40|$|According to {{classical}} evolutionary theory, phenotypic variation originates from random mutations that {{are independent of}} selective pressure. However, recent findings suggest that organisms have evolved mechanisms to influence the timing or genomic location of heritable variability. Hypervariable contingency loci and epigenetic switches increase the variability of specific phenotypes; error-prone DNA <b>replicases</b> produce bursts of variability in times of stress. Interestingly, these mechanisms seem to tune the variability of a given phenotype to match the variability of the acting selective pressure. Although these observations do not undermine Darwin’s theory, they suggest that selection and variability are less independent than once thought...|$|R
40|$|DNA <b>replicases</b> stall at lesions during replication, {{potentially}} {{leading to}} genome instability. However, cells use specialized lesion bypass polymerases to restart stalled replisomes. Although most organisms possess these damage tolerance polymerases, capable of traversing blocking DNA lesions, many appear to lack these enzymes. We {{have discovered that}} replicative primases from archaea, previously considered to be solely involved in priming replication, are also capable of performing translesion DNA synthesis. This discovery has major implications for our understanding of additional roles of DNA primases during replication and the subsequent evolution of related lesion bypass pathways in eukaryotic organisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to apply a}} new criterion, the template specificity of RNA <b>replicases</b> of Escherichia coli RNA phages, for the grouping of these phages. Based on the template specificity, it was shown that (a) Qβ, VK, and ST belonged to one group (group III), and SP and FI to another group (group IV), and (b) some similarity existed between groups III and IV. Considering such template specificity in addition to previously reported properties of phage particles, we could separate RNA phages into four major groups (I-IV) with subgroups a, b, and c in group III, and subgroups a and b in group IV...|$|R
25|$|Factors {{supporting}} {{an important}} role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least {{the components of the}} RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. Such <b>replicase</b> RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Jack W. Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential for self-replication. If these conditions were present, Darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. Such autocatalytic systems of RNA capable of self-sustained replication have been identified. The RNA replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other's synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. In evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. This was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system.|$|E
2500|$|These {{factories}} then facilitate transcription {{and subsequent}} {{translation of the}} viral proteins. Transcription of viral genes must be initiated by association of the L protein with the three nucleocapsid species. In addition to transcriptase and <b>replicase</b> functions, the viral L protein is also thought to have an endonuclease activity that cleaves cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) {{for the production of}} capped primers used to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. As a result of this [...] "cap snatching," [...] the mRNAs of hantaviruses are capped and contain nontemplated 5' terminal extensions.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene Koonin said, [...] "Despite {{considerable}} {{experimental and}} theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently {{exist for the}} origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account {{for the emergence of}} an efficient RNA <b>replicase</b> or the translation system. The MWO [...] version of the cosmological model of eternal inflation could suggest {{a way out of this}} conundrum because, in an infinite multiverse with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable." ...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal <b>replicases</b> of {{cellular}} organisms utilize a ring shaped protein that encircles DNA as a mobile tether for high processivity in DNA synthesis. These “sliding clamps ” have sufficiently large linear diameters to encircle duplex DNA and are perhaps even {{large enough to}} slide over certain DNA secondary structural elements. This report examines the Escherichia coli b and human proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamps {{for their ability to}} slide over various DNA secondary struc-tures. The results show that these clamps are capable of traversing a 13 -nucleotide ssDNA loop, a 4 -base pair stem-loop, a 4 -nucleotide 5 * tail, and a 15 -mer bubble within the duplex. However, upon increasing the size of these structures (20 -nucleotide loop, 12 -base pair stem-loop, 28 -nucleotide 5 * tail, and 20 -nucleotide bubble) th...|$|R
40|$|Viruses {{associated}} with wild orchids and their mycorrhizal fungi are poorly studied. Using a shotgun sequencing approach, we identified eight novel endornavirus-like genome sequences from isolates of Ceratobasidium fungi isolated from pelotons within root cortical cells of wild indigenous orchid species Microtis media, Pterostylis sanguinea and an undetermined species of Pterostylis in Western Australia. They represent the first endornaviruses {{to be described}} from orchid mycorrhizal fungi and from the Australian continent. Five of the novel endornaviruses were detected from one Ceratobasidium isolate collected from one Pterostylis plant. The partial and complete viral <b>replicases</b> shared low (9 – 30 %) identities {{with one another and}} with endornaviruses described from elsewhere. Four had genome lengths greater than those of previously described endornaviruses, two resembled ascomycete-infecting endornaviruses, and unlike currently described endornaviruses, three had two open reading frames. The unusual features of these new viruses challenge current taxonomic criteria for membership of the family Endornaviridae...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Y-Family DNA polymerases {{specialize}} in translesion syn-thesis, bypassing damaged bases {{that would otherwise}} block the normal progression of replication forks. Y-Family polymerases have unique structural features {{that allow them to}} bind damaged DNA and use a modified template base to direct nucleotide incorporation. Each Y-Family polymerase is unique and has different preferences for lesions to bypass and for dNTPs to incorporate. Y-Family polymerases are also characterized by a low catalytic efficiency, a low processivity, and a low fidelity on normal DNA. Recruitment of these specialized polymerases to replication forks is therefore regulated. The catalytic center of the Y-Family polymerases is highly conserved and homologous to that of high-fidelity and high-processivity DNA <b>replicases.</b> In this review, structural differences between Y-Family and A- and B-Family polymerases are compared and correlated with their functional differences. A time-resolved X-ray crystallographic study of the DNA synthesis reaction catalyzed by the Y-Family DNA polymerase human polymerase η revealed transient elements that led to the nucleotidyl-transfe...|$|R

When the mRNA transcript only encodes one gene, it is monocistronic. A coronavirus non-structural protein provides extra fidelity to replication because it confers a proofreading function, which is lacking in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes alone.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA metamobilome {{is defined}} as a metagenome of {{circular}} genetic elements within a certain community. Metagenomic analyses of plasmids provide insights into the composition and structure of environmental plasmid communities. It is a promising method that will provide information about the types of plasmids that are present within environmental samples, and will give overviews about occurrences of plasmids as well as accessory genetic elements carried on these plasmids. A metamobilome library was constructed by combining multiple displacement amplification with pyrosequencing. This method provided a fast, efficient and unbiased strategy to investigate the communal gene pool of circular genetic elements (the metamobilome). We compared our wastewater metamobilome library with a wastewater metagenome library, against chromosomes, plasmids, phages and IS element databases, respectively. This showed that very few strictly chromosomal reads were present in our metamobilome library. Furthermore, data analysis showed that our library was strongly enriched for genes encoding plasmid-selfish traits, such as stability and conjugation, and most strikingly several hundred new putative plasmid <b>replicases</b> have been recovered...|$|R
40|$|En libre-accès sur Archimer : [URL] audienceDNA {{replication}} in Archaea, as {{in other}} organisms, involves large protein complexes called replisomes. In the Euryarchaeota subdomain, only two putative <b>replicases</b> have been identified, and their roles in leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis are still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the coupling of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -loading mechanisms with DNA polymerase function in the Euryarchaea Pyrococcus abyssi. PCNA spontaneously loaded onto primed DNA, and replication factor C dramatically increased this loading. Surprisingly, the family B DNA polymerase (Pol B) also increased PCNA loading, probably by stabilizing the clamp on primed DNA via an essential motif. In contrast, on an RNA-primed DNA template, the PCNA/Pol B complex was destabilized {{in the presence of}} dNTPs, allowing the family D DNA polymerase (Pol D) to perform RNA-primed DNA synthesis. Then, Pol D is displaced by Pol B to perform processive DNA synthesis, at least on the leading strand...|$|R
40|$|The {{replication}} complexes of all positive strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes {{are associated}} with membranes. In the case of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), the main determinant of membrane attachment {{seems to be the}} virus-encoded non-structural protein NSP 1, the capping enzyme of the viral mRNAs, which has guanine- 7 -methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities. We show here that both enzymatic activities of SFV NSP 1 are inactivated by detergents and reactivated by anionic phospholipids, especially phosphatidylserine. The region of NSP 1 responsible for binding to membranes as well as to liposomes was mapped to a short segment, which is conserved in the large alphavirus-like superfamily of viruses. A synthetic peptide of 20 amino acids from the putative binding site competed with in vitro synthesized NSP 1 for binding to liposomes containing phosphatidylserine.

40|$|The {{chemical}} identity {{and integrity of}} the genome is challenged by the incorporation of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) in place of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) during replication. Misincorporation {{is limited by the}} selectivity of DNA <b>replicases.</b> We show that accumulation of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) in the genome causes replication stress and has toxic consequences, particularly in the absence of RNase H 1 and RNase H 2, which remove rNMPs. We demonstrate that postreplication repair (PRR) pathways—MMS 2 -dependent template switch and Pol ζ-dependent bypass—are crucial for tolerating the presence of rNMPs in the chromosomes; indeed, we show that Pol ζ efficiently replicates over 1 – 4 rNMPs. Moreover, cells lacking RNase H accumulate mono- and polyubiquitylated PCNA and have a constitutively activated PRR. Our findings describe a crucial function for RNase H 1, RNase H 2, template switch, and translesion DNA synthesis in overcoming rNTPs misincorporated during DNA replication, and may be relevant for the pathogenesis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Y-family DNA polymerases have spacious active {{sites that}} can {{accommodate}} {{a wide variety}} of geometric distortions. As a consequence, they are considerably more error-prone than high-fidelity <b>replicases.</b> It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the in vivo activity of these polymerases is tightly regulated, so as to minimize their inadvertent access to primer-termini. We report here that one such mechanism employed by human cells relies on a specific and direct interaction between DNA polymerases ι and η with ubiquitin (Ub). Indeed, we show that both polymerases interact noncovalently with free polyUb chains, as well as mono-ubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ub-PCNA). Mutants of polι (P 692 R) and polη (H 654 A) were isolated that are defective in their interactions with polyUb and Ub-PCNA, whilst retaining their ability to interact with unmodified PCNA.
