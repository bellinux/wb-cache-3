Regarding the laser-ultrasonic testing, surface acoustic wave generated and detected by lasers is used to detect surface-breaking cracks. As the benefits of broad-band feature of the laser-ultrasonics, this method allows to detect very small cracks having the depth of less than 0. 1 mm. Also, a frequency response analysis technique of the surface acoustic wave, which propagates through the crack, is developed to size {{the depth of the}} crack. The error of this depth measurement method is estimated at less than 0. 2 mm through a series of experiments using stress corrosion cracking. A part of the laser-based maintenance system has been already applied to the actual maintenance works in Japanese nuclear power plants. The developed system and its operation are presented.

In this study, the pyrolysis behavior of different coal moisture contents and the reaction mechanism were investigated in an indirectly heated fixed-bed <b>reactor</b> with <b>internals.</b> The results showed that, at a furnace temperature of 900 degrees C, the increased coal moisture content went from 0. 41 to 11. 68 wt % and significantly modified the temperature fields, thereby prolonging the pyrolysis time to reach 500 degrees C and then enhancing the condensation and trapping of the coal at the bed center.

This study is furthered to optimize the operating conditions {{by focusing on the}} reaction pressure to enhance the yield and quality of shale oil in the fixed bed <b>reactor</b> with <b>internals.</b> Reducing the pyrolysis pressure increased the shale oil yield in comparison with the pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure. This influence due to reducing reaction pressure appeared to be higher in the <b>reactor</b> with <b>internals</b> than in the <b>reactor</b> without any <b>internals.</b> Moreover, there were higher yield of aliphatic components and fewer aromatic species in the <b>reactor</b> with <b>internals,</b> essentially indicating the suppressed secondary reactions to the produced primary shale oil in the new reactor.

Consequently, there is actually some synergistic effect between internals and reducing pressure so that adopting internals and using vacuum condition can grant the indirectly heated fixed bed reactor great potential to achieve high yield and high quality of shale oil in oil shale pyrolysis.

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to characterizing the coal {{pyrolysis}} performance based on field effects in five fixed bed reactors with different radiuses. The {{results showed that the}} increased reactor radius raised the coal bed thickness, thereby modifying the temperatures and extending the reaction time to reach 500 degrees C. At a furnace temperature of 900 degrees C, the increased coal bed thickness from 20 mm to 100 mm decreased the tar yield from 7. 24 wt% to 5. 62 wt%, while it raised the light tar content from 76. 4 wt% to 83. 0 wt% in the <b>reactor</b> with <b>internals</b> (<b>reactor</b> B). In contrast, in the <b>reactor</b> without <b>internals</b> (<b>reactor</b> A), the tar yield varied marginally and remained at 4. 73 wt% but the light tar content increased from 69. 5 wt% to 74. 7 wt%. The increased coal bed thickness resulted in an increase in the tar quality but a decrease in the gas HHV (higher heating value) for both reactors. However, with the increase of coal bed thickness, reactor B always provides a higher yield and quality of tar and gas but lower pyrolysis water yield than reactor A, indicating that the internals suppressed the secondary reaction of pyrolysis products and the increase in coal bed thickness did not weaken this advantage of internals. The char HHV located {{in the center of the}} <b>reactor</b> with <b>internals</b> was higher than that of the reactor without internals; this was postulated that the pyrolysis products escaped from the central low-temperature coal bed, which enhanced carbon deposition. As expected, EDS results proved the postulation and showed that the char in the center of the reactor B had more carbon species. In addition, the color changes of quartz sand in the before and after tests first verified the flow field of pyrolysis products in phenomenology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
