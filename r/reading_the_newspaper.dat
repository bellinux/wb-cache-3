5|$|He {{wore the}} #3 jersey for the New York Yankees in 1947, {{and was one}} of the last players to wear it before it was retired in honor of Babe Ruth the {{following}} year. On December 11, 1947, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree. To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Wally Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was a sore arm from the previous season, to which Clark responded that <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, an {{attorney}} from the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's office was <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper,</b> which reported {{the success of}} a certain Rolf Mulka, a bronze-medal-winning yachtsman, at the Rome Olympics. The prosecutor, who had been investigating Auschwitz since 1959, recognized the relatively uncommon name and investigated Rolf's father. His suspicion was correct, and Robert Mulka was arrested in November 1960. He was remanded in custody from then until March 1961, from May until December 1961, from February until October 1964, and then from December 1964.|$|E

25|$|Before {{his third}} year of college, Reeve took a three-month leave of absence. He flew to Glasgow and saw {{theatrical}} productions throughout the United Kingdom. He {{was inspired by the}} actors and often had conversations with them in bars after the performances. He helped actors at the Old Vic with their American accents by <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> aloud for them. He then flew to Paris, where he spoke fluent French for his entire stay; he had studied it from third grade until his second year in Cornell. He watched many performances and immersed himself in the culture before finally returning to New York to reunite with his girlfriend.|$|E
25|$|When Chelsea was {{two years}} old, she {{accompanied}} her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race. She learned {{to read and write}} at a very young age. Chelsea claims that she started <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five years old. In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, where Nazi soldiers were buried. Chelsea attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools. She skipped the third grade.|$|E
25|$|Since 2005, Abdul-Jabbar {{has served}} as special {{assistant}} coach for the Lakers. Abdul-Jabbar had been interested in coaching since his retirement, and given the influence he had on the league, {{he thought that the}} opportunity would present itself. However, during his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation of being introverted and sullen. He did not speak to the press, leading to the impression that he disliked them. In his biography My Life, Magic Johnson recalls instances when Abdul-Jabbar brushed him off when Magic (as a ball boy) asked for his autograph, Abdul-Jabbar froze out reporters who gave him a too enthusiastic handshake or even hugged him, and refused to stop <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> while giving an interview.|$|E

25|$|Successful {{therapeutic}} {{relationships between}} nurses and patients {{need to have}} positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses. Minor activities such as shopping, <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> together, or taking lunch/dinner breaks with patients can {{improve the quality of}} support provided. Physical support may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch. Patients described feelings of connection when the psychiatric nurses hugged them or put a hand on their shoulder. Psychiatric/mental health nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand. Patients with depression described relief when the psychiatric nurse embraced them. Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual feelings with the psychiatric nurses.|$|E
500|$|In a hotel lobby, the {{concierge}} answers {{a phone call}} from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper.</b> After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room– pausing to play the opening bars of the song [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" [...] by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system– and runs a bath.|$|E
500|$|Well liked in Montreal, Vézina {{was often}} seen as the best player on the ice for the Canadiens, and was {{respected}} by his teammates, who considered him the spiritual leader of the team. Referred to as [...] "le Concombre de Chicoutimi" [...] (the [...] "Chicoutimi Cucumber") for his cool demeanour on the ice, he was also known as [...] "l'Habitant silencieux" [...] (the [...] "silent Habitant", Habitant being a nickname for the Canadiens), a reference to his reserved personality. He often sat {{in a corner of}} the team's dressing room alone, smoking a pipe and <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper.</b> When news of Vézina's death was announced, newspapers across Quebec paid tribute to the goalie with articles about his life and career. Hundreds of Catholic masses were held in honour of the devout Vézina, and more than 1,500 people filled the Chicoutimi cathedral for his funeral.|$|E

[...] Both guards from the freight trains had also entered the signal box, {{and there was some}} discussion of the war news reported in the newspaper. Shortly afterwards, because the local train had stood on the main line for over three minutes, pursuant to Rule 55 its driver sent fireman, George Hutchinson to the box, although he left at 6.46 am, having failed to fully perform the required duties (see Rules breaches).|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth, meanwhile, rehearsed for the {{upcoming}} day with her maids of honour, a sheet used {{in place of the}} velvet train and an arrangement of chairs standing in for the carriage. So that she could become accustomed to its feel and weight, the Queen also wore the Imperial State Crown while she went about her daily business, sporting it at her desk, at tea and while <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper.</b> Elizabeth took part in two full rehearsals at Westminster Abbey, on 22 and 29 May, though other sources assert that the Queen attended either [...] "several" [...] rehearsals or one.

2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E
