These two normalization  methods (described in chapter 3) are used to analyse the contribution of each segment of the core having different regions (fuel, clad, coolant, moderator and channel box) to the RCs. All the calculations in this work are performed using PSG 2 / Serpent – a Continuous-energy Monte Carlo Reactor Physics Burnup Calculation Code. The overall <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficient's</b> values are exactly the same for both methodologies, but the partial <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> are totally differing from each other. Using the symmetric normalization methodology introduced in chapter 3 section 3. 4. 3 the partial <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> become almost the same for both methodologies. Moreover, the overall <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> are exactly the same as well. Methodologies for reducing the radiotoxicity of the actinides and fission products produced in nuclear fuels are presently under investigation. Therefore, currently the nuclear reactors are designed not only for power generation, but also are used as transmuters as well, by inserting, for example, the minor actinide to a reactor core the safety parameters can get worse.

50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficient</b> less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E

Control rods worth calculation is used to specify safety margin of reactor. Temperature <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fuel and coolant {{are one of the}} inherent factors that can control reactor power. This study has been done about control rod worth calculation and temperature <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> of a VVRS- 2 MWth reactor. The reactor core has been simulated by using WIMSDB 5 and CITATION-LDI 2 codes to perform neutronic calculations. The WIMSDB 5 code solves neutron transport equation and obtains macroscopic cross-sections (Winfrith, 1982). The CITATION-LDI 2 code solves diffusion equation for the reactor core (Winfrith, 1972). These two codes were linked by an interface that has been programmed with DELPHI (Winfrith, 1998). The rod worth and <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> are calculated considering burn-up calculations. The burn-up calculation is performed with WIMSDB 5 code.

At the same time <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficients</b> are insensitive to location of annular coolant channel radius changes. Restrictions for fuel enrichment (IAEA requirements) coupled with geometry restrictions of annular channel listed above (impossible to remove the thermal power or significant increasing of heat exchangers height) have shown that prospect of feedbacks improving via width and location of annular channel is used up.

40|$|The coolant {{density effect}} {{represents}} one of the main reactivity feedback in LFR and SFR. These reactivity feedback effects are often calculated via direct perturbation in Monte Carlo codes. This work presents a new approach for <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficient</b> calculations based on Perturbation Theory. New methods were implemented in a extended Serpent version and are here verified against reference results for spatial coolant reactivity maps. In the paper, a detailed investigation of the effect of the calculation parameters and the applicability range of the perturbation calculations is presented. The main advantage of the present approach is the capability of providing, within a single Monte Carlo run, several reactivity coefficients. This feature is demonstrated via the reactivity feedback decomposition in energy, space, isotope and reaction in the ALFRED lead cooled reactor case.

40|$|We have {{established}} a correspondence between perturbation components in diffusion and transport theory. In particular we {{have established}} the correspondence between the leakage perturbation component of the diffusion theory {{to that of the}} group self scattering in transport theory. This has been confirmed by practical applications on sodium void reactivity calculations of fast reactors. Why this is important for current investigations? Recently, there has been a renewed interest in designing fast reactors where the sodium void <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficient</b> is minimized. In particular the ASTRID 8, 9 reactor concept has been optimized with this goal in mind. The correspondence on the leakage term that has been established here has a twofold implication for the design of this kind of reactors. First, this type of reactor has a radial reflector; therefore, as shown before, the sodium void <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficient</b> calculation requires the use of transport theory. The minimization of the sodium <b>reactivity</b> <b>coefficient</b> is normally done by increasing the leakage component that has a negative sign. The correspondence established in this paper allows to directly look at this component in transport theory. The second implication is related to the uncertainty evaluation on sodium void reactivity. As it has shown before, the total sodium void reactivity effect {{is the result of a}} large compensation (opposite sign) between the scattering (called often spectral) component and the leakage one. Consequently, one has to evaluate separately the uncertainty on each separate component and then combine them statistically. If one wants to compute the cross section sensitivity coefficients of the two different components, the formulation established in this paper allows to achieve this goal by playing on the contribution to the sodium void reactivity coming from the group self scattering of the sodium cross section...|$|E

As these LWRs continue to operate and more are built to match the increasing demand for electricity, the required capacity for these repositories grows. Georgia Tech's Subcritical Advanced Burner Reactor (SABR) has been designed to reduce the capacity requirements for these repositories and thereby help close the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle by burning the long-lived transuranics in spent nuclear fuel. SABR's design is based heavily off of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR). It is important to understand whether the SABR design retains the passive safety characteristics of the IFR. A full safety analysis of SABR's transient response to various possible accident scenarios needs to be performed to determine this.

To test this hypothesis markers of gastrointestinal immunostimulation, as manifested by serum IgA concentrations, were compared with serum markers of inflammation, as manifested by acute phase proteins. Serum samples from 45 unrelated Caucasian patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were tested for correlation of serum IgA and six acute phase proteins: C reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1 -antitrypsin, alpha 1 -antichymotrypsin, caeruloplasmin, alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), and haptoglobin. Serum IgA was shown to be significantly positively correlated with four of these six acute phase proteins: CRP (r = 0. 58, p less than 0. 001), alpha 1 -antitrypsin (r = 0. 29, p less than 0. 05), AGP (r = 0. 61, p less than 0. 01), and haptoglobin (r = 0. 58, p less than 0. 001), suggesting that gastrointestinal immunostimulation does have a role in the pathogenesis of inflammation in AS.
