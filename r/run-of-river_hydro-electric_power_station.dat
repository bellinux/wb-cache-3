40|$|There {{are three}} species of lamprey in the UK; the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and the brook lamprey Lampetra planeri. All three {{are found in}} the River Tay. They are all {{included}} in Annex II of the European Habitats Directive 92 / 43 /EEC and are designated species in the River Tay SAC. Stanley Mills is a small scale <b>run-of-river</b> <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> which takes water from the River Tay, upstream of Perth. This project aimed {{to assess the impact of}} Stanley Mills power station on downstream-migrating lamprey. Sea and river lamprey are typically anadromous species. They spawn in fresh water where the ammocoetes (larvae) remain for several years before transforming into parasitic adults and migrating to the sea. The concern is that downstream migrating lamprey may travel into the water intake for the hydropower station and either become impinged on trash screens or damaged by passing through the turbine itself. Sampling was carried out through the main expected period of emigration (September to March). Debris from the trash screen was checked for lamprey. Nets were set in the outflow from the power station while the turbine was both running and turned off to catch lamprey which had passed through the turbines or the bywash. All lamprey were identified, measured and their condition assesse...|$|E
