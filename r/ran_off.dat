5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> with Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, {{accompanied by}} Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister.

Percy was alienated from his family and received little financial support from them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had a second child, William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra. The group spent the summer of 1817 with Byron at Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. That fall, Percy's wife, Harriet, committed suicide, and in December Percy and Mary were married.
