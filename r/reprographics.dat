50|$|In 1982 Hobs Manchester {{opened on}} Kennedy Street {{comprising}} a branch manager, two printers and a delivery girl. In 1983, Hobs bought-out CT <b>Reprographics</b> Ltd on Deansgate and moved its operations from Kennedy Street to CT <b>Reprographics</b> existing building. The staff {{doubled in size}} overnight. Hobs dropped its name in favour of the already well established CT <b>Reprographics</b> Ltd brand. The same year CT <b>Reprographics</b> was the first company in the UK to purchase the advanced Xerox 2080 printer which became a welcomed addition to the two dyeline printing machines. Because {{of the size of}} the Xerox 2080, Kieran O'Brien had to seek new premises on Deansgate to house this machine. In 1987, bigger premises became available on Deansgate, so CT <b>Reprographics</b> and the Xerox 2080 were both co-located in the new building, and the CT <b>Reprographics</b> brand reverted to Hobs Manchester. Today in 2010 it offers a complete range of printing solutions.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to find out the <b>reprographic</b> process including the obstacles faced on the reprography of Suara Merdeka newspaper using digital camera at the Suara Merdeka Repository. This research used a qualitative research method. The sampling techniques used are purposive sampling, resulting in three informants, namely two reprography technical staff and one Suara Merdeka Repository administrator. The methods for collecting data are observation, interview, and documentation study. The data analysis technique used in this research is the Miles and Huberman analysis. The resulted analysis from this research shows that Suara Merdeka Repository utilises digital camera for the process of Suara Merdeka newspaper's reprography. During this process, the technical staffs hold an important role to produce a quality media conversion from a conventional to a digital form. The <b>reprographic</b> process application is very simple, merely utilising the digital camera's ability without using additional lightning equipment. Whereas for data processing, it's limited to cropping and renaming the resulted <b>reprographic</b> data. The lack of human resources and budget impact on the inhibition of the reprography process of Suara Merdeka newspaper. The inventory tools and equipment owned by Suara Merdeka Repository could no longer function optimally for <b>reprographic</b> process purposes so that it resulted in a less than optimum <b>reprographic</b> result. The reprography process by Suara Merdeka Repository is applied without modifying the original form of Suara Merdeka newspaper...|$|R
