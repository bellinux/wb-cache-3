Let B and R be sets of blue and <b>red</b> <b>points,</b> respectively, in the plane such that B ∪ R is in general position, and the convex hull of B contains k interior blue points and l interior <b>red</b> <b>points.</b> Hurtado et al. found sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} a blue polygonization that encloses all <b>red</b> <b>points.</b> We consider the dual question of the existence of a blue polygonization that excludes all <b>red</b> <b>points</b> R. We show that there is a minimal number K = K(l), which is a polynomial in l, such that one can always find a blue polygonization excluding all <b>red</b> <b>points,</b> whenever k ≥ K. Some other related problems are also considered. ...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s, a cat, {{owned by}} Siamese cat breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, {{produced}} {{a litter of}} Siamese kittens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three of the kittens had unique markings, consisting of white points and feet. Intrigued by their looks, she began working to breed cats like them, using seal <b>point</b> <b>Siamese</b> with bicolor American Shorthairs. The offspring of those cats lacked the <b>Siamese</b> <b>points,</b> but by breeding the offspring to Siamese cats, the desired look was accomplished. Hinds-Daugherty named the breed [...] "Snowshoe" [...] because of their white feet. Hinds-Daugherty promoted the Snowshoe at local cats shows, though they were not recognized at the time. Hinds-Daughtery eventually abandoned the Snowshoe breeding program, and it was taken up by Vikki Olander.|$|R
40|$|The Reverse Nearest Neighbor (RNN) {{problem is}} to find all points in a given data set whose nearest {{neighbor}} is a given query point. Given a set of blue points {{and a set of}} <b>red</b> <b>points,</b> the bichromatic version of the RNN problem, for a query blue point, is to find all the <b>red</b> <b>points</b> whose blue nearest neighbour is the given query point. In this paper, we introduce and investigate optimization problems according to the Bichromatic Reverse Nearest Neighbor rule (BRNN). We give efficient algorithms to compute a new blue point such that: (1) the number of associated <b>red</b> <b>points</b> is maximum (MAXCOV criterion); (2) the maximum distance to the associated <b>red</b> <b>points</b> is minimum (MINMAX criterion); (3) the minimum distance to the associated <b>red</b> <b>points</b> is maximum (MAXMIN criterion).

Our algorithm enumerates the set of relevant hyperrectangles (inclusion maximal axisaligned hyperrectangles that do not contain a <b>red</b> <b>point)</b> and counts the number of blue points in each one. The runtime of our algorithm depends on the total number of relevant hyperrectangles. We prove asymptotically tight bounds on this quantity in the worst case.

40|$|AbstractA {{geometric}} {{spanning tree}} {{of a point}} set S is a tree whose vertex set is S and whose edge set {{is a set of}} non-crossing straight line segments with endpoints in S. Given a set of <b>red</b> <b>points</b> and a set of blue points in the plane, the red/blue spanning tree problem is to find a geometric spanning tree for <b>red</b> <b>points</b> and a geometric spanning tree for blue points such that the number of crossing points of the two trees is a minimum. If no three points are collinear, we show that the minimum number of crossing points is completely determined by the number of maximal red (or blue) chains on the convex hull of all <b>red</b> <b>points</b> and blue points. We design an optimal algorithm for constructing a geometric spanning tree of all the <b>red</b> <b>points</b> and a geometric spanning tree of all the blue points with the minimum number of crossing points. If collinear points are allowed, we prove that the problem of deciding whether there exists a geometric spanning path of all the <b>red</b> <b>points</b> and a geometric spanning path of all the blue points without crossing is NP-complete...|$|R

40|$|For {{a finite}} {{set of points}} S, the (monochromatic) reverse nearest {{neighbor}} (RNN) rule associates with any query point q the subset of points in S that have q as its nearest neighbor. In the bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) rule, sets of <b>red</b> and blue <b>points</b> are given and any blue query {{is associated with the}} subset of <b>red</b> <b>points</b> that have it as its nearest blue neighbor. In this paper we introduce and study new optimization problems in the plane based on the bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) rule. We provide efficient algorithms to compute a new blue point under criteria such as: (1) the number of associated <b>red</b> <b>points</b> is maximum (MAXCOV criterion); (2) the maximum distance to the associated <b>red</b> <b>points</b> is minimum (MINMAX criterion); (3) the minimum distance to the associated <b>red</b> <b>points</b> is maximum (MAXMIN criterion).
