2500|$|The GUM {{agents are}} not police {{officers}} (the police force {{is under control}} of the provincial government), so they do not carry weapons and they cannot detain or arrest people, but they can <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> traffic violations, shut down commercial establishments that violate the law, perform first aid procedures, set up roadside blood alcohol content controls, etc. The GUM patrols public areas such as squares, monuments, and the pedestrian streets in the center; its operations overlap and coordinate those of other municipal and provincial agencies, and are intended to have an extra dissuasive effect. The GUM was started on 29 June 2004 with 250 agents, and soon taken up by other cities: in Villa Constitución a project was presented by a private citizen in September; nearby Roldán adopted it in October, Buenos Aires in March 2005 (see Guardia Urbana de Buenos Aires), and Rafaela is currently discussing it. The Police Cadet School of Rosario provided technical courses for aspiring agents residing in many towns and cities of Santa Fe.|$|E

30|$|Advancements in {{technology}} {{have led to}} the generation and availability of new types of medically-relevant data sources that have an array of potential health applications, including patient-generated health data (PGHD) (Wood et al., 2015). PGHD is defined as “health-related data—including health history, symptoms, biometric data, treatment history, lifestyle choices, and other information—created, recorded, gathered, or inferred by or from patients or their designees (i.e. care partners or those who assist them) to help address a health concern” (Shapiro et al., 2012). It is distinct from data generated in clinical settings because it allows for patients to directly <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> their own information. PGHD can complement and enrich other sources of medical evidence, and its use is advised when measuring concepts best known by the patient or best measured from the patient perspective, such as pain or nausea (Research Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

40|$|Malignant melanomas of the vulva {{are rare}} tumours which {{constitute}} only 5 - 10 % of all vulvar cancers {{but are the}} second commonest vulvar malignancy after squamous carcinomas. Almost all vulvar naevi are of the junctional type from which melanomas are believed to arise and this may explain why in women, 3 - 5 % of melanomas occur in the vulva though it occupies only 1 - 2 % of the body surface area. Vulvar melanomas have a poor prognosis with an overall 5 -year survival rate of only 34 % in a recent review. ' Vulvar melanomas are much more common in fair skinned Caucasian women but very rare in our local women who have a much darker skin.

Also, documented {{the assessment of the}} socio-economic perceptions of three groups of fisher folks on the economy of infected mudfish Clarias fishing activities. Fifty-six (67. 5 %) of 83 mudfish Clarias caught by artisanal fisher folks were examined for the presence of the larvae of the nematode Eustrongylides. All the 8 sampled fishing localities in Bida floodplain of Nigeria had a mean intensity and abundance of at least 3 and 1 worm per fish per site, respectively. Two hundred and one (96. 2 %) of 209 worms recovered were from the musculatures at different depths resulting in undulations on the skin surfaces as grub-like presentations. The three groups of fisher folks assessed encountered economic losses from nematode infected mudfish Clarias which attract much debates or rejections during marketing due to its aesthetically displeasing appearance, faster deterioration, higher fragility in smoked form coupled with poorer taste compared to the wholesome ones.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect the {{presence}} of body fluids is a crucial first step in documenting and processing forensic evidence. The Rapid Stain IDentification (RSID™) tests for blood, saliva, semen and urine are lateral flow immunochromatographic strip tests specifically designed for forensic use. Like most lateral flow strips, the membrane components of the test are enclosed in a molded plastic cassette with a sample well and an observation window. No specialized equipment is required to use these tests or to score the results seen in the observation window; however, the utility of these tests can be enhanced if an electronic record of the test results can be obtained, preferably by a small hand-held device {{that could be used}} in the field under low light conditions. Such a device should also be able to “read” the lateral flow strips and accurately record the results of the test as either positive, i. e., the body fluid was detected, or negative, i. e., the body fluid was not detected. Here we describe the RSID™ Reader System—a ruggedized strip test reader unit that allows analysis and documentation of RSID™ lateral flow strip tests using pre-configured settings, and show that the RSID™ Reader can accurately and reproducibly <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> correct results from RSID™ blood, saliva, semen, and urine tests...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sri Lanka has {{witnessed}} {{a series of}} dengue epidemics {{over the past five}} years, with the western province, home to the political capital of Colombo, bearing {{more than half of the}} dengue burden. Existing dengue monitoring prevention programs are exhausted as public health inspectors (PHIs) cope with increasing workloads and paper-based modes of surveillance and education, characterizing a reactive system unable to cope with the enormity of the problem. On the other hand, the unprecedented proliferation and affordability of mobile phones since 2009 and a supportive political climate have thus far remained unexploited for the use of mobile-based interventions for dengue management. Objective: To conduct a needs assessment of PHIs in Colombo with respect to their dengue-related tasks and develop a new mobile-based system to address these needs while strengthening existing systems. Methods: One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 PHIs to a) gain a nuanced, in-depth understanding of the current state of surveillance practices, b) understand the logistical, technological and social challenges they confront, and c) identify opportunities for mobile-based interventions. Quantitative analysis included simple descriptive statistics while qualitative analysis comprised textual analysis of 209 pages of transcripts (or nearly 600 minutes of conversations) using grounded theory approaches. Results: Current paper-based data collection practices for dengue surveillance involved a circuitous, time consuming process that could take between 7 - 10 days to officially <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> a single case. PHIs confronted challenges in terms of unreliable, standalone GIS devices, delays in registering mosquito breeding sites and lack of engagement from communities while delivering dengue education. These findings, in concert with a high motivation to use mobile-based systems, informed the development of Mo-Buzz, a mobile-based system that integrates three components – digitized surveillance, dynamic disease mapping and digitized dengue education – on a common platform. The system was developed through an iterative, evolutionary, collaborative process, consistent with the Spiral model of software development and is currently being used by all 55 PHIs in the CMC system. Conclusions: Given the entrenched nature of existing paper-based systems in PHIs’ work habits, we expect a gradual adoption curve for Mo-Buzz in the future. Equally, we expect variable adoption of the system with respect to its specific components, and specific PHI sub-groups (younger versus older). The Mo-Buzz intervention is a response to multiple calls by the global mHealth community for collaborations in the area of mobile interventions for global health. Our experience revealed that the benefits of this paradigm lies in alleviating country-specific public health challenges through a commonly shared understanding of cultural mores, and sharing of knowledge and technologies. We call upon future researchers to further dissect the applicability of the Spiral Model of software development to mHealth interventions and contribute to the mHealth evidence debate from theoretical and applied perspectives...|$|E
