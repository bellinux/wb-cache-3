For example, some statements are incidental notes or illustrations; others are well known to the student and/or can be easily inferred or subsumed within larger span predicates. The student/user will make such value judgements in line with learning objectives.

30|$|The {{experimental}} design can become complicated {{because there are}} interlinked components of Text Charting, <b>Rhetorical</b> <b>Predicate</b> Analysis and Conceptual Mapping. What are the contributions of each, and do they overlap? The progression of these techniques suggests a planned comparison design which is more focused than the usual post-hoc comparisons following an Analysis of Variance [ANOVA]. The planned comparisons have the hypotheses set up before the experiment proceeds. Students are then randomly assigned to the treatment groups, the test measures taken and analysed [e.g. ANOVA]. The difference is that with post-hoc ANOVAs the actual comparisons are not strictly statistically independent, hence the possibility of Type 1 and Type 2 errors. With planned comparisons the hypotheses are orthogonal and the information given is non-redundant.|$|E

The specification was bosed upon experimental expert-user facilitative dialogues. These dialogues were analyzed using a classification scheme developed for the purpose. The scheme provides a meta-language for describing patterns of intent and rhetorical structure in dialogue. Using the scheme as a tool, comman patterns in expert-user dialogue emerged, providing insights into both tutoring strategy and the linguistic forms required to generate help output. These were refined to form a set of frames consisting of stereotypical patterns of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>predicates</b> to answer different types of ques-tions which could be adapted to the needs of a particular user.

30|$|Particularly {{with the}} support of technology, teaching/learning is a {{communicative}} and interactive process creating opportunities for engagement that present challenges to tutors and students. It is argued that, within these challenges, the understanding and exploitation of educational content can be supported and improved by a process of conceptual mapping. This activity is conceived as a staged process focused, at varying levels, on the functional structure of material with its identified concepts, and relational (<b>rhetorical)</b> <b>predicates</b> being represented through a mapping. These stages of Text Charting (comprehending) rhetorical analysis (understanding) and map construction (conceptualising) are explained and discussed; a framework of functional predicates is proposed, and the process of conceptual mapping is illustrated. The ways such mappings and the meta-language can be exploited in further work and collaborations are outlined; software applications (apps) that can support these processes, and evaluation issues concerned with identifying and illuminating the effects on learning, form the concluding sections of this paper.|$|R

A <b>predicate</b> {{with a natural}} final endpoint, such as accomplishments and achievements, suggests that by default a clause with the predicate {{is connected to the}} clause following by Narration, and a predicate without natural final endpoint is defeasibly connected to the following clause by BackgroundT, a temporal background. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{discourse}} {{features of}} Anggor, a non-Austronesian language of Papua New Guinea, are analyzed. The {{goal is to}} describe the features and processes operating in oral and written discourse. A summary of discourse studies starts with structural linguistics in the 1950 s. ^ A sketch of the phonology covers from segments to intonation contours, vowel harmony, consonant harmony, and the future tense morphophonemic process. ^ Grammatically the temporal-reference monitoring system is of typological significance {{as it is a}} derived system using verb affix complexes whereas the New Guinea Highlands systems have specific morphemes for this purpose. This system monitors sequential or simultaneous time relations and general or specific anticipatory reference. A unique feature is the double anticipatory reference where two referents of the following clause are specified. The factors relevant to reference monitoring are semantic rather than surface subject. Verbalized constructions have thematic functions. Discourse thematized structures have verbal affixes that agree in tense-mood with the verb of the dominating clause and optionally agree with the subject and object. The eleven verb classes are related to semantic categories. A significant problem is that of defining a grammatical sentence for narratives. The data do not support the establishment of sentences in narratives by grammatical criteria alone. The most relevant factors for describing narrative discourse are interclause relations and intonation rather than grammatical structure. ^ The semantic system is described in terms of features and the propositional framework of Grimes. Reference has both inherent and situational features. Cases have differing inherent prominence according to their mapping relations to clause constituents. Lexical predicates are analyzed in terms of their semantic features, aspect, and case frames. <b>Rhetorical</b> <b>predicates</b> organize discourse and consist of logical, equative, orientation, and response relations. Nontext semantics specifies cultural knowledge needed to understand text content. ^ Cohesive features are phonological, grammatical, and lexical. Intonation divides a text into information units and indicate cohesion between them. Grammatical cohesion includes cross reference and tense-mood agreement, cataphoric reference monitoring, anaphoric affix chains, pronominalization, repetition, and structural parallelism. Lexical cohesive features are items related in a semantic domain, collocation of objects and events or event sequences, and cycles that involve the repetition of sections of text. ^ The staging, or prominence, system indicates the salience of elements in the text. The last element of an intonation contour has prominence and marked prominence occurs when {{there is more than one}} contour per clause. Grammatically, structural complexity provides prominence. Open classes and optional elements are more prominent their counterparts. A specificity-complexity continuum varies from 0 affixation to topicalization. Thematization indicates what is being talked about in the clause (local theme) or supraclause (global theme). Unmarked local theme is signalled by the cross reference system. Marked local theme is indicated by complex structures for clause constituents. The cataphoric reference system indicates unmarked global theme whereas marked global theme is signalled by anaphora using structural elements more complex that verb affixes for reference. Oral discourse has fewer prominence features that written, narratives fewer features than nonnarratives, and culturally familiar content fewer features than culturally new content. ...|$|R

The phrases a chief executive utters or records has the ability to shape his perceived image. When Bill Clinton entered the "White House in 1992 after a successful campaign he experienced problems in his initial days in office which resulted in a loss of public support. This analysis offers insight into some of the reasons for Clinton's difficulties during his first two years in office. Specifically, through a narrative analysis which focuses upon the construction of character types, this study indicates that Clinton did not effectively create messages (characters) which would enhance his ethos. Clinton's predilection was to create characters which divided audiences rather than uniting them, thus he was unable to engender adequate audience identification and public support. Consequently, Clinton's messages tended to harm rather than enhance his credibility as a leader...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to two distinct but convergent issues: the possibility of paraphrase and an account of context sensitivity {{on the basis of}} textual cohesion (or coherence). The possibility of explaining contextual specifications of meaning as a side effect of establishing textual cohesion is explored through an investigation into the nature of texts. Taking off from existing theories of text structure, an ideal concept of cohesion is elaborated which accounts for textual connection by the interpreter’s assignment of rhetorical relations (or discourse relations). In addition to connecting the elements of a text together, rhetorical relations have implications for the content of terms and sentences composing a text. The contextual meaning of terms and sentences are thus {{explained by the fact that}} the terms and sentences are parts of a text. Enriching the domain of context sensitivity, special emphasis is placed on the implications of <b>rhetorical</b> relations for <b>predicate</b> terms. Through an analysis of authentic literary examples, a certain conception of predicate reference is vindicated which is labelled rhetorical adjustment. The approach contrasts with several contextualist theories in linguistics and philosophy of language which prefer to account for the generation of meaning transcending the linguistic meaning of terms and sentences as specified by syntax and lexicon by means of external parameters such as the speaker’s intentions and communicative aims. In this way the thesis is a contribution to the debate concerning the interface between semantics and pragmatics. Such a contextualism based on the notion of cohesion has implications for a certain conception of paraphrase. It is often emphasized that it is not possible to say the same thing in different words. It is argued that taking contextualism and cohesion into account justifies a conception of paraphrase according to which it is not opposed to, but contributes to the constitution of the original meaning. Such a paraphrase is undemanding in that it does not aim to capture all the aspects of the original wording, yet it is neither trivial, since it is unpredictable from a lexical point of view nor irrelevant, since it is a constitutive feature of the original expression in so far as it is part of a text...|$|R
