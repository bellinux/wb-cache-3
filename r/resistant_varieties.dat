40|$|This article {{develops}} a forestry model {{to obtain the}} optimal control strategy and optimal rotation length after a disease attacks in a perennial variety. Three cases are considered: a benchmark consisting of a disease-free field, an identical field with the disease present but no <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> with which to replant, and an identical field with the disease present and a <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> with which to replant. We determine general decision rules and then apply the model {{to the case of}} Pudrición del Cogollo, a major disease threat to the Colombian oil palm industry. In the application, we compare the optimal rotation length between the three scenarios and determine the optimal level of control in each period for the disease scenarios. The singular solution involves complete control of the disease, {{and in the absence of}} a <b>resistant</b> <b>variety,</b> the presence of the disease increases the rotation length. With these solutions, we then determine the value of developing a <b>resistant</b> <b>variety.</b> This value depends heavily on the age distribution of the current trees and decreases as the average tree age decreases. The value further declines when the resistance variety has negative attributes such as higher replanting and maintenance costs than the original variety.

The {{aim of this}} study was to check the involvement of bromelain, the cysteine protease protein family abundantly present in pineapple fruits, and AcCYS 1, an endogenous inhibitor of bromelain, in the development of blackheart. For this we checked the response to postharvest chilling treatment of two pineapple varieties (MD 2 and Smooth Cayenne) differing in their resistance to blackheart. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that postharvest chilling treatment induced a down-regulation of bromelain transcript accumulation in both varieties with the most dramatic drop in the <b>resistant</b> <b>variety.</b> Regarding AcCYS 1 transcript accumulation, the varieties showed opposite trends with an up-regulation in the case of the <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> and a down-regulation in the susceptible one.

40|$|Rice blast disease {{caused by}} Magnapothe oryzae {{is the most}} devastating disease {{attacked}} in rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. Blast disease can cause approximately 60 % - 100 % of yield losses which can feed around 60 million of people. According to various projections, world need to produce 30 % more rice by 2030. To meet this challenge, various management strategies should be enhanced and implemented. This review paper aims to discuss on current control managements of rice blast disease in Malaysia and other countries such as China, India, Japan and other countries. The scopes of this review are to identify the current management that was being applied in other countries and to review the potential control method that can be implemented in Malaysia. There are several cultural practices that have been implemented by various countries such as <b>resistant</b> <b>variety,</b> mixtures of variety or multi lines, water management, and nutrient management. Most of the countries are focusing on using <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> to control rice blast disease. Among the countries, China used most of <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> to control rice blast {{and one of them}} is Xiangzi 3150 and has been used as donor gene for 20 years. Malaysia also used the <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> such as MR 219 to manage rice blast. Control method of using mechanical approach is most unpopular method, perhaps in the future, our country should concern more about this approach which is has been proved in Japan by using fan-forced wind. The method is claimed to be effective in combating rice blast disease. For chemical control, most of the countries used Carbcndazim and followed by Isoprothiolane and Tricylazole through a seed treatment and foliar sprays. Among these controls, chemical is the most commonly used by farmers due to its effectiveness and fast control rice blast disease. However, due to drawback of using the chemical which is high contain of toxicity cause environmental issue. Therefore, utilization of antagonistic bacteria as biological agents becomes researcher's interest to study the efficacy of biological agents to control rice blast disease. In addition, an advanced method for early detection of the disease such as serological method, molecular method, biomarker-based disease detection and plant properties also can be used in preventing the blast infection...|$|R
