25|$|A stirrup {{is a light}} frame or {{ring that}} holds {{the foot of a}} rider, {{attached}} to the saddle by a strap, often called a stirrup leather. Stirrups are usually paired and are used to aid in mounting and as a support while using a <b>riding</b> <b>animal</b> (usually a horse or other equine, such as a mule). They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay in the saddle and control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation and warfare.|$|E
25|$|Donkeys can interbreed {{with other}} members of the family Equidae, and are {{commonly}} interbred with horses. The hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule, valued as a working and <b>riding</b> <b>animal</b> in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the Asino di Martina Franca, the Baudet de Poitou and the Mammoth Jack are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny, and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile. Donkeys can also breed with zebras in which the offspring is called a zonkey (among other names).|$|E
500|$|The Finnhorse is {{considered}} a reliable and fairly good jumper, and is regularly seen in [...] show jumping classes. Finnhorses have been quite successful at lower levels because they are clean and efficient jumpers, but their shorter stride at the canter and gallop keeps them from competing at more advanced levels. In his 1952 book Ratsastuskirja, Olympic rider Werner Walldén described the Finnhorse as enduring and resilient, mentally focused, and an easy keeper. He considered jumping to be the breed's best asset as a <b>riding</b> <b>animal,</b> but noted that its scope does not reach the level required for modern international competition.|$|E

500|$|Over the years, {{she made}} use of outside bloodlines. She leased the young, then {{unproven}} stallion Khemosabi for his first breeding season in 1969. She also {{made use of}} horses owned by other ranches, such as the Polish import Bask, whom she linebred to his 3/4 sister, Varian's Polish import Bachantka, producing another significant foundation mare, Balalinka, dam of Barbary. In 2002, requiring an outcross stallion not closely related to her own horses, she purchased the Brazilian-foaled Jullyen El Jamaal, who has bloodlines not previously incorporated into the Varian program, {{as well as a}} line tracing back to Bay el Bey via Bey Shah. Varian [...] continued to seek performance ability in her mares; in the Varian program, every mare is trained under saddle and must prove suitable as a <b>riding</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E
500|$|In most cultures, a war horse {{used as a}} <b>riding</b> <b>animal</b> {{was trained}} to be {{controlled}} with limited use of reins, responding primarily to the rider's legs and weight. The horse became accustomed to any necessary tack and protective armour placed upon it, and learned to balance under a rider who would also be laden with weapons and armour. Developing the balance and agility of the horse was crucial. The origins of the discipline of dressage came from the need to train horses to be both obedient and manoeuvrable. The Haute ecole or [...] "High School" [...] movements of classical dressage taught today at the Spanish Riding School have their roots in manoeuvres designed for the battlefield. However, the airs above the ground were unlikely to {{have been used in}} actual combat, as most would have exposed the unprotected underbelly of the horse to the weapons of foot soldiers.|$|E

At odd times during the week he examined numbers of chestnut sorrels, tried several, and was unsatisfied. It was not till Saturday that he came upon Bob. Daylight knew him for what he wanted the moment he laid eyes on him. A large horse for a <b>riding</b> <b>animal,</b> he was none too large for a big man like Daylight.

He was the biggest <b>riding</b> <b>animal</b> on the ranch, descended from the King's Sparklingdow with a range mare for dam, and roped wild only two weeks before. I never have seen so {{beautiful}} a horse. He had the round, deep-chested, big-hearted, well-coupled body of the ideal mountain pony, and his head and neck were true thoroughbred, slender, yet full, with lovely alert ears not too small to be vicious nor too large to be stubborn mulish. And his legs and feet were lovely too, unblemished, sure and firm, with long springy pasterns that made him a wonder of ease under the saddle." ...|$|E

50|$|Breeching is {{occasionally}} used in {{a similar}} manner as that of a pack saddle, especially when riding mules.

50|$|In Weinbaum's Solar System, Jupiter radiates enough heat {{to create}} Earthlike environments on the Galilean moons. Ganymede, the third Galilean satellite, has a subarctic climate, large bodies of water, and a six-month {{rotation}} period. Due to Jupiter's tidal pull, every spot on Ganymede's surface is inundated with water {{every three months}} except a small area of the south pole where the human settlement of Hydropole is located. The Ganymedian natives, the Nympus, grow a mosslike plant called cree which is ordinarily red, but which turns blue when exposed to the ammonia in Ganymede's atmosphere. The blue moss is collected by human traders in the employ of Cree, Inc. who travel among the native villages on an aquatic <b>riding</b> <b>animal</b> called a hipp (short for Hippocampus catamiti); it is then shipped to Earth to produce crephine, a combined anesthetic and medicine.
