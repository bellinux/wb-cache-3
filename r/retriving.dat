40|$|Abstract: The author {{deals with}} the effects of {{globalisation}} on the oral and written expressive forms rooted in oral antecedents. He develops a context for <b>retriving</b> and transmitting the oral as a discourse under the regime of globalisation by arguing that technologies can be exploited for preserving the oral traditions and for their dissemination. One can initiate the discussion hinted by the title above by asking avery basic question. What is globalisation doing to traditional expressive forms? One can definitely say that proliferation of global systems in communication is a definite engine of change. Globalisation, among other things, driven by technological revolutions poses a different challenge to expressive forms rooted in oral antecedents. The question arises is globalisation a better/worse option for preservation and dissemination of the oral? Is globalisation, as it is feared in some quarters, would forever erase the oral? I propose to develop a context for <b>retriving</b> and transmitting the oral as a discourse under the regime of globalisation by arguing that technologies can be exploited in preserving the oral or creating an archive for its dissemination. As Roger Hewitt points out: “What also needs recovering is the folklorist’s nose for expressive forms–oral narratives, jokes, sayings, chants etc– without the folklorist’s prejudice against the technological: an approach that melds a sensitivity to creativity in language, with popular cultural analysis, a sense of the contemporary, a sense of agency, within an apprehension of culture not as ‘tradition ’ but rather, as the bricoleurs’s bag, and meaning as created as much as ‘given’ ” (Hewitt 2003 : 197) ...|$|E
40|$|Parallel audio {{amplifier}} are hybrid amplifiers thatcouple a linear and a switching stage with a parallel connection. Aproper control must be {{designed so that}} the voltage is controlledby the linear stage, {{while most of the}} current is driven by theswitching stage. So doing the overall architecture achieves thetypical efficiency of the switching stage and the distortion of thelinear stage. In summary a nice trade-off between efficiency anddistortion can be achieved, allowing to reduce heat dissipationkeeping a pleasant sound reproduction. The above purposes can be achieved only with a proper controlthat must set accurately the balance between the two stages, andits implementation is very critical. The paper deals with the modelof the hybrid {{audio amplifier}} architecture aiming at <b>retriving</b> themost critical items, and at defining simple relationships for theoptimal design of the amplifier.

For retrieving images different techniques are used automatic image annotation techniques are mostly used for image retrieval. Content-based image retrieval, the problem of searching large image repositories according to their content, {{has been the subject}} of a significant amount of computer vision research in the recent past. While early retrieval architectures were based on the query-by-example paradigm, which formulates image retrieval as the search for the best database match to a user-provided query image, it was quickly realized that the design of fully functional retrieval systems would require support for semantic queries. These are systems where the databases of images are annotated with semantic keywords, enabling the user to specify the query through a natural language description of the visual concepts of interest. This realization, combined with the cost of manual image labeling, generated significant interest in the problem of automatically extracting semantic descriptors from images.

The <b>retriving</b> of unused environmental energy from mechanical vibrations is a promising solution for powering sensor nodes, realizing an autonomous sensor system. The most studied mechanical energy converters {{are based on}} the direct piezoelectric effect and they are made with thick-film and MEMS technologies [1 - 2].

For that reason it is expected to obtain maximum diagnostic information with minimum exposure to harmful factors, by accurate selection of scanning parameters. This thesis analyzes the noise properties of two CT scanners, GE Lightspeed HD 750, and Toshiba Aquillion ONE, based on reported differences in appearance of the images scanned. Catphan Phantom 600 uniformity module is scanned with both scanners, using range of configurations and extension rings simulating patients of different sizes. 60 datasets were obtained and analyzed in terms of the uniformity, homogeneity, noise texture and spectral power distribution. The results show that GE scanner provides images less contaminated with noise when larger patient is scanned or the scanned region is enveloped with big volumes of matter or high density regions, that are sources of artifacts in CT. On the other hand, it is Toshiba that performed better when desired region of scanning was easily accessable (small or slim patients). Because human body is a source of many artifacts that increase the difficulties of obtaining desired data, it is understandable, that medical practitioners have more success in <b>retriving</b> diagnostically important information from images from GE scanner, which has better results in similar simulated conditions...|$|E

In this paper, a correlation-aware QoS routing algorithm (CAQR) is proposed to efficiently deliver visual information under QoS constraints by exploiting the correlation among video sensors. Firstly, a correlation-aware differential coding scheme is designed {{to reduce the amount}} of traffic generated by correlated video sensors. Then, a correlation-aware load balancing scheme is proposed to prevent network congestion by spliting the correlated flows that cannot be reduced to different paths. Finally, these correlationaware schemes are integrated into an optimization QoS routing framework with an objective to minimize energy consumption subject to QoS constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves efficient delivery of visual information under QoS constraints in wireless video sensor networks. I...|$|R

The novelty of the protocol is that it uses parallel lookup to reduce <b>retrive</b> latency and bounds communication overhead to a dynamically adjusted routing table. Tambour estimates the probabilities of routing entries' liveness based on statistics of node lifetime history and evicts dead entries after lookup failures. When the network is unstable, more routing entries will be evicted in a given period of time, and the routing tables will be getting smaller which minimize the number of timeouts for later lookup requests.
