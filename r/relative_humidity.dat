5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with <b>relative</b> <b>humidity.</b> A high <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in <b>relative</b> <b>humidity.</b> At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E
50|$|The term dry rot is {{somewhat}} misleading, as both species of fungi Serpula lacrymans and Meruliporia incrassata require an elevated moisture content to initiate {{an attack on}} timber (28-30%). Once established, the fungi can remain active in timber with a moisture content of more than 20%. At <b>relative</b> <b>humidities</b> below 86 percent, growth of Serpula lacrymans is inhibited, but it can stay dormant at <b>relative</b> <b>humidities</b> down to 76 percent. These <b>relative</b> <b>humidities</b> correspond to equilibrium moisture contents of wood of 19 and 15 percent, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are known}} to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500hPa level, or 5.9km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection.

5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south.

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (fruit body opening) {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E

5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> {{approached}} 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of medicanes often {{results from the}} vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well, resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding {{with an increase in}} <b>relative</b> <b>humidity,</b> creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. This, in turn, leads to in an increase in potential energy, producing heat-induced air-sea instability. Moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdrafts—the vertically downward movement of air—which often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones, and in such a scenario, wind shear remains minimal; overall, cold-core cut-off lows serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux-influenced warm-core lows such as medicanes. The regular genesis of cold-core upper-level lows and the infrequency of Mediterranean tropical cyclones, however, indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter. Elevated sea surface temperatures, contrasting with cold atmospheric air, encourage atmospheric instability, especially within the troposphere.|$|E
