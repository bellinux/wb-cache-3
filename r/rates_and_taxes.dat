40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether concessionary <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> incentives {{can attract}} {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) into certain designated areas in China. Since China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979, tax benefits have been used extensively to attract FDI into different areas. In 1991, a new tax law was introduced which superseded two previous income tax laws. This new law provides additional tax benefits which improve the investment environment for foreign investors. This study investigates the effect of China's <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> incentive policy on FDI and on the locational choices of foreign firms. Our empirical results indicate that <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> incentives are important determinants of regional investment decisions in China, after controlling for potential confounding variables covering infrastructure, unemployment <b>rate,</b> wage <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> agglomeration economics. Specifically, areas offering lower <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> increased <b>tax</b> incentives are found to attract greater amounts of FDI. The impetus of the tax effect on FDI is more apparent in the post- 1991 period due {{to changes in the}} tax laws. Our results also suggest that infrastructure variables are important determinants of regional investment decisions. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R

25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{quantify}} the relationship between <b>tax</b> revenue <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> (for example, in the United States by the Congressional Budget Office). While the interaction between <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> revenue is generally accepted, the precise nature of this interaction is debated. In practice, the shape of a hypothetical Laffer curve for a given economy can only be estimated. The relationship between <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> revenue is likely to vary from one economy to another and depends on the elasticity of supply for labor, as well as various other factors. Even in the same economy, the characteristics of the curve could vary over time. Complexities such as progressive <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> possible differences in the incentive to work for different income groups complicate the task of estimation. The structure of the curve may also be changed by policy decisions. For example, if <b>tax</b> loopholes <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> shelters are made more readily available by legislation, the point at which revenue begins to decrease with increased taxation is likely to become lower.|$|R
6000|$|If {{you wish}} to be really free, and {{to do what you}} like, like what is right; and do that, says St. Paul, and then the law will not {{interfere}} with you: [...] "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." [...] And then he sums up what doing right is, in one short sentence: [...] "Love thy neighbour as thyself; for love is the fulfilling of the law." [...] All that the laws want to make you do, is to behave like men who do love their neighbours as themselves, and therefore do them no harm--to behave like men who are ready to give up their own private wills and pleasures, and even their own private property, if wanted, {{for the good of the}}ir neighbours and their country. Therefore the law calls on you to pay <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>taxes,</b> which are to be spent for the good of the nation at large. And if you love your neighbour as yourself, and have the good of everyone round you at heart, you will no more grudge paying <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>taxes</b> for their benefit than you will grudge spending money to support and educate your own children. And so you will be free, free to do what you like, because you like, from the fear and love of God, to do those right things which the law is set to make you do.|$|E
