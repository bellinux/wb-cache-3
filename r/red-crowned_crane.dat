25|$|In Japan, this crane {{is known}} as the tanchōzuru and is said to live for 1,000 years. A pair of red-crowned cranes was used in the design for the Series D 1000-yen note (reverse side). In the Ainu language, the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>crane</b> {{is known as}} sarurun kamuy or marsh kamuy. At Tsurui, they are one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan. Cranes are said to grant favours in return for acts of sacrifice, as in Tsuru no Ongaeshi ("crane's return of a favor").|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} and summer, the migratory populations of the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>crane</b> breed in Siberia (eastern Russia), northeastern China and {{occasionally}} in northeastern Mongolia (i.e., Mongol Daguur Strictly Protected Area). The breeding range centers in Lake Khanka, {{on the border of}} China and Russia. Normally, the crane lays two eggs, with only one surviving. Later, in the fall, they migrate in flocks to Korea and east-central China to spend the winter. Vagrants have also been recorded in Taiwan, China. In addition to the migratory populations, a resident population is found in eastern Hokkaidō in Japan. This species nests in wetlands and rivers. In the wintering range, their habitat is comprised mainly by paddy fields, grassy tidal flats, and mudflats. In the flats, the birds feed on aquatic invertebrates and, in cold, snowy conditions, the birds switch to mainly living on rice gleanings from the paddy fields.|$|E

2500|$|Flock {{sizes are}} {{affected}} by the small numbers of the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>crane,</b> and given their largely carnivorous diet, some feeding dispersal is needed in natural conditions. Wintering cranes have been observed foraging, variously, in family groups, pairs, and singly, although all roosting is in larger groups (up to 80 individuals) with unrelated cranes. By the early spring, pairs begin to spend more time together, with nonbreeding birds and juveniles dispersing separately. Even while not nesting, red-crowned cranes tend to be aggressive towards conspecifics and maintain a minimum distance of [...] to keep out of pecking range of other cranes while roosting nocturnally during winter. In circumstances where a crane violates these boundaries, it may be violently attacked.|$|E
2500|$|Breeding {{maturity}} {{is thought}} to be reached at 3-4 years of age. All mating and egg-laying is largely restricted to April and early May. A <b>red-crowned</b> <b>crane</b> pair [...] duets in various situations, helping to establish formation and maintenance of the pair bond, as well as territorial advertisement and agonistic signaling. The pair moves rhythmically until they are standing close, throwing their heads back and letting out a fluting call in unison, often triggering other pairs to start duetting, as well. As it is occurs year around, the social implications of dancing are complex in meaning. However, dancing behavior is generally thought to show excitement in the species. To strengthen the bond, red-crowned cranes engage in dual honking rituals before performing a dance.|$|E

25|$|With their height {{averaging}} 1.5 m (5ft), {{their large}} size deters most predators. As a result, <b>red-crowned</b> <b>cranes</b> often react indifferently {{to the presence}} of other birds such as small raptors; with harriers, falcons, owls, and small buzzards being allowed to hunt small prey near a crane nest without any of these parties harassing each other. However, birds more likely to be egg or nest predators, such as corvids, some buzzards, and various eagles, are treated aggressively and are threatened until they leave the crane's territory. Mammalian carnivores, including gray wolves, red foxes, badgers, raccoon dogs, Eurasian lynxes, and domestic dogs, are attacked immediately, with the parent cranes attempting to jab them in the flanks until the predators leave the vicinity, sometimes killing smaller enemies such as foxes. Occasionally, losses at the nest occur to some of the above predators. Introduced American mink on Hokkaido {{are one of the most}} successful predators of eggs and nestlings. Also, immature and unwary adult cranes may be killed by the largest raptors, such as sea eagles, or mammalian carnivores, though this is rare, especially with adults. White-naped cranes often nest near <b>red-crowned</b> <b>cranes,</b> but competition between these species for food in a common nesting area is lessened due to the greater portion of vegetation in the white-naped crane's diet. In cases where interactions turn aggressive between white-naped and <b>red-crowned</b> <b>cranes,</b> <b>red-crowned</b> <b>cranes</b> are dominant, as expected due to their considerably larger size.|$|R
