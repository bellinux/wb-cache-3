5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest <b>referee.</b> Early in the match, Angle {{was able to}} apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked {{out of the ring}} by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw <b>referee</b> came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the <b>referee,</b> and {{executed}} an illegal low blow. Angle called for another <b>referee,</b> but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the <b>referee,</b> which led to Angle knocking down the <b>referee.</b> As the other <b>referee</b> was knocked out, SmackDown <b>referee</b> Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on Angle, pinning him to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled <b>referee.</b> André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders {{were not on the}} mat when the <b>referee</b> made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to <b>referee</b> that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor <b>referee.</b> Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed <b>referee</b> to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second <b>referee</b> was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, {{the number}} of {{successful}} <b>referees</b> in the post-test was higher than {{the number of}} successful <b>referees</b> in the pre-test. In the pre-test, there were 4 successful <b>referees</b> in the experimental group and 4 successful <b>referees</b> in the control group. Hence, there were 8 successful <b>referees</b> in total. In the post-test, there were 15 successful <b>referees</b> in the experimental group and 9 successful <b>referees</b> in the control group. Thus, there were 24 successful <b>referees</b> in total. These values showed that the digital game-based learning platform was more beneficial than traditional learning book because the number of <b>referees</b> who improve their knowledge level by using training platform outnumbered those <b>referees</b> using the LOG book.|$|R

5|$|Early games {{did not use}} any on-field {{officials}} but {{disputes between}} the players would be referred to a committee member. Umpires were introduced {{by the end of}} 1862. Two umpires were used; one from each club. The off-field <b>referee</b> was introduced for the Youdan Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871. The umpires would then appeal to the <b>referee</b> on behalf of their team. The concept was later introduced to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the <b>referee</b> moved onto the pitch and the umpires became linesmen. The umpire's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wales Test Dixon and the WRU {{continued}} to clash over <b>referee</b> appointments. The dispute escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures.

The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as <b>referee</b> for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was well respected by the New Zealanders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{the study}} was to compare the perceptual {{abilities}} of top soccer <b>referees</b> and assistant <b>referees</b> at different levels of professional attainment. The sample consisted of FIFA and national level <b>referees</b> as well as assistant <b>referees.</b> Their perceptual abilities were assessed with a classical tool applied to measure psychomotor abilities in humans – the Toulouse- Pieron test. The results indicated that: perceptual abilities of assistant <b>referees</b> were definitely better than those of the <b>referees</b> (p< 0. 01). Top level <b>referees</b> demonstrated better perceptual abilities than first-league <b>referees</b> (p< 0. 01). The research results have proved that referees’ perceptual abilities differ depending on their function and professional level, while also indicating that the level of abilities may influence the number and correctness of decisions made during a game. It has been demonstrated that this elementary cognitive process may be strongly shaped by individual experience and age. This finding may be instrumental in screening <b>referees</b> and developing criteria for recruiting future <b>referees...</b>|$|R

There, Kong performed her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver on the <b>referee</b> and followed by hitting him with a steel chair. Kim took the steel chair from Kong, bashed her over the back and head with it, before getting a near-fall which was counted by a replacement <b>referee.</b> Kong then proceeded to try an Awesome Bomb on the second <b>referee,</b> but was stopped by Kim as she attempted a roll-up pin {{which led to the}} three count and the retaining of the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at twelve minutes and forty-four seconds. Following the contest, Kong and Kim fought at ringside before it was broken up by security.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} officiating soccer among Norwegian elite and non-elite <b>referees.</b> Eighty-three elite <b>referees</b> and 44 non-elite <b>referees</b> completed a web-based questionnaire (SurveyXact) that solicited their three main reasons for officiating soccer. The data were obtained by bracketing, intuiting, and describing their different reasons. Three main categories of descriptions emerged (percentage elite/non-elite) : passion-based motivations (57 / 25 %), social-based motivations (25 / 25 %), and fitness-based motivations (13 / 31 %). Norwegian elite <b>referees</b> are significantly more passion-based motivated than non-elite <b>referees</b> in the lower-level leagues. The prevalence of fitness-based motivations was significantly lower for elite <b>referees</b> than for non-elite <b>referees.</b> Social-based motivations had approximately the same importance for the two different groups of soccer <b>referees...</b>|$|R
