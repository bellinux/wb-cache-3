5000|$|The Company {{had been}} working toward {{completing}} the filing of its annual reports on Form 10-K and the subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The Company was unable to resolve certain items {{that would have a}} direct impact on the information required to be disclosed and the Company’s ability to file the report. The Company was initially delayed in filing these reports due to a number of unforeseen factors that impacted its ability to collect and prepare the required information and audit confirmations from third parties, delays connected with the acquisition, maintenance and divesture of the film libraries, the availability of certain professionals crucial to the timely completion of the annual and quarterly filings, the availability of funds, the acquisition and location of certain files and documents, operational issues, and the resolution of certain contemplated and filed legal actions by both the Company and by third parties, most of which were related directly and/or indirectly to the acquisition of the film libraries transaction. These and other factors has created a heavy <b>reporting</b> <b>burden</b> on the Company, requiring management to spend excessive time and effort preparing and reviewing old information instead of focusing on business operations and requiring the Company to spend more money on outside counsel and auditors to help prepare the reports.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the modern}} {{battlefield}} an intercom {{mounted in the}} crew helmet provides internal communications and {{a link to the}} radio network, and on some tanks an external intercom on the rear of the tank provides communication with co-operating infantry. Radio networks employ radio voice procedure to minimize confusion and [...] "chatter".A recent [...] development in AFV equipment and doctrine is integration of information from the fire control system, laser rangefinder, Global Positioning System and terrain information via hardened military specification electronics and a battlefield network to display information on enemy targets and friendly units on a monitor in the tank. The sensor data can be sourced from nearby tanks, planes, UAVs or, in the future infantry (such as the US Future Force Warrior project). This improves the tank commander's situational awareness and ability to navigate the battlefield and select and engage targets. In addition to easing the <b>reporting</b> <b>burden</b> by automatically logging all orders and actions, orders are sent via the network with text and graphical overlays. This is known as Network-centric warfare by the US, Network Enabled Capability (UK) or Digital Army Battle Management System צי"ד (Israel). Advanced battle tanks, including the K-2 Black Panther, have taken up the first major step forward in adopting a fully radar integrated Fire Control System which allows it to detect tanks from a further distance and identify it as a friend-or-foe as well as increasing the tank's accuracy as well as its capability to lock onto tanks.|$|E

However, {{little is known}} {{of the impact of}} the 3 main clinical variants of FTD— behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SemDem), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) —or the role of disease severity in caregiver burden. The Zarit Burden Inventory was used to measure caregiver burden of bvFTD (n= 17), SemDem (n= 20), PNFA (n= 20), and AD (n= 19) patients. Symptom duration, caregiver age, and relationship type were matched across groups. Moreover, a number of caregiver (mood, social network) and patient variables (functional disability, behavioral changes, relationship with caregiver, and dementia stage) were addressed to investigate their impact on caregiver burden. Caregivers of bvFTD patients <b>reported</b> the highest <b>burden,</b> whereas SemDem and PNFA caregivers <b>reported</b> <b>burden</b> similar to AD. A regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden in FTD, regardless of subtype, was explained by a model combining disease staging, relationship changes, and caregiver depression. Burden increased with disease severity in FTD. This study is the first to show that caregivers of SemDem, PNFA, and AD patients show similar burden, while confirming that bvFTD caregivers show higher burden than AD caregivers. More importantly, this study demonstrates that burden worsens with disease progression in FTD...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) reporting programs contain provisions to avoid excessive <b>reporting</b> <b>burdens</b> on affected sources while ensuring maximum reporting of significant emissions. Some programs specify an overall reporting threshold that determines {{whether or not the}} facility or organization must submit a report. Regardless of the reporting threshold, a reporting facility in most cases will have emission points that are significant emitters of GHG and a number of emission points that are relatively minor emitters compared to total facility emissions. In some cases, monitoring of minor emission points can be burdensome or infeasible. As a result, many reporting programs are designed so that the same level of effort is not always required for estimating, documenting, and reporting emissions from minor emission points as for the larger sources. 1 These provisions sometimes are referred to as “de minimis ” reporting provisions. To better understand the reporting issues for minor emission points, we analyzed the de minimis requirements of existing mandatory and voluntary GHG reporting programs in the U. S. and internationally. The de minimis requirements of these programs are summarized in Attachmen...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was conducted in the Psychiatry Department, Government Medical College, Amritsar. A sample size of 34 was taken who were primary caregivers (preferably parents or spouse) of schizophrenia patients diagnosed using ICD 10. Measures included caregiver’s demographic variables and caregiver’s burden using the Zarit burden interview and PANSS scale in patients. Statistical Analysis- Data was analysed using SPSS software version 21. RESULTS The mean age of the caregiver was 42 SD (12. 16) years. The majority of the caregivers were parents, married and employed. The mean average score of the responses to Zarit burden interview was (SD= 59. 52 ± 20. 92).
