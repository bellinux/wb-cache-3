5000|$|AVI is a subformat of the Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF),</b> which divides a file's {{data into}} blocks, or [...] "chunks." [...] Each [...] "chunk" [...] is {{identified}} by a FourCC tag. An AVI file {{takes the form}} of a single [...] "chunk" [...] in a <b>RIFF</b> <b>formatted</b> file, which is then subdivided into two mandatory [...] "chunks" [...] and one optional [...] "chunk".|$|R

50|$|As a {{derivative}} of the Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF),</b> AVI files are commonly tagged with metadata in the INFO chunk. In addition, AVI files can embed Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP). By design, any RIFF file can legally include additional chunks of data, each identified by a four-character code; software {{which does not}} understand that particular code should skip the chunk. As such, it is theoretically possible to expand any <b>RIFF</b> file <b>format,</b> including AVI, to support almost any conceivable metadata. Some {{of the limitations of}} AVI in modern use relate to a lack of standardization in this metadata (see Limitations below).|$|R
5000|$|By {{way of the}} <b>RIFF</b> <b>format,</b> the {{audio-visual}} data {{contained in}} the [...] "movi" [...] chunk can be encoded or decoded by software called a codec, which is an abbreviation for (en)coder/decoder. Upon creation of the file, the codec translates between raw data and the (compressed) data format used inside the chunk. An AVI file may carry audio/visual data inside the chunks in virtually any compression scheme, including Full Frame (Uncompressed), Intel Real Time (Indeo), Cinepak, Motion JPEG, Editable MPEG, VDOWave, ClearVideo / RealVideo, QPEG, and MPEG-4 Video.|$|E
40|$|This bachelorâ€™s thesis {{presents}} {{solution to}} requirement of implementation of digital metronome in VST technology. In the beginning, there is analysis of basic characteristics of digital metronome, {{that helps to}} suggest algorithm realizing digital metronome. Algorithm is encapsulated into C++ class with appropriate interface, which is suitable for usage in different technologies of digital sound signal processing. This way encapsulated metronome is implemented in VST technology as plug-in. For this reason, thesis contains a brief introduction to VST software development kit, definitions of its basic methods and way how to do graphical user interface of VST plug-in. For realizing of function enabling choice of any sound loaded from wav file, there is a description of <b>RIFF</b> <b>format,</b> that specifies the format of saving multimedia data into drive. Using this knowledge, the function of loading from wav file is implemented. In order to adjust sampling frequency of loaded sound, thesis deals with problems of sample rate conversion and implements resampling function...|$|E
5000|$|Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE, or more {{commonly}} known as WAV due to its filename extension) (rarely, Audio for Windows) is a Microsoft and IBM audio file format standard for storing an audio bitstream on PCs. It is an application of the Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF)</b> bitstream <b>format</b> method for storing data in [...] "chunks", and thus is also close to the 8SVX and the AIFF format used on Amiga and Macintosh computers, respectively. It is the main format used on Windows systems for raw and typically uncompressed audio. The usual bitstream encoding is the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format.|$|R

5000|$|The file itself {{consists}} of one RIFF chunk, which then can contain further subchunks: hence, {{the first four}} bytes of a correctly <b>formatted</b> <b>RIFF</b> file will spell out [...] "R", [...] "I", [...] "F", [...] "F".|$|R
50|$|The Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF)</b> is {{a generic}} file {{container}} format {{for storing data}} in tagged chunks. It is primarily used to store multimedia such as sound and video, though {{it may also be}} used to store any arbitrary data.|$|R
50|$|The QCP {{file format}} {{is used by}} many {{cellular}} telephone manufacturers to provide ring tones and record voice. It is based on <b>RIFF,</b> a generic <b>format</b> for storing chunks of data identified by tags. The QCP format does not specify how voice data in the file is encoded. Rather, it is a container format. QCP files are typically encoded QCELP or EVRC.|$|R
50|$|WebP's lossy {{compression}} algorithm {{is based on}} the intra-frame coding of the VP8 video format and the Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF)</b> as a container format. As such, it is a block-based transformation scheme with eight bits of color depth and a luminance-chrominance model with chroma subsampling by a ratio of 1:2 (YCbCr 4:2:0). Without further content, the mandatory RIFF container has an overhead of only twenty bytes, though it can also hold additional metadata. The side length of WebP images is limited to 16383 pixels.|$|R
50|$|VGMusic.com accepts remakes/covers, arrangements, and remixes {{of video}} game music in MIDI format. The MIDI {{sequences}} are typically General MIDI and GM2 standard, but sequences that use proprietary MIDI standards like Roland GS and Yamaha XG {{are also available}} on the site. Formerly <b>RIFF</b> MIDI (RMI) <b>format</b> sequences were also available, but currently only MIDI types 0 and 1 (MID) are available. The community is driven by a user-base of musicians from around the world, who transcribe the music into midi format by ear using sequencing software.|$|R
5000|$|In {{its first}} versions, the CDR file format was a {{completely}} proprietary file format primarily used for vector graphic drawings, recognizable by the first two bytes of the file being [...] "WL". Starting with CorelDraw 3, the file format changed to a Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF)</b> envelope, recognizable by the first four bytes of the file being [...] "RIFF", and a [...] "CDR*vrsn" [...] in bytes 9 to 15, with the asterisk [...] "*" [...] being in early versions just a blank. Beginning with CorelDraw 4 it included the version number of the writing program in hexadecimal ("4" [...] meaning version 4, [...] "D" [...] meaning version 14). The actual data chunk of the RIFF remains a Corel proprietary format.|$|R
5000|$|SMFs {{are created}} as an export format of {{software}} sequencers or hardware workstations. They organize MIDI messages into {{one or more}} parallel tracks, and timestamp the events {{so that they can}} be played back in sequence. A header contains the arrangement's track count, tempo and which of three SMF formats the file is in. A type 0 file contains the entire performance, merged onto a single track, while type 1 files may contain any number of tracks that are performed in synchrony. Type 2 files are rarely used and store multiple arrangements, with each arrangement having its own track and intended to be played in sequence.Microsoft Windows bundles SMFs together with Downloadable Sounds (DLS) in a Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF)</b> wrapper, as RMID files with a [...] extension. RIFF-RMID has been deprecated in favor of Extensible Music Files (XMF).|$|R
5000|$|One major {{uncompressed}} audio format, LPCM, is {{the same}} variety of PCM as used in Compact Disc Digital Audio and is the format most commonly accepted by low level audio APIs and D/A converter hardware. Although LPCM can be stored on a computer as a raw audio format, it is usually stored in a [...] file on Windows or in a [...] file on macOS. The AIFF format {{is based on the}} Interchange File Format (IFF), and the WAV format is based on the similar Resource Interchange File <b>Format</b> (<b>RIFF).</b> WAV and AIFF are designed to store a wide variety of audio formats, lossless and lossy; they just add a small, metadata-containing header before the audio data to declare the format of the audio data, such as LPCM with a particular sample rate, bit depth, endianness and number of channels. Since WAV and AIFF are widely supported and can store LPCM, they are suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the development of speech recognition front-end for segmenting and clustering continuous Bangla speech sentence to some predefined clusters. From the study of different previous research works it was observed that the front-end {{is an important part of}} any speech recognition system. In our work, the original speech sentences were recorded and stored as <b>RIFF</b> (. wav) file <b>format.</b> Then a segmentation approach was used to segment the continuous speech into uniquely identifiable and meaningful units. Among the different techniques, the word/sub-word segmentation is simple and produces very good results. This is why this technique was selected for speech segmentation to obtain improved performance. After segmentation, the segmented words were clustered into different clusters according to the number of syllables and the sizes of the segmented words. The test database contained 758 words/sub-words segmented from 120 sentences. Each sentence was recorded from six different speakers and saved as a different wave file. The developed system achieved the segmentation accuracy rate at about 95 %...|$|R
