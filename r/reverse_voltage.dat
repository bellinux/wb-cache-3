40|$|We present {{experimental}} and theoretical {{data on the}} charge collection properties of a 4 H-SiC epitaxial Schottky diode exposed to 5. 48 - and 2. 00 -MeV alpha particles. Hundred percent Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) is, in particular, demonstrated for the 2. 00 -MeV alpha particles at <b>reverse</b> <b>voltages</b> higher than 40 V. By comparing measured CCE values with the outcomes of drift-diffusion simulations, a value of 500 ns is inferred for the hole lifetime within the lowly doped, active layer of virgin samples.

25|$|The {{reverse bias}} {{rating of the}} N-drift region to {{collector}} P+ diode is usually only of tens of volts, so if the circuit application applies a <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> to the IGBT, an additional series diode must be used.|$|E
25|$|Tantalum {{capacitors}} {{are inherently}} polarized components. <b>Reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> or ripple currents higher than specified can destroy the dielectric {{and thus the}} capacitor.

For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5 V for types with a rated voltage ≤2.5V, or 2.1 to 2.5V for types with a rated voltage of >2.5V, may be applied during the measurement to avoid <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E

25|$|At a <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> {{lower than}} −1.5V at room temperature, the cathode {{aluminum}} foil begins {{to build up}} an oxide layer corresponding to the applied voltage. This is aligned with generating hydrogen gas with increasing pressure. At {{the same time the}} oxide layer on the anode foil begins dissolution of the oxide, which weakens the voltage proof. It is now a question of the outside circuit whether the increasing gas pressure from oxidization leads to bursting of the case, or the weakened anode oxide leads to a breakdown with a short circuit. If the outside circuit is high-ohmic the capacitor fails and the vent opens due to high gas pressure. If the outside circuit is low-ohmic, an internal short circuit is more probable. In every case a <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> lower than −1.5V at room temperature may cause the component to catastrophically fail due to a dielectric breakdown or overpressure, which causes the capacitor to burst, often in a spectacularly dramatic fashion. Modern electrolytic capacitors have a safety vent that is typically either a scored section of the case or a specially designed end seal to vent the hot gas/liquid, but ruptures can still be dramatic.|$|E
25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} are polarized capacitors {{and generally}} require an anode electrode voltage {{to be positive}} relative to the cathode voltage. However, the cathode foil of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is provided with a very thin, natural air-originated oxide layer. This oxide layer has a voltage proof of approximately 1 to 1.5V. Therefore, aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte can withstand a very small <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> and, for example, can be measured with an AC voltage of about 0.5V, as specified in relevant standards.|$|E
25|$|With a <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> applied, {{a reverse}} leakage current flows in very small areas of {{microcracks}} or other defects across the dielectric layer to the anode of the electrolytic capacitor. Although the current {{may only be}} a few microamps, it represents a very high localized current density which can cause a tiny hot-spot. This can cause some conversion of amorphous tantalum pentoxide to the more conductive crystalline form. When a high current is available, this effect can avalanche and the capacitor may become a total short.|$|E

This diode has a distinguishing anode structure and the relatively thick AlGaN barrier layer in contrast a conventional field-effect Schottky barrier diode (FESBD).

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of self-pulsation in monolithic multi segment GaN-based laser diodes (LDs) with integrated absorber, and operating at 410 nm is investigated. The bias-dependent modal absorption {{of the devices}} is determined by high resolution Hakki-Paoli gain spectroscopy. Using a streak camera detection system we measure the pulsation frequency, applying bias voltages up to - 40 V to the absorber section of the multi segment LD. Under moderate <b>reverse</b> <b>voltages,</b> to approximately - 15 V, the absorption features a quadratic dependence on the bias voltage with a clear minimum corresponding to the flat band conditions. In this regime we observe stabilized relaxation oscillations, with a pulse repetition rate which depends only on the current in the gain section, {{but not on the}} reverse bias in the absorber section. At higher <b>reverse</b> <b>voltages</b> a linear increase of the modal absorption is observed. There, the devices switch to the self-Q-switching regime which exhibits a linear decrease of the pulsation frequency with increasing reverse bias...|$|R
25|$|The {{capacitance}} value {{specified in}} the data sheets of the manufacturers is called rated capacitance CR or nominal capacitance CN and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100 to 120Hz. Electrolytic capacitors differ from other capacitor types, whose capacitances are typically measured at 1kHz or higher. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5V for types with a rated voltage of ≤2.5V or 2.1 to 2.5V for types with a rated voltage of >2.5V may be applied during the measurement to avoid <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|Special bipolar {{capacitors}} {{designed for}} AC operation, usually {{referred to as}} [...] "bipolar", [...] "non-polarized" [...] or [...] "NP" [...] types, are available. In these, the capacitors have two anode foils of opposite polarity connected in series. On each of the alternate halves of the AC cycle, one anode acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> from damaging the opposite anode. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not adaptable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized polymer film or paper dielectric.|$|E
2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called reverse {{breakdown}} occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The avalanche diode is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the Zener diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region.
