40|$|Williams Syndome (WS) is {{as complex}} neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} characterized by vascular and heart disease, mental retardation, characteristic facial features, and chararteristic personality. WS, {{which is usually}} sporadic, affects approximately 1 in 20, 000 live births and {{is caused by a}} particular deletion of about 1. 5 Mb of chromosome 7 q 11. 23. My lab has shed light on the anatomical and cognitive basis for WS. While WS patients have cognitive gifts, such as notable linguistic abilities, they also have deficits, such as visuospatial deficits. WS patients also show significant anatomical differences, with a reduces perimeter of the corpus collosum and amygdalar nuclei. The major current goal in the field is to connect the genetic basis to these anatomical and cognitive differences. About <b>28</b> genes <b>are</b> <b>deleted</b> in WS; four such genes are Elastin, Lim kinase, WSTF and GTF 21. An elastin deletion results in supravalcular aortic sclerosis (SVAS), which is commin in WS patients. Lim kinase absence affects actin polmerization and lamellipodia formation and may regulate abnormal synaptic development. WSTF deletion results in misregulation of chromatin remodeling and this may have profound consewuences during development. GTF absence explains the facial and skull abnormalities in WS. The impact of other gene deletions is poorly understood; thus, future work continues to focus on the relationship between genetics, the brain and cognition in relation to WS syndrome...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman SP-B is {{synthesized}} by the alveolar Type II {{epithelial cell}} as a 381 amino acid preproprotein. The 79 residue mature SP-B peptide is extremely hydrophobic and flanked by propeptides of 200 and 102 amino acids at its NH 2 - and COOH-termini, respectively. The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify peptide domains of the SP-B proprotein necessary for trafficking of the mature peptide in the secretory pathway. To this end several constructs were generated, by subcloning the full length human SP-B (SP-B), COOH-terminally truncated SP-B (SP-BΔC, in which residues 201 – 381 <b>were</b> <b>deleted),</b> NH 2 -terminally deleted SP-B (SP-BΔN, in which residues <b>28</b> – 200 <b>were</b> <b>deleted),</b> NH 2 -terminal propeptide (SP-BN), mature SP-B (SP-BM) and COOH-terminal propeptide (SP-BC), into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3. The resulting expression constructs were characterized by DNA sequencing and in vitro transcription/translation and subsequently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were labeled with [35 S]-met/cys and analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Proteins encoded by SP-B, SP-BΔC, SP-BN and SP-BC constructs were secreted into media; in contrast, SP-B constructs lacking the NH 2 -terminal propeptide (SP-BΔN) remained in the endoplasmic reticulum (as assessed by endoglycosidase H sensitivity) and were rapidly degraded. We conclude that (1) 27 amino acids at the NH 2 -terminus of SP-B contain a functional signal peptide and (2) the NH 2 -terminal propeptide of the SP-B precursor is necessary and sufficient for intracellular trafficking of the mature peptide...|$|R
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus of the herpes {{type that}} infects {{a high percentage}} of some populations. One of the most researched genes expressed by HCMV with close homology to human chemokine receptors <b>is</b> the US <b>28</b> G protein-coupled receptor. Study design: This study was initiated to elucidate the intracellular signalling pathways of an inflammatory factor (IL- 6) and an angiogenic factor (STAT 3) triggered by the viral US 28 oncogene and the presence of US 28 in the HCMV viral particle. These pathways were observed by introducing the US 28 gene into two human cell lines by infection with a HCMV strain that expresses the US 28 gene (wild type), and two HCMV strains where the US <b>28</b> gene <b>was</b> <b>deleted</b> (ÄUS <b>28</b> and ÄUS 28 /UL 33). Special attention was directed at the expression of IL- 6 after promotion of the US 28 gene and subsequent phosphorolation of STAT 3. A new US <b>28</b> antibody <b>was</b> validated and a method developed in an attempt to determine US 28 on the viral particle. The following techniques were applied: Cell culture work, two mammalian cell lines were used, HFF’s and U 373 MG. Virus stock titre determination to determine the multiplicity of infection. Protein quantitation to determine very small quantities of protein for Western blot analysis. ELISA for the quantitative determination of IL- 6. Western blotting for phospho- STAT 3 determination and validation of the US <b>28</b> antibody. Immunocytochemistry <b>was</b> used for back titrations of virally infected cells. Immunofluorescence assay and use of confocal microscopic techniques was used for the location of the US 28 gene in the virion and for tSTAT 3 translocation to the nucleus. Conclusion: A clear increase in IL- 6 secretion (495 % ± 1 %) was seen, and this was after only an hour in HCMV WT infected cells. From the increase in IL- 6 secretion a subsequent increase in STAT 3 phosphorylation was detected in the same samples. A clear link has been established between IL- 6 and STAT 3. A method to determine whether US <b>28</b> <b>was</b> present in the HCMV viral particle was designed and preliminary results obtained. The results were inclusive.

40|$|In primary human diploid fibroblasts, {{infection}} with an unpurified stock of human cytomegalovirus induced accumulation of the CC chemokine MCP- 1 {{in the cell}} culture medium. By 24 h postinfection, the level of MCP- 1 returned to that in uninfected cultures. When cells were infected with UV-inactivated human cytomegalovirus, the induction of MCP- 1 was still observed, but no reduction was seen by 24 h postinfection or later. This effect {{was the result of}} a decrease in the level of MCP- 1 mRNA present within the infected cell. Infection with purified virus revealed that the induction of MCP- 1 was due to an activity found in the medium of infected cells; purified virions did not induce the expression of MCP- 1. However, {{infection with}} purified virions repressed the level of MCP- 1 mRNA below that found in uninfected cells. Additionally, infection with human cytomegalovirus prevented the induction of MCP- 1 expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 1 β. The CC chemokine receptor encoded by the human cytomegalovirus US 28 open reading frame (ORF) did not appear to play a role in this process, since a mutant virus in which the US <b>28</b> ORF had <b>been</b> <b>deleted</b> downregulated MCP- 1 in the same manner...|$|R

40|$|Fermentation at low {{temperatures}} {{is one of}} the most popular current winemaking practices because of its reported positive impact on the aromatic profile of wines. However, low temperature is an additional hurdle to develop Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeasts, which are already stressed by high osmotic pressure, low pH and poor availability of nitrogen sources in grape must. Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation of S. cerevisiae to fermentation at low temperature would help to design strategies for process management, and to select and improve wine yeast strains specifically adapted to this winemaking practice. The problem has been addressed by several approaches in recent years, including transcriptomic and other high-throughput strategies. In this work we used a genome-wide screening of S. cerevisiae diploid mutant strain collections to identify genes that potentially contribute to adaptation to low temperature fermentation conditions. Candidate genes, impaired for growth at {{low temperatures}} (12 °C and 18 °C), but not at a permissive temperature (<b>28</b> °C), <b>were</b> <b>deleted</b> in an industrial homozygous genetic background, wine yeast strain FX 10, in both heterozygosis and homozygosis. Some candidate genes were required for growth at low temperatures only in the laboratory yeast genetic background, but not in FX 10 (namely the genes involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis). Other genes related to ribosome biosynthesis (SNU 66 and PAP 2) were required for low-temperature fermentation of synthetic must (SM) in the industrial genetic background. This result coincides with our previous findings about translation efficiency with the fitness of different wine yeast strains at low temperature.
