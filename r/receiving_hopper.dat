40|$|The {{winemaking}} technology plays a {{very important}} role in enology as it directly influences the characteristics of wine. In particular, grape transport and destemming are critical steps in winemaking for the wine quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare two different processing lines of Chardonnay grapes to evaluate their effects on the quality of the final product. In particular, grapes receiving, transporting and destemming were performed using different machines in order to evaluate their influence on the quality of Chardonnay wines. The use of a <b>receiving</b> <b>hopper</b> equipped with a belt conveyor, followed by a destemmer equipped with partially coated rubber beaters, allowed to obtain Chardonnay wines of overall higher quality than using a <b>receiving</b> <b>hopper</b> equipped with a screw conveyor, followed by a destemmer equipped with steel beaters. The results were supported by chemical analyses on musts and wines and by the sensory analysis of the wines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Air {{drilling}} {{technology has}} been widely used in {{the oil and gas}} exploration, coal, geothermal, geological exploration, nuclear industry and other fields due to its high drilling rate and low cost. However, the design of the pneumatic conveying system for the mineral detritus is still largely based on empiricism. The paper was set in the background of gas drilling, mainly studied the gas-solids two-phase flow characteristics in 90 degree bent annular pipe and backward-facing step of an annular pipe, which are very important parts of air drilling. They refer to the bent part and backward-facing step of an annular channel formed by the drill pipe and the borehole wall. A detailed numerical simulation and experimental studies were carried out for the flow structure and pressure losses of gas-solid two-phase in the annular pipe of gas drilling. Since a unified theory has not been developed for the two-phase flow in annular pipe, a lot of experimental work should be conducted. In the experimental research, the paper independently designed and built an annular pipe pneumatic conveying system with 90 degree bend and backward-facing step, including designing material screw feeder, material <b>receiving</b> <b>hopper,</b> pipeline, control system, data acquisition system, and etc. As known, many parameters, such as gas velocity, diameter and density of the particle, and solids loading ratio, can influence the conveying process. How these primordial influence factors act on th...|$|E

40|$|NASA {{has built}} a {{prototype}} oxygen production plant to process the lunar regolith using the hydrogen reduction chemical process. This plant is known as "ROxygen - making oxygen from moon rocks". The ROxygen regolith transfer team has identified the flow and transfer characteristics of lunar regolith simulant to be a concern for lunar oxygen production efforts. It is important to ISRU lunar exploration efforts to develop hardware designs that can demonstrate the ability to flow and transfer a given mass of regolith simulant to a desired vertical height under lunar gravity conditions in order to introduce it into a reactor. We will present results obtained under both 1 / 6 -g and 1 -g gravity conditions for a system that can pneumatically convey 16. 5 kg of lunar regolith simulant (NU-LHT- 2 M, Mauna Kea Tephra, and JSC- 1 A) from a flat-bottom supply hopper to a simulated ISRU reactor (dual-chambered <b>receiving</b> <b>hopper)</b> where the granular material is separated from the convey gas (air) using a series of cyclone separators, {{one of which is}} an electrically enhanced cyclone separator (electrocyclone). The results of our study include (1) the mass flow rate as a function of input air pressure for lunar regolith simulants that are conveyed pneumatically as a dusty gas in a vertical direction against gravity under lunar gravity conditions (for NU-LHT- 2 M and Mauna Kea Tephra), and under earth gravity conditions (for NU-LHT- 2 M, Mauna Kea Tephra and JSC- 1 A), and (2) the efficiency of the cyclone/electrocyclone filtration system in separating the convey gas (air) from the granular particulates as a function of particle size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Millmerran Power Station (MPS) {{consists}} of two units with each unit producing 420 MW of electricity. The coal is delivered to the plant by off road type trucks and unloaded into a 500 MT hopper. The ROM (run of mine) coal is processed {{through a series of}} crushing stations and coal handling (storage/reclaim) systems, and delivered by overland conveyor to the power plant silos. MPS, as a coal fired station, is wholly dependent on a consistent and reliable supply of coal to maintain operating efficiency. MPS has been experiencing inefficiencies in their ROM coal supply because of constant blockage issues at the <b>receiving</b> <b>hopper.</b> This blockage {{is a direct result of}} large lumps of coal coming from the mine. The blockages interrupt the supply of coal potentially lowering the fuel supply to the power station. Currently, an excavator is hired to clear up the blockage which could be utilised more effectively elsewhere. This introduces an extra cost to the mine in terms of both money and inefficiency. MPS is seeking an engineering design solution to this problem. The elimination of the blockages through an automatic system without increasing any safety risks is highly desirable as that would result in a cheaper and smoother operation of the mine. A literature review on the current coal handling system of MPS was essential in order to be able to develop a design that is suitable for MPS. In this investigation, five conceptual designs with the most appropriate design, in terms of meeting the specified criteria, was analysed and detailed. It was found that the simpler and more effective the design, the higher its practicality in terms of reaching the desired objectives. This enabled an overall cost estimate budget to be produced, which would be the major deciding factor on the implementation of the design. The results of this investigation will aid in gaining an understanding of the overall general solution for the ROM coal blockage problem at MPS. Both design and engineering solutions have been recommended in this dissertation. This will lead eventually to a more automated, safer, efficient and cost effective operating environment...|$|E
