5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} <b>radio</b> <b>compass.</b> In Number 2, the <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|Two-seat trainer version. Armament {{reduced to}} a single 20mm gun and the oil cooler was {{relocated}} underneath the engine cowling. Fitted with a <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> and gun camera. Considerably heavier than the fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.|$|E
5|$|A letter Hess {{wrote to}} his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows {{that in spite of}} not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a <b>radio</b> <b>compass,</b> modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E
50|$|In 1944 Fairchild {{changed the}} company name from Fairchild Aviation to Fairchild Camera and Instrument Company. Its product {{portfolio}} expanded during World War II from aerial photography equipment to include machine gun cameras, x-ray cameras, radar cameras, gun synchronizers, and <b>radio</b> <b>compasses.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with <b>radios,</b> <b>compasses</b> and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|R
50|$|In January 1922 Renshaw {{calibrated}} <b>radio</b> <b>compasses</b> for the 12th Naval District. She {{returned to}} San Diego 28 January and remained moored, {{except for a}} brief trip to San Pedro 20-24 February, until decommissioned 27 May 1922. The destroyer was laid up at San Diego until disposed of in 1936 {{in accordance with the}} London Naval Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament. She was struck from the Navy list 19 May 1936, sold 29 September to Schiavone Bonomo Corporation, and reduced to a hulk 2 December 1936.|$|R
5|$|Next, she put in {{for repairs}} at Norfolk, Virginia until 8 March, {{when she left}} for fleet {{exercises}} near Cuba. Following this, Harding left for New York, arriving there on 14 April. On 1 May, she departed {{as part of a}} group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC seaplanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Harding provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and Harding rendered assistance to NC-1 before it sank. NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as she took off for the last leg of her journey, Harding got underway to provide <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, Harding visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, Harding was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises.|$|E

25|$|Various {{avionics}} {{were installed}} on the Canberra, many of these had their origins within the Second World War. Such systems include Gee-H navigation, Rebecca beacon-interrogation distance-measuring equipment, very high frequency (VHF) radio, <b>radio</b> <b>compass,</b> radar altimeter, {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF), and Orange Putter radar warning receiver. Perhaps the most crucial of the mission systems was the HS2 automatic radar bombsight, which was mounted in the nose; delays {{in the development of the}} HS2 model intended for the Canberra led to early models being fitted with a T.2 optical sight for visual bombing in its place, which was considerably inferior to the radar-guided counterpart when attacking ground targets while flying at high altitudes.|$|E
5000|$|From 1917-1920 Ballantine {{attended}} Drexel Institute {{and worked}} as a radio expert at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where he led design of the Navy coil-type <b>radio</b> <b>compasses.</b> He discovered the [...] "antenna effect" [...] in such systems and invented the capacity compensator for its control. In 1920-1921 he undertook graduate studies in mathematical physics at Harvard University, then spent a year at the Radio Frequency Laboratories in Boonton, New Jersey, where he worked on radio receivers and made inventions for stabilization of radio-frequency amplifiers via a Wheatstone bridge, linear detection at high signal levels, and automatic volume control. He returned to Harvard 1923-1924 as a John Tyndall scholar in physics.|$|R
500|$|Northolt {{became an}} active base during the Second World War for Royal Air Force and Polish Air Force squadrons in their defence of the United Kingdom. It {{was the first}} RAF station to operate the Hawker Hurricane, with No.111 Squadron {{receiving}} the first four aircraft in December 1937, and reaching its full complement by February 1938. In the lead-up to war, the RAF implemented a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields. As a result, by 1939 Northolt had a new [...] concrete runway. Later in 1939 RAF Hendon became one of its satellite airfields. Polish pilots were taught English at RAF Uxbridge, where they also practised formation flying using tricycles with <b>radios,</b> <b>compasses</b> and speed indicators.|$|R

25|$|The {{commission}} {{concluded that}} the probable cause of the accident was a navigational error which must have taken place before the aircraft had descended to 1,100meters (3,500ft). No technical faults were found with the aircraft. The report stated {{that there were some}} shortcomings in crew procedures: a measurement for direction control had been moved to a less visible location, a <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> was set at the wrong frequency so it received bearings from Lahti, a conversation related to the holidays with air traffic control and that the captain was not as rested as he could have been according to regulations. The commission could not find that the weather or the wind was a contributing cause, although the darkness and fog could have hindered the crew from gaining a visual cue to their location.|$|E
25|$|Sigurd was {{interested}} in all-weather navigation systems, and suggested to Russell that together they could create a radio-based technology using microwaves that could detect airplanes at night or in clouds. Russell agreed, and they both quit their jobs, {{set up their own}} lab at Halcyon, and began developing plans for a device that could precisely determine the location and direction of an airplane. They initially attempted to create a <b>radio</b> <b>compass,</b> but could not develop a successful design, partly as a consequence of their isolation. They ultimately sought assistance from Russell's college roommate, William Webster Hansen, who was by then a professor at Stanford. With Hansen's help, they {{came to the attention of}} the head of the Stanford physics department, David Webster, who hired them in 1936 to work at the University in exchange for lab space, $100 a year for supplies, and an agreement that Stanford University would have half of the royalties for any patents they obtained.|$|E
500|$|McKenzie told a {{journalist}} that, after the war, [...] "All the airmen {{came back and}} wanted to join Qantas, but they needed to build up their Morse speed and learn to use the modern equipment." [...] The Department of Civil Aviation fitted out {{a room at the}} school with transmitters, receivers and <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> so that pilots could train for their wireless ticket at the school. From 1948, McKenzie held a First Class Flight Radio Telephony Operator License.|$|E
50|$|The {{studios of}} <b>radio</b> station <b>Compass</b> FM 104.9 are {{situated}} in Rangiora. Compass FM 104.9 is a not-for-profit community station covering the North Canterbury region of New Zealand. From a transmitter atop Mount Grey, the station {{can be heard}} over much of North Canterbury, including the Waimakariri District, much of the Hurunui District and Selwyn District, and in greater Christchurch.|$|R
50|$|In use, the RDF {{operator}} {{would first}} tune {{the receiver to}} the correct frequency, then manually turn the loop, either listening or watching an S meter to determine {{the direction of the}} null (the direction at which a given signal is weakest) of a long wave (LW) or medium wave (AM) broadcast beacon or station (listening for the null is easier than listening for a peak signal, and normally produces a more accurate result). This null was symmetrical, and thus identified both the correct degree heading marked on the <b>radio's</b> <b>compass</b> rose as well as its 180-degree opposite. While this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft, the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction. By taking bearings to two or more broadcast stations and plotting the intersecting bearings, the navigator could locate the relative position of his ship or aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{success at}} tracking and controlling wireless signals {{relied on the}} antennas’ physical configuration and motion. The German inventor and physicist Karl F. Braun demonstrated beamforming {{for the first time}} in 1905. Braun created a phased array by positioning three antennas to reinforce radiation in one direction and diminish radiation in other directions. Guglielmo Marconi experimented with directional antennas in 1906.Directional antennas were rotated to detect and track enemy forces during World War I. The British admiralty used goniometers (<b>radio</b> <b>compasses)</b> to track the German fleet. [...] Edwin H. Armstrong invented the superheterodyne receiver to detect the high frequency noise generated by German warplanes’ ignition systems. The war ended before Armstrong’s creation was ready to help direct antiaircraft fire.Multiple elements (a fed dipole, a director, and reflectors) were assembled in the 1920s to create narrow transmit and receive antenna patterns. The Yagi-Uda array, better known as the Yagi antenna, is still widely used. Edmond Bruce and Harald T. Friis developed directional antennas for shortwave and microwave frequencies during the 1930s.|$|R
500|$|The {{navigation}} and bombing system (NBS) comprised an H2S Mk9 radar and a navigation bombing computer (NBC) Mk1. Other navigation aids included a Marconi <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> (ADF), GEE Mk3, Green Satin Doppler radar {{to determine the}} groundspeed and drift angle, radio and radar altimeters, and an instrument landing system. TACAN replaced GEE in the B.1A and B.2 in 1964 [...] Decca Doppler 72 replaced Green Satin in the B.2 around 1969 [...] A continuous display of the aircraft's position was maintained by a ground position indicator (GPI).|$|E
2500|$|At sunset, Maitland {{climbed the}} Bird of Paradise to an {{altitude}} of [...] to place it above the clouds, where Hegenberger could frequently check their position by star sightings. At 1:00a.m. Hegenberger made another attempt to acquire a <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> reading {{and picked up the}} signal from the Maui transmitter. He found that the Bird of Paradise was south (left) of its course, instead of north (right) as they had thought. The Maui signal guided them for forty minutes before cutting out entirely.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{possibility}} of mistaken location {{was supported by}} statements of other Aero O/Y pilots who claimed that the radio transmitter beacon [...] "Locator S" [...] had given wrong readings to the airplane <b>radio</b> <b>compass.</b> This wrong reading may have given an impression that the airplane has passed the beacon earlier {{than it did in}} reality. However, the investigation board had stated it was unlikely as Flight 217 flew very close to the beacon which meant the signal must have been strong and that the likely reason was the pilots' misconception of the altitude instead.|$|E
