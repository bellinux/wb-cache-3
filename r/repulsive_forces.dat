5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E
5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E

25|$|There are few {{instances}} wherein the Casimir effect can {{give rise to}} <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> between uncharged objects. Evgeny Lifshitz showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> can arise. This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz {{was carried out by}} Munday et al. Other scientists have also suggested the use of gain media to achieve a similar levitation effect, though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium (Kramers–Kronig relations). Casimir and Casimir-Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al.|$|E

25|$|A {{covalent}} bond, {{also called}} a molecular bond, is a chemical bond {{that involves the}} sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain {{the equivalent of a}} full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{isoelectric point}} (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces.</b> Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium caseinate, is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E

30|$|The Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) {{theory of}} colloid {{stability}} {{is commonly used}} to describe the particle–substrate interfacial interactions in the base fluid [25]. In this theory, both an attractive <b>force</b> and a <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> existing between particles account for the stability of particles in the base fluid. The attractive force, also called the van der Waals force, includes attractions between atoms, molecules and surfaces. It grows with the length of the nonpolar part of the substance. The van der Waals force is relatively weak compared to normal chemical bond. The <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> arises from the overlap of electrical double layers that appear on the surfaces of particles when they are placed into the base fluid. The overlap of their double layers interrupts their own electrostatic stability and the electrostatic repulsion causes the <b>repulsive</b> <b>force,</b> when two particles get too close together. Particles in the base fluid can keep stable if the <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> is stronger than the attractive force. Otherwise, particles will aggregate. Serious aggregation of particles may lead to the sedimentation of particles.|$|R

In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R {{in such a way}} that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992), and Jalal and Krarup (2003).

2500|$|The {{presence}} of surface charge imbalance {{means that the}} objects will exhibit attractive or <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces.</b> This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact electrification and the triboelectric effect. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates {{a great amount of}} static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed {{one on top of the}} other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. [...] Some examples of these substances are rubber, plastic, glass, and pith. Conductive objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Static electric generators, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.|$|E
