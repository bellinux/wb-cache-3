5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive <b>rent-seeking</b> behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, <b>rent-seeking,</b> and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, investable funds became {{increasingly}} concentrated {{in a single}} institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to <b>rent-seeking.</b> Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets {{was a result of}} crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, a sultan {{gave in to}} the {{pressures}} of the Corps and permitted Janissary children to become members of the Corps, a practice strictly forbidden for the previous 300 years. They also became <b>rent-seeking</b> and sought protection of their special rights and advantages. According to paintings of the era, they were also permitted to grow beards. Consequently, the formerly strict rules of succession became open to interpretation. While they advanced their own power, the Janissaries also helped to keep the system from changing in other progressive ways, and according to some scholars the corps was most responsible for the political stagnation of Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{insurance}} products and practices {{have been described}} as <b>rent-seeking</b> by critics. That is, some {{insurance products}} or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under United States tax law, for example, most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can invest their premium payments in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.|$|E

2500|$|Economist Joseph Stiglitz {{argues that}} rather than {{explaining}} concentrations of wealth and income, market forces {{should serve as a}} brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as [...] "rent-seeking". [...] While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them. [...] This process, known to economists as <b>rent-seeking,</b> brings income not from creation of wealth but from [...] "grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{there are}} {{economies of scale}} in production, it is {{possible}} that countries may become 'locked into' disadvantageous patterns of trade. Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality. Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms. Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization. He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations <b>rent-seeking</b> advantages if [...] "strategic industries" [...] can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "political model" [...] – termed so by Meyer and Gupta {{because it}} [...] "operates most openly in government, where {{a change in}} regime is {{followed}} swiftly by changes in policy and criteria used to assess policy outcomes" [...] (1994, p.354) – has organizations seeking to maximize {{a specific set of}} performance measures. Under this model, though, metrics are defined by the top-level managers' preferences. Performance criteria and the measurement thereof are generally consistent within regimes; however, as the regimes themselves change over from one to the other, so do these measures. So while this model incorporates changing performance measures like performance paradox, because change is associated with some level of disruption and instability, agents view change in performance measures negatively and seek to avoid it. Furthermore, maximizing on performance measures is unlikely to bring about entirely positive outcomes because executive agents generally set goals while engaging in <b>rent-seeking,</b> using power to advance their own interests (whether they be acquiring more power, money etc.).|$|E
2500|$|Economist Arnold Kling {{said the}} bill [...] "maximizes <b>rent-seeking</b> (favoritism toward {{particular}} businesses) and minimizes carbon reduction". Other economists {{have argued that}} the bill will create significant financial costs. The Wall Street Journal accused the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of significantly underestimating the bill's ultimate costs, pointing out supposed flaws in its calculations. The Wall Street Journal also suggested that the bill's costs would disproportionately affect lower-income households, for which the CBO estimates did not account. The New York Times reported that the bill's provisions to levy tariffs on Chinese imports due to carbon emissions could provoke a trade war. The Competitive Enterprise Institute argued that the bill was essentially the [...] "largest tax hike in world history". The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the petroleum and natural gas industry, said the bill would place [...] "disproportionate burden on all consumers of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, propane and other petroleum products", and by 2035, it would cause gasoline prices in excess of $4.00 per gallon by today's standards.|$|E
2500|$|When a non-Muslim boy was {{recruited}} under the devşirme system, he would first {{be sent to}} selected Turkish families in the provinces to learn Turkish, the rules of Islam (i.e. to be converted to Islam) and the customs and cultures of Ottoman society. After completing this period, acemi (new recruit) boys were gathered for training at the Enderun [...] "acemi oğlan" [...] school in the capital city. There, young cadets would be selected for their talents in different areas to train as engineers, artisans, riflemen, clerics, archers, artillery, and so forth. Janissaries trained under strict discipline with hard labour and in practically monastic conditions in acemi oğlan ("rookie" [...] or [...] "cadet") schools, where {{they were expected to}} remain celibate. Unlike other Muslims, they were expressly forbidden to wear beards, only a moustache. These rules were obeyed by Janissaries, at least until the 18th century when they also began to engage in other crafts and trades, breaking another of the original rules. In the late 16th century a sultan gave in to the pressures of the Janissary Corps and permitted Janissary children to become members of the Corps, a practice strictly forbidden for 300 years. They also became <b>rent-seeking</b> and set goals to protect their special rights and advantages. Consequently, succession rules, formerly strict, became open to interpretation.

50|$|<b>Rent-seeking</b> {{can prove}} costly to {{economic}} growth; high <b>rent-seeking</b> activity makes more <b>rent-seeking</b> attractive {{because of the}} natural and growing returns that one sees {{as a result of}} <b>rent-seeking.</b> Thus organizations value <b>rent-seeking</b> over productivity. In this case there are very high levels of <b>rent-seeking</b> with very low levels of output. <b>Rent-seeking</b> may grow at the cost of economic growth because <b>rent-seeking</b> by the state can easily hurt innovation.

Similarly, taxpayers lobby for loopholes and will spend the value of those loopholes, again, to obtain those loopholes (again absent collective-action constraints).
