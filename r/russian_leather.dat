6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you something," [...] he said, and gave Thirlwell a small <b>Russian</b> <b>leather</b> wallet. It was well made, but worn and stained {{as if it had}} been soaked in water. [...] "I found this when I undressed Driscoll," [...] he went on. [...] "It is not a thing you would expect a rude {{prospector}} to carry. But I found something else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have it all}} here," [...] said Gregson, {{pointing}} to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. [...] "A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes. <b>Russian</b> <b>leather</b> card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money {{to the extent of}} seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio's 'Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson." ...|$|E
60|$|The pocket-book {{contained}} {{a roll of}} Russian notes {{to the value of}} a thousand pounds. Julian felt that there was indeed nothing to do but, as the letter said, to accept the presents in the spirit in which they were made. Everything showed that thoughtful kindness had been exercised. On the dressing-table stood a superb travelling-case of <b>Russian</b> <b>leather,</b> fitted with all necessaries of the toilet in ivory, mounted with silver, and with his initials engraved upon the back of the various brushes. Hitherto he had made no attempt to remove the soft brown beard that had grown untouched from the day when the army had turned its back upon Moscow. He now set to and shaved himself, and then dressed for dinner. In glancing at one of the long cheval glasses in the room, he could not but feel a distinct satisfaction at his appearance. Except in shop windows in Germany, he had not, since he left home, had the opportunity of seeing more of himself than could be gathered from the tiny glass that formed part of his kit.|$|E
50|$|First Republic of Czechoslovakia {{brought the}} Engelmüller brand its heyday. Its shops offered leather suits, caps, gloves and {{trousers}} {{made of the}} best <b>Russian</b> and Swedish <b>leather.</b> Its advertisements appeared {{in the majority of}} motoring and society magazines, such as Automobil, Motor Revue or Touch of society. Engelmüller gloves were worn by car racing driver Eliška Junková, by Czech aerobatics legend František Novák, actress Lída Baarová and many others. Engelmüller glove styles were also popular with international automobile racing stars such as Tazio Nuvolari, Louis Chiron and Bernd Rosemeyer.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, I {{have had}} to quote his own advice against him; for I have refused Lord Chalkclere after all. I told him (C. not S.) that he was much too good for me: far too perfect and {{complete}} a person; that I preferred a husband whom I could break in for myself, even though {{he gave me a}} little trouble. Scoutbush was cross at first; but he said afterwards that it was just like Baby Blake (the wretch always calls me Baby Blake now, after that dreadful girl in Lever's Novel); and I told him frankly that it was, if he meant that I had sooner break in a thorough-bred for myself, even though I had a fall or two in the process, than jog along on the most finished little pony on earth, who would never go out of an amble. Lord Chalk may be very finished, and learned, and excellent, and so forth: but, ma chère, I want, not a white rabbit (of which he always reminds me), but a hero, even though he be a naughty one. I always fancy people must be very little if they can be finished off so rapidly; if there was any real verve in them, they would take somewhat longer to grow. Lord Chalk would do very well to bind in <b>Russian</b> <b>leather,</b> and put on one's library shelves, to be consulted when one forgot a date; but really even your Ulysses of a doctor--provided, of course, he turned out a prince in disguise, and don't leave out his h's--would be more to the taste of your naughtiest of sisters." ...|$|E

50|$|The McCune {{home site}} {{was chosen to}} rise up impressively over the nearby streets, and little expense was spared on decoration. McCune had {{mahogany}} shipped from San Domingo, oak from England, and a rare white-grained mahogany from South Africa. The red roof tiles came from the Netherlands, and an enormous broad mirror wall was transported from Germany in a specially made railroad car. The walls were adorned with moiré silks, tapestries, and <b>Russian</b> <b>leather.</b> The exterior of the home was built of red Utah sandstone although some details like the lavish fireplaces used more exotic stone like Nubian marble. The home was completed in 1901 {{at a cost of}} one million dollars.|$|E
50|$|The city {{is located}} near the {{international}} border between Iran and Iraq, Khosravi border terminal. The famed Silk Road passes through Ghasr-e Shirin, connecting the highlands of the Iranian Plateau through a natural opening in the Zagros mountain chain with the lowland Mesopotamia and whence, the Levant and the Mediterranean basin. Being at the foothills of Zagros has made the city an important trade connection. For centuries the town has hosted the caravans of Silks and goods from far east to Arabia and Byzantium and up until 1980, when the Iran - Iraq war devastated the area, Qasr-e Shirin had a large secondhand clothes market where items, ranging from American plaid jackets to <b>Russian</b> <b>leather</b> military motorcycle coats, could be obtained. The Jews were first forced to migrate to East through Ghasr-e Shirin during ruling of Assyrian Empire in 800 BC.|$|E
