50|$|<b>Rudivirus</b> is a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the order}} Ligamenvirales; {{it is the only}} genus in the family Rudiviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped, stiff-rod-shaped viruses with linear dsDNA genomes, that infect hyperthermophilic archaea of the kingdom Crenarchaeota. There are {{currently}} three species in this genus including the type species Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2. The family name derives from the Latin rudis, thin rod, referring to the virion shape.|$|E
40|$|The Rudiviridae are {{a family}} of {{rod-shaped}} archaeal viruses with covalently closed, linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes. Their replication mechanisms remain obscure, although parallels have been drawn to the Poxviridae and other large cytoplasmic eukaryotic viruses. Here we report that a protein encoded in the 34 -kbp genome of the <b>rudivirus</b> SIRV 1 {{is a member of}} the replication initiator (Rep) superfamily of proteins, which initiate rolling-circle replication (RCR) of diverse viruses and plasmids. We show that SIRV Rep nicks the viral hairpin terminus, forming a covalent adduct between an active-site tyrosine and the 5 ′ end of the DNA, releasing a 3 ′ DNA end as a primer for DNA synthesis. The enzyme can also catalyze the joining reaction that is necessary to reseal the DNA hairpin and terminate replication. The dimeric structure points to a simple mechanism through which two closely positioned active sites, each with a single tyrosine residue, work in tandem to catalyze DNA nicking and joining. We propose a novel mechanism for <b>rudivirus</b> DNA replication, incorporating the first known example of a Rep protein that is not linked to RCR. The implications for Rep protein function and viral replication are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecently {{a unique}} {{mechanism}} of virion release {{was discovered in}} Archaea, different from lysis and egress systems of bacterial and eukaryotic viruses.

Here we present results of a protein analysis of Sulfolobus islandicus cells infected with the <b>rudivirus</b> SIRV 2, which enable us to postulate SIRV 2 -encoded protein P 98 as the major constituent of these exceptional cellular ultrastructures...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhile {{studying}} {{gene expression}} of the <b>rudivirus</b> SIRV 1 in cells of its host, the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus, a novel archaeal transcriptional regulator was isolated. The 14 kDa protein, termed Sulfolobus transcription activator 1, Sta 1, is encoded on the host chromosome. Its activating effect on transcription initiation from viral promoters was demonstrated in in vitro transcription experiments using a reconstituted host system containing the RNA polymerase, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor B (TFB).

40|$|International audienceThe 2 465 177 bp genome of Sulfolobus islandicus LAL 14 / 1, host of {{the model}} <b>rudivirus</b> SIRV 2, was sequenced. Exhaustive {{comparative}} genomic analysis of S. islandicus LAL 14 / 1 and the nine other completely sequenced S. islandicus strains isolated from Iceland, Russia and USA revealed a highly syntenic common core genome of approximately 2 Mb and a long hyperplastic region containing most of the strain-specific genes. In LAL 14 / 1, the latter region is enriched in insertion sequences, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), glycosyl transferase genes, toxin-antitoxin genes and MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements). The tRNA genes of LAL 14 / 1 are preferential targets for the integration of mobile elements but clusters of atypical genes (CAG) are also integrated elsewhere in the genome. LAL 14 / 1 carries five CRISPR loci with 10 per cent of spacers matching perfectly or imperfectly the genomes of archaeal viruses and plasmids found in the Icelandic hot springs. Strikingly, the CRISPR_ 2 region of LAL 14 / 1 carries an unusually long 1. 9 kb spacer interspersed between two repeat regions and displays a high similarity to pING 1 -like conjugative plasmids. Finally, we have developed a genetic system for S. islandicus LAL 14 / 1 and created ΔpyrEF and ΔCRISPR_ 1 mutants using double cross-over and pop-in/pop-out approaches, respectively. Thus, LAL 14 / 1 is a promising model to study virus-host interactions and the CRISPR/Cas defence mechanism in Archaea...|$|E
40|$|A newly {{characterized}} archaeal <b>rudivirus</b> Stygiolobus rod-shaped virus (SRV), which infects a hyperthermophilic Stygiolobus species, {{was isolated}} from a hot {{spring in the}} Azores, Portugal. Its virions are rod-shaped, 702 (+/- 50) by 22 (+/- 3) nm in size, and nonenveloped and carry three tail fibers at each terminus. The linear double-stranded DNA genome contains 28, 096 bp and an inverted terminal repeat of 1, 030 bp. The SRV shows morphological and genomic similarities to the other characterized rudiviruses Sulfolobus rod-shaped virus 1 (SIRV 1), SIRV 2, and Acidianus rod-shaped virus 1, isolated from hot acidic springs of Iceland and Italy. The single major rudiviral structural protein is shown to generate long tubular structures in vitro of similar dimensions {{to those of the}} virion, and we estimate that the virion constitutes a single, superhelical, double-stranded DNA embedded into such a protein structure. Three additional minor conserved structural proteins are also identified. Ubiquitous rudiviral proteins with assigned functions include glycosyl transferases and a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, as well as a Holliday junction resolvase, a transcriptionally coupled helicase and nuclease implicated in DNA replication. Analysis of matches between known crenarchaeal chromosomal CRISPR spacer sequences, implicated in a viral defense system, and rudiviral genomes revealed that about 10 % of the 3, 042 unique acidothermophile spacers yield significant matches to rudiviral genomes, with a bias to highly conserved protein genes, consistent with the widespread presence of rudiviruses in hot acidophilic environments. We propose that the 12 -bp indels which are commonly found in conserved rudiviral protein genes may be generated as a reaction to the presence of the host CRISPR defense system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel virus, AFV 1, of the hyperthermophilic archaeal genus Acidianus. Filamentous virions {{are covered with}} a lipid envelope and contain at least five different proteins with molecular masses {{in the range of}} 23 – 130 kDa and a 20. 8 -kb-long linear double-stranded DNA. The virus has been assigned to the family Lipothrixviridae on the basis of morphotypic characteristics. Host range is confined to several strains of Acidianus and the virus persists in its hosts in a stable carrier state. The latent period of virus infection is about 4 h. Viral DNA was sequenced and sequence similarities were found to the lipothrixvirus SIFV, the <b>rudiviruses</b> SIRV 1 and SIRV 2, as well as to conjugative plasmids and chromosomes of the genus Sulfolobus. Exceptionally for the linear genomes of archaeal viruses, many short direct repeats, with the sequence TTGTT or close variants thereof, are closely clustered over 300 bp {{at each end of the}} genome.

40|$|The {{double-stranded}} DNA genomes of the crenarchaeal <b>rudiviruses</b> SIRV 1 (32 kb) and SIRV 2 (35 kb) {{were previously}} sequenced. Here we present {{results of the}} analysis of gene expression of these viruses at different time points after infection of the host cell, Sulfolobus islandicus, and of the mapping of transcriptional start sites. Transcription of both genomes starts simultaneously at multiple sites spread over the total length of the genome and from both strands. The earliest time point when viral transcripts could be detected in cells was 30 min after infection. At this time point all the viral genes, except one, were transcribed. Many genes were clustered {{and appeared to be}} transcribed as polycistronic messengers. Although the coat protein-encoding gene was initially also transcribed as a polycistronic messenger, an abundant monocistronic transcript of this gene was detected 2 to 3 h after infection, just before assembly of viral particles. The expression of a single gene, adjacent to the coat protein gene, was upregulated at the late phase of infection, suggesting that it might be involved in specific processing and activation of the coat protein messenger. Start sites of 13 transcripts from the SIRV 1 genome have been mapped by primer extension, and promoter sequences have been identified. Similar to host promoters, these viral promoters all contain potential binding sites for the archaeal transcription factors TATA binding protein and transcription factor B. In addition, most of them contain a virus-specific consensus element, suggesting the involvement of alternative transcription factors...|$|R
