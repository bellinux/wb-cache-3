25|$|Cooper's accomplishments (along {{with his}} widely noted and {{appealing}} personality) were {{depicted in the}} 1983 film The <b>Right</b> <b>Stuff</b> {{in which he was}} portrayed by actor Dennis Quaid. Cooper worked closely with the production company on this project and reportedly, every line uttered by Quaid is attributable to Cooper's recollection. Quaid met with Cooper before the casting call and rapidly learned his mannerisms. Quaid also had his hair cut and dyed to match how the former astronaut's hair looked during the 1950s and 1960s. Cooper was later depicted in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, in which his character was played by Robert C. Treveiler. Cooper appeared as himself in an episode of the television series CHiPs and during the early 1980s made regular call-in appearances on Late Night with David Letterman.
