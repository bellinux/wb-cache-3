50|$|Train 2D57, the 19:09 {{service from}} London Waterloo to Effingham Junction, became derailed on the {{approach}} to Epsom at about 19:42 on Tuesday 12 September 2006. The train was formed of two four-car class 455 electric multiple units (EMUs). The leading bogie of the fourth coach was derailed towards the left as it passed over a set of trailing points on a right-hand curve at about 17 miles per hour (27 km/h). The train {{came to a stop}} partially in Epsom station, and passengers were quickly evacuated onto the platform. There were no injuries, and there was only minor damage to the train and the track.As the train approached Epsom, the driver shut off power and reduced speed to complywith the 20 mph permanent speed restriction round the curve into the station, entering thecurve at 19.2 mph (30.9 km/h). He felt a judder, and looked back, observing blue flashesand smoke {{from the rear of the}} train. He assumed there was a fault with the train, andattempted to coast into the station. As the fourth coach came into his field of vision, thedriver saw that it was derailed and made an emergency brake application. The train thenstopped within five seconds.In the report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch into the accident, the maintenance of track and points was heavily criticised.

40|$|Effective {{lubrication}} of {{the wheel}} rail interface {{plays an important role}} in prolonging the life of rail and wheels and can save tens of millions of dollars in maintenance and replacement costs. Condition monitoring and control of wayside rail lubrication equipment is a complex issue and is traditionally undertaken using unskilled labour at great cost. Remote monitoring of wayside <b>rail</b> <b>lubricators</b> reduces the need for staff to attend the sites in person, work in the trackside danger zones, and in remote locations. With many different technologies available at hand, decision making can be a difficult process. Wayside <b>rail</b> <b>lubricators</b> come in many types and theirperformance can vary depending on their configuration, placement, and control. The North American model of rail lubrication greatly differs to that of the models used in Australia. Lubricator blades come in many configurations, performance can greatly vary depending on selection and placement. This paper looks at the application of the different real time monitoring systems offered by the two major suppliers of wayside <b>rail</b> <b>lubricators</b> and the benefits of these systems verses the traditional manual monitoring. For this trial general packet radio service (GPRS) / 3 G technology has been used. The wayside <b>rail</b> <b>lubricators</b> in this trial are in remote locationswith poor access conditions. Data available from the test siteinclude the health of lubricators, grease levels, train movementand security of the unit and parameters relating to grease dispensing. Difficulties encountered, system constraints, andlimitations are discussed for the systems and permit maintenancedecisions to be made prior to leaving the depot. Cost benefits ofemploying such technologies are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Exors of James Mills were {{manufacturers}} of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing {{from a small}} building employing two men to the large Bredbury Steelworks on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce bright steel, at one point becoming the largest producer of bright steel outside the United States. Other products were added from time to time, including cotters for locomotives and rolling stock, engineer's keys, taper pins, grooved fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway permanent way fastenings, <b>rail</b> <b>lubricators</b> and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to the United Kingdom, and in the 1960s developed free machining steels containing tellurium and an alloy replacement steel. The company was later acquired by GKN and closed down in 1985. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.|$|R
