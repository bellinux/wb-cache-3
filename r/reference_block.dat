40|$|Abstract The {{non-uniformity}} of the hardness <b>reference</b> <b>block</b> {{is one of}} {{the important}} factors, which influence the hardness measurement. For calibration of hardness <b>reference</b> <b>block,</b> the elementary idea to reduce the error from this factor is to make the indentations at the distributed location as though covering the entire test surface with limited number of indentations. The principle to decide the appropriate numbers and locations of the measurement is to consider the trend and frequency of hardness distribution. Stratified sampling was introduced to the study {{on the assumption that the}} confidence of average hardness estimation would be increase with an appropriate test location. Six Vickers hardness reference blocks of 200, 600, 900 HV from 2 different manufacturers were selected for the experiment...|$|E
30|$|Thus, each {{block is}} {{affected}} a time slot to process a field when this field is traversing the graph. They are then activated {{depending on the}} ongoing field. To achieve this, the controller decides a starting moment for each block in the graph. This starting time is computed by considering both the graph structure and the properties (latency and throughput) of each block composing it. Indeed, each state is associated to a datapath, and once the system enters a state, the processing starts with a specific block that is tagged as a <b>reference</b> <b>block.</b> The activation moment of the remaining blocks in the datapath is then estimated by computing their distance to the <b>reference</b> <b>block</b> based on the latency and the throughput of the blocks preceding them. This algorithm has been integrated into the presented SDR PHYs design flow.|$|E
40|$|To {{validate}} the European standard ENV 843 - 4 for hardness measurements on ceramics, three classes of ceramic materials, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, and aluminium oxide: involving 19 ceramics in total, were tested using the traditional techniques Vickers (HV 1), Knoop (HK 2), and superficial Rockwell (HR 45 N). The {{use of new}} ceramic <b>reference</b> <b>blocks</b> certified according to the standards ISO 4547 and ISO 6507 - 1 for metallic materials was studied. If the hardness response of the tested materials does not involve chipping and cracking the application of high hardness <b>reference</b> <b>blocks</b> for training users to obtain hardness values comparable with the certified HV 1 and HK 2 values improves the reproducibility from about 10 % to 1 to 3 %. The scatter between the laboratories {{is similar to the}} scatter within the laboratories. The measurement of the indentation geometry on typical commercial ceramic materials call be made only with higher scatter and reduced reproducibility compared with typical metallic materials, which is caused by the stochastic indentation response. For such materials involving chipping and cracking (for instance SiC), the application of <b>reference</b> <b>blocks</b> with well-shaped indentations does not provide improved comparability of results between the laboratories, The actual indentation response of the ceramic material tested must be considered before selecting the appropriate hardness technique and test force. There is {{no significant difference between the}} abilities of the hardness techniques HV 1, HK 2, and HR 45 N to discriminate sensitively between materials of closely similar properties.

Next, a reference frequency F 2 of the unloaded bearing member is determined using a second P 2 L 2 equipment configuration and is then compensated for equipment offset errors via the relationship F 2 +F 2 (Fo 1) / 1000000.
