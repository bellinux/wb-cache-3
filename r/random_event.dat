5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a <b>random</b> <b>event.</b> Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, {{or a lack of}} sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a <b>random</b> <b>event</b> that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a <b>random</b> <b>event,</b> and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study {{aspects of}} computability {{concerning}} <b>random</b> <b>events</b> and variables in a computable probability space which fulfills certain computability axioms. To this end, we introduce two multirepresentations of <b>random</b> <b>events</b> and <b>random</b> variables respectively, employing the Fréchet–Nikodym metric and the Ky Fan metric. They are {{shown to be}} recursively complete in guaranteeing computability of basic operations on <b>random</b> <b>events</b> and <b>random</b> variables.

5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a <b>random</b> <b>event.</b> There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E

40|$|People tend {{to believe}} that {{sequences}} of <b>random</b> <b>events</b> produce fewer and shorter streaks than is actually the case. Although this error has been demonstrated repeatedly and in many forms, nearly all studies of randomness cognition have focused on how people think about <b>random</b> <b>events</b> occurring in the present or future. This article examines how our biased beliefs about randomness interact with properties of memory to influence our judgments about and memory for past <b>random</b> <b>events.</b> We explore this interaction by examining how beliefs about randomness affect our memory for <b>random</b> <b>events</b> and how certain properties of memory alter our tendency to categorize <b>events</b> as <b>random.</b> Across three experiments, we demonstrate an interaction between randomness cognition and three well-established but distinct properties of memory: (1) the reconstructive nature of memory, (2) primacy and recency effects, and (3) duration neglect. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Regarding {{spontaneous}} {{or natural}} monozygotic twinning, a recent theory proposes that monozygotic twins are formed after a blastocyst essentially collapses, splitting the progenitor cells (those that contain the body's fundamental genetic material) in half, leaving the same genetic material divided in two {{on opposite sides}} of the embryo. Eventually, two separate fetuses develop. Spontaneous division of the zygote into two embryos is not considered to be a hereditary trait, but rather a spontaneous and <b>random</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} two-stage linear programs. Here {{the decision}} maker takes some action in the first stage, after which a <b>random</b> <b>event</b> occurs affecting {{the outcome of the}} first-stage decision. A recourse decision can then be made in the second stage that compensates for any bad effects that might have been experienced {{as a result of the}} first-stage decision. The optimal policy from such a model is a single first-stage policy and a collection of recourse decisions (a decision rule) defining which second-stage action should be taken in response to each random outcome.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{paleontology}} {{had followed}} geology in preferring uniformitarian mechanisms, despite the promotion by Eugene Merle Shoemaker {{of the importance}} of catastrophic impacts. During the renaissance period Walter Alvarez and others found iridium in the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary layer. Also the Chicxulub Crater, was identified and determined to be due to a meteor impact. These discoveries led to the acceptance and popularisation of the idea that the extinction had been caused by a meteor impact. This in turn undermined the assumption that dinosaurs had become extinct because they were inferior to mammals. Instead it suggested they had fallen prey to a <b>random</b> <b>event</b> which no large animal could have survived.|$|E
500|$|February {{began with}} a home game against Académica. Benfica's Geovanni scored the first goal in the 32nd minute and Simão later scored twice to win the match 3–0. Benfica {{returned}} to joint-first and won their second consecutive league game {{for the first time}} in four months. On 12 February, Benfica played away at the Estádio Municipal de Braga against Braga. The match ended in draw and a sharing of points. Trapattoni was happy with the draw, saying Benfica entered a little nervously and were lucky not to lose in some <b>random</b> <b>event,</b> like in past games. On the following Thursday, Benfica travelled to Russia to play in the Kuban Stadium against CKSA Moscow. With the Russians just recently coming out of their pre-season, Benfica dominated possession but failed to score, losing 2–0. Trapattoni blamed the pitch, saying he was confident Benfica could win in Lisbon. On 21 February, Benfica received Vitória de Guimarães; Benfica's Geovanni scored in the first half and Nuno Gomes assisted Nuno Assis to make the score 2–0. César Peixoto of Guimarães scored in the second half. Benfica held the advantage and remained joint-first with Porto. Three days later, Benfica played the second leg of the UEFA Cup. They drew 1–1 and were eliminated from the competition. After the game, Trapattoni refuted any lack of attitude from Benfica, saying, [...] "We played well. I could not ask them anything." [...] On 28 February, Benfica visited the Estádio do Dragão for the second Classico of the season. Porto's Benni McCarthy scored first but Geovanni equalized in the 75th minute, setting the final score at 1–1. It was the first time since 1993–94 that Benfica did not lose away to Porto.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} common cause closedness of a classical, Kolmogorovian {{probability}} space {{with respect to}} a causal independence relation between the <b>random</b> <b>events</b> is defined, and proposi-tions are presented that characterize common cause closedness for specific probability spaces. It is proved in particular that no probability space with a finite number of <b>random</b> <b>events</b> can contain common causes of all the correlations it predicts; however, it is demonstrated that probability spaces even with a finite number of <b>random</b> <b>events</b> can be common cause closed {{with respect to a}} causal independence relation that is stronger than logical independence. Furthermore it is shown that infinite, atomless probability spaces are always common cause closed in the strongest possible sense. Open problems concerning common cause closed-ness are formulated and the results are interpreted from the perspective of Reichenbach’s Common Cause Principle. 1 The problem and informal review of results Let T be a theory formal part of which contains classical probability theory (S, p), where S is a Boolean algebra of sets representing <b>random</b> <b>events</b> (with Boolean operations ∪,∩,⊥) an...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of “Grundbegriffe” by A. N. Kolmogorov (published in 1933) on {{education in the}} area of probability and its impact on research in stochastics cannot be overestimated. We would like to point out three aspects of the classical probability theory “calling for” an upgrade: (i) classical <b>random</b> <b>events</b> are black-and-white (Boolean); (ii) classical random variables do not model quantum phenomena; (iii) basic maps (probability measures and observables { dual maps to random variables) have very different “mathematical nature”. Accordingly, we propose an upgraded probability theory based on Łukasiewicz operations (multivalued logic) on events, elementary category theory, and covering the classical probability theory as a special case. The upgrade can be compared to replacing calculations with integers by calculations with rational (and real) numbers. Namely, to avoid the three objections, we embed the classical (Boolean) <b>random</b> <b>events</b> (represented by the f 0; 1 g-valued indicator functions of sets) into upgraded <b>random</b> <b>events</b> (represented by measurable { 0; 1 }-valued functions), the minimal domain of probability containing “fractions” of classical <b>random</b> <b>events,</b> and we upgrade the notions of probability measure and random variable...|$|R
