40|$|We present high angular {{resolution}} {{observations of the}} HC 3 N J = 5 - 4 line from the Egg nebula, which is the archetype of proto-planetary nebulae (PPNs). We find that the HC 3 N emission in the approaching and <b>receding</b> <b>portion</b> of the envelope traces a clumpy hollow shell, similar to that seen in normal carbon-rich envelopes. Near the systemic velocity, the hollow shell is fragmented into several large blobs or arcs with missing portions correspond spatially to locations of previously reported high-velocity outflows in the Egg nebula. This provides direct evidence for the disruption of the slowly expanding envelope ejected during the AGB phase by the collimated fast outflows initiated during {{the transition to the}} PPN phase. From modeling the HC 3 N distribution, we could reproduce qualitatively the spatial kinematics of the HC 3 N J = 5 - 4 emission using a HC 3 N shell with two pairs of cavities cleared by the collimated high-velocity outflows along the polar direction and in the equatorial plane. We infer a relatively high abundance of HC 3 N/H 2 3 × 10 - 6 for an estimated mass-loss rate of 3 × 10 - 5 M⊙ yr - 1 in the HC 3 N shell. The high abundance of HC 3 N and the presence of some weaker J = 5 - 4 emission {{in the vicinity of the}} central post-AGB star suggest an unusually efficient formation of this molecule in the Egg nebula. © 2009.

40|$|To date, few {{researchers}} have solved three-dimensional free-surface problems with dynamic wetting lines. This paper extends the free-surface {{finite element method}} described in a companion paper [Cairncross, R. A., P. R. Schunk, T. A. Baer, P. A. Sackinger, R. R. Rao, "A finite element method for free surface flows of incompressible fluid in three dimensions, Part I: Boundary-Fitted mesh motion. ", to be published (1998) ] to handle dynamic wetting. A generalization of the technique used in two dimensional modeling to circumvent double-valued velocities at the wetting line, the so-called kinematic paradox, is presented for a wetting line in three dimensions. This approach requires the fluid velocity normal to the contact line to be zero, the fluid velocity tangent to the contact line to be equal to the tangential component of web velocity, and the fluid velocity into the web to be zero. In addition, slip is allowed in a narrow strip along the substrate surface near the dynamic contact line. For realistic wetting-line motion, a contact angle which varies with wetting speed is required because contact lines in three dimensions typically advance or recede a different rates depending upon location and/or have both advancing and <b>receding</b> <b>portions.</b> The theory is applied to capillary rise of static fluid in a corner, the initial motion of a Newtonian droplet down an inclined plane, and extrusion of a Newtonian fluid from a nozzle onto a moving substrate. The extrusion results are compared to experimental visualization. Subject Categorie...|$|R
50|$|In {{astronomy}} and plasma physics, the thermal Doppler broadening {{is one of}} the explanations for the broadening of spectral lines, and as such gives an indication for the temperature of observed material. Other causes of velocity distributions may exist, though, for example due to turbulent motion. For a fully developed turbulence, the resulting line profile is generally very difficult to distinguish from the thermal one.Another cause could be a large range of macroscopic velocities resulting, e.g., from the <b>receding</b> and approaching <b>portions</b> of a rapidly spinning accretion disk. Finally, there are many other factors which can also broaden the lines. For example, a sufficiently high particle number density may lead to significant Stark broadening.|$|R
5000|$|November 18, 1929, {{a tsunami}} stuck Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland, after a {{large-scale}} Grand Banks earthquake. Sometime after the quake, many people noticed the water draining {{out of the}} coves and harbours. In St. Lawrence, [...] "the harbour bottom, which on average is 10 m deep, was visible in places." [...] "As the water <b>receded,</b> it exposed <b>portions</b> of the ocean floor that were normally submerged and caused boats docked at various harbours to tumble over onto their sides. Minutes later, three successive waves hit the shore and water levels rose dramatically." [...] Three waves [...] hit the coast at 105 km/h about three hours after the earthquake occurred. [...] "In most places, the sea level swelled three to seven metres above normal, but {{in some of the}} peninsula's long narrow bays, such as at Port au Bras, St. Lawrence, and Taylor's Bay, the water rose by between 13 m to 27 m." [...] The waves travelled at speeds up to 129 km/h at the epicentre; they were recorded as far away as Portugal. The tsunami destroyed many south coastal communities on the Burin Peninsula, killing 27 or 28 people, sweeping away homes, businesses, wharves, and fishing boats, and leaving 10,000 more homeless.|$|R
40|$|Tri drvena oltara, dvije ispovjedaonice i sakristijski ormar kapele svetog Franje Ksaverskog okvirno su datirani detaljnom analizom ornamentike i pojedinih dekorativnih motiva. Pronađeni srodni primjeri na području kontinentalne Hrvatske i susjedne Slovenije ukazuju na moguću provenijenciju oltara. The {{church of}} St. Francis Xavier in Rtić, a village near Lukovdol in the Gorski Kotar region, was erected around 1715, {{according}} to Jesuit mission reports. It was furnished {{with a wooden}} polychromed main altar, dedicated to the patron of the church, and side altars of the Holy Guardian Angel and St. Barbara. These were preceded by four illusionistic altars, referred to in a 1725 report as “marble altars”. Next to the triumphal arch, even today there are visible traces of painting from the altars of Virgin and Child and the Holy Guardian Angel. No archival records were found as to the dating and provenance of the main and the side altars, and it remains unclear when the illusionistic altars {{had been replaced by}} wooden ones. This most certainly took place after 1725, and the reasons might be found in the increased popularity of the sanctuary and the necessity for more sumptuous furnishings and a richer iconographic programme, which was probably made possible by plentiful offerings. We attempted to answer the question of at least an approximate dating of the altars and its association to a specific artistic circle or workshop by way of a detailed analysis of the ornamentation, the thus far least studied component of the altar. Literature has associated the wooden altars of the church with the “golden altars” in neighboring Slovenia. The assumption proved to be wrong, as neither the main nor the side altars were decorated with auricular ornaments, typical of the golden altars of {{the second half of the}} 17 th century. All three altars are adorned by an acanthus with a ribbon, an ornament that appeared in altars of continental Croatia around 1715, following the prevalence of the “pure” acanthus ornament and lasting into the 1730 s. At that time, the base of the ribbon and tendril became more often interlocked with motifs from the decorative repertoire of a leaf and strapwork ornament, while the share of acanthus was reduced. This same type of ornament is on the main and the side altars interpreted in different ways. The main altar has the separate elements of the ribbon and the acanthus branch mostly joined together, to the point that impression is given of the acanthus leaves sprouting from the ribbon. A distant model for this type of acanthus can be traced down to the ornamental plates of German printmaker Johann Leonhard Eisler (1697 − 1733), while similar varieties of acanthus motif with a ribbon are also found on the Pauline altars in Remete. What also ties the main altar with the Pauline woodcarving workshop is its architectural structure, with the <b>receding</b> central <b>portion</b> flanked by slanted sides with niches that make the altar reminiscent of the main altar of the Church of St. Nicholas in Jasenovac, also attributed to the Pauline workshop. A comparison for the side altars of the Holy Guardian Angel and St. Barbara can be found in the nearby Vinji Vrh pri Semiču in Slovenia. Here, the main altar of the Holy Trinity Church, by an unknown master, was polychromed and gilded by F. A. Nirenberg of Višnja Gora in 1741, according to an inscription on the predella. Similar ornamental motifs (a series of tassels and acanthus leaves, a motif of a pointed square bordered with acanthus leaves, mirror-symmetrical compositions of acanthus tendrils with stiffly executed leaves and pronounced graphism, as well as tiny volute-scrolled clouds that fill up the upper halves of the niches) tie the side altars in Rtić with the main altar of the Holy Trinity Church in Semič. Also comparable are the sculptures of both altars, with their static postures and schematic execution, which points to the possibility that they were a work of the same, probably local workshop that was active on both sides of the Kupa River. Owing to their shared formal features and the type of decorative motifs, the sacristy cabinet and the two pulpits make up an ensemble that originated prior to the altars, probably around the mid- 17 th century. In addition, the confessional from the Church of the Virgin of Carmel in Moravička Sela is probably the work of the same master (or workshop) ...|$|R
