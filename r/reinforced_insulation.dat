The {{combustion}} {{stability of}} low concentration methane in a perfectly-stirred reactor is numerically studied by Chemkin software and GRI-Mech 3. 0 mechanisms, considering the influence factors of residence time, methane concentration, preheating temperature and heat loss, the following {{conclusions can be}} drawn: (1) To maintain low concentration methane combustion stability, it is {{need to make the}} residence time in the reactor larger than the critical residence time or the mass flow rate less than the critical mass flow rate. (2) To make the methane concentration below 4 % combustion stability, it should be preheated to improve chemical reaction speed, methane concentration decreased by 1 %, corresponding to increasing preheating temperature of about 200 K. (3) Heat loss can significantly reduce the initial temperature, and thus lead to reduce the critical mass flow.

40|$|The {{market share}} for fibre <b>reinforced</b> aerogel <b>insulation</b> {{materials}} {{is expected to}} increase as production costs are lowered, and in this context, the development of layered products with integrated aerogel is highly interesting. The effect of uniaxial compression and humidity on the thermal conductivity of commercially available aerogel insulation blankets were measured in order to assess the feasibility of integrating aerogel blankets with other building components. The thermal performance under uniaxial compression was measured by compressing commercially available aerogel blanket materials in a heat flow meter apparatus. Up to 11. 5 % decrease in apparent thermal conductivity was observed at a compressive strain of 16 %, corresponding to an applied stress of approximately 22 kPa. The thermal insulation properties of the aerogel insulation blankets remained excellent within the range of compressive stress investigated in this study (up to about 40 kPa), making aerogel integration highly interesting for building components that will be used under compression. However, a 32 % increase in thermal conductivity was observed upon exposure to an atmosphere of 95 % relative humidity (RH). Thus, in order to widen the range of application for fibre <b>reinforced</b> aerogel <b>insulation</b> materials, further investigations should be conducted to understand and improve their tolerance to moistur...|$|R

This composite basically contains nano-sized carbon particles as conductive filler into an elastomer matrix to achieve pressure sensitive function. The superior pressure sensitive effect was showed at 0. 88 vol % of carbon particles while in the previous study the micro-sized carbon particle was required above 30 vol%. In addition, nano-sized silica particles were added to <b>reinforce</b> electrical <b>insulation</b> properties and to improve the pressure sensing reliability of the composite. The addition of the surface modified silica improved better both the sensing performance and the mechanical strength than the composite containing non-modified silica particles.

40|$|Traditionally {{materials}} used for catenary support structures are steel, concrete or even wood, {{in combination with}} the use of insulators. The development of new materials such as Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) makes a new revolutionary design possible. The use of FRP is expanding rapidly at the moment, being applied already in bridges, lock-doors and the design of High-Voltage towers [1]. A benefit of FRP from a mechanical point of view is that, due to the reduced Young modulus, the design is mainly determined by the stiffness of the construction, therefore the resulting strength of the structure is very high. The insulating properties of the material make it possible to omit the use of insulators. This leads to the following benefits in catenary design: - Environmental friendly as no zinc or paint is required for conservation; - FRP is easy to be recycled; - Cost reduction as no insulators are required; - Reduced height of civil structures as no space is required for insulators; - Reduced maintenance costs, since FRP does not corrode; - Reduced weight of catenary support structure simplifying foundation design; - For d. c. systems no voltage limiting devices are needed, therefore reducing stray currents and reducing impact of the railway on other structures such as pipelines (provided that the construction meets the requirements for <b>reinforced</b> <b>insulation</b> in accordance with [5]; - Number of construction parts is reduced, leading to easier and faster construction. As the mechanical properties of FRP are well known at present, the main interest concerns the electrical properties, especially in relation to ageing and pollution. Therefore, conductivity measurements have been performed on a FRP beam which has been in use in the railway environment for 20 years. Also measurements have been conducted on a reference sample in a High- Voltage laboratory. Three situations have been studied: - Original state; - Cleaned; - After salt-spray test. Based on the measurements it can be concluded that the conductivity, even after being in use for 20 years, is sufficient for the intended use. Conductivity can be attributed mainly {{to the surface of the}} material, and is probably due to the deposition of carbon and metal particles from pantograph, catenary and moisture. It can be concluded that the use of FRP in catenary support structures, without insulators is a promising new technology, with benefits for both costs as well as the environment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ten years ago, {{the first}} Spanish high speed line which {{traveled}} from Madrid to Sevilla {{at an average}} speed of 250 km/h was inaugurated. At this speed pantograph noise, which is of an aerodynamic nature, {{is thought to have}} rather influence in the passengers zone. However, pantograph contribution is often omitted since main noise sources are expected to come from wheels and devices placed under the floor (motors, engines, compressors, etc). According to this, special anti-noise treatments are designed for floor structures achieving high noise insulation levels. Then, not expected noise contributions from the pantograph become significant. This paper is aimed at evaluating whether is necessary to apply anti-noise measures on the roof structure or not, by using the vibro-acoustical description of all car’s elements, and the measured pantograph sound power level as the inputs of a SEA model. Firstly, two microphone arrays had been used for the measurement, one of them having optimum microphone spacing to achieve best resolution at low frequency octave bands, and the other one to get best performance at high frequency octave bands, covering a global range of frequencies between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz.

Energy efficiency solutions and innovative experimental components are synergically integrated in a single project, enabling to reach important results, {{as demonstrated by the}} assessment of environmental achievements and the calculation of avoided CO 2 emissions. Since a quantitative evaluation of the energy savings, that can be achieved with the use of bioclimatic greenhouses, is very complex, due to the large number of parameters,which are necessary to describe their operation, the research work focused on the thermo-fluid dynamic modeling of these systems, {{with the use of a}} specific CFD-FEM software, COMSOL Multiphysics™. In particular a model was created, initially conceived in 2 D and currently developed in 3 D, which reproduces the thermo-fluid dynamic behavior of an experimental greenhouse in the Solaria complex.

The MLI system consisted of two blankets, each blanket made up of alternate layers of double silk net (16 layers) and double aluminized Mylar radiation shields (15 layers) contained between two cover sheets of Dacron scrim <b>reinforced</b> Mylar. The <b>insulation</b> system was designed for and installed on a 87. 6 in diameter liquid hydrogen tank. Nominal layer density of the insulation blankets is 45 layers/in.

The total steady state heat transfer rates into the test tank for shroud temperatures of 630, 530, 152 R were 164. 4, 95. 8, and 15. 9 BTU/hr respectively. The noninsulation heat leaks into the tank (12 fiberglass support struts, tank plumbing, and instrumentation lines) represent between 13 to 17 pct. of the total heat input.

40|$|AbstractMost CO 2 removal {{systems at}} the thermal power plants demand the vast {{energy of the}} steam for the power generation, which lowers the {{performance}} and increases the cost. Therefore reducing the energy consumption is inevitable for introducing the CO 2 removal system into the thermal power plant. We have achieved the energy consumption of 2. 6 GJ/t-CO 2 at a condition of 90 % CO 2 capture ratio at our 10 t-CO 2 /day pilot plant in February 2011 using the flue gas from the coal fired boiler of the Mikawa power plant. This {{is the first time}} in the world that the consumed energy of much lower than 3. 0 GJ/t-CO 2 has been proved at a 10 t- CO 2 /day scale pilot plant using the actual flue gas of the coal fired power plant, not only by simulations. According to the heat loss test and analysis, it would be reduced more 0. 3 GJ/t-CO 2 by <b>reinforcing</b> the thermal <b>insulation,</b> which means 2. 3 GJ/t-CO 2 would be possible at larger scale commercial plant. Since the pilot plant had completed in September 2009, we have been operating it continuously using the flue gas from the coal fired boiler. Then we have reached the 6, 809 hour cumulative operating time which includes more than 3, 000 hour operating time exceeding the planning values of 10 t-CO 2 /day and 90 % CO 2 capture ratio. This means our excellent solvent called TS- 1 (Toshiba Solvent 1) has enhanced durability and reliability because any definite degradation by SOX, NOX and oxidization has not been emerging during the operation.

40|$|Much of the {{political}} economy analysis of reform focuses on the conflict of interest between groups that stand to gain or lose from the competing policy proposals. In reality, {{there is also a}} lot of disagreement about the working of the policy: in addition to conflicting interests, conflicting views play an important role. Those views are shaped in part by an educational bureaucracy. It is documented that the beliefs of that bureaucracy differ substantially from those of the broader constituency. I analyse a model where this effect originates in the self-selection of workers in the educational occupation, and is partly <b>reinforced</b> by the <b>insulation</b> of the educational profession from the real economy (an effect which had been discussed by Hayek). The bias makes it harder for the population to learn the true parameters of the economy if these are favourable to the market economy. Two parameters that govern this capacity to learn are social entropy and heritability. Social entropy defines how predictable one’s occupation is as a function of one’s beliefs. Heritability is the weight of the family’s beliefs in the determination of the priors of a new generation. Both heritability and social entropy reduce the bias and makes it easier to learn that the market economy is "good", under the assumption that it is. Finally I argue that the capacity to learn from experience is itself affected by economic institutions. A society which does not trust markets is more likely to favour labour market rigidities that in turn reduces the exposure of individuals to the market economy, and thus their ability to learn from experience. This in turn reinforces the weight of the educational system in the formation of beliefs, thus validating the initial presumption against the market economy. This sustains an equilibrium where beliefs and institutions reinforce each other in slowing or preventing people from learning the correct underlying parameters. beliefs; education; educational system; employment protection; ideology; intellectuals; learning; reforms...|$|R
