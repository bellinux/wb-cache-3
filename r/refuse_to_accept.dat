5|$|Sjumandjaja was {{reportedly}} a very strict director {{and unwilling to}} receive criticism from actors. According to El Manik, who played a Japanese soldier in Budak Nafsu, Sjumandjaja refused to listen to El Manik's concern that a Japanese man {{would not be able}} to speak Indonesian fluently, instead telling the actor to write Japanese dialog himself if he wanted. Gandasubrata recalled that Sjumandjaja fired his own father-in-law from Jakarta Opera when the latter could not perform to the director's expectations. According to producer Manoo Sukmajaya, Sjumandjaja would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a directing offer if he found the script uninteresting, valuing creative worth over the director's fee.|$|E
5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E

25|$|While it {{is widely}} assumed that the problem lies {{primarily}} in men refusing to grant a get to their wives {{and that it is}} a widespread issue, in Israel, figures released from the chief rabbinate show that women equally <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a get and that the numbers are a couple of hundred on each side.

Beneš initially insisted that no new government could be formed which did not include ministers from the non-Communist parties. However, an atmosphere of mounting tension, coupled with massive Communist-led demonstrations occurring throughout the country, convinced Beneš to remain neutral over the issue, for fear the KSČ foment an insurrection and give the Red Army a pretext to invade the country and restore order.|$|E
25|$|High {{first entered}} {{the race for}} {{governor}} in 1964. He {{announced that he would}} <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> large campaign donations, and traveled the state in a DC-3. The Miami News was the only newspaper in the state to endorse High. Until his candidacy, Democratic candidates for Governor of Florida had supported segregation, some more strongly than others. The Democratic-dominated legislature {{at the turn of the}} century had passed a new constitution that disenfranchised most blacks, a status that was enforced until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|E

This probably dealt a fatal blow to any chance of permanent peace between Rome and Carthage {{and is one of the}} causes of the Second Punic War and held as the motivation of the subsequent military and political activities of Hamilcar.|$|E

25|$|Some Traditionalist Catholics {{reject to}} a greater or lesser extent the changes made since 1950 (see Traditionalist Catholic). None {{advocate}} returning to the original (1570) form of the liturgy, though some may perhaps wish a re-establishment of its form before Pius X's revision of the rubrics in 1911. Some do <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the 1955 changes in the liturgy of Palm Sunday and the Easter Triduum and in the liturgical calendar (see General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII), and instead use the General Roman Calendar as in 1954. Others accept the 1955 changes by Pius XII, but not those of Pope John XXIII. Others again, in accordance with the authorization granted by Pope Benedict XVI in Summorum Pontificum, use the Missal and calendar as it was in 1962.|$|E
25|$|The GPO {{created a}} network of post offices where senders could submit items. All post was {{transferred}} from the post office of origination to distribution points called sorting stations, and from there the post was then sent on for delivery to the receiver of the post. Initially it was {{the recipient of the}} post who paid the fee, and he had the right to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the item if he did not wish to pay. The charge was based on the distance the item had been carried so the GPO had to keep a separate account for each item. In 1840 the Uniform Penny Post was introduced, which incorporated the two key innovations of a uniform postal rate, which cut administrative costs and encouraged use of the system, and adhesive pre-paid stamp.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} Cossacks, some <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> {{themselves}} {{as part of}} the standard ethnic Russian people, and claim to be a separate subgroup on par with sub-ethnicities such as the Pomors. In the 2002 Russian census the Cossacks were allowed to a have distinct nationality as a separate Russian sub-ethnical group. The Kuban Cossacks living in Krasnodar Kray, Adygea, Karachayevo-Cherkessia and some regions of Stavropol Krai and Kabardino-Balkaria counted 25,000 men. However, the strict governance of the census meant that only Cossacks who are in active service were treated as such, {{and at the same time}} 300,000 families are registered by the Kuban Cossack Host. Kuban Cossacks not politically affiliated with the Kuban Cossack Host, such as the director of the Kuban Cossack Choir Viktor Zakharchenko, have maintained at various times a pro-Ukrainian orientation. Zakharchenko has recently changed his position and proposes a unification of Ukraine and Russia.|$|E

25|$|Eager {{to expand}} his control, Jimmy turns his {{attention}} to the Preppies, the clique that consists of rich students. Just as he begins to win them over, Gary tricks them into turning against him. In response, Jimmy signs up for a boxing tournament hosted by the Preppies' leader, Derby Harrington (John Lavelle). Though he wins, the Preppies <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> defeat and gang up on him, resulting in a massive fight that ends with Jimmy declaring himself the new leader. With the Preppies subdued, Jimmy then sets out to conquer their rivals, the Greasers. Johnny Vincent (Rocco Rosanio), their leader, asks Jimmy to help him expose an affair between his girlfriend Lola Lombardi (Phoebe Strole), and Gord Vendome (Andrew Gehling), a member of the Preppies. The Preppies, angered by Jimmy's betrayal, abandon him, but he gradually wins back their trust. Gary manages to convince Johnny that Jimmy wants Lola, so he sets an ambush for him in a scrapyard. With Petey's help, Johnny is defeated and the Greasers recognize Jimmy as their superior. During this, Jimmy helps out a homeless man who pretend to be Santa Claus.|$|E
25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, and we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give to our country some confidence of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E
