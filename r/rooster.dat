5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife what he saw. His wife refused to believe him unless the <b>rooster</b> she had just killed {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, the <b>rooster</b> flew away towards the mountain.

5|$|In 2005, <b>Rooster</b> Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R.

The series was produced {{at the request of}} Monolith Productions {{as a part of a}} tie-in with the Director's Edition of the F.E.A.R., which the <b>Rooster</b> Teeth team used to produce the series. The mini-series consists of five episodes. Four of these have been released on the <b>Rooster</b> Teeth website, and one — episode 0, a prequel — originally shipped exclusively with the F.E.A.R. Director's Edition DVD. It is also included with the game's digital release on GOG.com.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>rooster's</b> call: Yuan Mei's book Zi Bu Yu mentioned, [...] "Evil spirits {{withdraw}} {{when they}} hear a <b>rooster's</b> call" [...] (鬼聞雞鳴即縮。), because the <b>rooster's</b> call usually occurs {{with the rise of}} the sun.|$|R
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a <b>rooster,</b> a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon <b>rooster</b> dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the <b>rooster</b> {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the <b>rooster,</b> and immediately went mad. Another dragon <b>rooster,</b> with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
5|$|The symbol {{used by the}} French rugby {{team was}} a great success, and was later adopted by the French {{delegation}} at the Olympic Games of 1920 where the <b>rooster</b> was perched on five Olympic rings.

French players are sometimes called les coqs and some French supporters {{have been known to}} release roosters on the playing field before games.|$|E

5|$|Until 1912, {{the strip}} (uniform) of the French team was white with two rings, one red and one blue. After {{the first game}} won by France against Scotland in 1911, France's captain Marcel Communeau asked that the team adopt the coq gaulois (Gallic <b>rooster),</b> {{historical}} emblem of France, as its symbol. The Gallic <b>rooster</b> was probably chosen partly because it is considered as a proud and combative animal that can be sometimes aggressive, although it had been used previously as a symbol by French teams – a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910. The badge was initially white and red, but was altered to a multicoloured, embroidered image after 1945, and has been golden since 1970.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old <b>rooster</b> defended their village from them—especially the <b>rooster,</b> for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E

5|$|France {{traditionally}} play in blue {{shirts with}} white shorts and red socks, and are {{commonly referred to}} as les tricolores or les bleus.

French international matches are played at several venues across the country; the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis is used for their games during the Six Nations, and they have a formidable home record at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille where they have only lost twice, to Argentina in 2004 and to New Zealand in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. <b>Rooster</b> Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project.

Club captain Braith Anasta, who departed to from the <b>Roosters</b> to Tigers, was replaced by Golden Boot-winning fullback Anthony Minichiello who had played for the <b>Roosters</b> since 2000. With a new roster of players, this proved an excellent season for the <b>Roosters</b> who took out the minor premiership before winning the grand final 26-18 against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.

5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when <b>Rooster</b> Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E
