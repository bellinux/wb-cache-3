Following the Government's <b>resettlement</b> <b>programme,</b> the temple was {{relocated}} on Tai Gin Road in 1988 where it stands today. Under the guidance of the temple's Spiritual Advisor, Sayadaw U Pannya Vamsa, together with the combined efforts of the resident monks, members of the public, and well-wishers, the new temple building was officially opened in 1991. The temple has intricate Burmese architectural style with teak wood carvings that were donated by the Tripitaka Nikaya Main Ministrative Body (Ti Ni) of Myanmar.|$|E
500|$|The Gateway Protection Programme is not {{the first}} British refugee <b>resettlement</b> <b>programme.</b> Other, {{informal}} resettlement programmes include the Mandate Refugee Scheme, and the UK has also participated in the Ten or More Plan. The former is for so-called [...] "mandate" [...] refugees who have been granted refugee status by UNHCR in third countries. To qualify for the scheme, refugees must have close ties to the UK and it must also be demonstrated that the UK is the most appropriate country for their resettlement. The Ten or More Plan, established by UNHCR in 1973 and administered in the UK by the British Red Cross, is for refugees requiring medical attention not available in their current location. During the 1990s, 2,620 refugees were settled in the UK through these two programmes. In 2003, the UK's Ten or More Plan had a resettlement goal of 10 people and the Mandate Refugee Scheme 300. Refugees have also been resettled through specific programmes following emergencies. For example, 42,000 Ugandan Asians expelled from Uganda during 1972–74, 22,500 Vietnamese during 1979–92, over 2,500 Bosnians in the 1990s, and over 4,000 Kosovars in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1998, the Zimbabwe {{government}} published its [...] "policy framework" [...] on the Land Reform and <b>Resettlement</b> <b>Programme</b> Phase II (LRRP II), which envisaged the {{compulsory purchase}} {{over five years}} of 50,000 square kilometres from the 112,000 square kilometres owned by white commercial farmers, public corporations, churches, non-governmental organisations and multinational companies. Broken down, the 50,000 square kilometres meant that every year between 1998 and 2003, the government intended to purchase 10,000 square kilometres for redistribution.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{expiration}} of the entrenched constitutional conditions {{mandated by the}} Lancaster House Agreement in the early 1990s, Zimbabwe outlined several ambitious new plans for land reform. A National Land Policy was formally proposed and enshrined as the Zimbabwean Land Acquisition Act of 1992, which empowered the government to acquire any land as it saw fit, although only after payment of financial compensation. While powerless to challenge the acquisition itself, landowners were permitted some lateral to negotiate their compensation amounts with the state. The British government continued to help fund the <b>resettlement</b> <b>programme,</b> with aid specifically earmarked for land reform reaching £91 million by 1996. Another £100 million was granted for [...] "budgetary support" [...] and was spent {{on a variety of}} projects, including land reform. Zimbabwe also began to court other donors through its Economic Structural Adjustment Policies (ESAP), which were projects implemented in concert with international agencies and tied to foreign loans.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later, the pro-Mugabe Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) {{organised}} several people (including {{but not limited}} to war veterans; many of them were their children and grandchildren) to march on white-owned farmlands, initially with drums, song and dance. This movement was officially termed the [...] "Fast-Track Land Reform Program" [...] (FTLRP). The predominantly white farm owners were forced off their lands along with their workers, who were typically of regional descent. This was often done violently and without compensation. In this first wave of farm invasions, a total of 110,000 square kilometres of land had been seized. Several million black farm workers were excluded from the redistribution, leaving them without employment. According to Human Rights Watch, by 2002 the War Veterans Association had [...] "killed white farm owners in the course of occupying commercial farms" [...] on at least seven occasions, in addition to [...] "several tens of [...] farm workers". The first white farmers to die as a direct consequence of the <b>resettlement</b> <b>programme</b> were murdered by Zimbabwean paramilitaries in mid 2000. More commonly, violence was directed against farmworkers, who were often assaulted and killed by the war veterans and their supporters. Violent confrontations between the farmers and the war veterans occurred and resulted in exchanges of gunfire, as well as a state of armed siege on the affected farms.|$|E
40|$|<b>Resettlement</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} {{implemented}} to relocate people from hazard areas to other safe places. Generally, <b>resettlement</b> <b>programmes</b> consist of several activities upon locations through time. However, the resettlement activities have never been analysed explicitly through these conditions. The lack of this knowledge causes many problems in considering the appropriate places for relocating people. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the resettlement activities and some considered factors by interviewing different roles {{of people in a}} hazard community. A case study of Ban Nam Ko sub-district is used to gain the knowledge of resettlement activities in more details. The explored results are presented as some significant milestones and descriptions to explain the resettlement activities. This study is beneficial to the relevant organisations to use the results in planning the places for each resettlement phase through time in order to avoid those inappropriate functions of places...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of the Saguling Dam project has been conducted. This paper {{attempts}} to examine the long-term effects of the dam construction on the livelihoods of the displaced people, paying special attention to any effects caused by inequality of access to resettlement schemes. The study results indicate that the majority of the resettlers perceived their livelihoods as being better after their resettlement. However, loss of jobs or conversion to less preferable or beneficial occupations caused by the project has affected their satisfaction level. In addition, inequality of access to options of the resettlement scheme has caused differences in socio-economic status among the resettlers. Furthermore, in the long term, the option has also failed to indemnify resettlers from lost livelihoods due to environmental and socio-economic constraints. For future <b>resettlement</b> <b>programmes,</b> the authors propose that policy makers should employ analysis instruments which can precisely predict long-run impacts, while local backgrounds and dynamics are important to be considered to secure the success of <b>resettlement</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Resettlement</b> <b>programmes</b> {{for people}} from a refugee {{background}} must respond {{to a variety of}} concerns as people from diverse backgrounds and often long-standing periods of upheaval and hardship enter their new resettlement communities. Host countries approach the demands of <b>resettlement</b> through varying <b>programmes</b> and policies and those differences across countries can profoundly affect the newcomers’ experiences. The current study employs quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the individual and contextual factors that influence the resettlement experience for adults from Sudan being resettled in Queensland, Australia. Ninety Sudanese adults were recruited through snowball sampling techniques for the quantitative study, with 10 individuals purposefully selected to complete the semi-structured qualitative interview. In the quantitative sample, 25 to 30 % of participants reported significant symptoms of psychological distress and frequent experiences of discrimination, and the majority of participants reported integration (identifying with both Australian and Sudanese cultures) as their method of acculturation. Participants reported feeling initially welcomed into Australia, with positive influences including bonding and bridging capital which helped them in their adaptation and negative influences including problems with the <b>resettlement</b> <b>programmes</b> and experiences of discrimination. The findings underscore the importance of socio-political context on refugee experiences of the resettlement process...|$|R
