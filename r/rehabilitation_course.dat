We hypothesized that a higher intensity {{of exercise}}, in combination with physiotherapist-led instructions and education in management of breathlessness, would lead to better self-management, possibly delaying calls to the emergency service and preventing hospitalization. Objective: We aimed to test this hypothesis in a subsequent randomized trial, and in order to test study processes and estimate hospitalization rates, we did a small preliminary prospective cohort study on severe COPD patients referred to outpatient rehabilitation. Methods: In 2013, four <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>courses</b> were scheduled (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) each lasting 8 weeks and including eight to ten patients. This preliminary study was designed as a controlled cohort study. The bi-weekly exercise sessions in the spring and autumn courses included a high-intensity walking exercise at 95 % of estimated VO 2  max for as long as possible. The other two <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>courses</b> included the usual walking exercise intensity (85 % of estimated VO 2  max). Hospitalization rates were assessed from the participants’ medical records in an 18 -month period. Results: We were able to enroll 31 patients in total (15 in the high-intensity exercise group and 16 in regular intensity). There were no group differences in the hospitalization rates. However, during review of the medical records, we observed a striking mortality rate among participants who had attended the high-intensity <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>courses</b> (five deaths) compared to the standard rehabilitation (zero deaths). Four of the five deaths were COPD exacerbations. Fisher’s exact test was statistically significant (P= 0. 046), as was a log-rank test (P= 0. 019) of the Kaplan–Meier estimated survival rates. Conclusion: These results from this small preliminary cohort study are alarming and raise concerns about the possible serious risks associated with high-intensity exercise rehabilitation of severe COPD patients.

The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{impending}} change in the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for drivers (Road Safety Authority, 2007 a), the aim {{of this paper is to}} examine recent surveys of attitudes and behaviour regarding drink-driving, to provide an estimate of any trends that may be apparent as well as current attitudes and behaviour. Any change in policy can only work, of course, if people comply with the law. This can be induced with high levels of enforcement, but it is far better if people comply with the law because they think it is a good law. Four main sources of information are examined, sampling driver responses from 1997 through to 2006 and including 3494 adults of whom 2804 were drivers. It was found that many drivers were unclear as to the current BAC limit. Those who did think they knew tended to err on the conservative side. Fifty percent agree that any alcohol may affect their driving, and drink-driving is seen as extremely shameful. A majority of drivers support Mandatory Alcohol Testing, stiffer penalties, and the introduction of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>courses</b> for repeat offenders. Over 75 % of drivers support a lower BAC, which is part of a continuing trend since 1997. Sixty-six percent now favour a zero limit, and 90 % a zero limit for new drivers. Although there are some reservations regarding interpretation of some of the published data, the evidence reviewed here indicates a progressive cultural shift against drinking and driving. Thus the time seems appropriate for the government to implement a lowered permitted BAC strategy...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt is {{important}} that those taking part in research trials are as representative as possible of those with the disease being studied. In a study of those with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} involving pulmonary rehabilitation, 120 of 297 suitable patients responded that they did not wish {{to take part in the}} trial. We were keen to know why these patients declined to take part in the study. MethodsA total of 120 patients who had responded that they did not wish to take part in the main trial were approached to ask if they would be willing to undertake a semi-structured face-to-face interview in their own home or by telephone. Those who were willing (n= 39) underwent tape-recorded interviews and data analysis was performed using the framework method. ResultsThis was a qualitative study which revealed that several themes influenced patients’ willingness or otherwise to take part in a research project involving pulmonary rehabilitation. Travelling to the hospital and location of the rehabilitation, along with competing commitments, and a variable perception of the benefits to the patient were clearly major factors and some had previous negative experiences of either the hospital, healthcare or research. While there was an element of negativity or impaired understanding regarding the research itself, the other factors appeared to be of greater importance. ConclusionRecruitment to pulmonary <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>courses</b> or recruitment to research involving pulmonary rehabilitation may be more successful if the location of the rehabilitation can be made as near to the patient's home as possible, and if the patient is given as much information as possible about what is involved...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{potential}} for telehealth-based interventions to provide remote support, education and improve self-management for long-term conditions is increasingly recognised. This trial aims {{to determine whether}} an intervention delivered through an easy-to-use tablet computer can {{improve the quality of}} life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by providing personalised self-management information and education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The EDGE (sElf management anD support proGrammE) for COPD is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of an Internet-linked tablet computer-based intervention (the EDGE platform) in improving quality of life in patients with moderate to very severe COPD compared with usual care. Eligible patients are randomly allocated to receive the tablet computer-based intervention or usual care in a 2 : 1 ratio using a web-based randomisation system. Participants are recruited from respiratory outpatient clinics and pulmonary <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>courses</b> as well as from those recently discharged from hospital with a COPD-related admission and from primary care clinics. Participants allocated to the tablet computer-based intervention complete a daily symptom diary and record clinical symptoms using a Bluetooth-linked pulse oximeter. Participants allocated to receive usual care are provided with all the information given to those allocated to the intervention but without the use of the tablet computer or the facility to monitor their symptoms or physiological variables. The primary outcome of quality of life is measured using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C) baseline, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures are recorded at these intervals in addition to 3 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Research Ethics Committee for Berkshire-South Central has provided ethical approval for the conduct of the study in the recruiting regions. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer review publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trials ISRCTN 40367841...|$|R
