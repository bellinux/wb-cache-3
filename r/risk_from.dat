5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place for farming due to the <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
25|$|In {{developing}} countries, environmental contaminants {{associated with}} increased health <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> use of infant formula, particularly diarrhea due to unclean water and lack of sterile conditions – both prerequisites to the safe use of formula – often outweigh any <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> breastfeeding.|$|R
25|$|Since human {{epidemiology}} and experimental data for CNS <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> space radiation are limited, mammalian models are essential tools {{for understanding the}} uncertainties of human risks. Cellular, tissue, and genetic animal models {{have been used in}} biological studies on the CNS using simulated space radiation. New technologies, such as three-dimensional cell cultures, microarrays, proteomics, and brain imaging, are used in systematic studies on CNS <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> different radiation types. According to biological data, mathematical models can be used to estimate the <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> space radiation.|$|R

5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} population, {{screening}} of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated.

5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> infections.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E
50|$|The recent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, {{as well as}} {{previous}} nuclear {{accidents in}} Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and elsewhere have heightened concerns about the human health <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> accidental exposure to radiation.

40|$|Despite much {{interest}} in the health risks associated with behavioral factors, {{little is known about}} whether individuals residing in different countries experience a different set of risks. International comparisons of the death <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> major behavioral factors can shed light on whether features of health systems and epidemiological histories modify the health effects of risky behaviors. We used nationally representative samples and mortality linkages spanning the 1971 – 2014 period from the United States and Finland to examine cross-national differences in the <b>risks</b> of death <b>from</b> cigarette smoking and obesity. We evaluated both current and former smoking and current and prior obesity. In 1990, the approximate midpoint of our study, the death <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> current smoking were about 55 % higher in U. S. women compared to Finnish women, but similar for men in the two countries. Death <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> smoking significantly increased over the period for women in both countries and there was no parallel increase in risks among men. Death <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> obesity did not significantly differ in the two countries and no significant trend in the risks were detected in either country. Reasons for the relatively high and increasing <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> smoking among American women warrant further evaluation...|$|R

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} he faced, Alderson transformed the ill-trained and poorly prepared Canadian recruits into tough, veteran soldiers {{and laid the}} foundations for later victories at Vimy Ridge and in other operations.

5|$|Federal {{investigations}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) were launched, {{and they}} interviewed witnesses, checked documentation, and conducted on-scene {{examination of the}} plant. OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours. Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, mantas became {{strictly}} {{protected in}} international waters {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of technology {{by the human}} race has allowed the greater exploitation {{of natural resources and}} has helped to alleviate some of the <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood. Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} {{occurred at}} the same time as the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, limiting the amount of supplies that could be sent to each of the disasters. Efforts were organized in Ibagué and Bogotá for Armero and in Cali for Chinchina, where medical teams gathered. Makeshift triage stations were established in Lerida, Guayabal, and Mariquita, and soon were overwhelmed with the sheer number of victims.
