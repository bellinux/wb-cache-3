In {{the design of}} bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, {{in which case the}} feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using <b>response</b> <b>surface</b> methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential quadratic programming.|$|E

The <b>response</b> <b>surfaces</b> are not known and have to be noisily sampled one-at-a-time. This setting is motivated by stochastic control applications and requires joint experimental design both in space and response-index dimensions. To generate sequential design heuristics we investigate stepwise uncertainty reduction approaches, as well as sampling based on posterior classification complexity. We also make connections between our continuous-input formulation and the discrete framework of pure regret in multi-armed bandits. To model the <b>response</b> <b>surfaces</b> we utilize kriging surrogates. Several numerical examples using both synthetic data and an epidemics control problem are provided to illustrate our approach and the efficacy of respective adaptive designs.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{formulation of}} the engineering optimization problem is given. Evaluation of the objective function and constraint equations can be very expensive in a computational sense. Thus, it is desirable to use as few evaluations as possible in obtaining its solution. In solving the equation, one approach is to develop approximations to the objective function and/or restraint equations and then to solve the equation using the approximations {{in place of the}} original functions. These approximations are referred to as <b>response</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The desirability of using <b>response</b> <b>surfaces</b> depends upon the number of functional evaluations required to build the <b>response</b> <b>surfaces</b> compared to the number required in the direct solution of the equation without approximations. The present study is concerned with evaluating the performance of <b>response</b> <b>surfaces</b> so that a decision can be made as to their effectiveness in optimization applications. In particular, this study focuses on how the quality of approximations is effected by design selection. Polynomial approximations and neural net approximations are considered...|$|R

40|$|Response-surface {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for obtaining probability distributions of the consequences of postulated nuclear reactor accidents. In these techniques, probability distributions are assigned to the system and model parameters of the accident analysis.

The results of the deterministic analyses are used to generate analytical functions (called <b>response</b> <b>surfaces)</b> that approximate the accident consequences in terms of selected system and model parameters. The response-surface methodology of this report includes both systematical and random knot-point selection schemes, second- and third-degree <b>response</b> <b>surfaces,</b> functional transformations of both input parameters and consequence variables, smooth synthesis of region-wise <b>response</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the treatment of random conditions for conditional distributions.
