It provided {{that they were to}} be funded centrally but could raise funds in their own <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> any other regulations necessary for the administration of the associations were to be made by the Army Council. It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the government will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows {{for the death penalty}} to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

25|$|New {{antisemitism}} is {{the concept}} that {{a new form of}} antisemitism has developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, emanating simultaneously from the far left, Islamism, and the far <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it tends to manifest itself as opposition to Zionism and the State of Israel. The concept generally posits that much of what is purported to be criticism of Israel by various individuals and world bodies, is, in fact, tantamount to demonization, and that, together with an alleged international resurgence of attacks on Jews and Jewish symbols, and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse, such demonization represents an evolution in the appearance of antisemitic beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit en banc, {{and thus}} the later {{decision}} controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive {{only to the extent}} they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} persisted until 1964, when John Ostrom {{discovered a}} small carnivorous dinosaur which he named Deinonychus antirrhopus, a theropod whose skeletal resemblance to birds seemed unmistakable. This led Ostrom {{to argue that}} Huxley had been <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> birds had indeed evolved from dinosaurs. Although it was Deinonychus that inspired Ostrom to connect birds with dinosaurs, very similar birdlike dinosaurs, such as Velociraptor, had been known for many decades, but no connection had been made. After Ostrom's discoveries, the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs gained support among palaeontologists, and today it is almost universally accepted. Newer methods, such as cladistics, and the discovery of several feathered dinosaurs have helped confirm the relationship.|$|E
25|$|The King {{knew that}} he had to take Paris if he stood any chance of ruling all of France. This, however, was no easy task. The Catholic League's presses and {{supporters}} continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared to fight to the death rather than accept a Calvinist king. The Battle of Ivry, fought on March 14, 1590, was another victory for the king, and Henry's forces went on to lay siege to Paris, but the siege was broken by Spanish support. Realising that his predecessor had been <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in Catholic Paris, Henry reputedly uttered the famous phrase Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris is well worth a mass). He was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1593 and was crowned at Chartres in 1594.|$|E

25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E
25|$|In April 1205 the Bishop of Hereford {{was summoned}} {{to appear before the}} court for his refusal to admit a {{suitable}} priest to this church currently in the possession of Cecilia Devereux. In his defense he stated that the clergy of the Hereford Chapter refused to allow an appointment as they claimed possession of this chapel. They requested the right to present their case. On 6 June 1205 Hugh, Dean of Hereford, paid 2 marks for convening another court to hear his suit countering the recognition of Cecilia’s holding of the chapel at Putley. On 29 June 1206, the Bishop of Hereford and his attorney appeared before the court claiming the church of Putley as their <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the grant to Cecilia Devereux had only occurred because the hearing proceeded too quickly to allow them to present their case. When the canons were informed of Cecilia’s claim, they had requested that the sheriff of Hereford put her claim on hold and were told this would require a warrant of the king. The canons submitted an assize presenting their position, and paid 12 shillings for the court to be summoned. On 15 October 1206 the Canons of Hereford appeared to show by what right the claim of Cecilia to the chapel of Putley should be set aside. They argued that they had been in possession of the chapel for over 60 years, and presented the original charter granting them the chapel by William Devereux. They also presented a charter the Bishop of Hereford, which later confirmed the original grant. They argued that the granting of the claim of Cecilia Devereux had occurred too quickly for them to respond, and when they had discovered that it had occurred they began the proceedings to regain their rights. On the payment of 40 shillings, the sheriff was ordered to have a jury assembled on 26 November 1206. The sheriff failed to gather the jury on this day and the hearing was postponed to January 1207. Hugh, Dean of Hereford, put Walter de la Puille in his place for the hearing now occurring on 29 January 1207. On this date the court found in favor of the Canons of Hereford. On 7 October 1207 Cecilia Devereux was fined 3 marks, and she released her claims and those of her future heirs. The canons paid Cecilia 8 marks, and granted her the privilege of having her name celebrated in Hereford Cathedral at the annual thanksgiving to benefactors, and daily in service of the church of Putley.|$|E

500|$|Publication of {{the sequel}} The Lord of the Rings altered many critics' {{reception}} of the work. Instead of approaching The Hobbit as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms {{picked up on the}} idea of The Hobbit as being a [...] "prelude", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a presentist interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it disregards the book's influence on these genres. Commentators such as Paul Kocher, John D. Rateliff and C. W. Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately, both because The Hobbit was conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers' expectations of tone and style.|$|E
500|$|In 1951, with secret {{means of}} {{communications}} established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. [...] He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.

[...] Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. [...] Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. [...] Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{title was}} {{invariably}} {{seen as a}} statement on {{the demise of the}} Beatles, as commentators viewed the album as Harrison's liberation from the artistic constraints imposed on him within the band. The album's cover image, showing Harrison seated on his Friar Park lawn surrounded by four reclining garden gnomes – thought to represent the Beatles – was also viewed as reflecting this theme. While commenting that [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] had [...] "accrue new layers of relevance" [...] during the album's creation, particularly with the death of Harrison's mother, former Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer writes: [...] "Nobody in November 1970 could have mistaken the title's significance... As if to cement the association of ideas, the wry cover picture has George in solitary splendour, surrounded by a quartet of gnomes." [...] In a 2001 interview, photographer Barry Feinstein admitted that the words [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] had helped inspire his set-up for the photo, saying: [...] "What else could it be?... was over with The Beatles, <b>right?</b> <b>And</b> <b>that</b> title...

500|$|Continuing his analysis, Barlow {{addressed}} [...] "The Last of the Masters", contrasting it with {{an earlier}} work by Dick, [...] "The Defenders".

The 'noble lie' has served its purpose." [...] However, Barlow concedes, [...] "ut this is an extremely early story and Dick had not yet clarified his own world view..." [...] Comparing this story to [...] "The Last of the Masters", Barlow took note of Dick's commentary from The Golden Man collection ("...sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> which is practical.") and concluded that the story represented Dick's understanding of [...] "the problems at the other extreme..." [...] in politics.
