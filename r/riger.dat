25|$|In 1991, Rimé et al. {{noted that}} in {{contemporary}} scientific research, emotions {{were considered to be}} responses to preceding events that are then restrained by self-control and self-restoration. As such, emotions were generally regarded as ephemeral and intrapersonal experiences. Rimé also later pointed out that attachment theory rendered emotional regulation to be of an interpersonal nature for children, yet to become mature adults one must become autonomous and capable of regulating emotions independently. In the field of psychology a healthy individual is typically seen as “self-contained, independent and self-reliant, capable of asserting himself and influencing his environment”. <b>Riger</b> also suggests that this individualistic view of emotional regulation could have been influenced by the context within which it had been studied, i.e. the United States.|$|E

2500|$|... "Nadia's Theme" [...] {{refers to}} an {{instrumental}} piece that became eponymously linked to Comăneci shortly after the 1976 Olympics. It began {{as part of the}} musical score of the 1971 film Bless the Beasts and Children, originally titled [...] "Cotton's Dream". It was also used as the title theme music for the American soap opera The Young and the Restless. It became associated with Comăneci after cinematographer/feature reporter Robert <b>Riger</b> used it against slow-motion montages of Nadia on the television program ABC's Wide World Of Sports. The song became a top-10 single in the fall of 1976, and the composers, Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin,Jr., renamed it [...] "Nadia's Theme" [...] in Comăneci's honour. However, Comăneci never actually performed to [...] "Nadia's Theme." [...] Her floor exercise music was a medley of the songs [...] "Yes Sir, That's My Baby" [...] and [...] "Jump in the Line" [...] arranged for piano.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riger</b> {{was the son}} of Harry St. John Cooke and Irene Teresa <b>Riger</b> of New York city.

His second marriage was to the writer Dawn Aberg; their children are Ariel Aberg-Riger (born 1981) and John Maxwell Aberg-Riger (born 1983).|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Sanger married sports {{illustrator}} {{and photographer}} Robert Nelson <b>Riger</b> (June 4, 1924 - May 19, 1995), they had four children: Christopher Robin <b>Riger</b> (1951), Victoria Eleanor <b>Riger</b> (1952), Robert Paris <b>Riger</b> (1960), Charlotte Irene <b>Riger</b> (1963).

40|$|The Buddhist {{practice}} of eight Waterloo, Ontario residents are explored in this study, highlighting {{the relationship between}} the reported outcomes of Buddhist practice and individual empowerment. By employing a heuristic research methodology, as described by Moustakas (1994), I use my own experience as a Buddhist practitioner to contribute to the research data and elicit detailed descriptions from the participants. The findings of the interviews reveal four common themes of the participants’ Buddhist practice: 1) increased awareness of unconscious habits; 2) peace from letting go of control; 3) a change in their perspective of self; and 4) enhanced connection with others. Discussion of the findings compares the outcomes of the participants’ practice with <b>Riger’s</b> (1993) proposed model of empowerment which incorporates both traditionally masculine ideals of control and individuality with traditionally feminine ideals of compassion and interconnection...|$|R
50|$|Parallel to his {{business}} career, Castberg conducted {{military and economic}} studies on his own. He became known for the paper Vil Ofoten-Luleåbanen blive af nogen særegen Betydning for de forenede <b>Rigers</b> militære Forhold? in 1885. In 1902 he published Ældre og nyere Udtalelser vedrørende Sveriges faste Forsvar. Both works pertained to the possible military tensions between Sweden and Norway, who were in a personal union at the time, the first work causing a greater interest {{in the northern part}} of the border. The question on the presence fortresses on the Norwegian-Swedish border would become a hot topic at the dissolution of the union in 1905, specifically in the Convention of Karlstad. In 1906 Castberg published Production: en Studie, a monography in economy. Already the next year it was published in English as Production: A Study in Economics.|$|R
