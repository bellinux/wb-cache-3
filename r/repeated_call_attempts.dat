50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of step-by-step and other early systems {{is that the}} preference for choosing trunks or selector links is fixed, and the most preferred links are used more often, {{with the result that}} the same faulty hardware blocks <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> until it is removed from service. 5XB markers were designed to rotate preferences {{in such a way that}} it is highly unlikely that the same circuit elements will be used in the next call. Thus, if a call encounters an equipment problem, a second try will probably succeed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for performance evaluation and comparison between existing handoff algorithms taking into consideration signal levels, call dropping, and handoff cost. Using the new approach, existing handoff algorithms are then compared in terms of signal quality and number of handoffs required to achieve a desired overall signal quality. We also provide in this paper a method to estimate handoff cost and to optimize handoff sequences for retrial (where <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> are made after a call is lost) and non-retrial models based on the proposed approach. We observe that the Threshold with Hysteresis method performs better than other known methods including the one used in the GSM standard. Our {{results indicate that the}} Threshold with 4 dB Hysteresis method performs well for urban areas although with a high dropping probability, whereas the Threshold with 6 dB Hysteresis method suits for suburban areas with a low dropping probability. We find that handoff sequences obtained by existing handoff methods are less efficient than the optimal handoff sequence given in the paper by a margin of 29 – 45 % for retrial model, and by 34 – 77 % for non-retrial model. The paper also suggests some specific parameter values to improve the performance of currently used handoff methods based on our findings. Copyright 201...|$|E

50|$|Virtual queuing is {{a concept}} used in inbound call centers. Call centers use an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) to {{distribute}} incoming calls to specific resources (agents) in the center. ACDs hold queued calls in First In, First Out order until agents become available. From the caller’s perspective, without virtual queuing they have only two choices: wait until an agent resource becomes available, or abandon (hang up) and try again later. From the call center’s perspective, a long queue results in many abandoned <b>calls,</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>attempts,</b> and customer dissatisfaction.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a single server retrial queue with {{a finite number}} of {{heterogeneous}} sources of calls is investigated. It is assumed when a given source is idle it will generate a primary call after an exponentially distributed time. If the server is free {{at the time of the}} request’s arrival then the call starts to be served. The service time is also exponentially distributed. During the service time the source cannot generate a new primary call. After service the source moves into free state and can generate a new call again. If the server is busy at the time of the arrival of a primary call, then the source starts generating so <b>called</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>calls</b> with exponentially distributed times until it finds the server free. As before, after service the source becomes free and can generate a new primary call again. We assume that the primary <b>calls,</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>attempts</b> and service times are mutually independent. This queueing system and its variants could be used to model magnetic disk memory systems, local area networks with CSMA/CD protocols and collision avoidance local area networks and could contribute as a building block for larger heterogeneous networks. The novelty of this model is the heterogeneity of the calls, which means that each call is characterized by its own arrival, repeated and service rates. The aim of the paper is to give the usual steady-state performance measures of the system. To do so, an efficient software tool, MOSEL (Modeling, Specification and Evaluation Language) developed at the University of Erlangen, Germany, is used to formulate and solve the problem. Several sample numerical results illustrate the power of the tool showing the effect of different parameters on the system’s measures...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> in a {{telephone}} survey is an important decision.

In this paper we study the effects of number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function of the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents.

40|$|In {{telephone}} surveys, several <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> {{are often}} needed {{to establish contact}} with selected individuals. We consider the problem of choosing {{the maximum number of}} <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> to be made to each selected individual before he or she is classified as unavailable. This is an important question since a large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; a small number of attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn. We start from the assumptions that the survey goal is to estimate a population total, that the sample can be divided into response homogeneity groups, and that the direct weighting estimator is to be used. We suggest a strategy for choosing the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> that takes the survey design, non-response, measurement errors and costs of data collection into account. The strategy relies on models for non-response and measurement errors. In our models, the impact of the error sources on the estimator may differ for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> According to our strategy, the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> is decided through a comparison of the estimator’s standard error for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> but the same cost.

40|$|Abstract⎯We {{consider}} a single server retrial queue with batch arrivals, two phases of heterogeneous service and multiple vacations with N- policy. The primary arrivals find the server busy or doing secondary job (vacation) will join orbit (group of <b>repeated</b> <b>calls).</b> If {{the number of}} <b>repeated</b> <b>calls</b> in orbit is less than N, the server does the secondary job repeatedly until the retrial group size reaches N. At the secondary job completion epoch, if the orbit size is at least N, then server remains in the system to render service either for primary <b>calls</b> or for <b>repeated</b> <b>calls.</b> For the proposed model, we carry out steady state system size distribution of number of customers in retrial group.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the unreliable nature of the servers under Retrial queueing system. These kinds of models are readily available in real life namely booking in Railway system, Call centres etc., so the analysis of such real models is most important. Consider a multi server retrial queueing system with breakdown and repair of services in which arrival rate follows a Poisson distribution with parameter ? and service time follows an exponential distribution with parameter. Let c be the number of servers in the system. The breakdown of service follows an exponential distribution with parameter a and repair of service follows an exponential distribution with parameter. If any one of the servers is free at the time of a primary call arrival, the arriving call begins to be served immediately by one of the free servers and customer leaves the system after service completion. Otherwise, if c servers are busy or c servers are in breakdown then the arriving customer goes to orbit and becomes a source of <b>repeated</b> <b>calls.</b> The pool of sources of <b>repeated</b> <b>calls</b> may be viewed as a sort of queue. Every such source produces a poisson process of <b>repeated</b> <b>calls</b> with intensity s. If an incoming <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> finds any one of the servers is free, it is served and leaves the system after service, while the source which produced this <b>repeated</b> <b>call</b> disappears. The access from the orbit to the service facility follows the classical retrial policy. This model is solved by using direct truncation method. Numerical study have been done for analysis of Mean Number of Customers in the Orbit (MNCO), Mean Number of Busy Servers (MNBS), Mean Number of Servers in Breakdown (MNSB) and various system measures...|$|R
