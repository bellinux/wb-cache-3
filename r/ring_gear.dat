25|$|The {{rotation}} of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is always {{the average of the}} rotations of the side sun gears. This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the drive shaft is held (say, leaving the transmission in gear preventing the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|E
25|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. The sun gears (which drive the axle half-shafts) will rotate at different speeds relative to the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the left wheel making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|E

50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer <b>rings</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R

Especially for large sectioned starter <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> (in this case diameter of the gear is 470 mm) the critical issue is to maintain a stable hardness distribution on gear cross sections. These hardness variations in process could yield to: 1. High scrap costs due to out of specification parts. 2. Increase in tact time in process, decrease in labor efficiency due to scrap rate and excessive hardness measurements. 3. Potential risk of failure on engine in low mileages. 4. 100 % hardness measurements in ongoing process which leads to time and cost waste. This technical paper summarizes the case study conducted for truck flywheel starter <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> with diameter of 470 mm in order to reduce hardness variation by optimization of induction hardening and tempering processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 3 K {{type and}} 2 K- 2 H type {{planetary}} gear trains {{can be designed}} to have high reduction ratios. Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type planetary gear reducer only contain two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type planetary gear reducers. Also, in general, the gear reducers with high reduction ratio are compound gear system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K type planetary simple gear reducers with high reduction ratios. Based on the concept of train value equation, the kinematic design of 2 K type planetary gear trains with high reduction ratio are synthesized. Six 2 K type planetary gear reducers are designed to illustrate the kinematic design process. Three of the examples are 2 K type planetary gear reducers with simple planet gears. For the 2 K type planetary simple gear reducer, there is a problem that is the simple planet gear engages to two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> with different tooth number. One example is used to illustrate how to design the two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> with different shift coefficient to engage the same planet gear.

500|$|Due to the secretive culture around masked wrestlers in Lucha libre Espantito's {{real name}} {{is not a matter}} of common knowledge, nor has it been {{revealed}} if he worked under a different ring name before he made his in-ring debut as Espantito. It has been confirmed that Espantito trained in his native Torreón, Coahuila under the tutelage of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz, better known as Espanto II and also received further training from Indio Chirikawa. In the early 1990s the Mini-Estrella concept was introduced in Mexico, featuring not just Midget professional wrestling but also wrestlers who were short in stature. A lot of these new Mini-Estrellas used the same ring character as regular sized wrestlers such as Octagoncito being a smaller version of Octagón. Due to his short stature, , the future Espantito became a natural fit in the Mini-Estrellas division and was given permission by his trainer to start working as a smaller version of Los Espantos ("The Terriors") and became known as El Espantito, wearing the signature black mask with a white cross on it popularized by Espanto I, Espanto II and Espanto III as well as the same black-and-white <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of the originals.

Most of AAA's Mini-Estrella division consisted of luchadors that had followed AAA founder Antonio Peña from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), where some of the Mini-Estrellas changed their name and mask due to the larger version of the character not jumping to AAA at the time.
