5000|$|Because {{the rest}} of the shark has little value {{relative}} to that of its fins, sharks are sometimes finned while fishing vessels are still at sea, and the finless and often still-living shark is thrown back into the sea to free space aboard the vessel. In legal contexts {{the use of the term}} [...] "shark finning" [...] can refer specifically to this practice of removing the fins from live sharks and discarding the carcass while still at sea. For these legal purposes the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ﬁns</b> on land during catch processing is not necessarily considered to be shark ﬁnning.|$|E
50|$|Shark finning {{refers to}} the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fins</b> from sharks, often while the shark is alive. The sharks are {{sometimes}} discarded back to the ocean, still alive but without their fins. Unable to swim effectively, they sink {{to the bottom of}} the ocean and die of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea enables fishing vessels to increase profitability and increase the number of sharks harvested, as they only have to store and transport the fins, by far the most profitable part of the shark; the shark meat is bulky to transport. Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.|$|E

40|$|The longitudinal, lateral, and {{directional}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a delta-wing configuration were obtained experimentally at Mach 20 in helium with Reynolds numbers, based on model length, of 1. 5 million and 2. 9 million and at a Mach number of 6 in air with a Reynolds number, based on model length, of 4. 8 million. The angles of attack varied from 0 deg to 55 deg for two sideslip angles. The effects of the addition <b>of</b> dorsal <b>fins,</b> the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> wing tip <b>fins,</b> an increase in elevon span, and changes in elevon hinge-line sweep angle are discussed. The unmodified vehicle had a maximum lift-drag ratio of 2. 1 at Mach 19 and of 2. 4 at Mach 6 with about the same lateral and directional stability level at both Mach numbers. As the Mach number increased from 6 to 20, the longitudinal center of pressure moved forward and more positive elevon deflection was therefore required to maintain a given trim angle. The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> wing tip <b>fins</b> increased the maximum lift-drag ratio and had a negligible effect on longitudinal stability, but caused directional instability that was not corrected by the dorsal fins examined. The shape of the wing and elevon hinge-line sweep had a large influence on the induced yawing moment due to roll control...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made by}} the NACA wing-flow method to determine the drag, pitching-moment, lift, and angle-of-attack characteristics at transonic speeds of various configurations of a semispan model of an early configuration of the XF 7 U- 1 tailless airplane. The results of the tests indicated that for the basic configuration with undeflected ailavator, the zero-lift drag rise occurred at a Mach number of about 0. 85 and that about a five-fold increase in drag occurred through the transonic speed range. The results of the tests also indicated that the drag increment produced by - 8. 0 degrees deflection of the ailavator increased with increase in normal-force coefficient and was smaller at speeds above than at speeds below the drag rise. The drag increment produced by 35 degree deflection of the speed brakes varied from 0. 040 to 0. 074 depending on the normal-force coefficient and Mach number. These values correspond to drag coefficients of about 0. 40 and 0. 75 based on speed-brake frontal area. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fin</b> produced a small positive drag increment at a given normal-force coefficient at speeds during the drag rise. A large forward shift of the neutral-point location occurred at Mach numbers above about 0. 90 upon <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fin,</b> and also a considerable forward shift throughout the Mach number range occurred upon deflection of the speed brakes. Ailavator ineffectiveness or reversal at low deflections, similar to that determined in previous tests of the basic configuration of the model in the Mach number range from about 0. 93 to 1. 0, was found for the fin-off configuration and for the model equipped with skewed (more highly sweptback) hinge-line ailavators. With the speed brakes deflected, little or no loss in the incremental pitching moment produced by deflection of the ailavator from O degrees to - 8. 00 degrees occurred in the Mach number range from 0. 85 to 1. 0 in contrast to a considerable loss found in previous tests with the speed brakes off...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the DM- 1 Glider, which had approximately triangular plan form, an aspect ratio of 1. 8 and a 60 degree sweptback leading edge, has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel. The investigation consisted of {{the determination of the}} separate effects of the following modifications made to the glider on its maximum lift and stability characteristics: (a) installation of sharp leading edges over the inboard semispan of the wing, (b) <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the vertical <b>fin,</b> (c) sealing <b>of</b> the elevon control-balance slots, (d) installation of redesigned thin vertical surfaces, (e) installation of faired sharp leading edges, and (f) installation of canopy. The maximum lift coefficient of the DM- 1 glider was increased from 0. 61 to 1. 01 by the installation of semispan sharp leading edges, and from 1. 01 to 1. 24 by the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the vertical <b>fin</b> and sealing <b>of</b> the elevon control-balance slots. The highest maximum lift coefficient (1. 32) was obtained when the faired sharp leading edges and the thin vertical surfaces were attached to the glider. The original DM- 1 glider was longitudinally stable. The semispan sharp leading edges shifted the neutral point forward approximately 3 percent of the root chord at moderate lift coefficients, and the glider configuration with these sharp leading edges attached was longitudinally unstable, for the assumed center-of-gravity location, at lift coefficients above 0. 73.

Thermal performances and effectiveness of perforation and equivalent surface solid fin arrays have been evaluated and compared.

50|$|Following Jaguar's {{withdrawal}} from {{competition at the}} end of the 1956 season, a number of completed and partly completed D-types remained unsold at the Browns Lane factory. In an attempt to recoup some of the investment made in building these unused chassis, and to exploit the lucrative American market for high-performance European sports cars, Sir William Lyons decided to convert a number to road-going specification. Only minor changes were made to the basic D-type structure: the addition of a passenger side door; the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the large <b>fin</b> behind the driver; and the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the divider between passenger and driver seats. In addition, changes were made for cosmetic, comfort and legal reasons: a full-width, chrome-surrounded windscreen was added; sidescreens were added to both driver and passenger doors; a rudimentary, folding, fabric roof was added for weather protection; chromed bumpers were added front and rear (a styling cue later used on the E-type); XK140 rear light clusters were mounted higher on the wings; and thin chrome strips were added to the edges of the front light fairings.|$|R

Immediately upon collection, the marginal pectoral fin ray was removed from some fish, and others were left unclipped as a control group. Fish were promptly returned to the laboratory and held in 1, 300 -L recirculating tanks at 21 - 26 °C. After a minimum recovery time of 48 h, individual fish were placed in a 1, 000 -L, Brett-type swim tunnel, {{and their ability to}} maintain station in flowing water by swimming, skimming, or substrate appression was tested by subjecting fish to increasing speeds beginning at 10 cm/s. After a 60 -min swimming bout, speed was increased by 10 cm/s. This was repeated until the fish could no longer maintain station. Fin ray removal had no significant effect on critical station-holding speed (CSHS). The CSHS (mean ± SE) of fin-ray clipped fish was 60. 1 ± 4. 2 cm/s, and that of unclipped fish was 59. 2 ± 3. 0 cm/s. Correlation analysis and analysis of variance indicated that collection method, water temperature, size of fish, and time spent in the laboratory had no significant effects on CSHS. Tail beat frequency increased with water velocity, but clipped and unclipped fish were not significantly different.

40|$|Fin {{flickering}} {{was defined}} as rapid movements <b>of</b> the <b>fins.</b> The behavioral function of such movements is however not well established.
