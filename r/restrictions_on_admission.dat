50|$|Up {{until the}} millennium, {{the number of}} {{students}} enrolled at the university rose exponentially. In 1992, UiO implemented a <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>admissions</b> for all of its faculties for the first time. A large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought {{to be found in the}} poor job market. In 1996, there were 38,265 students enrolled at UiO. This level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s. The strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partially to the poor labour market.|$|R

5000|$|The {{government}} was alarmed by these communities, and in 1861 tightened <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> and prohibited student organizations; these restrictions {{resulted in the}} first ever student demonstration, held in St. Petersburg, {{which led to a}} two-year closure of the university. The consequent conflict with the state was an important factor in the chronic student protests over subsequent decades. The atmosphere of the early 1860s gave rise to political engagement by students outside universities that became a tenet of student radicalism by the 1870s. Student radicals described [...] "the special duty and mission of the student as such to spread the new word of liberty. Students were called upon to extend their freedoms into society, to repay the privilege of learning by serving the people, and to become in Nikolai Ogarev's phrase 'apostles of knowledge'." [...] During the next two decades, universities produced a significant share of Russia's revolutionaries. Prosecution records from the 1860s and 1870s show {{that more than half of}} all political offences were committed by students despite being a minute proportion of the population. [...] "The tactics of the left-wing students proved to be remarkably effective, far beyond anyone's dreams. Sensing that neither the university administrations nor the government any longer possessed the will or authority to enforce regulations, radicals simply went ahead with their plans to turn the schools into centres of political activity for students and non students alike." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard and Joan Ostling {{point to}} the church's practice, {{continued}} until 1978, of refusing the priesthood to blacks as evidence that past LDS Church policies were racist in nature. Before the change in policy, most other adult males in the LDS Church were given the priesthood; church policy precluded blacks from officiating in ordinances and from participating in church temple ceremonies. Jerald and Sandra Tanner cite quotes from church leaders such as Brigham Young, who said, [...] "You must not think, from what I say, that I am opposed to slavery. No! The negro is damned, and is to serve his master till God chooses to remove the curse of Ham". The Tanners also illustrate church racism by quoting sections of the Book of Mormon which describe dark skin {{as a sign of}} a curse and a mark from God to distinguish a more righteous group of people from a less righteous group, and by citing passages describing white skin as [...] "delightsome" [...] while dark skin is portrayed as unenticing (...) [...] These references in the Book of Mormon refer to those presumed to be the ancestors of Native Americans, not people of African descent. Joseph F. Smith, president of the church, wrote that people with dark skin were less faithful in the pre-mortal life, and as such, did not warrant the blessings of the priesthood. The Tanners also cite other church leaders, historical and modern, who have spoken in favor of segregation and <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> to the priesthood for men of African descent.|$|E

40|$|The article {{addresses}} a recently emerging dialogue between Freudians and Jungians, {{in particular the}} attempts {{to understand how the}} two schools of analysis developed along different tra-jectories. Two catalysts for the schism are discussed: the physician require-ment at Freudian training institutes in the US and the claim of scientific vali-dation of Freudian theory. The article argues that the attempted medicaliza-tion of psychoanalysis was a major rea-son for Jungian analysts feeling alienat-ed from psychoanalysis since Jung never placed such <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> to training. And the claim that Freud’s metapsychology met sci-entific standards seems to have had as one of its purposes to dismiss Jung’s theories, with their much less technical bend. Now that the medical degree requirement is gone and theoretical for-mulations have proliferated on the basis of narrative explanations, the author proposes a serious reassessment by both analytic schools, including dealing with the internal problems plaguing many training institutes. As a solution to these problems the article argues for establishment of non-sectar-ian standards of accreditation, with rec-iprocity and freedom of candidates to transfer from one institute to another...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the article is export {{processing}} zones of Bangladesh, which may become a sample for development of mechanic engineering in Russia. Export processing zone, {{as a kind of}} special economic zones, is a quite useful tool for the country's economy. They allow reaching a number of government objectives: increase employment, attract investment and enhance volume of collected taxes. In addition to the direct eff ect, the emergence of export processing zones has indirect impact on the economy by increasing purchases from suppliers by SEZ residents.  Providing tax and customs benefi ts to residents, the state puts companies outside the zones at a disadvantage. However, to counter this, state imposes <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> of products of resident companies on domestic market. These restrictions may relate to establishment either of a certain percentage of products that can be delivered freely on the internal market or share that can be delivered after payment of customs duties and taxes. The purpose of this work is to show the results of Bangladesh EPZs and to present basic directions of development for such zone specialized in mechanic engineering in Russia. The methodological base of the research is comparative analysis, cause-eff ect relationships, as well as historical method. In this article the author analyzes the experience of creation of export processing zones in Bangladesh, where they are suffi ciently proven: new jobs and enterprises have been created - investments to these zones account for a signifi cant share of total investments to the country. Moreover export of Bangladesh has increased signifi cantly. At the same time the goal for diversifying the country industry has not been met: textile is the main branch is in these zones. At the article the author points to the possibility of using this experience in Russia in terms of mechanic engineering. Availability of qualifi ed personnel, training base, transfer of production from Europe, weakened national currency, government's desire to diversify Russian export may be crucial to attract investments to such Russian zones. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{identify}} {{problems associated}} with the treatment of inpatient drug users in Jeddah, and suggest ways of improving the delivery of health care service to these drug users. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and two subjects with substance dependence who were admitted to the Voluntary Detoxification Unit of Al Amal Hospital, Jeddah, between January and April 1997 (inclusive) were studied. A data gathering form was designed to collect relevant information. Outcome was recorded after discharge or transfer from the unit. RESULTS: Over half the subjects were single, unemployed, without high school education and came to the hospital unaccompanied. About 68. 21 &#x 0025; used heroin and 21. 52 &#x 0025; used alcohol. About 87. 86 &#x 0025; were intravenous drug users (IVDUs) and 54. 69 &#x 0025; started injecting from the outset. Just under half of the subjects were from outside Jeddah. There were regional variations in the choice of abused drugs. Most inpatients were on their first or second admission. The vast majority of subjects were readmitted within a year of discharge, and 44. 70 &#x 0025; gave no specific reason for their hospitalization. Unaided abstinence was reported by 42. 71 &#x 0025; and post-treatment abstinence by 57. 52 &#x 0025;. <b>On</b> <b>admission,</b> 57. 14 &#x 0025; expressed no desire to complete the program. About 54. 63 &#x 0025; were discharged after receiving medical detoxification, and 7. 61 &#x 0025; went on to have drug rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: The main finding of the study was that very few drug users were committed to completing the treatment program. There is a need to review the related factors that may be responsible for this situation. Changes have to be made to improve compliance and increase retention of the inpatient program. Contractual and probationary treatment of drug users should be initiated. Current <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>admissions</b> have to be eased.

The convent is nowadays very neglected and in tumble-down state, following the official <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>admission</b> of novices and the imperial decree of compulsory closing of the Novitiate convents.

Among the reforms in the legislation signed into law creating the association was the removal of the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>admission</b> of women to the practice of law.In 1896, NYSBA proposed the first global means for settling disputes among nations, what is now called the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. In the area of legal ethics, NYSBA adopted the Canons of Ethics in 1920. This evolved into the Code of Professional Responsibility and in 2001 adopted changes addressing multidisciplinary practice. The U.S. state of New York was the last state using the Code for many years, long after all other states-except California and Maine-had adopted the Model Rules. On December 17, 2008, the administrative committee of the New York courts announced that it had adopted a heavily modified version of the Model Rules, effective April 1, 2009. New York's version of the Model Rules was created by adjusting the standard Model Rules to reflect indigenous New York rules that had been incorporated over the years into its version of the Model Code. Even though New York did not adopt the Model Rules verbatim, the advantage of adopting its overall structure is that it simplifies the professional responsibility training of New York lawyers, and makes it easier for out-of-state lawyers to conform their conduct to New York rules by simply comparing their home state's version of the Model Rules to New York's version.|$|R

Whether HR <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> could be correlated and perhaps participate to inflammation has not been reported. MethodsBetween March 2007 and February 2010, we conducted a retrospective study on all patients admitted in our center for acute pericarditis. Diagnosis criteria included 2 among the following: typical chest pain, friction rub, pericardial effusion on cardiac echography, or typical ECG findings. Primary endpoint was biology: CRP <b>on</b> <b>admission,</b> <b>on</b> days 1, 2, 3, and especially peak. We evaluated also recurrences and clinical events during hospitalization and at one month. ResultsWe included 73 patients. Median age was 38. 0 y (CI 25 - 75 % 28. 0 - 51. 0) and median hospitalization duration was 2. 0 d (1. 5 - 3. 0). 27 % of the patients presented pericardial effusion. Heart rate <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> was 88. 0 bpm (CI 25 - 75 %: 76. 0 - 100. 0) and on discharge 72. 0 (65. 0 - 80. 0)). Heart rate <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> was significantly correlated with CRP <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> (r= 0. 34, n= 69; p= 0. 004), CRP peak (r= 0. 54; n= 61; p< 0. 0001), CRP on discharge (r= 0. 32; p= 0. 021) and temperature <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> (r= 0. 40; n= 39; p= 0. 01).

This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of circulating plasma DNA levels in severe septic patients presenting at the Emergency Department (ED). Methods Sixty-seven consecutive patients with severe sepsis and 33 controls were evaluated. Plasma DNA levels were estimated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay using primers for the human β-hemoglobin and ND 2 gene. The patients’ clinical and laboratory data <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> were analyzed. Results The median plasma nuclear and mitochondria DNA levels for severe septic patients <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those of the controls. The mean plasma nuclear DNA level <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> correlated with lactate concentration (γ[*]=[*] 0. 36, p [*]=[*] 0. 003) and plasma mitochondrial DNA <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> (γ[*]=[*] 0. 708, p [*] 0. 001). Significant prognostic factors for fatality included mechanical ventilation within the first 24 hours (p [*]=[*] 0. 013), mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> (p [*]=[*] 0. 04), serum lactate (p[*] [*] 0. 001), and both plasma nuclear and mitochondrial DNA <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> (p[*] [*] 0. 001).

The admitting consultants were then tested {{to see if they}} could diagnose the patients correctly when they were shown the admission histories and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Twenty-six per cent of patients with a final diagnosis of MI were not correctly diagnosed <b>on</b> <b>admission.</b> Fifty-one per cent of all patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy (TT) mainly because the diagnosis was not made <b>on</b> <b>admission.</b> A smaller {{proportion of}} these patients were admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU). The consultants only correctly diagnosed an average of 7. 3 of the 20 patients who were mis-diagnosed <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> and would have prescribed TT to an average of 4. 3 of these 20 patients. A significant proportion of patients had a diagnosis of MI missed <b>on</b> <b>admission</b> and therefore did not receive TT. Therefore, another aid to diagnosis such as serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) measurement should be available as an emergency test...|$|R
