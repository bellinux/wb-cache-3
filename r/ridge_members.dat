40|$|A RIDGE (Region of IncreaseD Gene Expression), {{as defined}} by {{previous}} studies, is a consecutive set of active genes on a chromosome that span a region around 110 kbp long. This study investigated RIDGE formation {{by focusing on the}} well-defined, immunological important MHC locus. Macrophages were assayed for gene expression levels using the Affymetrix MG-U 74 Av 2 chip are were either 1) uninfected, 2) primed with IFN-g, 3) viral activated with mCMV, or 4) both primed and viral activated. Gene expression data from these conditions was studied using data structures and new software developed for the visualisation and handling of structured functional genomic data. Specifically, the data was used to study RIDGE structures and investigate whether physically linked genes were also functionally related, and exhibited co-expression and potentially co-regulation. A greater number of RIDGEs with a greater number of members than expected by chance were found. Observed RIDGEs featured functional associations between <b>RIDGE</b> <b>members</b> (mainly explored via GO, UniProt, and Ingenuity), shared upstream control elements (via PROMO, TRANSFAC, and ClustalW), and similar gene expression profiles. Furthermore RIDGE formation cannot be explained by sequence duplication events alone. When the analysis was extended to the entire mouse genome, it became apparent that known genomic loci (for example the protocadherin loci) were more likely to contain more and longer RIDGEs. RIDGEs outside such loci tended towards single-gene RIDGEs unaffected by the conditions of study. New RIDGEs were also uncovered in the cascading response to IFNg priming and mCMV infection, as found by investigating an extensive time series during the first 12 hours after treatment. Existing RIDGEs were found to be elongated having more members the further the cascade progress. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|The Mahantango {{represents}} a terrestrial to marine transition zone {{that went through}} many transgressive-regression sequences. The fine-grained rocks represent a shallow sea environment and accounts {{for many of the}} fossils. Coarser grained sediments represent near-shore environments, beaches, or possibly delta lobes. These environments were tide-dominated and often had violent storms. The Montebello Sandstone member {{is an example of a}} storm dominated rock unit. Brachiopod fossils are scattered in massive sandstone beds throughout the rock unit, while the Sherman <b>Ridge</b> <b>member</b> is more laminated with fossilized ripple marks often indicating tidal current directions.|$|R
50|$|Spiclypeus {{is known}} solely from the holotype CMN 57081 which is housed at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Ontario.

Missing skull elements include the skull roof, the palate, the predentary and the rear of the lower jaws. It was collected from the lower Coal <b>Ridge</b> <b>Member</b> of the Campanian Judith River Formation several meters above the mid-Judith discontinuity, which dates it to between 76.24±0.18 and 75.21±0.12 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The Morrissey Formation is the basal {{unit of the}} Kootenay Group. It {{consists}} of massive, cliff-forming, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, with minor beds and lenses of conglomeratic sandstone, and rare beds of siltstone, carbonaceous mudstone, and coal. The sequence coarsens upward and, in most areas, it can be subdivided into two members. The lower portion, called the Weary <b>Ridge</b> <b>Member,</b> {{consists of}} orange-brown weathering, slightly argillaceous, calcareous sandstone with rare siltstone and mudstone interbeds. The upper portion, called the Moose Mountain Member, consists of hard, medium grey to brownish grey weathering, siliceous sandstone with rare beds of carbonaceous mudstone and coal.

50|$|In {{south central}} Pennsylvania, the Marcellus is mapped with three members, {{from top to}} base: The Mahanoy Member (Dmm), a dark gray to grayish black silty shale and siltstone; the Turkey <b>Ridge</b> <b>Member</b> (Dmt), an olive to dark-gray fine to medium grained sandstone; and the Shamokin Member (Dms), a dark gray to grayish black fissile {{carbonaceous}} shale that is calcareous in places near the base. The Turkey Ridge is commonly mapped in the Mahantango Formation, or included in the Montebello Formation (Dmot), and only the Shamokin correlates with the Marcellus on adjacent map sheets. In extreme eastern Pennsylvania, the Broadhead Creek member, a dark gray silty shale with dark gray shaly limestone concretions, appears above the Stony Hollow and Union Springs, in a layer up to 275 m thick.|$|R
50|$|The holotype, ROM 75860, {{was found}} in a {{sandstone}} layer of the Judith River Formation, part of the middle Coal <b>Ridge</b> <b>Member</b> with an age between 76.2 and 75.2 million years. It consists of a skeleton with skull. According to Theropoda Expeditions, it was 99% complete. It was described as a dinosaur mummy, also containing soft tissues. Many osteoderms and small ossicles of the armour are present in their original position. Additionally, there are remains of keratin sheaths of the spikes and of keratin, non-bony, scales, {{in the form of a}} black film. The specimen was in 2017 the most complete ankylosaur find from the Judith River Formation, which in this respect is not very productive. Also it was the first American ankylosaurian specimen combining good skull and tail material.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a new ceratopsid, Spiclypeus shipporum gen et sp. nov., from the lower Coal <b>Ridge</b> <b>Member</b> of the Judith River Formation in Montana, USA, which dates to ~ 76 Ma (upper Campanian). The species is {{distinguished}} by rugose dorsal contacts on the premaxillae for the nasals, laterally projecting postorbital horncores, fully fused and anteriorly curled P 1 and P 2 epiparietals, and a posterodorsally projecting P 3 epiparietal. The holotype specimen is also notable for its pathological left squamosal and humerus, which show varied signs of osteomyelitis and osteoarthritis. Although the postorbital horncores of Spiclypeus closely resemble those of the contemporaneous 'Ceratops', the horncores of both genera are nevertheless indistinguishable from those of some other horned dinosaurs, including Albertaceratops and Kosmoceratops; 'Ceratops' is therefore maintained as a nomen dubium. Cladistic analysis recovers Spiclypeus as the sister taxon to the clade Vagaceratops + Kosmoceratops, and appears transitional in the morphology of its epiparietals. The discovery of Spiclypeus adds to the poorly known dinosaur fauna of the Judith River Formation, and suggests faunal turnover within the formation...|$|R

In port, of course the sailors were permitted to go ashore, but the allowance was still charged to the ship's account; and became a perquisite of the purser.
