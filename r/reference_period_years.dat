40|$|International audienceGlobally, {{the year}} 2003 is {{associated}} {{with one of the}} largest atmospheric CO 2 rises on record. In the same year, Europe experienced an anomalously strong flux of CO 2 from the land to the atmosphere associated with an exceptionally dry and hot summer in Western and Central Europe. In this study we analyze the magnitude of this carbon flux anomaly and key driving ecosystem processes using simulations of seven terrestrial ecosystem models of different complexity and types (process-oriented and diagnostic). We address the following questions: (1) how large were deviations in the net European carbon flux in 2003 relative to a short-term baseline (1998 – 2002) and to longer-term variations in annual fluxes (1980 to 2005), (2) which European regions exhibited the largest changes in carbon fluxes during the growing season 2003, and (3) which ecosystem processes controlled the carbon balance anomaly. In most models the prominence of 2003 anomaly in carbon fluxes declined with lengthening of the <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> from one <b>year</b> to 16 years. The 2003 anomaly for annual net carbon fluxes ranged between 0. 35 and – 0. 63 Pg C for a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> of one <b>year</b> and between 0. 17 and – 0. 37 Pg C for a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> of 16 <b>years</b> for the whole Europe. In Western and Central Europe, the anomaly in simulated net ecosystem productivity (NEP) over the growing season in 2003 was outside the 1 s variance bound of the carbon flux anomalies for 1980 – 2005 in all models. The estimated anomaly in net carbon flux ranged between – 42 and – 158 Tg C for Western Europe and between 24 and – 129 Tg C for Central Europe depending on the model used. All models responded to a dipole pattern of the climate anomaly in 2003. In Western and Central Europe NEP was reduced due to heat and drought. In contrast, lower than normal temperatures and higher air humidity decreased NEP over Northeastern Europe. While models agree on the sign of changes in simulated NEP and gross primary productivity in 2003 over Western and Central Europe, models diverge in the estimates of anomalies in ecosystem respiration. Except for two process models which simulate respiration increase, most models simulated a decrease in ecosystem respiration in 2003. The diagnostic models showed a weaker decrease in ecosystem respiration than the process-oriented models. Based on the multi-model simulations we estimated the total carbon flux anomaly over the 2003 growing season in Europe to range between – 0. 02 and – 0. 27 Pg C relative to the net carbon flux in 1998 – 2002...|$|R

In the first scenario most producers would reduce the use of inputs to a minimum and leave the raw cotton in the fields.

The Eurostat approach has some major advantages but also comes with some problems inherent to {{the combination of the}} two levels of analysis (Ponthieux 2010). Including periods of unemployment or inactivity may distract us from the real problem we are interested in (Halleröd and Larsson 2008). By focussing on full-year workers, we can ignore ‘workers’ who are poor because they did not work. Furthermore, focussing only on full-time full-year workers excludes the effect of low working hours on low income, and from a policy perspective, it is especially interesting to know why even working full-time full-year does not allow some individuals to avoid poverty (Nolan et al. 2012). The drawback of this approach is of course that a group of workers who is often most likely to have low earnings and experience difficulties in making ends meet is excluded from the analysis. Crettaz (2011) therefore proposes to adopt the ILO definition of ‘working’, entailing having worked at least 1  h in the week of the interview.

Together these estimates infer a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> high-elevation specific mass balance of 4. 85. 4 cmw. e. a– 1.

40|$|A second-level {{reliability}} analysis {{is carried out}} on a realistic case study, represented by a 150, 000 DWT double-hull tanker on service on a North Europe – Persian Gulf route. The object of the investigation is the longitudinal strength of the hull girder subject to bending loads. The scope of the analysis is to evaluate different stochastic models for the load variables and various combination criteria for the static and dynamic load components. A <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> of one <b>year</b> is adopted in the analysis and, as regards the loading conditions, use is made of detailed records collected from the owner {{during the first year}} of activity of the ship. The collapse equation describes the failure mode due to pure vertical bending moment, considering the ultimate capacity of the hull girder in its “as-built” conditions. A FORM procedure is adopted to calculate the reliability index and failure point co-ordinates. The present work is intended as a first step for the set up of a second-level reliability procedure to be adopted in the calibration of partial safety factors formats for the verification of the longitudinal strength of ships. Values of the reliability index are obtained for an existing, typical and well designed oil tanker on a common route: such values can be used for future comparisons between different design solutions or practices...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of a purposive review of the {{different}} alcohol survey instruments currently used in survey research. The review was conducted to support the development of a standardized comparative survey methodology for Europe. It examines various types of instruments used to measure alcohol consumption, risky drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence, social consequences and third-party harm. The review of literature provides several insights for a European comparative survey. The beverage-specific quantity–frequency measure is recommended for use across countries. A <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> of 1 <b>year</b> for alcohol consumption is considered important if one is to link associated problems with alcohol intake. With regard to risky drinking, objective measures based on the quantity of approximately 60 – 70 g of ethanol per drinking occasion are preferable to subjective measures of drunkenness. In choosing an instrument for measuring abuse and dependence, the key issue is to decide whether the instrument is to serve as a screening or diagnostic tool. In the case of screening, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test or the Rapid Alcohol Problem Screen- 4 appears more appropriate. But if one desires to approximate a diagnostic category, then the Composite International Diagnostic Interview or another operationalization of ICD- 10 / DSM-IV criteria would be the better choice. Due to a lack of validated scales for social consequences and third-party harm, no recommendations are justified...|$|R
40|$|RESUMÉ MARIE MARKETA OF WALDSTEIN'S FOUNDATIONS This bachelor's work {{represents}} Marie Marketa, Countess of Waldstein, as {{the founder}} of sacral objects in her estates, and presents an overview of buildings with an explanation of their origin in the given locality. Bachelor's thesis is part of research on Waldstejn's patronage in northern Bohemia prepared for the exhibition of this important aristocratic family in the Museum of the Bohemian Paradise in Turnov. During my research, I did mapping of individual sites and I described them. From {{my point of view}} the work in the field was important, this means acquisition of photographs of individual churches and gathering additional information on the creation of buildings. Most <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> was the <b>years</b> 1724 - 1729, when the Countess of Waldstein was truly generous in promoting the arts, when the favorable financial situation help her. Thanks to this situation newly built or restored religious buildings on Waldstein's estates were built. Such as decanal church of St. James in Mnichovo Hradiště, St. Nicholas in Turnov, and St. Vojtěch in Kruh near Doksy, St. Wenceslas in Boseň and the chapel of St. John of Nepomuk at Waldstein, St. Stapin in Klokočka. The aim set for this work I managed to meet, even though I remained in this work due to my research even more [...] ...|$|R
