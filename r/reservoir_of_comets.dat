40|$|Panspermia, {{an ancient}} idea, posits that {{microbial}} life is ubiquitous in the Universe. After several decades of almost irrational rejection, panspermia is at last coming {{to be regarded}} as a serious contender for the beginnings of life on our planet. Astronomical data is shown to be consistent with the widespread distribution of complex organic molecules and dust particles that may have a biological provenance. A minuscule (10 21) survival rate of freeze-dried bacteria in space is all that is needed to ensure the continual re-cycling of cosmic microbial life in the galaxy. Evidence that terrestrial life may have come from elsewhere in the solar system has accumulated over the past decade. Mars is seen by some as a possible source of terrestrial life, but some hundreds <b>of</b> billions <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> that enveloped the entire solar system, are a far more likely primordial <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> life. <b>Comets</b> would then have seeded Earth, Mars, and indeed all other habitable planetary bodies in the inner regions of the solar system. The implications of this point of view, which was developed in conjunction with the late Sir Fred Hoyle since the 1970 s, are now becoming amenable to direct empirical test by studies of pristine organic material in the stratosphere.

40|$|International audienceBeyond the Kuiper belt, the Oort cloud is {{characterized}} by particularly cold temperatures {{and the absence of}} energetic particles. Specific chemical processes involving cold radicals may occur in this <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> A microwave-driven atomic source can be used to generate cold atomic nitrogen (N (4 S)) for reactivity study of ices relevant to the Oort cloud. Without any additional source of energy, atomic nitrogen does not react with CO molecules to form NCO. This is consistent with a previous theoretical investigation carried out by Yazidi et al., who have shown that the potential energy surface for the CO (X 1 Σ+) + N (4 S) system is purely dissociative. On the other hand, a very small amount of water is sufficient to induce a reaction between these two species. This three-body reaction leads to the formation of the HNCO monomer, the (HNCO) (H 2 O) complex, and the hydroxyl radical. Such reactions, leading to prebiotic molecules, may take place in the Oort cloud and in the Kuiper belt, from which most of the comets come...|$|E
40|$|The outer Solar System {{has long}} {{appeared}} to be a largely empty place, inhabited only by the four giant planets, Pluto and a transient population of comets. In 1977 however, a faint and enigmatic object - 2060 Chiron - was discovered moving on a moderately inclined, strongly chaotic 51 -year orbit which takes it from just inside Saturn's orbit out almost as far as that of Uranus. It was not initially clear from where Chiron originated. these objects become temporarily trapped on Centaur-like orbits Following Chiron's discovery, almost 15 years elapsed before other similar objects were discovered; five more have now been identified. Based on the detection statistics implied by these discoveries, it has become clear that these objects belong to a significant population of several hundred (or possibly several thousand) large icy bodies moving on relatively short-lived orbits between the giant planets. This new class of objects, known collectively as the Centaurs, are intermediate in diameter between typical comets (1 - 20 km) and small icy planets such as Pluto (approx. 2, 300 km) and Triton (approx. 2, 700 km). Although the Centaurs are interesting in their own right, they have taken on added significance following the recognition that they most probably originated in the ancient <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> and larger objects located beyond the orbit of Neptune known as the Kuiper belt...|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} dust have been {{detected}} {{in the immediate vicinity}} of many stars, both young and old. A promising scenario to explain the presence of this short-lived dust is that these analogues to the Zodiacal cloud (or exozodis) are refilled in situ through cometary activity and sublimation. As the <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> is not expected to be replenished, the presence of these exozodis in old systems has yet to be adequately explained. It was recently suggested that mean-motion resonances (MMR) with exterior planets on moderately eccentric (e_p≳ 0. 1) orbits could scatter planetesimals on to cometary orbits with delays of the order of several 100 Myr. Theoretically, this mechanism is also expected to sustain continuous production of active comets once it has started, potentially over Gyr-timescales. We aim here to investigate the ability of this mechanism to generate scattering on to cometary orbits compatible with the production of an exozodi on long timescales. We combine analytical predictions and complementary numerical N-body simulations to study its characteristics. We show, using order of magnitude estimates, that via this mechanism, low mass discs comparable to the Kuiper Belt could sustain comet scattering at rates compatible with the presence of the exozodis which are detected around Solar-type stars, and on Gyr timescales. We also find that the levels of dust detected around Vega could be sustained via our proposed mechanism if an eccentric Jupiter-like planet were present exterior to the system's cold debris disc.

40|$|The {{scenario}} and {{the efficiency}} of water transport by icy asteroids and comets are still amongst the most important unresolved questions about the early phases of planetary systems. The detection of Proxima Centauri b (PCb), which moves in the habitable zone, triggered a debate {{whether or not this}} planet can be habitable depending on its formation history and available water content. A better understanding of cometary dynamics in extrasolar systems shall provide information about cometary reservoirs and give an insight into water transport especially to planets in the habitable zone. In our study we perform numerous N-body simulations with PCb and an outer <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> We investigate close encounters and collisions with the planet, which are important for the transport of water. Observers found hints for a second planet with a period up to 500 days. Our studies show that from the dynamical point of view two planets are stable even for a massive second planet with up to ~ 12 Earth masses. The simulations of a possible second planet yield that this planet can stay in a stable orbit very close to PCb. For the study of exocomets we include an additional planet outside of PCb in our calculations and we also consider the in uence of the binary alpha Centauri. The studies on the dynamics of exocomets reveal that the outer limit for water transport is between 100 and 200 au. From our simulations we estimate the water mass delivered to the planets to be between 0 and 30 Earth oceans. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Infrared (IR) and visible wavelength observing campaigns were planned on NASA's Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and on National Solar Observatory Dunn (DST) and McMath-Pierce Solar Telescopes, respectively. We highlight our SOFIA (+FORCAST) mid- to far-IR images and spectroscopy (approx. 5 - 35 microns) of the dust in the coma of ISON are to be obtained by the ISON-SOFIA Team during a flight window 2013 Oct 21 - 23 UT (r_h approx. = 1. 18 AU). Dust characteristics, identified through the 10 micron silicate emission feature and its strength, as well as spectral features from cometary crystalline silicates (Forsterite) at 11. 05 - 11. 2 microns, and near 16, 19, 23. 5, 27. 5, and 33 microns are compared with other Oort cloud comets that span the range of small and/or highly porous grains (e. g., C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp) and C/ 2001 Q 4 (NEAT) to large and/or compact grains (e. g., C/ 2007 N 4 (Lulin) and C/ 2006 P 1 (McNaught)). Measurement of the crystalline peaks in contrast to the broad 10 and 20 micron amorphous silicate features yields the cometary silicate crystalline mass fraction, which is a benchmark for radial transport in our protoplanetary disk. The central wavelength positions, relative intensities, and feature asymmetries for the crystalline peaks may constrain the shapes of the crystals. Only SOFIA can look for cometary organics in the 5 - 8 micron region. Spatially resolved measurements of atoms and simple molecules from when comet ISON is near the Sun (r_h< 0. 4 AU, near Nov- 20 -Dec- 03 UT) were proposed for by the ISON-DST Team. Comet ISON is the first comet since comet Ikeya-Seki (1965 f) suitable for studying the alkalai metals Na and K and the atoms specifically attributed to dust grains including Mg, Si, Fe, as well as Ca. DST's Horizontal Grating Spectrometer (HGS) measures 4 settings: Na I, K, C 2 to sample cometary organics (along with Mg I), and [OI] as a proxy for activity from water (along with Si I and Fe I). State-of-the-art instruments that will also be employed include IBIS, which is a Fabry-Perot spectral imaging system that concurrently measures lines of Na, K, Ca II, or Fe, and ROSA (CSUN/QUB), which is a rapid imager that simultaneously monitors Ca II or CN. From McMath-Pierce, the Solar-Stellar Spectrograph also will target ISON (320 - 900 nm, R approx. 21, 000, r_h< 0. 3 AU).

40|$|Comet C/ 2012 S 1 (ISON) {{was unique}} {{in that it was}} a {{dynamically}} new comet derived from the Nearly Isotropic Oort cloud <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> with a sun-grazing orbit. We present thermal models for comet ISON (rh approx. 1. 15 AU, 2013 -Oct- 25 11 : 30 UT) that reveal comet ISON's dust was carbon-rich and dominated by a narrow size distribution dominated by approx. micron-sized grains. We constrained the models by our SOFIA FORCAST photometry at 11. 1, 19. 7 and 31. 5 microns and by a silicate feature strength of approx. 1. 1 and an 8 - 13 microns continuum greybody color temperature of approx. 275 - 280 K (using Tbb r 0. 5 h and Tbb approx. 260 - 265 K from Subaru COMICS, 2013 -Oct- 19 UT) [1, 2]. N-band spectra of comet ISON with the BASS instrument on the NASA IRTF (2013 -Nov- 11 - 12 UT) show a silicate feature strength of approx. 1. 1 and an 11. 2 microns forsterite peak. [3] Our thermal models yield constraints the dust composition as well as grain size distribution parameters: slope, peak grain size, porosity. Specifically, ISON's dust has a low silicate-to- amorphous carbon ratio (approx. 1 : 9), and the coma size distribution has a steep slope (N 4. 5) such that the coma is dominated by micron-sized, moderately porous, carbon-rich dust grains. The N-band continuum color temperature implies submicronto micron-size grains and the steep fall off of the SOFIA far-IR photometry requires the size distribution to have fewer relative numbers of larger and cooler grains compared to smaller and hotter grains. A proxy for the dust production rate is f approx. 1500 cm, akin to Af. ISON has a moderate-to-low dust-to-gas ratio. Comet ISON's dust grain size distribution does not appear similar to the few well-studied long-period Nearly Isotropic Comets (NICs), namely C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp) and C/ 2001 Q 4 (NEAT) that had smaller and/or more highly porous grains and larger sizes, or C/ 2007 N 4 (Lulin) and C/ 2006 P 1 (McNaught) that had large and/or compact grains. Radial transport to comet-forming disk distances (20 AU) is easier for smaller grains (1 micron) than for larger grains (approx. 20 microns like Stardust terminal particles). The presence of predominantly micron-sized and smaller grains suggests comet ISON may have formed either earlier in disk evolution whereby larger grains did not have the time to be transported to distances beyond Neptune, or the comet formed so far out in the disk that larger grains did not traverse such large radial distances. The high carbon-content of ISON's refractory dust appears to be complimented by the presence of limitedlifetime organic (CHON-like) grain materials: preliminary analyses of near-IR and high-resolution optical spectra indicate that gas-phase daughter molecules C 2, CN, and CH were more abundant than their parent molecules (C 2 H 2, C 2 H 6, measured in the near- IR). Dust composition as well as grain size distribution parameters (slope, peak grain size, and porosity) give clues to comet origins...|$|E
40|$|Comets {{belong to}} a group of small bodies {{generally}} known as icy planetesimals. Today the most primitive icy planetesimals are the Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) occupying a roughly planar domain beyond Neptune. KBOs may be scattered inward, allowing them to collide with planets.
