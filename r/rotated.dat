5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the <b>rotated</b> observer. The observer is physically <b>rotated.)</b> In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly <b>rotated.</b>|$|E

5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS national championship game. In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national championship game <b>rotated</b> every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The national championship game <b>rotated</b> to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU).

If it <b>rotated</b> in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E

40|$|To avoid {{resonance}} {{problems in}} <b>rotating</b> turbomachinery components such as impellers, {{it is of}} paramount importance to determine the natural frequencies of these parts when they are under operation. Nevertheless, most of these <b>rotating</b> structures are inaccessible and in some cases submerged and confined. To measure the natural frequencies of submerged impellers from the <b>rotating</b> frame is complicated, because sensors have to be well fixed, withstand with large pressure and centrifugal forces. Furthermore, the signals have to be transmitted to the stationary frame. For this reason it may be advantageous to measure the natural frequencies with sensors placed on the casing. In this paper, the analysis of <b>rotating</b> disk-like structures submerged and confined has been performed from the stationary frame. Previously, an analytical model to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the disk from the <b>rotating</b> frame is presented. Once natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained in the <b>rotating</b> frame, the transmission to the stationary frame has been deduced. A <b>rotating</b> disk test rig has been used for the experimental study. It consist of a <b>rotating</b> disk that has been excited from the <b>rotating</b> frame with a piezoelectric patch and it response has been measured from both <b>rotating</b> and stationary frame. Results shows that for <b>rotating</b> submerged structures in heavy fluids such as water, not only the structural modes of the <b>rotating</b> part are different than for <b>rotating</b> structures in air, but also the transmission from the <b>rotating</b> to the stationary frame.
