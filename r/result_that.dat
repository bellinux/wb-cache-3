40|$|A {{paradox is}} called a {{statement}} which is true and false in the same time. Therefore, if we suppose that statement is true, it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> is false; and reciprocally, if we suppose that is false, it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> is true. 2. But there are statements that do not completely obey this definition. We call a Semi-Paradox a statement such that either supposing that is true it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> is false (but not reciprocally), or supposing that is false it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> is true (but not reciprocally). So, the statement has a degree of 0. 50 (50 %) of a paradox, and 0. 50 of a non-paradox. 3. Three-Quarters Paradox. 3. 1. Definition. There are cases when a statement can be between a paradox and a semi-paradox. For example: a) If we suppose that the statement is true, it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> is false, but reciprocally if we suppose that the statement is false, {{it may be possible}} <b>resulting</b> <b>that</b> is true. Therefore, the second implication (conditional) does not always occur...|$|R

5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the <b>result</b> <b>that</b> different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E

Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E

5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity <b>result</b> <b>that</b> applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E
5|$|Peter Elfelt (1866–1931), {{who served}} his {{photography}} apprenticeship in 1893 in Hillerød with Carl Rathsack, soon opened a studio {{of his own}} together with his two brothers.

5|$|The {{research}} {{showed that}} companies that considered design {{on a higher}} level of the ladder were constantly growing.

With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also becomes more important.|$|E

5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the <b>result</b> <b>that</b> the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the <b>result</b> <b>that</b> treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E
5|$|As Vizier he {{had taken}} all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers with the <b>result</b> <b>that</b> the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy {{to help them get}} rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E

5|$|Aylesford School – Sports College is a {{secondary}} school situated in Teapot Lane, Aylesford, in modern buildings.

In 2004 the school gained specialist status as a Sports College, with the <b>result</b> <b>that</b> the curriculum now includes an element of sports education of every aspect.

5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the <b>result</b> <b>that</b> on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jetté learned to read and write.|$|E

Youth-team defender Dean Lisles was promoted to the first-team squad, to provide cover for the injured Sangaré, O'Hare and Purkiss. York drew 0–0 away to Hinckley United {{in the first round}} of the FA Trophy, and the replay at home was won 3–1, in which Brodie scored his second hat-trick of 2009–10. York beat fellow play-off contenders Mansfield 3–0 on Boxing Day, Brodie (2) and Gash scoring.
