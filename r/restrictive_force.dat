40|$|The European public {{procurement}} regulation {{has been described}} as a <b>restrictive</b> <b>force</b> on PPP projects, especially in countries which employ a strict interpretation of the directives. One major limitation brought forward has been the restrictions on negotiations during the procurement procedure. In the literature it has been suggested that the negotiation would improve PPP performance because it allows for a clarification of the contract and enables alignment of the parties’ goals. Two propositions are used to examine if the regulations are a hindrance to PPP performance by comparing the current doctrine and European case law on {{public procurement}} to those two propositions. The perspectives are the regulation of the different procedures available in the directives: competitive dialogue, the negotiated procedure, and the open and restricted procedures and the possibility of early involvement before the formal procedure has begun. The conclusion is that, while the directives limit the procuring authorities’ abilities to exchange information and negotiate provisions, the information which need to be transferred, and negotiations which needs to be conducted, can in most cases be carried out within the current procurement framework. Thus, the public procurement legislation does not present any substantial limitations on PPP performance...|$|E
40|$|CranioSacral Therapy (CST) {{has been}} shown to help the autistic {{individual}} find greater ease, both within themselves and in the world around them, by decreasing structural stress and strain on their central nervous system. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is estimated to affect one child in every 150 births. It’s the fastest growing developmental disability, with a diagnosis rate rising 10 to 17 percent each year. ASD {{is considered to be a}} result of biological and/or neurological disorders that affect the functioning of the brain. To date, there is no known single cause of ASD. The CST Model of ASD Dr. Upledger’s recent model of autism is based on his hands-on experience with autistic children and their responses to therapy. It’s supported by research at Johns Hopkins University showing “increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, neuroglial activation and inflammatory changes ” in the cerebrospinal fluid of the autistic patients studied. 1 Simply stated, ASD is partially caused by a loss of flexibility and probable inflammation of the membrane layers surrounding the brain. This compromise can create <b>restrictive</b> <b>force</b> on the brain tissue leading to adverse strain on the internal body-regulating components of the hypothalamus, the reticular activating system and the autonomic nervou...|$|E
40|$|Exon–intron {{architecture}} {{is one of}} the major features directing the splicing machinery to the short exons that are located within long flanking introns. However, the evolutionary dynamics of exon–intron architecture and its impact on splicing is largely unknown. Using a comparative genomic approach, we analyzed 17 vertebrate genomes and reconstructed the ancestral motifs of both 3 ′ and 5 ′ splice sites, as also the ancestral length of exons and introns. Our analyses suggest that vertebrate introns increased in length from the shortest ancestral introns to the longest primate introns. An evolutionary analysis of splice sites revealed that weak splice sites act as a <b>restrictive</b> <b>force</b> keeping introns short. In contrast, strong splice sites allow recognition of exons flanked by long introns. Reconstruction of the ancestral state suggests these phenomena were not prevalent in the vertebrate ancestor, but appeared during vertebrate evolution. By calculating evolutionary rate shifts in exons, we identified cis-acting regulatory sequences that became fixed during the transition from early vertebrates to mammals. Experimental validations performed on a selection of these hexamers confirmed their regulatory function. We additionally revealed many features of exons that can discriminate alternative from constitutive exons. These features were integrated into a machine-learning approach to predict whether an exon is alternative. Our algorithm obtains very high predictive power (AUC of 0. 91), and using these predictions we have identified and successfully validated novel alternatively spliced exons. Overall, we provide novel insights regarding the evolutionary constraints acting upon exons and their recognition by the splicing machinery...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates two episodic {{television}} shows, Arrested Development and Scrubs, {{and attempts}} to establish why one succeeded with audiences and the other failed. Following the work of genre theory, it is asserted that the two shows resonate with opposing narratives framing lived experience. The former presents the institutional (or <b>restrictive)</b> <b>force</b> of language to guide one's thoughts, mark disassociations between the self and others, and determine action. The latter appeals to the creative (or liberating) use of dialogue and narrative to inspire agency. In privileging the concrete situations in which interactions with others enable growth without restricting the will, and in which others are engaged in the same self-investigation, Scrubs calls for an acknowledgement of others. Arrested Development points to the metaphysical language and power systems that make such acknowledgements impossible. It is argued thereafter that both world-pictures have their place. The opposition between Arrested Development and Scrubs develops into a dual affirmation of how ordinary uses of language {{have the potential to}} create arbitrary limits between the self and others, but also how ordinary language in a state of emergence from the particular lives of a multiplicity of speakers enables us to meaningfully communicate {{in the first place and}} antagonizes the metaphysical pictures that hold us captive. This thesis concludes by exploring the way that fiction, as a series of propositions, occupies the middle space between an epistemological opening up and closing off of the self to others, allowing it to be used for either purpose, or for both at once.

40|$|The paper aims {{to analyze}} family policies, labor market and social {{protection}} {{policies in the}} light of their correlated effects on the dynamics of gender relations, to identify such new tools for understanding national realities in European countries and to propose appropriate directions for intervention by programs and policies. The current research on public policies considers that the analysis of family policies, of labor market or social security policies, from the perspective of gender (in) equality, offers relevant indicators with regard to the welfare regimes and quality of democracy or to the democratic deficit in the post-communist Romanian society, placed in the actual European context. This paper attempts to identify the mechanisms through which the state and its public policies reproduce and enhance traditional/conservative cultural models on gender roles and asymmetric social relations between men and women, also they reproduce the <b>restrictive</b> <b>force</b> of classic dichotomies between public-private life or productive-reproductive work. Despite the stated principle of gender equality, public policies maintain hierarchies and gender disparities in Romanian society, as in other European countries. This approach research shows that the complex interaction between cultural models of gender roles in the family/society and public policies is relevant to contextualized analysis of public policies and gender equality policies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the influence of cultural patterns (on family gender roles, labour organization etc.) on public policy (family policies, labor market policies, gender equality policies) in order to advance a set of questions: how do family and gender ideology influence the content of public policy and the conservation of gender regime in post-communist Romanian society? How can gender equality increase through public policies and to what extent is gender mainstreaming approach an appropriate solution in this sense...|$|E

This paper aims to discuss Jude's liminal character from the cultural perspectives on liminality respectively developed by the French ethnographer Arnold van Gennep and the British cultural anthropologist Victor Turner. Jude as a liminal character experiences similar transitions or rites of passage as defined and categorized by van Gennep. Yet, Jude's liminality remains permanent in each stage of his life since he cannot thoroughly perform the transition rites to leave one social position behind and undertake a new one. Also, analysed as a liminal character from Turner's understanding of the term, Jude fails to use the potential that his liminality provides him with to challenge the societal dogmas. However, he terribly suffers {{from the consequences of}} his liminal identity throughout the story. Jude's tragic end displays how he is punished for his lifelong liminality that prevents him from moving either to the centre or the margins of his Victorian society. This essay argues that Hardy's portrayal of Jude as a liminal figure reminds the defnitions of the term, developed by van Gennep and Turner, but produces a literary example that is quite antithetical to their conceptions particularly due to his apparent pessimism. For, Hardy depicts Jude's threshold identity as an obstacle in his efforts to belong to any particular social, cultural, economic, or intellectual group rather than an opportunity to challenge each social position...|$|R

40|$|In general {{electric}} field forces have the distinctive property {{of being able}} to mediate forces to virtually any material in a fully non-invasive and contact-free fashion. Based on this property, electrostatic levitation holds great promise for the semiconductor, solar panel, and flat-panel display industry since the handling of (semi) conducting and dielectric materials in a contact-free manner can bring many advantages and solve long-standing contamination and particulate control problems. These problems arise from the direct mechanical contact through which dielectric and semiconductor materials are commonly handled by process equipment in these industrial areas. Direct mechanical contact can cause chemical and particulate contamination of the handled material. Furthermore, it can result in electrostatic charging through tribo-electric effects, which raises the electrostatic potential of the handled material causing air-borne particles to be attracted to it. Ultimately, chemical and particulate contamination can critically affect performance, reliability, and product yield of the manufactured devices. Electrostatic levitation offers the inherent capability to avoid these contamination problems. In addition to enhancing contamination control, electrostatic levitation can provide uniformly distributed suspension forces. This is an advantage in the handling of very large and thin glass substrates used in the manufacture of flat panel displays as it leads to minimal mechanical deformation of the substrates. This thesis presents a comprehensive and in-depth study on the use of electrostatic fields for the contact-free suspension of (semi) conducting and dielectric materials. The electrostatic levitation devices that have been developed are specifically geared toward novel applications in the semiconductor and flat-panel display industry. Closed-loop feedback control is necessary to stabilize the position and attitude of the levitated object. In order to stably levitate an object, only three degrees of freedom are required to be actively controlled, i. e. the vertical motion and the angular motions represented by the pitch and roll angles. The lateral and longitudinal movements are passively stabilized by <b>restrictive</b> <b>forces</b> originating from the fringing fields existing between the outer edges of the stator electrodes and the suspended object. A generic voltage-controlled electrostatic levitator for the contact-free suspension of conducting disks or panels was developed first. Its main building blocks consist of a feedback controller, high-voltage dc amplifiers, displacement sensors, and a stator electrode structure. Simple guidelines based on the assumption of uniform electric fields are established for the design of suitable stator electrode patterns and applied voltage distributions, which guarantee electric potentials on disks/panels close to zero volts. Squeeze film air damping plays a major role since it may impact the dynamic behavior of the levitator significantly. The reason for this {{lies in the fact that}} the forces arising from squeeze film damping can approach values that are of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic suspension forces. We also investigated both theoretically and experimentally the <b>restrictive</b> lateral <b>forces</b> produced by the fringing fields. These forces are weaker than the levitation forces. In line with the theoretical model, the measurements show that the lateral force can be increased by applying higher stator voltage magnitudes or by decreasing the air gap separation. Based on these observations, the stator design was improved by adding a ring of peripheral sector electrodes having the primary function of generating the fringing fields. Levitation experiments have been conducted in an atmospheric environment, demonstrating the successful suspension of a 4 -inch silicon wafer, having a mass of 9. 4 g, at a nominal gap separation of 300 µm utilizing centralized PID feedback control. At constant ring electrode voltages of ± 1. 2 kV, a lateral stiffness value of 0. 84 N/m was produced by the improved stator produced, which corresponds to an increase of a factor of 5. 5 relative to the conventional stator. A major and growing industrial area of potential application of electrostatic levitation constitutes liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing. Glass substrates are basic and essential components in LCDs. They belong to the class of lossy dielectrics. Their charge relaxation times may complicate the task of levitating them stably. A stator electrode suitable for the levitation of lossy dielectrics consists of a regular planar array of parallel bar electrodes to which voltages of differing polarities are alternatingly applied. We develop a general analytical model of the levitation field and force on a lossy dielectric plate produced by this stator electrode. This model takes into account the influence of the atmospheric humidity on the electrostatic charging dynamics. The levitation force dynamics are studied by evaluating the transient response of the field under a step in the applied voltages. In this context, the rate of electric charge build up on the plate is characterized by the suspension initiation time (TSI), which is defined as the time elapsed between applying step voltages to the stator electrodes and start of lift-off of the dielectric plate from its initial position. TSI is theoretically predicted for 0. 7 mm thick soda-lime glass substrates, typically used in the manufacturing of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as a function of electrode geometry, air gap separation, ambient humidity, and step voltage magnitudes. The predicted results are shown to be in good agreement with previously published experimental data. Position measurement based on capacitive sensing technology has been investigated as well since it can lead to an improved level of levitator cleanliness. This stems from the fact that the sensing electrodes can be integrated into the stator electrodes rendering compact, planar structures. A charge-discharge capacitive displacement sensor with improved stray capacitance immunization capabilities was developed. In addition a simple and cost-effective capacitive sensor using the oscillation principle was designed and realized. Both sensors have been calibrated for different target materials, i. e. silicon, aluminum, and soda-lime and quartz glass. Measurements demonstrate a good linear behavior for both sensors. The final part of this thesis deals with cost-effective and compact electrostatic levitator designs. These designs are characterized by small footprints to ensure cleanliness and scalable to many degrees of freedom multi-electrode levitators without incurring excessive and prohibitive economic costs. The first designed levitator is driven by a relay based switching controller. Its key properties are that it is devoid of high-voltage dc amplifiers and a maximum number of only two high-voltage power supplies, capable of delivering constant dc voltages, are required. This number is entirely independent of the number of individually controlled stator electrodes. The inherent switching nature of the system imposes limit cycle oscillations on the levitated object. It is due to the squeeze-film air damping that these oscillations can be significantly suppressed, in particular at small gap separations down to 100 µm or lower. Successful levitation has been achieved for 4 -inch silicon wafers, 100 × 100 mm quartz glass substrates, and a highly flexible aluminum sheet measuring 280 × 280 mm, respectively. Experiments with the silicon wafer and glass substrates at reference air gap separations down to 100 µm or lower demonstrate limit cycle amplitudes below 1 µm. The second levitator is based on hysteresis control and represents a fundamental improvement on the first levitator in that it enables incorporating active damping in the system through derivative control. This fact opens up the possibility of operating the levitator in vacuum without degradation in performance as demonstrated by simulations. Overall, the proposed levitator retains largely the advantages of the relay control driven levitator. A 4 -inch silicon wafer was levitated successfully at a reference gap separation of 200 µm exhibiting a good transient and steady-state suspension performance. The measured switching period was 1. 5 ms and the amplitude of the voltage ripple was 10 V. The stability of the limit cycles in both levitators has been analyzed using the describing function method and Filippov’s theory. The first method follows an approximate approach while the second method offers a more precise avenue of tackling the stability analysis coupled with the key capability of analyzing multi-DOF systems.

40|$|Surrogate {{motherhood}} {{has been}} prohibited by Icelandic law since 1996, {{but in recent}} years, Icelandic couples have sought transnational surrogacy in India and the United States despite uncertainties about legal parental status as they return to Iceland with infants born to surrogate mothers. This reflects global trends of increased reproductive tourism, which <b>forces</b> <b>restrictive</b> regimes not only to make decisions concerning the citizenship and parentage of children born to surrogate mothers abroad, but also to confront difficult moral issues concerning surrogacy, global justice, human rights and exploitation. In March 2015, a legislative proposal permitting altruistic surrogacy, subject to strict regulation and oversight, and prohibiting the solicitation of commercial surrogacy abroad, was presented in the Icelandic Parliament. The proposal aims to protect {{the interest of the}} child first, respect the autonomy of the surrogate second, and accommodate the intended parents’ wishes third. After a brief overview of the development of the surrogacy issue in Iceland, this article describes the main features of this legislative proposal and evaluates it from an ethical and global justice perspective. It concludes that the proposed legislation is a response to problems generated by cross-border surrogacy in the context of evolving public attitudes toward the issue, and constitutes a valid attempt to reduce the moral hazards of surrogacy consistent with insights from current bioethical literature. Although the proposed legislation arguably represents an improvement over the current ban, however, difficult problems concerning evasive travel and global injustice are likely to persist until effective international coordination is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Rich meta-epidemiological {{data sets}} have been {{collected}} to explore associations between intervention effect estimates and study-level characteristics. Welton et al. proposed models {{for the analysis of}} meta-epidemiological data, but these models are <b>restrictive</b> because they <b>force</b> heterogeneity among studies with a particular characteristic to be at least as large as that among studies without the characteristic. In this paper we present alternative models that are invariant to the labels defining the two categories of studies. To exemplify the methods, we use a collection of meta-analyses in which the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool has been implemented. We first investigate the influence of small trial sample sizes (less than 100 participants), before investigating the influence of multiple methodological flaws (inadequate or unclear sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding). We fit both the Welton et al. model and our proposed label-invariant model and compare the results. Estimates of mean bias associated with the trial characteristics and of between-trial variances are not very sensitive to the choice of model. Results from fitting a univariable model show that heterogeneity variance is, on average, 88 % greater among trials with less than 100 participants. Based on a multivariable model, heterogeneity variance is, on average, 25 % greater among trials with inadequate/unclear sequence generation, 51 % greater among trials with inadequate/unclear blinding, and 23 % lower among trials with inadequate/unclear allocation concealment, though the 95 % intervals for these ratios are very wide. Our proposed label-invariant models for meta-epidemiological data analysis facilitate investigations of between-study heterogeneity attributable to certain study characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Background: Issues {{regarding}} {{the transmission of}} blood-borne viruses from infected medical personnel to patients are controversial to both parties. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the attitudes towards disclosure of HBV/HCV/HIV-infected surgeons and the possibility of being forced to give up surgical procedures, as well as to assess the prevalence of anti-HBc total, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV in surgical staff. Material and Methods: Using an anonymous questionnaire a cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted among surgeons and nurses of surgical wards in 16 randomly selected hospitals, Western Pomerania, Poland, from January to June 2009. Serum samples were tested for anti-HBc, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV by ELISA tests. Results: In the group of 427 participants (232 nurses, 65 doctors; a median age: 42 years), anti-HBc was found in 16. 6 %, HBsAg in 0. 7 %, anti-HCV in 1. 4 % and anti-HIV in 0 %. The risk of a single exposure to HBV was correctly defined by 26. 5 % of participants, to HCV by 19. 7 %, to HIV by 18. 7 %. 16. 2 % participants stated that infected surgeons should disclose their HBV, HCV, or HIV serostatus, 39. 8 % and 42. 6 % that those HBV/HCV-infected and HIV-infected, respectively, should discontinue practicing surgery. Participants who correctly assessed the risk of contracting HIV/HBV/HCV after a single exposure were significantly (p = 0. 0001; p = 0. 03; p = 0. 01, respectively) less likely to favor infected staff being forced to discontinue surgical procedures. Conclusions: A fraction of surgical staff showed detectable markers of HBV/HCV infection, they may be a source of infection for operated patients. Surgical staff's knowledge about occupational blood exposure risk was not satisfactory, which might have influenced the <b>restrictive</b> attitudes to <b>force</b> those infected with HBV/HCV/HIV to give up surgical procedures and a willingness to disclose their serological status.
