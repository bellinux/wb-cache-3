50|$|In {{the general}} <b>reparcelling</b> out of land, begun in 1757 when Finland {{was a part}} of Sweden, the medieval model of all fields {{consisting}} of numerous strips, each belonging to a farm, was replaced by a model of fields and forest areas each belonging to a single farm. In the further reparcellings, which started in 1848 when Finland was part of Russia, the idea of concentrating all the land in a farm to a single piece of real estate was reinforced. In these <b>reparcelling</b> processes, the land is redistributed in direct proportion to earlier prescription. Both the general <b>reparcelling</b> and the further <b>reparcelling</b> processes are still active {{in some parts of the}} country, and a new <b>reparcelling</b> can be initiated when the local need for such <b>reparcelling</b> arises. After the Finnish Civil War, when Finland had become independent, a series of land reforms followed. These included the compensated transfer of lease-holdings (torppa) to the leasers and prohibition of forestry companies to acquire land. After the Second World War, Karelians evacuated from areas ceded to Russia were given land in remaining Finnish areas, taken from public and private holdings with less than full compensation to the previous owners. Also the war veterans, and their widows benefited from these allotments. As a result of post-WWII land reform, 30,000 new farms were established, 33,000 small farms received more land and 67,000 families received either a plot for a single-family home or a homestead with some arable land.|$|E
50|$|Joaquín Cueto Otí (San Antonio, Entrambasaguas, 1925), {{a farmer}} and writer, {{considered}} a pioneer for <b>reparcelling</b> in Cantabria, which grouped {{the harvest of}} Hoznayo Calante in 1960, until it reached the villages of Navajeda, Islares and Habanos, president of the local agrarian chamber, co-founder of the independent association of ranchers and farmers of Santander (AIGA) and council member of Entrambasaguas. After retirement he wrote two dozen books.|$|E
50|$|In 1757, {{the general}} <b>reparcelling</b> out of land began. In this process, the medieval {{principle}} of dividing all the fields {{in a village}} into strips, each belonging to a farm, was changed into a principle of each farm consisting of a few relatively large areas of land. The land was redistributed in proportion to earlier possession of land, while uninhabited forests far from villages were socialized (see Agriculture in Sweden#History).|$|E
50|$|Before being {{incorporated}} into the city of Łódź in 1946, Retkinia was for many centuries {{closely associated with the}} nearby town of Pabianice rather than the fledgling town of Łódź. First mentioned in an ecclesiastical document in 1398, the village was administratively part of the Roman Catholic parish of St. Matthew in Pabianice from the late Middle Ages until 1910, and together with Pabianice it belonged to the Cathedral Chapter of Kraków until the Prussian invasion of 1793. After negotiations between the Chapter and the Prussian government following the second partition of Poland, the Chapter was compensated for the loss of lands, which became a property of the Prussian state, later to be {{incorporated into}} the Duchy of Warsaw (1807-1815) during the Napoleonic wars. After the Congress of Vienna, Retkinia, alongside Łódź and Pabianice, became part of the newly created Congress Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire. In 1839 the State Treasury sold the forest in Retkinia to brothers Konstanty and Jan Sięmiątkowski, and in 1841 the village was transferred into the ownership of Mateusz Lubowidzki, a member of the Council of State of the Kingdom of Poland. The latter sold the village to Wilhelm Nencki in 1854, whose family was compensated by the state following the abolition of serfdom in Congress Poland in 1864. Nencki tried to force the local peasants back into serfdom in 1864 but met with resistance and failed. In 1851 {{the eastern part of the}} village (later known as Zagrodniki) was struck by a devastating fire, and in 1855 the area experienced a famine caused by protracted rains. Poor sanitation and poverty contributed to disease, including two outbreaks of cholera. The year 1875 saw a <b>reparceling</b> of land, which led to the creation of six areas of settlement (Długa Kolonia, Mała Kolonia, Działy, Brzózki, Piaski and Zagrodniki) that were to form the structure of Retkinia until the construction of the housing estate in the 1970s. According to official statistics from 1827, the village of Retkinia (then located in Kalisz Voivodeship, Sieradz obwód, Szadek county) had 33 houses and a population of 300. By 1881, Retkinia had 50 houses and a population of 560. In 1902 the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line was opened, its tracks cutting the village in two.|$|R
50|$|During the 20th century, {{the way to}} Santiago {{lost its}} importance, {{especially}} because of the developing of new car roads. Aiazo became a common agrarian village that sent a big amount of people to the emigration. During the 1950s Aiazo started the <b>reparcelling</b> works, ended during the 1990s. This meant the largest transformation on Aiazo’s landscape in its history.Since the 1980s, the social structure of Aiazo became different and as some people returned from the emigration, they built new houses. By this time the Asociación de Veciños de Aiazo, (lately Asociación de Veciños Os Pasos de Aiazo) -a neighborhood association became very important. This group of people improved Aiazo social life in an extraordinary way. A historic day in Aiazo is the 23 July, since in this day of 1994 the Os Pasos de Aiazo recreational area {{was set up by}} this association, Os Pasos became so important that Aiazo celebrated different events by using this space, highlighting the Festa dos Pasos (Os Pasos Festival), since 1994, or the Ruta de Senderismo day (a hiking event) since 1998. In January 2005 Aiazo celebrated the first edition of the Festa da Merenda (Merenda Festival), devised by some influent women in the neighborhood association, that quickly became in the most important gastronomic festival in Frades and {{in one of the most}} important in all Galicia, exceeding 8.000 visitors in the 2015 edition.|$|E
40|$|The law No. 139 / 2002 Col., on <b>reparcelling</b> {{and land}} offices can be {{consider}} {{as one of}} the most important tools of active land law in the CR. In frame of administrative procedure in public interest, the law enables to re-parcel lands and ownership relations to them in order to create conditions for consequential management. A property right to newly defined parcels is acquired by a decision of the appropriate land office which is an administrative authority. By means of <b>reparcelling,</b> also „modern“ ecological problems are solved. <b>Reparcelling</b> is necessary for renewal of statutory land registration, clearing and delimitation of borders in the landscape, and so it is a significant contribution for renewal of peace in land ownership in the CR shaken in 1948 – 1989. <b>Reparcelling</b> shows only secondary economic impact, it is more suitable to assess the effectiveness only from the point of view of effectiveness of the financial means expended for <b>reparcelling.</b> The pieces of knowledge presented in the paper are a result of solution of the research intention 6046070906 „Economics of Czech agriculture resources and their efficient use in frame of multifunctional agri-food systems“...|$|E
40|$|Investments play a great {{role for}} {{individual}} companies {{as well as}} for a country's economy. Thus a careful decision about the investment project is of great importance. Choosing between various investment options is based on the preinvestment study. The focus of the dissertation is the drawing up of the preinvestment study for the Planina South project. The influence of the contractual <b>reparcelling</b> on the project's economic success is also analyzed. The starting point of the project is the adopted Planina South municipal location plan, which envisages the construction of a multi-occupied building with 112 apartments. The expected project expenditures are presented together with the time of their occurrence. The anticipated prices are based on the assumption about the decreasing apartment prices at that location due to an increased offer. The implementation of the contractual repareclling of the building land is a precondition for selling the apartments. Based on the influence analysis of the implementation of the contractual repareclling of the building land and the economical success of the project, the static and dynamic models were designed and four different dates of contractual repareclling were set. Results show that the economic success of the project is largely influenced by the date of the contractual repareclling of the building land: The more the dates of the <b>reparcelling</b> implementation and the end of construction work are apart, the less successful the project is economically. If the contractual repareclling of the building land begins in 2009 or later, there is no profit, i. e. the project is unsuccessful. In the future, the investment projects of the "building for the market" residential properties in Kranj will not be as profitable as they used to be...|$|E
40|$|Building {{of field}} roads {{following}} the complex <b>reparcelling</b> {{follows from the}} plan of joint facilities and is proposed {{with respect to the}} given cadastre. In the Czech traffic rules, field road is mentioned as a kind of purpose-built communication. The Czech norm No. 73 6109 defines it as a of purpose-built communication, serving preliminarily to the farmers, but potentially having also other function. It can serve as a bicycle path, pedestrian path and mainly as a road for motor vehicles enabling the owners to reach fields in their possession and their rational use. Field roads and the surrounding vegetation contribute to the landscape scenery and its biodiversity, permanently and clearly determine the borders between fields and cadastres. In summary, they contribute to stability of the cadastre. My task was to evaluate the newly-built joint facilities, namely the road network, {{from the point of view}} of their costs for the land offices České Budějovice and Český Krumlov. Therefore, I used the data offered to me by these offices. All these data are summarised in chapter 5 : Results and Discussion. In the Summary, I put together all the new findings and the course of building prices during 2000 - 2011...|$|E
40|$|In Flanders, the Government has {{recently}} established an innovative policy framework {{to preserve the}} water storage capacity in flood-prone areas. In this context, the concept of ‘Signal Areas’ (signaalgebieden) has been created. These areas are still undeveloped areas with a hard planning destination (residential and industrial areas) located in flood-prone areas. The framework outlines in what way one needs {{to deal with the}} flood risk in these areas. The intention is to work with tailor-made solutions for each separate area. For this purpose, a comprehensive tool-box is available, such as land <b>reparcelling,</b> spatial destination or zoning swapping (bestemmingsruil), regulations regarding appropriate construction methods and land use in urban planning regulations or in public utility servitudes, and the application of a sharpened Water Test. The final objective is to create an efficacious, area-oriented adaptation strategy for climate-proof spatial planning. In this contribution, the author will provide an insight into the legal design of the above-mentioned concepts and instruments, how they can contribute to a stronger linkage between water management and spatial planning and therefore to a solid climate change adaptation strategy, as well as the factors of success and failure of this new policy framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{redevelopment}} of a brownfield {{can provide}} a range of societal, environmental but also economic benefits {{for a number of}} entities. In the Netherlands (and elsewhere), public–private partnerships are common practice for such projects, because of two main reasons. First, limitations to public funding have led governments to invite the private sector into various long-term arrangements for capital-intensive projects. Second, a comprehensive approach for the whole brownfield area may be more efficient and profitable, compared to piecemeal development via interventions by individual owners. This article investigates, with respect to brownfield redevelopment, the interaction behavior of two key parties in forming partnerships: the municipality and a private developer. It is assumed that, apart from their mutual interest to redevelop the brownfield area, they will have different interests as well. In order to indicate their specific interest and the negotiation outcome regarding the forming of a public private partnership, this paper makes use of an experimental game theory approach. Three specific negotiation issues were analyzed in our research: a building claim, future land use and <b>reparcelling</b> of the land. In addition, this paper suggests an eight-step procedure to conduct a game theoretical experiment. A survey was conducted in order to gather the required data for the experiment. The data have been used to estimate the payoffs variations between the two key parties in the mentioned negotiation games. Finally, by comparing sub game perfect Nash equilibrium generated game outcomes and direct expected outcomes of respondents, this paper experimentally proves that the game theoretical analysis provides a valid representation of a real world brownfield redevelopment negotiation within the Dutch institutional-economic context. The outcome of the experiment confirms the Dutch tradition of public private partnerships in urban development practice, with public and private bodies willing to share financial risks and returns in these projects...|$|E
