5|$|Susianna Kentikian {{was born}} in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, the {{daughter}} of veterinary doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi. At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to school {{for a short period of}} time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's <b>residence</b> <b>status</b> remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{historical}} background of Hong Kong, immigration status in Hong Kong is determined {{by a combination of}} both nationality and <b>residence</b> <b>status.</b> Therefore, even a Chinese national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a slightly different status to a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong as well (since the former can never lose the right of abode status while the latter can lose it if he does not enter Hong Kong for a period of 36 months). At the same time, a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a preferential immigration status to a Chinese national without the right of abode in Hong Kong, as the former can remain in Hong Kong indefinitely, while the latter has to have his immigration status reassessed whenever his visa/permit expires.|$|E

2500|$|Under certain conditions, {{permanent}} <b>residence</b> <b>status</b> can be lost involuntarily. This includes {{committing a}} criminal act that makes a person removable from the United States. A person might also be found to have abandoned his/her status {{if he or she}} moves to another country to live there permanently, stays outside the USA for more than 365 days (without getting a re-entry permit before leaving), or does not file an income tax return on their worldwide income. [...] Permanent resident status can also be lost if it is found that the application or grounds for obtaining permanent residence was fraudulent. The failure to renew the permanent resident card does not result in the loss of status, except in the case of conditional permanent residents as noted above. [...] Nevertheless, it is still a good idea to renew the green card on time because it also acts as a work permit and travel permit (advance parole), but if the green card is renewed late, there is no penalty or extra fee to pay.|$|E

2500|$|Gülen {{procured}} a {{green card}} in 2001. Gülen’s application for permanent <b>residence</b> <b>status</b> in the US was controversial. Gülen first based his claim to residency on his status as an [...] "alien of extraordinary ability" [...] {{in the field of}} education - the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services categorically rejected it. As lawyers representing the Secretary of Homeland Security observed, Gülen has no degree or training in education and had authored no scholarly works. To the contrary, they argued, the evidence submitted by Gülen indicates that, far from being an academic, he seeks to cloak himself with academic status by commissioning academics to write about him and paying for conferences at which his work is studied. But, over the objections of the FBI, of the State Department, and of the Department of Homeland Security, three former CIA operatives intervened and managed to secure a permanent US residency for Gülen. CIA National Intelligence Council former vice chairman Graham E. Fuller, former CIA official George Fidas and former US Ambassador to Turkey Morton Abramowitz wrote endorsement letters for Gülen's green card application in 2008. His application ultimately won approval.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{independent}} effects of minority <b>status,</b> <b>residence,</b> insurance <b>status,</b> and income on physician utilization, controlling for general health {{status and the}} presence of acute or chronic health problems. Of special interest was the question of utilization differences among rural minority populations, as compared with urban non-Latino whites. DATA SOURCE: Data from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). STUDY DESIGN: Multivariate analyses used multiple logistic regression methods to detect independent effects of <b>residence</b> and minority <b>status</b> on whether or not individuals used physician services. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey, 1992. The survey included information about the race/ethnicity of the respondent, health status, utilization of services, insurance status, and socioeconomic status. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The most salient determinant of utilization of healthcare services is insurance status, regardless of race/ethnicity or (rural or urban) place of residence. Racial and ethnic minorities were less likely than whites to use physician services, and use was generally lower for rural residents. The most striking differences were for rural Latinos and rural Asians/other persons. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results demonstrate a need to adjust policies designed to improve utilization by accounting for particular problems faced by minority populations, they also demonstrate the primacy of addressing financial access...|$|R
