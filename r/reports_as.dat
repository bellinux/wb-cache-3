5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six {{messages from}} other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50years (which was {{the reason why the}} lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> a secondary concern.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{win over}} Clemson, Tech faced {{traditional}} rival Virginia {{in the annual}} battle for the Commonwealth Cup. Despite the rivalry {{and the fact that}} Virginia was ranked the No.24 team in the country, the Cavaliers put up even less of a struggle than Clemson. Virginia Tech won, 317. Now No.5 in the country, Tech began to distance itself from other highly ranked teams with consecutive wins over Rutgers and Syracuse. The 620 shutout of No.16 Syracuse was the largest victory ever recorded against a team ranked in the AP Poll.

5|$|From {{the launch}} of the {{original}} iPhone to the iPhone 4S, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.|$|E
5|$|Martin was an {{integral}} member of the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E

5|$|<b>Reports</b> <b>as</b> to {{the size}} of the mosque have varied considerably. Ali Mangera of Mangera Yvars Architects, {{submitted}} a proposal for the design competition, stated that his design would accommodate up to 40,000visitors simultaneously, with the potential for expanding to contain 70,000people. These figures led to much consternation. London Borough of Newham Councillor Alan Craig, of the Christian Peoples Alliance, criticised the development plans on the grounds that they would change the character of the local area, making it predominantly Muslim, and has called for a public inquiry into the mosque's development. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Newham planning department would refuse the mosque's application, as a project of that size had the potential to cause damage to community relations in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E

5|$|The {{genesis of}} the storm is unknown; it was first {{observed}} on September12 as a 70mph (120km/h) tropical storm about 550miles (885km) northeast of Antigua in the Lesser Antilles. On that day, the storm appeared on weather maps, and subsequently was tracked by ship <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> a small system. The storm tracked quickly northwestward, followed by a turn to the west-northwest. Around 18:00UTC on September13, the storm passed about 270mi (435km) south of Bermuda. Its exact track and intensity is unknown, though it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status late on September14 about 360mi (580km) west-southwest of Bermuda. The hurricane steadily intensified as it curved northward, and attained an estimated peak intensity of 100mph (155km/h) late on September15 about 110mi (190km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Żydokomuna {{continued}} to endure {{to a certain}} extent in postwar Poland (1944–1956), because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-controlled Communist regime as the fruition of prewar anti-Polish agitation; with it came the implication of Jewish responsibility. The Soviet appointments of Jews to positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception. Some 37.1% of post-war management of UB employees and members of the communist authorities in Poland were of Jewish origin. They were described in intelligence <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> very loyal to the Soviets (Szwagrzyk). Some Polish historians have impugned the loyalty of Jews returning to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover, which has raised the specter of Żydokomuna in the minds of other scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes <b>reports</b> <b>as</b> evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
