50|$|For the {{interference}} to occur, and since {{the interference}} pattern can be built up one interaction at a time, {{it is necessary that}} each individual wave packet of light interfere with itself. The physical picture being proposed here is that the single wave packet encounters the semi-transparent mirror and excites an electric field oscillation in each half of the MM apparatus. In each half of the apparatus the field induced by the wave packet interacts with two mirrors, once with the fully reflecting mirror at the terminus of the apparatus arm, once with the semi-transparent mirror. At the fully reflecting mirror the electric field is null, since the sum of the incident field and the <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> is zero. At the semi-transparent mirror, that portion of the field that is reflected (the portion in the one apparatus arm) is exactly equal to the negative of that portion of the incident field that enters (or leaves) the arm in question. Thus, analyzing each portion of the field independently within each apparatus arm shows that there are two enforced nulls for each arm, and the enforced node analogy is valid. This section has attempted to explain the physical picture behind Postulate DJL-II so that the postulate appears reasonable. However, from a scientific point of view, the postulate is one of the axioms, and arguments over “reasonableness” of starting assumptions are not crucial. What is crucial is that the set of axioms proposed herein lead to predictions of experimental reality that are different from competing theories so that tests can be done to determine which set of axioms best represents nature. While I hope readers now consider the postulate reasonable, the issue of testability is more important and will now be dealt with.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this presentation is to illustrate {{the accuracy of the}} Schelkunoff formulation over the Sommerfeld solution for a vertical electric dipole radiating over an imperfect ground. In an earlier paper, the alternate form of the Sommerfeld Green's function developed by Schelkunoff was presented (Schelkunoff, 1943 and Dyab, 2013). Here we demonstrate the application of this new methodology for two classes of problems. First, the problem of predicting the propagation path loss in a wireless communication environment is illustrated. The second application problem described in this paper deals with the verification of experimental data related to propagation over an Aluminum sheet at THz frequencies. It is seen that the main contribution of the <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> is due to a specular image point as expected for a metal and the presence of surface waves in the total <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> is absent, even though the permittivity of the metal is negative at these frequencies.

40|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{which has}} been termed "multilayered Rayleigh modes" has been presented in previous papers. This study aims to prove experimentally {{the existence of these}} waves in anisotropic periodically multilayered media. These modes result from a combination of Floquet waves which propagate in a periodically multilayered medium when all the Floquet waves are inhomogeneous. The experimental verification was done using an acousto-optic technique and a measurement of the <b>reflected</b> <b>field,</b> which was obtained with a hydrophone measurement system, on a carbon/epoxy composite plate. The experimental and calculated dispersion curves of the multilayered Rayleigh modes were then drawn. The coincidence of the curves was found quite good, thus confirming our theory. However, two modes were found by the acousto-optic technique not to fit into the theory. One experimentally detected mode was found to correspond to the Lamb mode of the plate and the other was not experimentally detected by the acousto-optic technique. Measurement of the <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> for this mode, which was obtained with a hydrophone measurement system, and its comparison with the predicted <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> make it possible to verify the existence of the mode.

40|$|The {{microstrip}} reflectarray antenna is a microstrip {{patch element}} planar array, which <b>reflects</b> the incident <b>fields</b> radiating from a feed antenna. Each patch element introduces a phase {{change to the}} scattered fields. In this paper, the scattering of the incident plane wave to a microstrip infinite array which performed by similar microstrip patch elements has been investigated. Determination of the <b>reflected</b> <b>fields</b> phase shift is desired. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method has been employed to calculate the phase shifts. At first, the infinite array configuration is converted to an equivalent unit cell configuration consisting only one radiator element using PEC and PMC walls around it. Then, a TEM plane wave excitation has been introduced for this equivalent waveguide structure and the <b>reflected</b> <b>fields</b> phase shift is determined by discretization of time domain Maxwell's equations and applying FDTD method. Using discrete time Fourier transform, the phase response yields in frequency domain. The phase response versus the microstrip patch size has been determined by using the existing relations for patch resonance dimensions.

40|$|Abstract. A {{recently}} proposed [1] shearing interferometer can {{be applied}} {{in the study of}} the attenuator tilt effect on the amplitude and phase distribution in the totally <b>reflected</b> <b>field.</b> The liner variation of the separation between the prism boundary and the attenuator face causes, especially at larger angles of incidence, specific distribution of the phase shift between the p- and s-components of the <b>reflected</b> <b>field.</b> The interferometer allows to determine this shift by measuring the fringe intensity distribution along the aperture of the beam. An experiment with a glass prism – air – plane silicon attenuator is described. The results are compared with the theoretical predictions.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that when a finite {{ultrasonic}} beam of a given spatial distribution is incident at the Rayleigh angle to a liquid-solid interface, the spatial distribution of the <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> may be altered significantly. The “energy redistribution” is due to the interference between the specularly reflected beam and a surface wave which has leaked back to the water. The “shape” of the <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> depends on the so-called Schoch displacement (which is characteristic of the interface) and on the width of the ultrasonic beam. It has also been observed that significant energy is scattered back to the transmitter at the Rayleigh angle.

The backscattered Rayleigh angle phenomena are also applied to measured surface wave velocities of anisotropic materials such as casts and welds...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{complexity}} behind manipulations of <b>reflected</b> <b>fields</b> by metasurfaces has been addressed showing that, {{even in the}} simplest scenarios, non-local response and excitation of auxiliary evanescent fields are required. Although these solutions theoretically allow to reflect incident plane waves into any desired direction, actual implementations are difficult and, in most cases, require extensive numerical optimization of the metamirror topology. In this work, we introduce purely local reflective metasurfaces for arbitrary manipulations of the power distribution of reflected waves without excitation of any auxiliary evanescent fields. The fields in front of such local metamirror contain only the desired propagating waves. The method {{is based on the}} analysis of the power flow distribution and the adaptation of the reflector shape to the desired distribution of <b>reflected</b> <b>fields.</b> As a result, we find that these power-conformal metamirrors can be easily implemented with conventional phase shifters. The results can be used for the design of reflecting surfaces with multiple functionalities and for waves of different physical nature.

The <b>reflected</b> <b>field</b> is the convolution of the incident waveform with the time-domain reflection coefficient, which is found by computing an inverse Laplace transform of the standard Fresnel reflection coefficient.

For materials described by simple dispersion models, the results should prove valuable for use in time-domain material characterization systems.
