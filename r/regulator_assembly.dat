The pack had a {{fiberglass}} frame contoured {{to fit the}} operator's body, secured with straps, and cylinders of fuel and nitrogen were attached to the frame. The motor was fastened using a hinged assembly that was controlled by levers under the shoulders while thrust was controlled through a <b>regulator</b> <b>assembly</b> connected to a throttle handle on the right lever of the device. The handle on the left lever governed the slant of the (jetavators) nozzles. Tests of the pack began {{toward the end of}} 1960 and were performed in a large hangar with a safety tether.

40|$|An {{advanced}} reactant {{pressure regulator}} with an internal ejector reactant circulation pump {{has been developed}} to support NASA's future fuel cell power systems needs. These needs include reliable and safe operation in variable-gravity environments, and for exploration activities with both manned and un manned vehicles. This product was developed for use in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) power plant reactant circulation systems, but the design could also be applied to other fuel cell system types, (e. g., solid-oxide or alkaline) or for other gas pressure regulation and circulation needs. The regulator design includes porting for measurement of flow and pressure at key points in the system, and also includes several fuel cell system integration options. NASA has recognized ejectors as {{a viable alternative to}} mechanical pumps for use in spacecraft fuel cell power systems. The ejector motive force is provided by a variable, high-pressure supply gas that travels through the ejector s jet nozzle, whereby the pressure energy of the fluid stream is converted to kinetic energy in the gas jet. The ejector can produce circulation-to-consumption-flow ratios that are relatively high (2 - 3 times), and this phenomenon can potentially (with proper consideration of the remainder of the fuel cell system s design) be used to provide completely for reactant pre-humidification and product water removal in a fuel cell system. Specifically, a custom pressure regulator has been developed that includes: (1) an ejector reactant circulation pump (with interchangeable jet nozzles and mixer sections, gas-tight sliding and static seals in required locations, and internal fluid porting for pressure-sensing at the regulator's control elements) and (2) internal fluid porting to allow for flow rate and system pressure measurements. The fluid porting also allows for inclusion of purge, relief, and vacuum-breaker check valves on the <b>regulator</b> <b>assembly.</b> In addition, this regulator could also be used with NASA's advanced nonflow-through fuel cell power systems by simply incorporating a jet nozzle with an appropriate nozzle diameter...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{structural}} {{studies on}} transcription factors from the POU family in complex with multiple cognate DNA enhancer elements {{have established a}} novel concept in DNA-mediated formation of distinct conformations of transcription <b>regulator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Two crystal structures of the Oct- 1 transcription factor {{in the presence of}} two different DNA sites have demonstrated how its POU DNA-binding segment is capable in forming two unrelated dimer arrangements, which is DNA motif dependent. While one arrangement allows binding of the Oct- 1 speci®c coactivator OBF- 1, binding of this coactivator is blocked in the second arrangement because the binding site is involved in its own dimer assembly. Conversely, two crystal structures of another POU transcription factor, Pit- 1, have demonstrated how the same overall assembly is maintained in the presence of two different DNA response elements. However, since the distance of the two Pit- 1 half-binding sites on these elements differ by two base pairs, the overall dimensions of the two complexes vary, allowing binding of a speci®c represssor (N-CoR) in one conformation but not in the other. Thus, despite the occurrence of different DNA-mediated molecular mechanisms, the net result, conformation-dependent binding of further regulators, is equivalent. These data introduce a concept where the DNA motif not only serves as binding site for speci®c transcription factors but also regulates their function by mediating speci®c transcription factor assemblies, which determine binding to conformation-dependent coregulators...|$|R

We describe a complex that targets the Protein Phosphatase 2 A holoenzyme (PP 2 A) to centrosomes in C. elegans embryos.

In contrast to the multiple functions of the PP 2 A catalytic subunit, RSA- 1 and RSA- 2 are specifically required for microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes and for spindle assembly. The centrosomally localized RSA-PP 2 A complex mediates these functions in part by regulating two critical mitotic effectors: the microtubule destabilizer KLP- 7 and the C. elegans <b>regulator</b> of spindle <b>assembly</b> TPXL- 1.

Since the assembly of collagen fibrils has {{a significant impact on}} the functionality of the scaffold, the ability to replicate the fibril assembly of human tissues is critical. To determine the mechanism of fish collagen fibril assembly, we first identified non-collagenous proteins (NCPs), the potential <b>regulators</b> of fibril <b>assembly</b> in vivo, and then used tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the NCPs contained in the basal plates of goldfish Carassius auratus scales, a collagenous plate which is characterized by a plywood-like assembly of collagen fibrils similar to that found in the cornea.

ResultsHere we use an RNA-interference screen of the human centrosome proteome to identify novel <b>regulators</b> of spindle <b>assembly.</b> One such <b>regulator</b> is HAUS, an 8 -subunit protein complex that shares homology to Drosophila Augmin. HAUS localizes to interphase centrosomes and to mitotic spindle microtubules, and its disruption induces microtubule-dependent fragmentation of centrosomes along with an increase in centrosome size. HAUS disruption results in the destabilization of kinetochore microtubules and the eventual formation of multipolar spindles. These severe mitotic defects are alleviated by codepletion of NuMA, indicating that both factors regulate opposing activities.
