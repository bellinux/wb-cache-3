5|$|CryoSat-2 is an almost-identical {{copy of the}} {{original}} spacecraft, however modifications were made including {{the addition of a}} backup <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter.</b> In total, 85 improvements were made to the spacecraft when it was rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 2008, a 34-kg probe made a {{hard landing}} near the crater. The moon impact probe (MIP) was {{launched}} from the Indian Chandrayaan-I spacecraft {{and reached the}} surface 25 minutes later. The probe carried a <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter,</b> video imaging system, and a mass spectrometer, which {{will be used to}} search for water.|$|E
5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with a frequency modulated type <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> known as AYD and a pulse type known as 718. The AYD modifications {{were made by the}} Norden Laboratories Corporation under an OSRD contract. When the manufacturer of 718, RCA, was contacted, it was learned that a new tail warning radar, AN/APS-13, later nicknamed Archie, was just entering production, which could be adapted for use as a <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter.</b> The third unit to be made was delivered to Los Alamos in April 1944. In May it was tested by diving an AT-11. This was followed by full-scale drop testing in June and July. These were very successful, whereas the AYD continued to suffer from problems. Archie was therefore adopted, although the scarcity of units in August 1944 precluded wholescale destructive testing. Testing of Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft with Thin Man bomb shapes was carried out at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{normally}} {{work in the}} E band, , or, {{for more}} advanced sea-level measurement, S band. <b>Radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> also provide a reliable and accurate method of measuring height above water, when flying long sea-tracks. These are critical for use when operating to and from oil rigs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> are {{frequently}} used by commercial aircraft for approach and landing, especially in low-visibility conditions (see instrument flight rules) and automatic landings, allowing the autopilot {{to know when}} to begin the flare maneuver. <b>Radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> give data to the autothrottle which {{is a part of the}} Flight Computer.|$|R

5|$|The first Ju 88s {{took off}} at 23:00 and began {{heading toward the}} Dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at {{approximately}} 50 metres while they flew out to sea. Crews were forbidden to engage enemy aircraft over the North Sea {{in order to preserve}} surprise until the last possible moment. The rain and squall assisted crews in judging the location and distance of the water. However, with crews prone to human error, it was decided to use the very accurate FuG 101 <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> and the Ju 88s blind-flying instruments. The strain on the crews was enormous, as a careful vigil was kept on them until the British coast was reached and the pilot began his ascent to the height of the returning bomber stream. As they did so, the Ju 88s released Düppel to obscure the radar of Mosquito fighters. The pilots were then free to begin their attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Little Boy pre-assemblies were {{designated}} L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test {{was conducted with}} L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian {{in order to test}} the <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> by the B-29 later known as Big Stink, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.|$|E
5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini <b>RADAR</b> <b>altimeter</b> observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} bias is {{an error}} present in radar altimetry {{of the ocean}} due to the non-uniform reflection from wave troughs and crests. A study of the electromagnetic bias became necessary to permit error reduction in mean sea level measurements of satellite <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters.</b> Satellite <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{have been used to}} find the upper and lower bounds for the electromagnetic bias. This report will present a theory using physical optics scattering and an empirical model of the short wave modulation to predict the electromagnetic bias. The predicted electromagnetic bias will be compared to measurements at C and Ku bands...|$|R

25|$|New {{avionics}} were incorporated, {{including a}} Litton {{inertial navigation system}} (INS) that could store 16 different preprogrammed navigation waypoints; a <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> with a ground warning system; and other improved navigation and communications gear.|$|E
25|$|The Sperry AN/ASQ-42 bombing/navigation system {{combined}} {{a sophisticated}} {{inertial navigation system}} with the KS-39 Star tracker (astro-inertial navigation system) to provide heading reference, the AN/APN-113 Doppler radar to provide ground speed and windspeed data, a search radar to provide range data for bomb release and trajectory, and a <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter.</b> The AN/ASQ-42 {{was estimated to be}} 10 times more accurate than any previous bombing/navigation system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{generally}} {{only give}} readings up to 2500 ft {{above ground level}} (AGL). Frequently, the weather radar can be directed downwards to give a reading from a longer range, up to 60,000 ft above ground level (AGL). , all airliners are equipped {{with at least two}} and possibly more <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters,</b> as they are essential to autoland capabilities. ( [...] , determining height through other methods such as GPS is not permitted by regulations.) Older airliners from the 1960s (such as the British Aircraft Corporation BAC 1-11) and smaller airliners in the sub-50 seat class (such as the ATR 42 and BAe Jetstream series) are equipped with them.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar can be used. The {{greater the}} {{frequency}} shift the further the distance traveled.

500|$|Two or more {{redundant}} <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{were used}} to reliably detect final altitude. When the altimeters sensed the correct height, the firing switch closed, igniting the three BuOrd Mk15, Mod 1 Navy gun primers in the breech plug, which set off the charge consisting of four silk powder bags each containing two pounds of WM slotted-tube cordite. This launched the uranium projectile towards {{the opposite end of}} the gun barrel at an eventual muzzle velocity of [...] Approximately 10 milliseconds later the chain reaction occurred, lasting less than 1 microsecond. The <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> used were modified U.S. Army Air Corps APS-13 tail warning radars, nicknamed [...] "Archie", normally used to warn a fighter pilot of another plane approaching from behind.|$|R
25|$|Based on the MQM-74 Chukar target drone, the XBQM-108A was {{modified}} with a revised, delta wing with canard control surfaces. The XBQM-108A was {{fitted with a}} thrust vectoring system based {{on the use of}} vanes that deflected the engine's exhaust; the aircraft retained the Chukar's recovery parachute and radio guidance system, {{with the addition of a}} <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> and midcourse guidance unit based on that of the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile.|$|E
25|$|Expert {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, {{was referring to the}} <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative {{to the level of the}} runway). Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.|$|E
25|$|Approaching , the {{navigator}} {{began calling}} out the radar altimeter's reading. This is not standard practice for a non-precision approach, as the <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> {{does not take}} into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the pressure altimeter, which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.|$|E
40|$|Satellite <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{can make}} useful {{contributions}} {{to the study of}} sea ice both by enhancing observations from other instruments and by providing a unique probe of ocean-ice interaction in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ).

50|$|A {{number of}} {{satellites}} (See links) use exotic dual-band <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> to measure height from a spacecraft. That measurement, coupled with orbital elements (possibly from GPS), enables {{determination of the}} topography.

40|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{are one of}} {{the main}} tools for {{measuring}} elevation changes across the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets and larger ice caps. A ground-based radar was deployed in autumn 2004 and spring 2006 in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This radar is a high bandwidth system operating in the Ku band, the same frequency as several satellite altimeters. Measurements were made over an elevation range of 1795 to 2350 m, along with snow pit and shallow core studies. These measurements demonstrate the spatial and temporal variations in the backscatter. Relative strengths of surface and volume reflections change dramatically between spring and autumn and there is also high spatial variability across the percolation zone. The extent of percolation will affect elevation estimates made by <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters...</b>|$|R
25|$|Satellite <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> {{measurements}} {{show that}} between 1992 and 2001 the Larsen Ice Shelf lowered {{by up to}} 0.27 ± 0.11 meters per year. In 2004, a report concluded that although the remaining Larsen C region appeared to be relatively stable, continued warming could lead to its breakup within the following decade. A large iceberg broke away in July 2017 but, although noteworthy, is most likely part of a natural calving process that balances inflow of ice from glaciers into the ice sheet.|$|E
25|$|On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 {{registered}} as TC-JGE carrying 128 passengers and {{a crew of}} 7, crashed during final approach to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands. It was determined that a faulty <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> caused the aircraft to throttle the engines back to idle and that the crew subsequently failed to react properly which resulted in an unrecoverable stall and the subsequent crash. Of the 135 people on board, nine people, including the three pilots, were killed. Eighty-six more people were transported to local hospitals.|$|E
25|$|The {{air traffic}} {{controller}} had instructed a Boeing 707 to take off and help guide the 757 back in to land, but before the 707 could take off, the 757's left wingtip struck the water, approximately 25 minutes after the emergency declaration, revealing to the crew the true altitude of the airliner; the pilots struggled with the controls and managed to get airborne again for 17 seconds, but the aircraft crashed inverted into the water. All 70 passengers and crew died. The official accident report concluded that the flight crew, distracted by the conflicting warnings, did not heed the <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> reading after descending through 2,500 feet.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to integrate the accurately measured sea surface topography, as resolved by both TOPEX/POSEIDON <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters,</b> into the above-mentioned quantitative studies of the short- and long-term variations in the mesoscale ocean dynamics of the Nordic Seas south of 66 deg N. This implies: (1) comparison and validation of the capability to resolve the general basin-scale circulation and the mesoscale variability by, respectively, <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> and numerical ocean circulation models; (2) calibration and validation of the altimeter-derived sea surface topography against in situ measurements from research vessels and moorings, particularly under extreme wind and wave conditions; and (3) improved monitoring {{and understanding of the}} flux variations between the North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas, both on the short and seasonal time scales...|$|R
40|$|Satellite <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> have an {{established}} and increasingly {{vital role in}} monitoring the Earth’s surface inland water resources. This paper analyzes two years of EnviSat burst echoes (which have 3. 9 -m nominal along-track separation) over rivers, lakes, and ephemeral water globally to assess the increase in monitoring potential afforded by the higher pulse repetition frequency (PRF) {{of the next generation}} of synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> and investigate spatial burst correlation. Burst echoes at 1800 Hz are successfully retracked with no waveform averaging. The conclusion is that the higher PRF allows detection and measurement of water bodies on a far finer spatial scale because water is a very bright reflector at Ku-band and land in general is relatively poor, with pools of water a few tens of meters across being successfully identified...|$|R

25|$|Various {{avionics}} {{were installed}} on the Canberra, many of these had their origins within the Second World War. Such systems include Gee-H navigation, Rebecca beacon-interrogation distance-measuring equipment, very high frequency (VHF) radio, radio compass, <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter,</b> {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF), and Orange Putter radar warning receiver. Perhaps the most crucial of the mission systems was the HS2 automatic radar bombsight, which was mounted in the nose; delays {{in the development of the}} HS2 model intended for the Canberra led to early models being fitted with a T.2 optical sight for visual bombing in its place, which was considerably inferior to the radar-guided counterpart when attacking ground targets while flying at high altitudes.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the <b>radar</b> <b>altimeter</b> and television in the early 1940s made remotely guided bomb- or torpedo-carrying aircraft a practical proposition. In January 1942, the Naval Aircraft Factory was instructed to initiate the {{development of}} such an aircraft, with a go-ahead for prototype construction being given in February. A production contract for 100 aircraft was issued in March, with John S. Kean being assigned as TDN-1 project manager, with the aircraft being designed {{to be capable of}} using either television or radar guidance. Constructed mainly from wood, the TDN-1 had a fixed tricycle landing gear, and could be fitted with a conventional cockpit in place of its guidance equipment for test flights.|$|E
50|$|Satellites such as Seasat and TOPEX/Poseidon use {{advanced}} dual-band <b>radar</b> <b>altimeters</b> {{to measure}} height from a spacecraft.

50|$|These {{three types}} of radar are {{currently}} used on several satellites. Scatterometers are of high value for operational meteorology, allowing reconstruction of wind fields on a global scale.
