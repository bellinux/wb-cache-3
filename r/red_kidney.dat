25|$|In Guyana, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago, {{it is one}} of {{the most}} popular type of beans cooked with rice, the main one being <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> beans, also {{referred}} to as red beans. It is also cooked as a snack or appetizer on its own. On New Year's Eve (referred to as Old Year's Night in Guyana and Suriname), families cook a traditional dish called cook-up rice. The dish comprises rice, black-eyed peas, and other peas and a variety of meats cooked in coconut milk and seasonings. According to tradition, cook-up rice should be the first thing consumed in the New Year for good luck. Cook-up rice is also made as an everyday dish.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish {{are quite}} popular in Europe. For example, in {{northeast}} Italy, {{they are used}} in risotto al nero di seppia (risotto with cuttlefish ink), also found in Croatia and Montenegro as crni rižot (black risotto). Spanish cuisine, especially that of the western coastal regions, uses cuttlefish and squid ink {{in a variety of}} tapas and dishes such as Arròs negre. Breaded and deep-fried cuttlefish is a popular dish in Andalusia. In Portugal, cuttlefish is present in many popular dishes. Chocos com tinta (cuttlefish in black ink), for example, is grilled cuttlefish in a sauce of its own ink. Cuttlefish is also popular in the region of Setúbal, where it is served as deep-fried strips or in a variant of feijoada, with <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> beans. Black pasta is often made using cuttlefish ink.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Metabolic haemodynamic, and organ {{blood flow}} {{measurements}} {{were made in}} tabled, partially anaesthetized albacore Thunnus alalun-ga. Heart rates were 1 1 5 k 9 beatslmin: blood pressure 98 / 75 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) : car-diac output 36. 1 f 5 (ml/min/kg) : oxygen con-sumption 3. 4 k 0. 7 (ml Oz/min/kg) and cardiac contractility (dP/dt) 6342 f 822 mm Hg/s. Organ blood flows were measured with radiolabelled microspheres. The <b>red</b> muscle, <b>kidney,</b> and spleen received the highest flows and the white-muscle the least. There was a flow gradient in the white-muscle with the inner portion near the red-muscle receiving the highest flows. Arterial and venous blood gas measurements showed a reverse tem-perature effect on arterial POz and a p,, of 15. 9 Torr corrected to 37 " C. Red-muscle temperature was 7 " C higher than ambient water temperature. These measurements record the albacore's mark-edly high cardiovascular capability...|$|R
40|$|To assess its usefulness, {{the peak}} version of color {{intensity}} projections (CIPs) {{was used to}} display {{a summary of the}} grayscale images composing a renogram as a single color image. Method For each pixel in a renogram, the time point with the maximum intensity was used to control the hue of the color of the corresponding pixel in the CIPs image. The hue ranged over red-yellow-green-light blue-blue with red representing the earliest time. Results For subjects with normal appearing kidneys, the injection site shows up in <b>red,</b> the <b>kidneys</b> in a red-yellow and the bladder in a green-blue. A late fill kidney typically appeared greener or bluer than a normal kidney indicating it reached its peak intensity at a later time point than normal. Conclusions Having the time and intensity information summarized in a single image promises to speed up the initial impression of patients by less experienced interpreters and should also provide a valuable training tool.

30|$|Volumes of {{interest}} (VOI) were manually drawn slice by slice on the axial {{plane of the}} CT part of every PET/CT study using PMOD (PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland) for the following body regions: brain, thyroid, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, <b>kidneys,</b> <b>red</b> marrow, pancreas, small intestine, colon and whole body. Choroid plexuses and urinary bladder were visually segmented on the emission PET data by two operators in consensus (SG and FC). CT-based segmentation of choroid plexuses would have been challenging and, if applied to bladder, it would have not taken into account possible changes of volume due to bladder filling during the PET/CT acquisition time.|$|R

30|$|Following {{the last}} SPECT/CT acquisition, at 192  h after cycle 2, all SPECT/CT data were loaded on the “Preparation for {{dosimetry}} toolkit” application. Transversal slices were reconstructed using the OSEM algorithm with the reconstruction settings {{defined in the}} optimization study associated with correction of the patient’s movements. Each SPECT acquisition was registered with the corresponding CT acquisition. A rigid registration between CT scans was performed. The reconstruction results were loaded on the “Dosimetry toolkit” application. The OARs (<b>red</b> marrow, <b>kidneys,</b> liver, and spleen) were segmented using the CT and SPECT images collected at 4  h post-injection. They were then replicated for the 24  h, 72  h, and 192  h images. The red marrow absorbed dose was determined by delineating the trabecular section on the L 2 –L 4 lumbar vertebrae, considering that this section represents 6.7 % of the total red marrow [22]. For kidneys, the delineation encompassed the cortex and the medulla regions of {{the left and right}} kidney, as described by Sundlöv et al. [11]. For the kidney volume, the partial volume effect correction was considered negligible. For the trabecular section on the L 2 –L 4 lumbar vertebrae, the obtained recovery coefficient was applied.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 251 {{bacteria}} were isolated using a nitrogen-free, malate-containing, semi-solid media (JNFb) from the surface-sterilized roots of eight species of legumes: Arachis hypogea, Astragalus sinicus, Crotalaria juncea, Glycine max, Medicago saliva, Phaseolus vulgaris, Pisum sativum, Sesbania cannabina, Trifolium incarnatum, Trifolium pratense, and Trifolium repens. Thirty-one isolated bacteria showed an acetylene reduction activity (ARA) of 2. 6 to 450 nmol h^ culture^ when {{grown in the}} JNFb media. No diazotroph was isolated from Crotalaria juncea, Sesbania cannabina, and Trifolium incarnatum. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence and physiological characteristics of the 31 isolates showed that these isolates were Agrobacterium radiobacter, A. tumefaciens, Azospirillum lipoferum, Bradyrhizobium elkanii, Burkholderia cepacia, Frateuria aurantia, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, Rhizobium gallicum, R. sp., Starkeya novella, and Xantobacter flavus. The isolates were classified into three groups by the pattern of ARA expression. Three representative strains of the A. lipoferum, X. flavus, and K. oxytoca groups were examined for {{the effect on the}} growth and the nitrogen content of <b>red</b> clover, <b>kidney</b> bean, and soybean.

25|$|Glycogen {{functions}} {{as one of}} two forms of long-term energy reserves, with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in {{the cells of the}} liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up from 5–6% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 100–120grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, Glycogen is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 400grams of glycogen. The amount of glycogen stored in the body—particularly within the muscles and liver—mostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the <b>kidneys,</b> <b>red</b> blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo.|$|R

30|$|Integrin-targeting radiopharmaceuticals have {{potential}} broad applications, spanning from cancer theranostics to cardiovascular diseases. We have previously reported preclinical dosimetry results of 68 Ga-NODAGA-RGDyK in mice. This study presents {{the first human}} dosimetry of 68 Ga-NODAGA-RGDyK in the five consecutive patients included in a clinical imaging protocol of carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Five male patients underwent whole-body time-of-flight (TOF) PET/CT scans 10, 60 and 120  min after tracer injection (200  MBq). Quantification of 68 Ga activity concentration was first validated by a phantom study. To be used as input in OLINDA/EXM, time-activity curves were derived from manually drawn regions of interest over the following organs: brain, thyroid, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, <b>kidneys,</b> <b>red</b> marrow, pancreas, small intestine, colon, urinary bladder and whole body. A separate dosimetric analysis was performed for the choroid plexuses. Female dosimetry was extrapolated from male data.

40|$|Selenium {{may play}} a {{beneficial}} role in multi-factorial illnesses with genetic and environmental linkages via epigenetic regulation in part via glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. A meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the effects of dietary selenium supplementation on the activity of overall GPx activity in different tissues and animal species and to compare the effectiveness of different forms of dietary selenium. GPx activity response was affected by both the dose and form of selenium (p < 0. 001). There were differences between tissues {{on the effects of}} selenium supplementation on GPx activity (p < 0. 001); however, there was no evidence in the data of differences between animal species (p = 0. 95). The interactions between dose and tissue, animal species and form were significant (p < 0. 001).

5000|$|There {{are three}} major types of organic beans: dry beans, snap beans (also known as green beans), and soybeans. The mature seeds of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{serve as a}} protein source {{in a variety of}} foods worldwide. Dry beans and snap beans are the same species, {{although}} dry beans are distinguished from snap beans (green beans) which are consumed as immature pods. Dry and snap beans also differ from soybeans (Glycine max), in which the seeds are consumed in a variety of processed forms such as tofu, soybean meal, oil, and fermented forms such as miso. Dry beans are divided into classes with a range of seed sizes, colors, and shapes. Examples include black beans, pintos, navy beans, small <b>red</b> beans, and <b>kidney</b> beans. Soybeans are usually divided into two groups, feed-grade and food-grade, with the food-grade including soybeans for processing, [...] "tofu-beans", and edamame, the latter of which is eaten as immature beans.|$|R
