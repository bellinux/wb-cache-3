2500|$|Fluoroscopy (...) is an imaging {{technique}} that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope (...) allows a physician to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched. This is useful for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, since the 1950s most fluoroscopes have included X-ray image intensifiers and cameras as well, to improve the image's visibility and make it available on a <b>remote</b> <b>display</b> screen. For many decades fluoroscopy tended to produce live pictures that were not recorded, but since the 1960s, as technology improved, recording and playback became the norm.|$|E

40|$|The firing room at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is {{responsible}} for all NASA human spaceflight launch operations, therefore {{it is vital that}} all displays within the firing room be properly tested, up-to-date, and user-friendly during a launch. The Ground Main Propulsion System (GMPS) requires a number of <b>remote</b> <b>displays</b> for Vehicle Integration and Launch (VIL) Operations at KSC. My project is to develop <b>remote</b> <b>displays</b> for the GMPS using the Display Services and Framework (DSF) editor. These <b>remote</b> <b>displays</b> will be based on model images provided by GMPS through PowerPoint. Using the DSF editor, the PowerPoint images can be recreated with active buttons associated with the correct Compact Unique Identifiers (CUIs). These displays will be documented in the Software Requirements and Design Specifications (SRDS) at the 90 % GMPS Design Review. In the future, these <b>remote</b> <b>displays</b> will be available for other developers to improve, edit, or add on to so that the display may be incorporated into the firing room to be used for launches...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDirect {{touch input}} is {{employed}} on many devices, {{but it is}} inherently restricted to displays that are reachable by the user. Gaze input as a mediator can extend touch to <b>remote</b> <b>displays</b> - using gaze for remote selection, and touch for local manipulation - but at what cost and benefit? In this paper, we investigate the potential trade-off with four experiments that empirically compare remote Gaze+touch to standard touch. Our experiments investigate dragging, rotation, and scaling tasks. Results indicate that Gaze+touch is, compared to touch, (1) equally fast and more accurate for rotation and scaling, (2) slower and less accurate for dragging, and (3) enables selection of smaller targets. Our participants confirm this trend, and are positive about the relaxed finger placement of Gaze+touch. Our experiments provide detailed performance characteristics to consider {{for the design of}} Gaze+touch interaction of <b>remote</b> <b>displays.</b> We further discuss insights into strengths and drawbacks in contrast to direct touch...|$|R
