25|$|As {{the deal}} {{worked its way}} through state and federal {{regulatory}} approval, Dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt. The company obtained $1.3 billion in term loan B facilities and $500 million in <b>revolving</b> <b>credit.</b> The company used this income to retire an $800 million, seven-year line of credit and a $500 million, two-year line of credit. Dynegy agreed that the <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> line would be paid off and terminate within five years. Two syndicated loans made up the $1.3 billion loan package. The $800 million loan and the $500 million loan were both due in 2020. This left Dynegy with $1.28 billion in lines of credit and $500 million in outstanding bonds.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Bank of America had {{introduced}} BankAmeriCard (today's Visa), the first credit card on a <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> model, in which cardholders {{did not have}} to pay the full balance each month but merely a minimum payment if they so chose. It, like other banks in those days, tried to promote use of them by mailing cards, unsolicited, to multiple, sometimes randomly chosen, customers in a particular area.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{product of}} the company is {{consumer}} lending. As an issuer of credit cards the bank also offers <b>revolving</b> <b>credits.</b> Sales of loans often take place in direct cooperations with trade partners, which utilize loans in their marketing efforts.|$|R
5000|$|For {{leveraged}} loans, considered {{non-investment grade}} risk, U.S. and European banks typically provide the <b>revolving</b> <b>credits,</b> letters of credit (L/Cs), and—although {{they are becoming}} increasingly less common—fully amortizing term loans known as [...] "Term Loan A" [...] under a syndicated loan agreement while institutions provide the partially amortizing term loans known a [...] "Term Loan B".|$|R
50|$|An amortizing {{term loan}} (A-term loan or TLA) {{is a term}} loan with a {{progressive}} repayment schedule that typically runs six years or less. These loans are normally syndicated to banks along with <b>revolving</b> <b>credits</b> {{as part of a}} larger syndication. In the U.S., A-term loans have become increasingly rare over the years as issuers bypassed the bank market and tapped institutional investors for all or most of their funded loans.|$|R
25|$|The {{fractured}} {{nature of}} the U.S. banking system under the Glass–Steagall Act meant that credit cards became an effective way {{for those who were}} traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.|$|E
25|$|The {{credit card}} may simply {{serve as a}} form of <b>revolving</b> <b>credit,</b> or it may become a {{complicated}} financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card or any other credit instrument, or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.|$|E
25|$|Until 1958, no one {{had been}} able to {{successfully}} establish a <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California, which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card. It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand Visa. In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card, launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{the banking}} segment is almost {{exclusively}} {{made up of}} commercial banks, while in the U.S. {{it is much more}} diverse and can involve commercial and investments banks, business development corporations or finance companies, and institutional investors such as asset managers, insurance companies and loan mutual funds and loan ETFs. As in Europe, commercial banks in the U.S. provide the vast majority of investment-grade loans. These are typically large <b>revolving</b> <b>credits</b> that back commercial paper or are used for general corporate purposes or, in some cases, acquisitions.|$|R

Feige, a self-professed [...] "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s. To raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525 million <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> facility with Merrill Lynch. Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them together in a crossover film. Arad, who doubted the strategy yet insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing, resigned the following year.|$|E
2500|$|A master {{trust is}} a type of SPV {{particularly}} suited to handle <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> card balances, and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times. In a typical master trust transaction, an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables.

[...] After this transaction, typically the originator would continue to service the receivables, in this case the credit cards.|$|E

50|$|Under F-IRB, EAD is {{calculated}} taking {{account of the}} underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This value does not take account of guarantees, collateral or security (i.e. ignores Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques {{with the exception of}} on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included in Exposure At Default). For on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the nominal amount of exposure. On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions. For off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and <b>revolving</b> <b>credits,</b> and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and equity derivative contracts.|$|R

British MP Stella Creasy has also proposed legislation for interest rate caps. A Policis report on proposed interest rate capping said it would cause an exit from the market and those {{with access to the}} credit mainstream would be diverted to products such as overdrafts and <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> that could be higher cost than high APR products and those without access to credit would be diverted to the black credit market. The Times said capping will further limit the availability of credit to people from regulated entities.|$|E

Van der Walt replied that whether the money paid to Zuma was a loan or a donation, he reaped the benefits: [...] "My review indicated that Zuma had no access to major funds to repay his debts. The repayments must have taken place outside the period of review." [...] Van Zyl produced a written <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> agreement between Shaik and Zuma of which, he said, Parliament was informed. The State said it would dispute its authenticity. Van Zyl also accused Van der Walt of not taking into account that Zuma had repaid some money to Shaik.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the median}} generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.

[...] The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. [...] Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use. [...] For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.|$|E
40|$|The latest {{revision}} of the Internal Ratings Based approach of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s New Capital Accord Proposal for retail portfolios contains a significant innovation relative to previous versions: the recognition that, for <b>revolving</b> <b>credits,</b> future margin income {{will be available to}} cover losses before a bank’s capital is threatened. We assemble a mini-portfolio of revolving exposures and we compare the capital charges generated by the latest Basel’s formula with the capital charges generated by two possible earnings-at-risk internal capital allocation models. We find that in general, Basel’s capital ratios are closer to those generated by our models for the groups with lower credit risk. We attribute the discrepancies to the different ways Basel and our models account for future margin income, to Basel assumptions about asset correlations, and to one our models taking macroeconomic conditions explicitly into account...|$|R
40|$|U. S. consumers' {{demand for}} cash is {{estimated}} with new panel micro data for 2008 - 2010 using econometric methodology similar to Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (2000); Attanasio, Guiso, and Jappelli (2002); and Lippi and Secchi (2009). We extend the Baumol-Tobin model {{to allow for}} credit card payments and revolving debt, as in Sastry (1970). With interest rates near zero, cash demand by consumers using credit cards for convenience (without revolving debt) has the same small, negative, interest elasticity as estimated in earlier periods and with broader money measures. However, cash demand by consumers using credit cards to borrow (with revolving debt) is interest inelastic. These findings may have aggregate implications for the welfare cost of inflation because then nontrivial share of consumers who <b>revolve</b> <b>credit</b> card debt {{are less likely to}} switch from cash to credit. In the 21 st century, consumers get cash from bank and nonbank sources with heterogeneous transactions costs, so withdrawal location is essential to identify cash demand properly...|$|R

He agreed that there was a financial relationship between Zuma and him, but {{that it was not a}} corrupt one as the payments he made to Zuma were loans made in friendship. He did not ask for any interest in the loans because it [...] "offended his religious convictions". The loans had been made on a <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> agreement. He also denied allegations of fraud, saying money was mistakenly written off in his company's books, but that this was later fixed. To allegations that he was involved in soliciting a bribe for Zuma, he replied that he knew nothing.|$|E

40|$|By 1998, {{about two-thirds}} of U. S. {{households}} held a bank-type credit card. Despite high interest rates, most <b>revolve</b> <b>credit</b> card debt. The majority of debt revolvers have substantial liquid assets, apparently violating arbitrage. We propose an "accountant-shopper" model that could provide an explanation for this puzzle. In our model, the "accountant self" (or spouse) of the household can control the expenditures of the "shopper self" (or spouse) by limiting the purchases the shopper can make before encountering the credit limit. Since the card balance is used for control purposes, the accountant self may also find it optimal to save in lower-return riskless assets. Using attitudinal responses and demographic data from the pooled 1995 and 1998 Surveys of Consumer Finances, we estimate a bivariate probit model of the decisions to have a credit card and to revolve debt on it, allowing for sample selection. The pattern of estimated coefficients is consistent with debt revolvers being motivated primarily by self-control considerations rather than intertemporal consumption smoothing. credit cards, consumer debt, portfolio puzzles, household portfolios...|$|R
