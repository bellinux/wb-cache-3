5000|$|This {{process of}} {{reconciliation}} {{leads to a}} [...] "both/and" [...] view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work Either/Or {{is a response to}} this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] (Judge Vilhelm) in Either/Or and Stages on Life's Way. [...] Marry, and you will <b>regret</b> <b>it.</b> Do not marry, and you will also <b>regret</b> <b>it.</b> Marry or do not marry, you will <b>regret</b> <b>it</b> either way.

Søren Kierkegaard [...] My dear reader, {{if you do not have}} the time and opportunity to take a dozen years of your life to travel around the world to see everything a world traveler is acquainted with, if you do not have the capability and qualifications from years of practice in a foreign language to penetrate to the differences in national characteristics as these become apparent to the research scholar, if you are not bent upon discovering a new astronomical system that will displace both the Copernican and the Ptolemaic-then marry; and if you have time for the first, the capability for the second, the idea for the last, then marry also. Even if you did not manage to see the whole globe or to speak in many tongues or to know all about the heavens, you will not <b>regret</b> <b>it,</b> for marriage is and remains the most important voyage of discovery a human being undertakes; compared with a married man’s knowledge of life, any other knowledge of it is superficial, for he and he alone has properly immersed himself in life.
