40|$|The usual {{tool for}} {{modeling}} bond <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> is a discrete, timehomogeneuous Markov chain. Such model assumes that all bonds are homogeneous {{with respect to}} their movement behavior among rating categories and that the movement behavior does not change over time. However, among recognized sources of heterogeneity in <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> is age of a bond (time elapsed since issuance). It has been observed that young bonds have a lower propensity to change ratings, and thus to default, than more seasoned bonds. The aimof this paper is to introduce a continuous, time-nonhomogeneuous model for bond <b>ratings</b> <b>migration,</b> which also incorporates a simple form of population heterogeneity. The specific form of heterogeneity postulated by the proposed model appears to be suitable for modeling the effect of age of a bond on its propensity to change ratings. This model, called a mover-stayer model, is an extension of a time-nonhomogeneuous Markov chain. This paper derives the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters of a continuous time mover-stayer model based on a sample of independent continuously monitored histories of the process, and develops the likelihood ratio test for discriminating between the Markov chain and the mover-stayer model. The methods are illustrated using a sample of rating histories of young corporate issuers. For this sample, the likelihood ratio test rejects a Markov chain in favor of a mover-stayer model. For young bonds with lowest rating the default probabilities predicted by the mover-stayer model are substantially lower than those predicted by the Markov chain. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{issues in}} evaluating banks ’ internal ratings of borrowers, drawing upon {{six years of}} internal ratings data from JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale exposures to perform a <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> analysis. While ratings agencies have previously conducted these studies based upon publicly rated debt, {{this is the first}} published study based on a bank’s internal ratings. <b>Ratings</b> <b>migration</b> analysis entails the actuarial estimation of transition probabilities for obligor credit risk ratings, with emphasis on estimation of empirical default probabilities. Measurement of changes in borrower credit quality over time is important as obligor risk ratings are a key component of a bank’s credit capital methodology. These analyses permit banks to more accurately assess and price credit risk, as well as improve their assessment of loss reserves and portfolio capital requirements. Key objectives of an internal <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> study include: 92 The RMA Journal April 2004 • Evaluating how well a bank differentiates risk on an ordinal basis. • Examining the consistency of obligor ratings across different lines of business (LOBs) or customer types, to suggest guidance in the risk-rating process. • Evaluating {{the extent to which a}} bank’s rating philosophy is influenced by current conditions or longer-term, through-the-cycle considerations. • Exploring how to satisfy Basel II regulatory requirements for validating the use of probabil-ities of default (PDs) associated with a bank’s ratings. Measurement of rating accuracy includes the notions of ordinal as well as cardinal accuracy. Ordinal accuracy tests the effectiveness of the ratings system in distinguishing credit risk on a relative basis. One can gauge ordinal accuracy by comparing agency ratings or default probability estimates (e. g., KMV EDFs TM) for a common universe of obligors. Cardinal accuracy is related to the validation of risk ratings by comparing realized default rates to assumed default rates. Analysis of a bank’s rating an...|$|E

40|$|The risk neutral credit {{migration}} process captures quantitative information which {{is relevant to}} the pricing theory and risk management of credit derivatives. In this article, we derive implied migration rates {{by means of a}} recently introduced credit barrier model which is calibrated on the basis of aggregate information such as credit migration rates and credit spread curves. The model is characterized by an underlying stochastic process that represents credit quality and default events are associated to barrier crossings. The stochastic process has state dependent volatility and jumps which are estimated by using empirical migration and default rates. A risk-neutralizing drift and forward liquidity spreads are estimated to consistently match the average spread curves corresponding to all the various <b>ratings.</b> The implied <b>migration</b> rates obtained with our credit barrier model are then compared with those obtained via the Jarrow-Lando-Turnbull model by the Kijima-Komoribayashi model in a detailed example...|$|R

40|$|Some past {{studies of}} credit risk <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> have found trend {{reversals}} and {{evidence that the}} data-generating process is nonstationary. Using a sample of Farm Credit System mortgages, we find no compelling statistical evidence of either phenomenon. We do find evidence that our sample of loans may be characterized by two types of borrowers – namely, movers and stayers. This type of borrower heterogeneity is unobserved because movers who do not migrate are indistinguishable from stayers who never migrate. We report {{on the development of}} a flexible nonparametric model for estimating transition probabilities. The model {{can also be used to}} estimate nonstationary transition probabilities and an example is provided. Credit risk, Markov chain, Maximum entropy, Migration, Risk ratings...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} {{the context of the}} {{emergence}} of Places Rated Almanacs (PRA), their success as a source of place-based knowledge, and their limitations as predictors of patterns of migration. The paper addresses whether, as an entrepreneurial product created in the spaces arising from the roll back of the nation state and the foregrounding of the local, competitive marketplace, PRAs continue to have relevance. It examines the utility of this knowledge resource in a new era where specific talent attraction and retention is central to neoliberal strategies for economic development. The paper offers an analysis of the correlations between PRA <b>ratings</b> and recent <b>migration</b> patterns is undertaken to explore their explanatory power. The contemporary significance of PRA is examined both in terms of the almanac's resonance with actual patterns of migration in the USA, and its resonance with contemporary debates over talent flows. It is concluded that place ratings offer only a partial resonance with actual patterns of mobility. Despite the changing political economic context with new neoliberal agendas in place competition, there is potentially continuing utility of such PRAs. The paper argues that greater engagement with contemporary debates over talent attraction, place attachment and social learning would enhance the knowledge basis of such guides. Within a knowledge economy, the attraction and retention of key talent has become vital. Place rating guides can be a useful resource as a tool within this neoliberal strategy for economic growth. This paper indicates how the established guides such as the PRA need to be updated to retain their utility...|$|R

FeatherstoneInstitutions of the Farm Credit System (FCS) {{focus on}} risk-based lending in {{accordance}} with regulatory direction. The rating of risk also assists retail staff in loan approval, risk-based pricing, and allowance decisions. FCS institutions have developed models to analyze financial and related customer information in determining qualitative and quantitative risk measures. The objective of this thesis is to examine empirical account data from 2006 - 2012 to review the probability of default (PD) rating methodology within the overall risk rating system implemented by a Farm Credit System association. This analysis provides insight into {{the effectiveness of this}} methodology in predicting the migration of accounts across the association’s currently-established PD <b>ratings</b> where negative <b>migration</b> may be an apparent precursor to actual loan default. The analysis indicates that average PD ratings hold relatively consistent over the years, though the distribution of the majority of PD ratings shifted to higher quality by two rating categories over the time period. Various regressions run in the analysis indicate that the debt to asset ratio is most consistently statistically significant in estimating future PD ratings. The current ratio appears to be superior to working capital to gross profit as a liquidity measure in predicting PD rating migration. Funded debt to EBITDA is more effective in predicting PD rating movement as a measure of earnings to debt than gross profit to total liabilities, although the change of these ratios over time appear to be weaker indicators of the change in PD rating potentially due to the variable nature of annual earnings of production agriculture operations due to commodity price volatility. The debt coverage ratio is important as it relates to future PD migration, though the same variability in commodity price volatility suggests the need implement multi-year averaging for calculation of earnings-based ratios. These ratios were important in predicting the PD rating of observations one year into the future for production agriculture operations. To further test the predictive ability of the PD ratings, similar regression analyses were completed comparing current year rating and ratios to future PD ratings beyond one year, specifically for three and five years. Results from these regression models indicate that current year PD rating and ratios are less effective in predicting future PD ratings beyond one year. Furthermore, because of the variation in regression results between the analyses completed for one, three and five years into the future, it is important to regularly capture ratio and rating information, at least annually...|$|R
40|$|The Basel II Accord {{requires}} {{banks to}} establish rigorous statistical {{procedures for the}} estimation and validation of default and ratings transition probabilities.

The model captures patterns of obligor heterogeneity and <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> dependence through unobserved sys-tematic macroeconomic shocks. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical framework for model calibration from historical rating transition data, and show how the predic-tive performance of the model can be assessed, even with sparse event data.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} two Markov chain time approaches, time-homogeneous and nonhomogeneous models, {{for analyzing}} farm credit risk migration as {{alternatives to the}} traditional discrete-time (cohort) method. The Markov chain models are found to produce more accurate, reliable transition probability rates using the 3 x 1 migration measurement method used by farm lenders. Compared to corporate bond <b>ratings</b> <b>migration</b> results, this study obtained larger mean differences in singular value decomposition between the cohort matrix {{and each of the}} Markov chain matrices. This finding suggests that the omission of transient, indirect migration activities under the cohort method is more costly when applied to farm credit analysis. This discrepancy could lead to understated transition probability estimates which, in turn, could produce misleading indicators of farm loan portfolio quality.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} split ratings and <b>ratings</b> <b>migration.</b> We find that bonds with split ratings {{are more likely to}} have future rating changes. A one-notch (more-than-one-notch) split rating increases the probability of rating change within one year of initial issuance by about 3 % (6 %). Furthermore, we find that about 30 % of split rated bonds have their two ratings converge after four years of initial issuance. The rating convergence tapers off after three years, and the rating agency with a higher (lower) initial rating generally maintains a higher (lower) rating in subsequent years if the two ratings do not converge. We also show that rating transition estimation can be improved by taking into consideration split ratings. We find that one-year rating transition matrices are significantly different between non-letter-split rated bonds and letter-split rated bonds, and we show that the difference has an economically significant impact on the pricing of credit spread options and VaR-based risk management models. Overall, our results suggest that split ratings contain important information about subsequent rating changes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{turmoil in}} the capital markets in 1997 and 1998 has {{highlighted}} the need for systematic stress testing of banks' portfolios, including both their trading and lending books. We propose that underlying macroeconomic volatility is {{a key part of}} a useful conceptual framework for stress testing credit portfolios, and that credit migration matrices provide the specific linkages between underlying macroeconomic conditions and asset quality. Credit migration matrices, which characterize the expected changes in credit quality of obligors, are cardinal inputs to many applications, including portfolio risk assessment, modeling the term structure of credit risk premia, and pricing of credit derivatives. They are also an integral part of many of the credit portfolio models used by financial institutions. By separating the economy into two states or regimes, expansion and contraction, and conditioning the migration matrix on these states, we show that the loss distribution of credit portfolios can differ greatly, as can the concomitant level of economic capital to be assigned.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} {{modeling}} credit risk of non-financial businesses entities by assessing the rating migration probabilities and predicting the probability of default over one year horizon on the basis of corporate financial accounts. Our research provides a number of new important insights. <b>Ratings</b> <b>migration</b> matrices are symmetrical in every observed period, which implies that default state is not final terminal state. We find a high degree of rating stability, with the exception of some volatility generated by firms {{in the middle of the}} ratings scale. In the period of lower economic growth probabilities of transition between different risks categories are lower than in the period of higher economic growth. Probabilities of default are relatively stable across enterprises operating in different economic activities. After considering a wide range of potential predictors of default, multivariate logistic regression results reveal that the most important are the ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets and the ratio of EBIT to total liabilities, both negatively related to the probability of default. In addition, higher liquidity, profitability and sales as well as construction and real estate sector affiliation all decrease the companies’ probability of default in the following year. The model correctly classifies relatively reasonable percentage of companies in the sample (74 % of all the companies, 71 % of defaulted and 75 % of non-defaulted companies) when the threshold is set in such a way to maximize the sum of correctly predicted proportions for both defaulted and nondefaulted companies. credit risk, corporate default, migration matrices, logit...|$|E
