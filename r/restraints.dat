40|$|ObjectiveThe {{effects of}} {{ventricular}} <b>restraint</b> level on left ventricular reverse remodeling are not known. We hypothesized that <b>restraint</b> level affects {{the degree of}} reverse remodeling and that <b>restraint</b> applied in an adjustable manner is superior to standard, nonadjustable <b>restraint.</b> MethodsThis study was performed in 2 parts using a model of chronic heart failure in the sheep. In part I, <b>restraint</b> was applied at control (0 mm Hg, n =  3), low (1. 5 mm Hg, n =  3), and high (3. 0 mm Hg, n =  3) levels with an adjustable and measurable ventricular <b>restraint</b> (AMVR) device. <b>Restraint</b> level was not altered throughout the 2 -month treatment period. Serial <b>restraint</b> level measurements and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. In part II, <b>restraint</b> was applied with the AMVR device set at 3. 0 mm Hg (n =  6) and adjusted periodically to maintain that level. This was compared with <b>restraint</b> applied in a standard, nonadjustable manner using a mesh wrap (n =  6). All subjects were followed up for 2 months with serial magnetic resonance imaging. ResultsIn part I, there was greater and earlier reverse remodeling in the high <b>restraint</b> group. In both groups, the rate of reverse remodeling peaked and then declined as the measured <b>restraint</b> level decreased with progression of reverse remodeling. In part II, adjustable <b>restraint</b> resulted in greater reverse remodeling than standard <b>restraint.</b> Left ventricular end diastolic volume decreased by 12. 7 % (P = . 005) with adjustable <b>restraint</b> and by 5. 7 % (P = . 032) with standard <b>restraint.</b> Left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 18. 9 % (P = . 014) and 14. 4 % (P < . 001) with adjustable and standard <b>restraint,</b> respectively. ConclusionsRestraint level affects the rate and degree of reverse remodeling and is an important determinant of therapy efficacy. Adjustable <b>restraint</b> {{is more effective than}} nonadjustable <b>restraint</b> in promoting reverse remodeling...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIn {{standard}} ventricular <b>restraint</b> therapy, {{a single}} level of <b>restraint</b> {{is applied to}} the entire ventricular surface. We showed previously that at high <b>restraint</b> levels, cardiac tamponade develops because of the thin-walled right ventricle, even while the left ventricle remains unaffected. We now hypothesize that applying <b>restraint</b> exclusively to the left ventricle permits higher levels of <b>restraint,</b> resulting in increased benefit to the left ventricle. MethodsThe acute effect of <b>restraint</b> applied to the left ventricle alone was analyzed in healthy and cardiomyopathic sheep hearts. <b>Restraint</b> therapy was applied by fluid-filled epicardial balloons placed solely around the left ventricle. <b>Restraint</b> level was defined by the measured balloon luminal pressure at end diastole. At incrementally higher <b>restraint</b> levels (0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14 mm Hg), transmural myocardial left ventricular pressure (Ptm = Left ventricle pressure − Balloon pressure) and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption were measured in healthy sheep (n =  5) and in sheep with heart failure (n =  6). ResultsIncreasing <b>restraint</b> from 0 to 14 mm Hg decreased transmural myocardial pressure by 48. 8 % (P ≤. 02) and the left ventricle tension-time index by 39. 1 % (P ≤. 01), and the pressure–volume area decreased by 58. 4 % (P ≤. 01). Similarly, stroke work decreased by 57. 9 % (P ≤. 03). Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged. There was no difference in the trend for all indices between animals that were healthy and those with heart failure. ConclusionsWe showed previously that, with standard <b>restraint,</b> right ventricle tamponade develops at high <b>restraint</b> levels, limiting <b>restraint</b> therapy. We now show that <b>restraint</b> applied to the left ventricle alone permits increased <b>restraint</b> levels, without causing right ventricle or left ventricle tamponade, for greater therapeutic benefit. We conclude that partial left ventricle <b>restraint</b> may be more effective than standard <b>restraint...</b>|$|R

40|$|Author version made {{available}} {{in accordance with}} publisher copyright policy. <b>Restraint</b> of older persons in inpatient and residential care is used to control aggression, and prevent falls and other adverse outcomes. Initiatives to reduce these practices are being implemented worldwide. However, {{there has been little}} examination of <b>restraint</b> practice in psychiatric services for older persons. This paper reports a retrospective comparative analysis of <b>restraint</b> use in three acute and two extended care psychiatric inpatient wards in Australia. The analysis involved examination of <b>restraint</b> incidents and comparison of restrained and non-restrained patients. There was significant variation in <b>restraint</b> use between wards. On one acute ward, 12. 74 % of patients were restrained, although <b>restraint</b> use declined during the data collection period. Patients with dementia were restrained at higher rates than patients with other diagnoses, and restrained patients stayed in hospital for a longer duration. <b>Restraint</b> occurred early in admission, and few differences emerged between those restrained once or multiple times. Mechanical <b>restraint</b> was more prevalent than physical <b>restraint,</b> with <b>restraint</b> predominantly used to manage aggression and falls. Findings provide new data on <b>restraint</b> in older persons' psychiatric services. Greater conceptual understandings of behaviours associated with dementia and the unique needs of patients with these disorders may assist in reducing <b>restraint</b> use in these settings...|$|R

5|$|Specific {{treatment}} for some symptoms may be required. One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical <b>restraints</b> are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia. If physical <b>restraints</b> are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

40|$|Title: The {{association}} between the prevalence and attitude regarding physical <b>restraint</b> use in a Dutch acute hospital. Background: Factors that influence physical <b>restraint</b> use need to be identified to reduce this questionable practice. However, due to limitations of previous studies, it is unknown whether an association exists between the prevalence and attitude regarding <b>restraint</b> use. Aim and research questions: To explore the {{association between}} the prevalence of physical <b>restraint</b> use and attitude of physicians and nurses towards <b>restraint</b> use in a Dutch acute hospital. The research questions were: what is the prevalence of <b>restraint</b> use, what is the attitude of physicians and nurses towards <b>restraint</b> use, and is there an {{association between the}} prevalence and attitude regarding <b>restraint</b> use? Method: A cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted. Unannounced, one researcher observed patients on 17 units on <b>restraint</b> use to determine the prevalence. Then, physicians and nurses working in these units {{were asked to complete}} the Maastricht Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ) to determine their attitude towards <b>restraint</b> use. Subsequently, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the association between the prevalence rates and mean MAQ scores at the unit level. Units with a response lower than 40 % and/or a prevalence based on less than five patients were excluded from this analysis to increase the usability of the results. Results: A moderate to strong positive significant association (rs= 0 ∙ 608, p= 0 ∙ 027) was found, indicating that units with a positive attitude tended to use more <b>restraint</b> than units with a negative attitude. Physicians and nurses had a relatively neutral to slightly positive attitude regarding <b>restraint</b> use, but they considered the use of <b>restraint</b> as appropriate clinical practice. Physicians and nurses considered the mostly used <b>restraint</b> measure (bilateral bedrails) as moderately restrictive. Conclusion: Attitude may be an influencing factor of physical <b>restraint</b> use. Recommendations: Information programs for units with positive attitudes and high prevalence rates should be aimed at changing attitudes against <b>restraint</b> use {{in order to reduce the}} use of <b>restraint...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background—Ventricular <b>restraint</b> is a nontransplantation {{surgical}} treatment for heart failure. The effect of varying <b>restraint</b> level on left ventricular (LV) mechanics and remodeling is not known. We hypothesized that <b>restraint</b> level may affect therapy efficacy. Methods and Results—We studied the immediate effect of varying <b>restraint</b> levels in an ovine heart failure model. We then studied the long-term effect of <b>restraint</b> applied over a 2 -month period. <b>Restraint</b> level was quantified {{by use of}} fluid-filled epicardial balloons placed around the ventricles and measurement of balloon luminal pressure at end diastole. At 4 different <b>restraint</b> levels (0, 3, 5, and 8 mm Hg), transmural myocardial pressure (Ptm) and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption (MV ˙ O 2) were determined in control (n 5) and ovine heart failure (n 5). Ventricular <b>restraint</b> therapy decreased Ptm and MV ˙ O 2, and improved mechanical efficiency. An optimal physiological <b>restraint</b> level of 3 mm Hg was identified to maximize improvement without an adverse affect on systemic hemodynamics. At this optimal level, end-diastolic Ptm and MV ˙ O 2 indices decreased by 27 % and 20 %, respectively. The serial longitudinal effects of optimized ventricular <b>restraint</b> were then evaluated in ovine heart failure with (n 3) and without (n 3) <b>restraint</b> over 2 months. Optimized ventricular <b>restraint</b> prevented and reversed pathological LV dilatation (13022 mL to 9118 mL) and improved LV ejection fraction (273 % to 435 %). Measured <b>restraint</b> level decreased over time as the LV became smaller, and reverse remodeling slowed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives.  The {{objective}} of this review was to investigate physical <b>restraint</b> minimization in acute and residential care settings. The first aim {{was to determine the}} effectiveness of attempts to minimize the use of physical <b>restraint,</b> and the second was to generate a description of the characteristics of <b>restraint</b> minimization programmes. Method.  A comprehensive search was undertaken involving all major databases and the reference lists of all relevant papers. To be included in the review studies had to be an evaluation of <b>restraint</b> minimization in an acute or residential care setting. As only a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) was identified, it was not possible statistically to pool the findings of different studies on the effectiveness of <b>restraint</b> minimization. To generate a description of the characteristics of <b>restraint</b> minimization programmes, the reported components of these programmes were identified and categorized. Results.  A total of 16 studies evaluating <b>restraint</b> minimization were identified: three in acute care and 13 in residential care. Of these, only one was an RCT, with the most common approach being the before and after study design. Based on the findings of the single RCT, education supported by expert consultation effectively reduced the use of <b>restraint</b> in residential care. There has been little evaluation of <b>restraint</b> minimization in acute care settings. The common approach to <b>restraint</b> minimization has involved a programme of multiple activities, with <b>restraint</b> education being the characteristic common to most programmes. Discussion.  Evidence suggests that physical <b>restraint</b> can be safely reduced in residential care settings through a combination of education and expert clinical consultation. There is little information on <b>restraint</b> minimization in acute care settings. The major finding of this review is the need for further investigation into all aspects of <b>restraint</b> minimization. David Evans, Jacquelin Wood, Leonnie Lamber...|$|R
