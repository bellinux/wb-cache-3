5|$|The lantern {{initially}} {{contained a}} fourth order Fresnel lens giving a red light; a short mast {{on the roof}} of the lantern bore a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> antenna. The fog signal was a horn powered by compressed air. The light was activated in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E

5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E
25|$|The {{norm for}} landing at Fornebu was to {{rendezvous}} with a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon,</b> Rumba, and conduct a fifteen-degree left turn {{for about half}} a minute. The aircraft would then be aligned with the 06 runway and could glide down following the instrument landing system (ILS). This maneuver would nominally take place {{at an altitude of}} 1,100meters (3,500ft). However, in clear weather the pilots often opted for a short-cut to reach the approach path more quickly. Because of the topography, it was possible that the ILS beams would deviate up to twenty-five degrees, which could cause the pilots to turn the aircraft too early and would cause the aircraft to fly over a range of hills on the wrong heading. This was a known fault with the system and pilots would therefore check the direction of the <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> at Asker to ensure they were in the correct position. This short-cut was carried out by Flight 239.|$|E

25|$|The bulk of {{the report}} was {{dedicated}} to the navigational aids at Fornebu. The report underlined that false signals from the <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> were an important underlying cause. It noted that the beacon for runway 01 interfered with that for 06 and that up to three false signals could be transmitted. The commission recommended airlines enforce routines which ensured that multiple systems for determining position and bearing always be used, as a single system would never be reliable. It also recommended an extra <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> be installed in Drammen to aid approach to runway 06 and that airlines in the meantime not rely solely on radio beacons during approach to 06. The report also looked at the work-flow at the air traffic control. The airport had a radar system installed, but this was used solely for monitoring traffic and was not seen as a navigational aid. The commission commented that air traffic control could have prevented the accident had it recognized that the aircraft was on the wrong path and alerted the pilots. Sufficient equipment was installed, {{but there were no}} instructions for such activity.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{departed}} Værnes at 8:30. It {{climbed to}} a cruising altitude of 2,500meters (8,000ft) and passed Tolga <b>Radio</b> <b>Beacon</b> at 09:12. In {{the area around}} Røros the aircraft started experiencing icing, which quickly rose to levels {{which could not be}} handled by the ice protection system. In addition, the aircraft was subject to a downdraft. The pilots therefore chose to turn the aircraft around and return to Trondheim. However, the icing was so aggressive that the aircraft continued to lose elevation. It was flying through a blizzard and there was poor sight, making navigation difficult.|$|E
25|$|United Airlines Flight 718, a Douglas DC-7 Mainliner named Mainliner Vancouver, and {{flown by}} Captain Robert Shirley, First Officer Robert Harms, and Flight Engineer Gerard Fiore, {{departed}} Los Angeles International Airport at 9:04am PST with 53 passengers and five crew members aboard (including two flight attendants), bound for Chicago's Midway Airport. Climbing to an authorized altitude of 21,000 feet, Captain Shirley flew under IFR in controlled airspace {{to a point}} northeast of Palm Springs, California, where he turned left toward a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> near Needles, California, after which his flight plan was direct to Durango in southwestern Colorado. The DC-7, although still operating under IFR, was now, like the Constellation, flying in uncontrolled airspace.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe {{took part}} in the mass killing by {{strafing}} refugees on the road. The number of civilians wounded or killed by aerial bombing is put at over 100,000. The Luftwaffe dropped thousands of bombs on urban centres inhabited only by civilian populations. Amongst the Polish cities and towns bombed at the beginning of war were Brodnica, Bydgoszcz, Chełm, Ciechanów, Kraków, Częstochowa, Grodno, Grudziądz, Gdynia, Janów, Jasło, Katowice, Kielce, Kowel, Kutno, Lublin, Lwów, Olkusz, Piotrków, Płock, Płońsk, Poznań, Puck, Radom, Radomsko, Sulejów, Warsaw, Wieluń, Wilno, and Zamość. Over 156 towns and villages were attacked by the Luftwaffe. Warsaw suffered particularly severely with a combination of aerial bombardment and artillery fire reducing large parts of its historic city centre to rubble. The Soviet Union assisted the Germans by allowing them to use a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> from Minsk to guide their planes.|$|E
25|$|Health {{officials}} {{hoped that}} rains from Hamish {{would help to}} reduce an ongoing dengue fever outbreak; however, little rainfall reached the coast, allowing further growth of the disease. On 10 March—following improved weather—rescue teams resumed searching for the three missing fishermen. During the second rescue attempt, one of the fishermen was found alive but alone in a large swell about 259km (161mi) northeast of Yeppoon, Queensland. The rescuers {{were able to find}} him when he turned on an Emergency Position Indicating <b>Radio</b> <b>Beacon,</b> which he originally thought was a stick. This beacon allowed the rescuers to pinpoint his location, though the other two fishermen reportedly did not have these beacons. On 16 March, a memorial service was held for the two fishermen who were lost at sea. About 200 people who knew the two men attended the service; many of whom signed a book honoring the fishermen.|$|E

500|$|For a time, Anderson {{directed}} Fitzgerald {{toward the}} relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then at 4:39p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational.

McSorley then hailed any {{ships in the}} Whitefish Point area to report {{the state of the}} navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of Avafors between 5:00 and 5:30p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the <b>radio</b> <b>beacon.</b> Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, [...] "Don't allow nobody on deck," [...] as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand.

500|$|The LCA {{believed}} {{that instead of}} hatch cover leakage, the more probable cause of the Fitzgerald loss was shoaling or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of Caribou Island when the vessel [...] "unknowingly raked a reef" [...] during the time the Whitefish Point light and <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> were not available as navigation aids. This theory {{was supported by a}} 1976Canadian hydrographic survey, which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from Anderson observed that Fitzgerald sailed through this exact area. Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that Fitzgeralds downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship [...] "hogged" [...] during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain. Divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of [...] "a recent collision or grounding anywhere." [...] Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling theory was later challenged {{on the basis of the}} higher quality of detail in Shannon's 1994photography that [...] "explicitly show the devastation of the Fitzgerald." [...] Shannon's photography of Fitzgeralds overturned stern showed [...] "no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal." ...|$|E
