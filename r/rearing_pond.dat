Mainly the factors such as success, survival, rate of growth and mortality have been studied. Survival increases with the size of the fish {{because of the fact that}} larger fish can easily avoid predation. Pellet-reared fish show higher mortality than minnow-reared fish because of the loss due to predation and also slightly worse ability to catch living prey and obtain food, even though their diet contains similar species. Temperature can also affect the mortality of the stocked fish, mainly when the temperature difference between the <b>rearing</b> <b>pond</b> or hatchery and the new environment exceeds 10 řC, which brings loss of majority of the stocked fish.

It was presented December 9, 2009 at the Hatfield Marine Science Center. Lint Slough is a small “finger” of the Alsea River estuary located in Waldport, Oregon, which drains a 4. 5 square mile basin. Infrastructure associated with a former fish research facility has recently been removed and the slough is being transformed back to its natural condition. 	In 1963 the Oregon Game Commission (now the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife) transformed Lint Slough into a salmon rearing research facility for coho, chinook, steelhead, and cutthroat trout. They dammed the upper and lower ends of the slough to create a ¾ mile long <b>rearing</b> <b>pond.</b> Lint Creek fed freshwater into the pond from upstream and the ocean fed saltwater into the pond via a levied canal built along the west side of the pond. Water control structures allowed researchers to regulate salinity in the pond. Researchers attempted to raise juvenile fish to the smolt phase at an accelerated rate and release the smolts into the ocean by autumn for the benefit of sport and commercial fishermen. Many challenges thwarted their efforts to raise fish in this facility.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} eutrophication in the aquatic environment, which occurs due to excessive intake of nutrients, i. e. nitrogen and phosphorus, which results in excessive algae growth.

In addition to high amount of phosphorus from the environment, fishing family also adds phosphorus with the feeding in the second and fourth pond. In the five <b>rearing</b> <b>ponds,</b> we first performed the basic physical and chemical analysis of water and produced simple Vollenweider's model. Phosphorus in the model stands as the only limiting factor for eutrophication. With the model we attempted to quantify and assess the impact of the introduction of phosphorus in the ponds, but also in the aquifer in which the water from the ponds flows into. We compared the results of the analysis of water and the model with each other and placed them in state of trophic <b>rearing</b> <b>ponds.</b> By comparison with the model and measurements, trophic states differ a bit in the third pond. In all other ponds, the trophic states are the same. The model results show, that the first and the second pond are in eutrophic state and the fourth pond is in mesotrophic state. Measurements show that the third pond is in eutrophic state, while the model shows mesotrophic state. The highest concentration of phosphorus is in the last pond as expected. The measurements show eutrophic state, as confirmed by the model. The last pond contains high quantity of total phosphorus. Due to excessive concentrations of total phosphorus, during the summer, the process of eutrophication appears. This is the reason, why phosphorus from the last pond affects downstream on first recipients and causes the eutrophication process...|$|R
