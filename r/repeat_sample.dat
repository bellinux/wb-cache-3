50|$|There {{have been}} rare {{instances}} of myiasis linked to M. stabulans. A twenty-year-old male from a rural part of India was reported {{with a rare}} case of intestinal myiasis. Symptoms included abdominal discomfort, bloated abdomen, and intestinal hurrying after meals. His stool sample was watery and contained sparse fecal matter, but it was littered with maggots. A <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> two hours later also displayed positive signs of maggots. The maggots were washed in 0.9% normal saline solution and in distilled water and were subsequently preserved in 10% formalin before being submitted to the Vector Control Research Center (VCRC) in Puducherry, for definite species identification. Upon arrival, the maggots were rinsed again with distilled water and dropped into a solution of 10% sodium hydroxide for six hours. The last segment on the maggot was transected, and by using a Zeiss binocular dissection microscope, the spiracular plate was removed and placed in Hoyer’s medium. By attaching a camera to a MOTIC BA 300 digital compound microscope, pictures were taken of the whole larva and the spiracular plate. The maggots were approximately 6 - 7 mm length-wise and 1 - 1.5 mm in width and appeared a dullish-white in color. Their carcasses were coated with a tough integument consisting of multiple bands of minute, grayish-brown spines. Closer examination with a microscope revealed a total of 11 separate segments. Each segment, except for the anal segment, had a belt of small, well-developed spines going towards the posterior margins. The anterior and posterior regions were similarly narrow while the middle appeared broad. Two hooks {{were found on the}} pseudo-cephalic segment of the maggot which enabled them to attach to the mucosal lining of the intestine. The appearance of spiracular slits on the solid plate on the peritreme of the posterior spiracle narrowed the results down to the genus Muscina. The curve in the spiracular slit at the middle verified that the species was M. stabulans.|$|E

Full blood count (platelets 173), coagulation screen were normal throughout. Liver function tests remained normal apart from an elevated gamma-GT (156). CT Brain was normal. CSF analysis showed a WCC of 454 /mm(3) (60 % lymphocytes), elevated CSF protein (1. 42 g/l) and a normal CSF glucose. He was commenced on IV antibiotics and IV acyclivor and improved. On day 3 of admission, he complained of a sudden severe headache, became unresponsive (GCS 3 / 15). INVESTIGATIONS: CT Brain showed a massive left intraventricular haemorrhage. He died 4 days later. Subsequent serum serology for leptospirosis was positive. A <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> taken 4 days post-admission, showed a rising IgM indicating active leptospirosis.

Two of these (45,X/ 46,XX and 46,XX/ 47,XX, + 21) were called true mosaics because multiple colonies demonstrated the same abnormal chromosome complement, and on subsequent evaluation of the newborn blood or fetal tissues, mosaicism was confirmed. Of the remaining cases, 29 were designated as pseudomosaics because only single or partial colonies exhibited an aberrant chromosome complement, 12 having a trisomy 2 line. In the final case, a double trisomy was demonstrated in only one of eight colonies in the first culture, but in the culture from a <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> an additional two colonies showed the same double trisomy.

It also deals with the legal aspects of DNA profiling because it raises many important legal questions. The The- sis consists of two parts. The first part is about DNA profiling itself. The history of DNA profiling worldwide and in the Czech Republic is mentioned. The first cases solved with its contribution are described. A very important feature of DNA profiling is that it can be used not only for conviction of offenders but also for acquittal of innocent individu- als. Biological principles of DNA profiling are explained as well as possibilities of its utilization in criminal science, criminal and civil proceedings. The fact that monozy- gotic twins have identical DNA is mentioned as well as some very extraordinary occurrences such as hermaphrodites or another kind of individuals, who have two different DNA. These anomalies can cause problems with interpretation of the results. DNA databases can be used for comparison of many DNA profiles without the necessity to <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> analysis.

Method: An analysis of errors obtained in clinical hematology laboratory in the Preanalytical and Postanalytical phase {{has been carried out}} over a 1 year period. All pre and post analytical causes for rejection or repeat samples and other errors were registered during this period. Results: In the present study the preanalytical errors were found to be more common in both IPD and OPD cases (65. 43 %) than the postanalytical errors(34. 57 %) Both pre & post analytical errors were more common in IPD cases (72. 40 %) than OPD (27. 60 %) cases. Considering both pre and postanalytical variables leading to a repeat/rejection of sample the overall percentage error out of total (IPD & OPD) cases was found to be 3. 73 %. Conclusion: By analyzing the rejection percentage of samples over a period of 1 year we found that preanalytical errors were more common than postanalytical errors and were seen more frequently in IPD cases. Amongst the preanalytical errors, clotted samples were the major cause of rejection whereas in the postanalytical category, reports that were misplaced especially in IPD cases caused much inconvenience to the patients and many a times a <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> had to be done.

Serum thiocyanate concentrations were measured by the ferric nitrate method. All smoking groups showed mean thiocyanate concentrations greater than non-smokers except those smoking five or fewer cigarettes a day. There was a significant increase in plasma thiocyanate with increasing smoking (p less than 0. 01). Non-smokers with and without exposure to passive smoke could not be separated by thiocyanate concentration. In our hands serum thiocyanate concentrations identified moderate and heavy smokers but could not distinguish between non-smokers, light smokers, and passive smokers.

40|$|Abstract Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{are abundant}} and evenly {{distributed throughout the}} maize (Zea mays L.) genome. SNPs have several advantages over simple sequence repeats, such as ease of data comparison and integration, high-throughput processing of loci, and identification of associated phenotypes. SNPs are thus ideal for DNA fingerprint-ing, genetic diversity analysis, and marker-assisted breeding. Here, we developed a high-throughput and compatible SNP array, maizeSNP 3072, containing 3072 SNPs developed from the maizeSNP 50 array. To improve genotyping efficiency, a high-quality cluster file, maizeSNP 3072 _GT. egt, was constructed. All 3072 SNP loci were localized within different genes, where they were distributed in exons (43 %), promot-ers (21 %), 30 untranslated regions (UTRs; 22 %), 50 UTRs (9 %), and introns (5 %). The average geno-typing failure rate using these SNPs was only 6 %, or 3 % using the cluster file to call genotypes. The genotype consistency of <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> analysis on Illumina GoldenGate versus Infinium platforms ex-ceeded 96. 4 %. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of the SNPs averaged 0. 37 {{based on data from}} 309 inbred lines. The 3072 SNPs were highly effective for distinguishing among 276 examined hybrids. Com-parative analysis using Chinese varieties revealed that the 3072 SNP array showed a better marker success rate and higher average MAF values, evaluation scores, and variety-distinguishing efficiency than the maizeSNP 50 K array. The maizeSNP 3072 array thus can be successfully used in DNA fingerprinting identification of Chinese maize varieties and shows potential as a useful tool for germplasm resource evaluation and molecular marker-assisted breeding...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the contribution to recurrence detection and survival of serum {{squamous cell carcinoma}} antigen (SCC-ag) analysis in the follow-up of early-stage cervical cancer patients. Patients and Methods: Follow-up data were evaluated in patients with early-stage squamous cell cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without radiotherapy. Routine serum SCC-ag determination was performed at each follow-up visit. Results: Recurrent disease occurred in 35 (16 %) of 225 patients and was preceded or accompanied by serum SCC-ag elevation 26 times (sensitivity, 74 %). In five (14 %) of these 35 patients, elevated serum SCC-ag was the first measured clinical indicator. Desite salvage therapy, all five patients died of disease. In the other 31 patients (21 with serum SCC-ag elevation), either symptoms and/or positive signs led to recurrence detection. Median survival time after recurrence was worse (9 months; range, 2 to 112 +) for patients with an elevated serum SCC-ag value at recurrence in comparison with patients with normal serum SCC-ag values (20 months; range, 4 to 96; P <. 01). In 23 of the 190 patients without recurrences, serum SCC-ag values became falsely elevated. In 16 of these 23 patients, the <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> after 6 weeks showed a normal SCC-ag, and in seven patients benign (especially skin) disorders were found. Conclusion: Serum SCC-ag analysis results in earlier recurrence detection in a small proportion (14 %) of patients but did not contribute to better survival. As long as treatment possibilities for recurrent cervical cancer patients are not improved, serum SCC-ag analysis should not be carried out in routine follow-up.

40|$|Background: Recent {{publications}} {{report that}} up to 70 % of total laboratory errors occur in the pre-analytical phase. Identifi cation of specifi c problems highlights pre-analytic processes susceptible to errors. The rejection of unsuitable samples can lead to delayed turnaround time and affect patient care. Methods: A retrospective audit was conducted investigating the rejection rate of routine blood specimens received at chemistry and haematology laboratories over a 2 -week period. The reasons for rejection and potential clinical impact of these rejections were investigated. Thirty patient fi les were randomly selected and examined {{to assess the impact}} of these rejections on clinical care. Results: A total of 32, 910 specimens were received during the study period, of which 481 were rejected, giving a rejection rate of 1. 46 % The main reasons for rejection were inappropriate clotting (30 %) and inadequate sample volume (22 %). Only 51. 7 % of rejected samples were repeated and the average time for a <b>repeat</b> <b>sample</b> to reach the laboratory was about 5 days (121 h). Of the repeated samples, 5. 1 % had results within critical values. Examination of patient folders showed that in 40 % of cases the rejection of samples had an impact on patient care. Conclusions: The evaluation of pre-analytical processes in the laboratory, with regard to sample rejection, allowed one to identify problem areas where improvement is necessary. Rejected samples due to factors out of the laboratory's control had a defi nite impact on patient care and can thus affect customer satisfaction. Clinicians should be aware of these factors to prevent such rejections. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter...|$|E
