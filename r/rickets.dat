5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (<b>rickets).</b> In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Charles {{apparently}} conquered {{his physical}} infirmity, {{which might have}} been caused by <b>rickets.</b> He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry {{died at the age of}} 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of <b>rickets,</b> two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>rickets</b> and osteomalacia are now rare in Britain, {{outbreaks}} {{have happened}} in some immigrant communities in which osteomalacia sufferers included women with seemingly adequate daylight outdoor exposure wearing Western clothing. Having darker skin and reduced exposure to sunshine did not produce <b>rickets</b> unless the diet deviated from a Western omnivore pattern characterized by high intakes of meat, fish, and eggs, and low intakes of high-extraction cereals. The dietary risk factors for <b>rickets</b> include abstaining from animal foods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rickets</b> was {{formerly}} {{a major public}} health problem among the US population; in Denver, where ultraviolet rays are about 20% stronger than at sea level on the same latitude, almost two-thirds of 500 children had mild <b>rickets</b> in the late 1920s. An increase {{in the proportion of}} animal protein in the 20th century American diet coupled with increased consumption of milk fortified with relatively small quantities of vitamin D coincided with a dramatic {{decline in the number of}} <b>rickets</b> cases. Also, in the United States and Canada, vitamin D-fortified milk, infant vitamin supplements, and vitamin supplements have helped to eradicate the majority of cases of <b>rickets</b> for children with fat malabsorption conditions.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin-deficiency-related {{diseases}} (such as scurvy and <b>rickets).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1923, American {{biochemist}} Harry Steenbock at the University of Wisconsin {{demonstrated that}} irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials. After irradiating rodent food, Steenbock discovered the rodents were cured of <b>rickets.</b> A vitamin D deficiency is a known cause of <b>rickets.</b> Using $300 {{of his own}} money, Steenbock patented his invention. His irradiation technique was used for foodstuffs, most memorably for milk. By the expiration of his patent in 1945, <b>rickets</b> had been all but eliminated in the US.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{suspected}} conditions require specific projections. For example, skeletal {{signs of}} <b>rickets</b> are seen predominantly at sites of rapid growth, including the proximal humerus, distal radius, distal femur {{and both the}} proximal and the distal tibia. Therefore, a skeletal survey for <b>rickets</b> can be accomplished with anteroposterior radiographs of the knees, wrists, and ankles.|$|E
25|$|Kinsey's {{parents were}} poor {{for most of}} his childhood, often unable to afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey {{receiving}} inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including <b>rickets,</b> rheumatic fever, and typhoid fever. His health records indicate that Kinsey received suboptimal exposure to sunlight (often the cause of <b>rickets,</b> before milk and other foods were fortified with vitamin D) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. <b>Rickets</b> led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being drafted in 1917 for World War I.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the patent expired in 1945, <b>rickets</b> was all but nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} {{feature of}} Fanconi syndrome is bone demineralization (osteomalacia or <b>rickets)</b> due to phosphate wasting.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{remains the}} main cause of <b>rickets</b> among young infants in most countries, because breast milk is low in vitamin D and social customs and climatic conditions can prevent adequate sun exposure. In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, where <b>rickets</b> occurs among older toddlers and children, it has been attributed to low dietary calcium intakes, which are characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited access to dairy products.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rickets,</b> a {{childhood}} disease, {{is characterized by}} impeded growth and soft, weak, deformed long bones that bend and bow under their weight as children start to walk. This condition is characterized by bow legs, which {{can be caused by}} calcium or phosphorus deficiency, as well as a lack of vitamin D; today, it is largely found in low-income countries in Africa, Asia, or the Middle East and in those with genetic disorders such as pseudovitamin D deficiency <b>rickets.</b>|$|E
25|$|A diet {{deficient}} in vitamin D {{in conjunction with}} inadequate sun exposure causes osteomalacia (or <b>rickets</b> when it occurs in children), which is a softening of the bones. In the developed world, this is a rare disease. However, vitamin D deficiency has become a worldwide problem in the elderly and remains common in children and adults. Low blood calcifediol (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) can result from avoiding the sun. Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and bone damage which leads to bone-softening diseases, including <b>rickets</b> and osteomalacia.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, German doctor Kurt Huldschinsky {{discovered}} {{that exposure to}} sunlight helped to cure <b>rickets</b> in many children, causing sunlight {{to be associated with}} improved health.|$|E
25|$|Alum {{was used}} by bakers in England during the 1800s to make bread whiter. This was theorized by some, {{including}} John Snow, to cause <b>rickets.</b> The Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 prevented this and other adulterations.|$|E
25|$|Maternal vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} overt bone disease from before birth and impairment of bone quality after birth. Nutritional <b>rickets</b> exists {{in countries with}} intense year-round sunlight such as Nigeria and can occur without vitamin D deficiency.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{differential diagnosis}} of OI is child abuse, as both may present with multiple fractures {{in various stages}} of healing. Differentiating them can be difficult, especially when no other characteristic features of OI are present. Other differential diagnoses include <b>rickets,</b> osteomalacia, and other rare skeletal syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Legg {{believed}} {{the cause was}} impairment of blood supply to the femoral epiphysis, Calve believed <b>rickets,</b> and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, {{a number of factors}} have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} causes osteomalacia (called <b>rickets</b> when {{it occurs}} in children). Use of vitamin D in children with normal vitamin D levels {{does not appear to}} improve bone density. Beyond that, low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with falls, and low bone mineral density. Taking extra vitamin D, however, does not appear to change the risk.|$|E
25|$|She {{argued that}} women who did not eat well during {{pregnancy}} {{were more likely to}} suffer from numerous medical problems and that their infants would carry emotional scars through life, such as hearing defects, eye abnormalities, <b>rickets</b> and anemia, and would do poorly in school, and that such mothers were settling for mediocre children when they could have superior ones.|$|E
25|$|Sherman {{was born}} in Hackney, London, to Jewish {{immigrants}} from Russia, Jacob Vladimir and Eva Sherman. His early years were spent in grinding poverty; as a child he suffered from <b>rickets.</b> He attended Hackney Downs County Secondary School, which was then a grammar school and regarded as a flagship of opportunity. He went on to Chelsea Polytechnic, where he studied science.|$|E
25|$|As humans {{dispersed}} from equatorial Africa to low UVR {{areas and}} higher altitudes sometime between 120,000 and 65,000 years ago, dark skin posed as a disadvantage. Populations with light skin pigmentation evolved in climates of little sunlight. Light skin pigmentation protects against vitamin D deficiency. It {{is known that}} dark-skinned people who have moved to climates of limited sunlight can develop vitamin D related conditions such as <b>rickets,</b> and different forms of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Penley gained {{increasing}} prominence during 1876 {{in supporting}} roles in Offenbach's Geneviève de Brabant, and Madame l'archiduc, and W. S. Gilbert and Frederic Clay's comic opera Princess Toto. The last {{of these was}} staged at the Strand, where Penley remained for three years under the management of Ada Swanborough, appearing mostly in burlesque. On 22 March 1879 he married Mary Ann <b>Rickets,</b> {{the daughter of a}} cattle salesman; they had three sons and three daughters.|$|E
25|$|Mayow {{published}} at Oxford in 1668 two tracts, on respiration and <b>rickets,</b> and in 1674 {{these were}} reprinted, the former in an enlarged and corrected form, with three others De sal-nitro et spiritu nitro-aereo, De respiratione foetus in utero et ovo, and De motu musculari et spiritibus animalibus as Tractatus quinque medico-physici. The contents of this work, which was several times republished and translated into Dutch, German and French, show {{him to have}} been an investigator much in advance of his time.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increase}} of vitamin D synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions {{that are related to}} common vitamin D deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of low UV radition: <b>rickets,</b> osteoporosis, numerous cancer types (including colon and breast cancer), and immune system malfunctioning. Vitamin D promotes the production of cathelicidin, which helps to defend humans' bodies against fungal, bacterial, and viral infections, including flu. When exposed to UVB, the entire exposed area of body’s skin of a relatively light skinned person is able to between 10 - 20000 IU of vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|From {{the summer}} of 1944 until February 1945, high school girls worked in or near Kokura {{constructing}} balloons to carry bombs across the Pacific where they would detonate in the U.S. The girls worked in two 12-hour shifts and, contrary to their expectations, there was little food available. Some eventually suffered from malnutrition. Within a short time after graduation {{in the spring of}} 1945, one participant estimates that one-tenth of her classmates died, while others suffered from tuberculosis, neuralgia, <b>rickets,</b> and symptoms of over-exhaustion as a result of exposure to chemicals used in making the balloons.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{earliest}} contributions {{while at the}} Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in orthopaedics, {{by means of the}} development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a special instrument (Macewen's osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of <b>rickets</b> (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts of the temporal bone and has identified an anatomical structure in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen's triangle in his honour.|$|E
25|$|Dark-skinned {{people who}} live in high latitudes with mild {{sunlight}} are at an increased risk – especially in the winter – of vitamin D deficiency. As a consequence of vitamin D deficiency, they are at a higher risk of developing <b>rickets,</b> and numerous types of cancers, and possibly cardiovascular disease and low immune system activity. However, some recent studies have questioned if the thresholds indicating Vitamin D deficiency in light-skinned individuals are relevant for dark-skinned individuals, as they found that on average dark-skinned individuals have higher bone density and lower risk of fractures than lighter-skinned individuals with the same levels of Vitamin D. This is attributed as possibly due to lower presence of Vitamin D binding agents (and thus higher bioavailability) in dark-skinned individuals.|$|E
25|$|However {{public support}} quickly waned {{as it became}} {{apparent}} that the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to the Conservatives' spectacular defeat in 1906. There was public outrage at the use of scorched earth tactics – the forced clearance of women and children, the destruction of the countryside, burning of Boer homesteads and poisoning of wells, for example – and the conditions in the concentration camps. It also became apparent that there were serious problems with public health in Britain: up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for military service, suffering from medical problems such as <b>rickets</b> and other poverty-related illnesses. This came at a time of increasing concern for the state of the poor in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Physiologically, {{increased}} pressure in utero, <b>rickets</b> and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because {{the heart is}} located behind the sternum, and because individuals with pectus excavatum {{have been shown to}} have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum. While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function, no consensus has been reached based on newer physiological tests such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function. Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery; A 2013 meta-analysis yielded conflicting results.|$|E
25|$|Gibson {{was born}} in Omaha, Nebraska, the last of Pack and Victoria Gibson's seven {{children}} (five boys and two girls). Gibson's father died of tuberculosis three months prior to Gibson's birth, and Gibson himself was named Pack Robert Gibson in his father's honor. While he revered his father's legacy, Gibson disliked the name Pack, and later changed his first name to Robert. Despite a childhood that included health problems like <b>rickets,</b> and a serious case of either asthma or pneumonia when he was three, Gibson was active in sports in both informal and organized settings, particularly baseball and basketball. Gibson's brother Josh (no relation to the Negro Leagues star player), who was 15 years his senior, {{had a profound impact}} on his early life, serving as a mentor to him. Gibson played on a number of youth basketball and baseball teams his brother coached, many of which were organized through the local YMCA.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that adult human females are consistently lighter in skin pigmentation than males in the same population. This form of sexual dimorphism {{is due to the}} requirement in human females for high amounts of calcium during pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding newborns, whose skeletons are growing, require high amounts of calcium intake from the mother's milk (about 4 times more than during prenatal development), part of which comes from reserves in the mother's skeleton. Adequate vitamin D resources are needed to absorb calcium from the diet, and {{it has been shown that}} deficiencies of vitamin D and calcium increase the likelihood of various birth defects such as spina bifida and <b>rickets.</b> Natural selection has led to females with lighter skin than males in all indigenous populations because women must get enough vitamin D and calcium to support the development of fetus and nursing infant and to maintain their own health.|$|E
25|$|Death during {{hibernation}} was {{a common}} end for cave bears, mainly befalling specimens that failed ecologically during the summer season through inexperience, sickness or old age. Some cave bear bones show signs of numerous ailments, including spinal fusion, bone tumours, cavities, tooth resorption, necrosis (particularly in younger specimens), osteomyelitis, periostitis, <b>rickets</b> and kidney stones. Male cave bear skeletons have been found with broken bacula, probably due to fighting during the breeding season. Cave bear longevity is unknown, though {{it has been estimated}} that they seldom exceeded twenty years of age. Paleontologists doubt adult cave bears had any natural predators, save for pack-hunting wolves and cave hyenas, which would probably have attacked sick or infirm specimens. Cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the disarticulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for the hyenas, especially at the end of the winter, when food was scarce. The presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons, deep in cave bear dens, indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears, with some dying in the attempt.|$|E
25|$|Primidone, {{along with}} {{phenytoin}} and phenobarbital, {{is one of}} the anticonvulsants most heavily associated with bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteopenia (which can precede osteoporosis), osteomalacia and fractures. The populations usually said to be most at risk are institutionalized people, postmenopausal women, older men, people taking more than one anticonvulsant, and children, who are also at risk of <b>rickets.</b> However, {{it has been suggested that}} bone demineralization is most pronounced in young people (25–44 years of age) and one 1987 study of institutionalized people found that the rate of osteomalacia in the ones taking anticonvulsantsone out of nineteen individuals taking an anticonvulsant (vs. none among the thirty-seven people taking none) was similar to that expected in elderly people. The authors speculated that this was due to improvements in diet, sun exposure and exercise in response to earlier findings, and/or that this was because it was sunnier in London than in the Northern European countries which had earlier reported this effect. In any case, the use of more than one anticonvulsant has been associated with an increased prevalence of bone disease in institutionalized epilepsy patients versus institutionalized people who did not have epilepsy. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking anticonvulsants have a greater risk of fracture than their drug-naive counterparts.|$|E
500|$|Over 26,000 {{artefacts}} {{and pieces}} of timber were raised along with remains of about half the crew members, The faces of some crew members have been reconstructed. [...] Analysis of the crew skeletons shows many had suffered malnutrition, and had evidence of <b>rickets,</b> scurvy, and other deficiency diseases. Crew members also developed arthritis through the stresses on their joints from heavy lifting and maritime life generally, and suffered bone fractures.|$|E
