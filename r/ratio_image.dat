For that, in situ Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) data acquired in the Ibitinga reservoir were resampled to match Landsat/TM spectral simulated bands (TM_sim bands) and used to run linear correlation with concurrent measurements of chlorophyll-&# 945; concentration. Monte Carlo simulation was then applied to select the most suitable model relating chlorophyll-&# 945; concentration and simulated TM/Landsat reflectance. TM 4 _sim/TM 3 _sim ratio provided the best model with a R² value of 0. 78. The model was then inverted to create a look-up-table (LUT) relating TM 4 _sim/TM 3 _sim ratio intervals to chlorophyll-&# 945; concentration trophic state classes covering the entire range measured in the reservoir. Atmospheric corrected Landsat TM images converted to surface reflectance were then used to generate a TM 4 /TM 3 <b>ratio</b> <b>image.</b> The <b>ratio</b> <b>image</b> frequency distribution encompassed the range of TM 4 _sim/TM 3 _sim ratio indicating agreement between in situ and satellite data and supporting the use of satellite data to map chlorophyll-&# 945; concentration trophic state distribution in the reservoir.

Despite the stochastic selection of TM 4 _sim/TM 3 _sim ratio as the best input variable for modeling the chlorophyll-&# 945; concentration, it has a physical basis: high concentration of phytoplankton increases the reflectance in the near-infrared (TM 4) and decreases the reflectance in the red (TM 3).

Parametric nondisplaceable binding potential (BP ND) images were compared with standardized uptake value (SUV) and SUV <b>ratio</b> <b>images.</b> Images were visually assessed by 3 independent readers, and both interreader and intermethod agreement was determined. Results: Both 90 -min (Fleiss k = 0. 88) and 60 -min (Fleiss k = 0. 89) BP ND images showed excellent interreader agreement, whereas agreement was good to moderate for SUV <b>ratio</b> <b>images</b> (Fleiss k= 0. 68) and SUV images (Fleiss k = 0. 59).

40|$|Abstract The {{proposed}} {{method for}} low-dimensional illumination space representation (LDISR) of human faces {{can not only}} synthesize a virtual face image when given lighting conditions but also estimate lighting conditions when given a face image. The LDISR {{is based on the}} observation that 9 basis point light sources can represent almost arbitrary lighting conditions for face recognition application and different human faces have a similar LDISR. The principal component analysis (PCA) and the nearest neighbor clustering method are adopted to obtain the 9 basis point light sources. The 9 basis images under the 9 basis point light sources are then used to construct an LDISR which can represent almost all face images under arbitrary lighting conditions. Illumination <b>ratio</b> <b>image</b> (IRI) is employed to generate virtual face images under different illuminations. The LDISR obtained from face images of one person can be used for other people.
