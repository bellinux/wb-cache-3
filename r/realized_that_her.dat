5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; {{the next month}} she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region {{during a time of}} war, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she {{returned to}} England and <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.|$|E

The ransom note demanded $118,000 for the child's safe return—almost the exact value of a bonus her husband had received earlier that year.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. A year later, Zohra Daoud, {{her husband}} Mohammad Daoud, {{along with their}} infant, fled to Germany. In 1980, she arrived at Virginia's Norfolk International Airport, where she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> life as a high class citizen was over. With a degree in French {{literature}} from Kabul University, Zohra Daoud {{managed to get a}} job in a French bakery in Richmond. When she arrived at the job, she was handed a mop and sent to the kitchen to sweep the floors. Despite being a trained commercial pilot, Zohra Daoud’s husband, Mohammad Daoud, worked at McDonald's, and then as a taxi driver. Zohra and Mohammad Daoud later began taking English classes, tutorial and exams in order to improve their English language. After all the hard work, Mohammad Daoud landed a job as a pilot for United Airlines. With their increase in income, Mohammad and Zohra Daoud began getting the rest of their family members into United States, as well as settling in their California home.|$|E

The script included a large part for Fowley, which Rogers described as [...] "by far the most [...] had to do in an episode." [...] She later explained, [...] "It occurred to me , uh oh, this is way too good. I have too much to do. They're going to kill me." ...|$|E
500|$|Omayra Sánchez {{lived in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Santander with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and sorghum collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique and aunt María Adela Garzón. [...] Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business. The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar. After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> legs were trapped under her house's roof. Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was [...] "trapped up to her neck", while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.|$|E

500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1993, despite not seeing or {{speaking}} to Jackson {{for a number of}} years, La Toya Jackson claimed that her brother was a pedophile and that she had proof, which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> revelations were not what she had claimed them to be. Then in Israel, she stated, [...] "I cannot and will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against young children... Forget about the superstar, forget about the icon. If he was any other 35-year-old man who was sleeping with little boys, you wouldn't like this guy". She also claimed that checks had been made out to several boys and that Jackson's own physical abuse as a child had turned him into an abuser. She would later claim that Jackson had tried to kidnap and kill her. The rest of the family disowned her, and in subsequent years she would insist that she was forced to make the allegations by her then husband for financial gain. Just prior to making the allegations, her husband was arrested for striking her in the face, arms and legs with a chair. By the turn of the millennium Jackson had forgiven his sister.|$|E

2500|$|While {{a student}} at the University of Chicago, Dunham took leave and went to the Caribbean to study dance and ethnography.

2500|$|In December 1993 Gordon hastily {{arranged}} {{a press conference}} in Tel Aviv, where he had Jackson read a statement claiming to believe the sensational sex abuse allegation against her younger brother Michael might be true.

A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> revelations were not what she had claimed them to be.

2500|$|For {{several years}} Bly's second career {{remained}} a secret, and she disguised herself by wearing contacts {{instead of her}} normal glasses when she attended functions as Eloisa James. [...] After her first New York Times Bestseller in 2005, Bly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> readers liked her writing regardless of its genre, and that by keeping her identity a secret she was implying that she was ashamed of her work and of her readers. [...] At a February 16, 2005 faculty meeting, Bly outed herself to her colleagues, revealing her alter ego and offering copies of her novels to her fellow professors. [...] Once she had officially [...] "come out", she submitted an op-ed to The New York Times defending the romance genre.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} year of her life, her health, always delicate, became more frail, but she kept up her {{interest}} in all the former work of her life, in spite of times of discouragement, for she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> strength was gradually becoming less. She presided at several Alliance meetings, although her friends well-knew that she was not able to bear the strain; but even in times of great weariness she would have days of enjoyment. Not many months before, on a visit to Concord, Massachusetts, which always brought happiness to her, she took part in the music one evening, and sang to the young people about her. One of the happiest recollections, to those nearest her, was of the last Christmas family gathering, in her own home, when she joined in the simple games and dances with her grandchildren. The two married daughters resided near their mother in Somerville, Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|In several interviews, Octavia Butler has {{acknowledged}} that a series of family and life experiences influenced her novel Kindred. Butler’s grandmother worked chopping sugar cane, and did the laundry of her family {{as well as for}} the white family whom she worked for. Butler spent a great deal of her childhood feeling ashamed that her mother was a housemaid. She also resented her mother for allowing her employers to treat her like dirt, talking to her like she was less than a human being. As she grew older, Butler <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> mother endured all that disrespect in order to provide for her. This, in turn, inspired her to write a series of female characters—Alice, Sarah, and Dana—whose capacity of endurance and sacrifice in the face of exploitation is heroic. [...] Butler’s work experiences also helped her develop the protagonist of the novel, Dana. Just like Butler, Dana works at a number of jobs--"from blue collar to low grade white collar, clerk typist"—while struggling to become a published writer. Like Dana, when work is hard to come by, Butler goes home, bakes a solitary potato for her daily meal and keeps on writing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1952, Walker was accidentally {{wounded in}} the right eye by a shot from a BB gun fired by one of her brothers. In 2013, on BBC Radio's Desert Island Discs, she said the act was {{deliberate}} but she agreed to protect her brother against their parents' anger if they knew the truth. Because the family had no car, the Walkers could not take their daughter to a hospital for immediate treatment. By {{the time they reached}} a doctor a week later, she had become permanently blind in that eye. When a layer of scar tissue formed over her wounded eye, Alice became self-conscious and painfully shy. Stared at and sometimes taunted by other children, she felt like an outcast and turned for solace to reading and to writing poetry. When she was 14, the scar tissue was removed. She later became valedictorian and was voted most-popular girl, as well as queen of her senior class, but she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> traumatic injury had some value: it had allowed her to begin [...] "really to see people and things, really to notice relationships and to learn to be patient enough to care about how they turned out".|$|E
2500|$|Things did {{not improve}} for Bentley in 1945. She began {{an affair with a}} man whom she came to suspect was either an FBI or a Soviet agent sent to spy on her, and her Soviet contact {{suggested}} that she should emigrate to the Soviet Union—a move Bentley feared would end with her execution. In August 1945, Bentley went to the FBI office in New Haven, Connecticut and met with the agent in charge. She did not immediately defect, however. Instead she seemed to be [...] "feeling out" [...] the FBI, and it would not be until November that she began to tell her full story to the FBI. In the meantime, her situation continued to worsen. In September she met with Anatoly Gorsky, her latest NKGB controller, and arrived at the meeting drunk. [...] She became angry with Gorsky, called him and his fellow Russian agents [...] "gangsters", and obliquely threatened to become an informer. She soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> tirade could have put her life in danger, and in fact when Gorsky reported to Moscow his recommendation was to [...] "get rid of her".|$|E
2500|$|Zeldis finally resumed {{painting}} {{twenty-three years}} later, as her children grew older and her marriage ended. She enrolled in Brooklyn College as an Early Childhood Studies major in 1970. The college had a [...] "life experience" [...] policy, which prompted Zeldis to submit her paintings despite continued apprehension over {{whether they were}} good enough. Much to her surprise, Zeldis's paintings were well received and her teacher introduced her work to an art critic, who further suggested showing her work to dealers. This period {{was a turning point}} for Zeldis, as she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> lack of training was not a barrier to the art world. It was around this time that she observed Haitian folk art in a gallery. She found Haitian folk art very stylistically similar to her own, and finally believed that she was an artist. Zeldis began painting seriously and had a number of gallery shows. Her work also appeared in books such as the International Dictionary of Naive Art and Moments in Jewish Life: The Folk Art of Malcah Zeldis. Zeldis later illustrated a number of children's books in collaboration with her daughter, Yona Zeldis.|$|E
