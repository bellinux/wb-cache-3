The administration order of forages (fibrous-succulents and succulents-fibrous), the number of feedings and the average consumption speed among the two portions were the experimental variants. Data was computed by ANOVA/MANOVA. The average consumption speed determined was 198. 5 g/min for concentrates, 48. 28 g/min for alfalfa hay, 203. 19 g/min for silage and 235. 32 g/min <b>for</b> <b>beets.</b> The required time for 1 kg of raw forage consumption (minutes and seconds) was 5. 02 for concentrates, 20. 43 for alfalfa hay, 4. 35 for herbs silage and 4. 15 <b>for</b> <b>beets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to examine effects of amendment of agricultural soil with river-sediment on the yield and heavy metal concentration of crops cultivated in it. Sediment was {{collected from the}} river in the industrialized and densely-populated area of Hanoi city and added to agricultural soil at the rates of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 %, followed by thorough mixing. White cabbage and beet were cultivated in pots at Hanoi Agricultural University. After harvest edible parts (leaf for white cabbage and root <b>for</b> <b>beet)</b> of both crops were weighed. The yield was highest at the soil with 30 % addition of the sediment for both crops. The total concentration of heavy metals was higher for white cabbage than <b>for</b> <b>beet</b> and was not parallel with the percentage of sediment in the soil. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in white cabbage and Cd in beet were over the Vietnam standard for maximum permissible heavy metal concentration in vegetables...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{recognition}} in noisy environments remains an unsolved problem {{even in the}} case of isolated word recognition with small vocabularies. Recently, several techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem. Concretely, two closely related parameterization techniques based on an AR modelling in the autocorrelation domain called SMC [1] and OSALPC [2] have shown good results using speech contaminated by additive white noise. The aim of this paper is twofold: to compare several techniques based on an AR modelling in the autocorrelation domain, including SMC and OSALPC, and to find the optimum model order and cepstral <b>liftering</b> <b>for</b> noisy conditions.
