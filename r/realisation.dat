5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its <b>realisation.</b> The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made.

40|$|We discuss new <b>realisations</b> of $W$ algebras {{in which}} the {{currents}} are {{expressed in terms of}} two arbitrary commuting energy-momentum tensors together with a set of free scalar fields. This contrasts with the previously-known <b>realisations,</b> which involve only one energy-momentum tensor. Since <b>realisations</b> of non-linear algebras are not easy to come by, the fact that this new class exists is of intrinsic interest. We use these new <b>realisations</b> to build the corresponding $W$-string theories and show that they are effectively described by two independent ordinary Virasoro-like strings.

40|$|Motivated by the {{importance}} of symplectic isotropic <b>realisations</b> {{in the study of}} Poisson manifolds, this paper investigates the local and global theory of contact isotropic <b>realisations</b> of Jacobi manifolds, which are those of minimal dimension. These arise naturally when considering multiplicity-free actions in contact geometry, as shown in this paper. The main results concern a classification of these <b>realisations</b> up to a suitable notion of isomorphism, as well as establishing a relation between the existence of symplectic and contact isotropic <b>realisations</b> for Poisson manifolds. The main tool is the classical Spencer operator which is related to Jacobi structures via their associated Lie algebroid, which allows to generalise previous results as well as providing more conceptual proofs for existing ones...|$|R

Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that $W$ algebras can be {{realised}} in terms of an energy-momentum tensor together with additional free scalar fields. Some recent results have shown that more general <b>realisations</b> are also possible. In this paper, we consider a wide class of <b>realisations</b> that may be obtained from the Miura transformation, related to the existence of canonical subalgebras of the Lie algebras on which the $W$ algebras are based. We give explicit formulae for all <b>realisations</b> of this kind, and discuss their applications in $W$-string theory. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

Proposed additional conditions on creating digraphs representations allow faster creation of representations by restricting the creations of representations that are not proper and would have to be removed in later steps of algorithm.

5|$|The Partisan {{attack on}} the camp and their liberation of a {{significant}} number of children brought the Ustaše to the <b>realisation</b> that this and similar camps for children could not be maintained. In late October 1942, 500 of the remaining children were dispersed to families in the surrounding villages by the Catholic aid group, Caritas. A total of 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages. Of the remaining children, 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška. The Jastrebarsko camp was then dismantled.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little <b>realisation</b> by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his <b>realisation</b> that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E
