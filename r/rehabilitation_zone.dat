The conflict has been taking place between MBNP and the people who live around the forest area (Wonoasri, Sanenrejo, Andongrejo, Curahnongko, and Kandangan) since 1998. The purpose of this research is to know the history of land {{conflict in}} Meru Betiri National Park and the impact of land rehabilitation on farmer's income This study was conducted in 2016. Qualitative research was conducted to obtain the historical information of MBNP land conflict and the survey was done to collect data of contribution of cultivation activities in the rehabilitation land (conflict area) on the income of farmers. The forest land conflict took place due to the vacant authority of the central government in 1998 which spread to the local government, so the government is not able to control the illegal harvesting of forest resources and forest area encroachment conducted by the public. In 1999, the local politicians of Indonesian Democratic Party proposed to the Ministry of Forestry in order the conflicted area of MBNP can be cultivated by the people around the area. In 2000, The Forestry Minister issued regulations stated that the assigned land is a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>zone.</b> The <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>zone</b> must be planted with Multiple Purposes Tree Species (MPTS) and seasonal crops by using agroforestry system. The purpose of MPTS planting is for reforestation and the seasonal crops plantation is addressed for increasing the income of the farmers.   After implementing the program for 15 years, the income generated from the rehabilitation land only Rp. 3, 517, 100,- (US $ 1 = Rp. 13, 400,-) per year or 14, 49 % of the total income of the farmers.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Many {{research}} studies have characterized the primary productivity of tropical forests {{and contributed to}} highlighting the complexity of underlying drivers of the ecological system. However, few studies have explored how productivity changes across multiple scales and how the drivers controlling productivity might differ depending on climatic and edaphic factors. Most know that modeling of the earth's surface using remote sensing within a geospatial format {{is limited by the}} spatial resolution of the technology and also the relative small temporal resolution of forestry inventory information. However even when we construct our models from this information knowing errors have probably been incorporated, we have a tendency to overlook those limitations because we generally don't have access to information containing fewer errors. This is especially critical to remember and understand when trying to model a system which is not completely understood or where robust information may not exist. Therefore it is helpful to be able to identify any critical thresholds of productivity so that one can determine when tipping points may occur in complex ecosystems. Determining the critical thresholds and tipping points for productivity would therefore allow us to then recognize the empirical indicators that may trigger a system or its components to shift from one state to another. This would then allow us to better understand the heterogeneity that exits in productivities at the local scales. To search for potential thresholds and tipping points for productivity across scales, a study was designed to search for any relationships between empirical productivity data from tropical forest studies and other parameters such as climatic and edaphic variables. This study used the tools provided by meta-analysis, spatial modeling and quantification of human impacts at the local level to identify which combination of variables might reveal potential thresholds of the productivity. The performance of these variables was then used within a modeling environment to understand the underlying assumptions and how forest cover at the local scale is impacted by anthropogenic activities in relation to policy implementations. At the global level those variables that best explain the spatial heterogeneity of total productivities at plot scales was based on using a meta-analysis of aggregated field data from 96 natural forests from the American, Asian and African tropics. These data suggested that 73 % of the variance in total net primary productivity (NPPt) could be explained by different combinations of four variables: soil-order, soil-texture, precipitation group and mean air temperature. If variations in NPPt by soil order, soil texture, precipitation group, and mean air temperature are not factored into modeling activities, regional estimates could over- or under-estimates total productivity potentials. At the regional level, underlying assumptions about a modeling environment were tested to determine how 20, 15, 10, five and one-km sampling resolutions using different occupancy selection criteria altered the distribution and importance of input variables as well as which variables were significant within the prediction model. Variances explained by predictive models were similar across cell sizes although relative importance of variables differed by sampling resolution. Partial dependence plots were used to search for potential thresholds or tipping points of NPP change as affected by an independent variable such as minimum daytime temperature. Applying different cell occupancy selection rules significantly changed the overall distribution of NPP values. Finally, policy additionality was measured by investigating anthropogenic activities within the Mount Halimun Salak National Park in reducing deforestation by implementing spatially explicit use zones. Results showed that for the period 2003 - 2013, strict conservation areas had a 6. 2 % lower rate of deforestation relative to all other use zones combined. The relative rate of deforestation was higher in the Special Research & Training zone, which is a designated area for local communities to acquire livelihood resources.

40|$|Background: In our Institute, {{most of the}} {{patients}} treated for hand injuries were industrial workers with poor compliance. For <b>rehabilitation</b> after <b>zone</b> II flexor tendon repair, we had tried various early mobilization protocols. As these protocols demanded a degree of commitment from {{the patients}}, our results were suboptimal. Hence, to improve the results, we implemented a new rehabilitation protocol by administering the pulsed ultrasound therapy during the early phase of tendon healing. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study done {{over a period of}} five years from January 2008 to January 2013. A total of 100 patients and 139 digits with zone II flexor tendon injuries were studied. After randomization, we administered pulsed ultrasound therapy of different frequencies and intensities for a total of 72 patients and 99 digits and formulated three groups. The results of ultrasound treated cases were compared {{with each other and with}} the results of cases treated by immobilization protocol. The results were analyzed using ′Original Strickland′ criteria. Results: 72 % excellent-good results in ultrasound (Group 1) protocol, 75 % excellent-good results in ultrasound (Group 2) protocol, and 77 % excellent-good results in ultrasound (Group 3) protocol were achieved. There was no case of rupture in the first two groups. The rupture rate was 7 % in ultrasound (Group 3) protocol. Only 25 % excellent-good results were obtained in the immobilization protocol.

The National Academy of Sciences/National Academy of Engineering Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface Mined for Coal in the Western United States produced a 1973 report that introduced the term, finding:In each zone the probability of rehabilitating an area depends upon the land use objectives, the characteristics of the site, the technology available, and the skill with which this technology is applied. At the extremes, if surface mined lands are declared national sacrifice areas, all ecological zones have a high probability of being successfully rehabilitated. If, however, complete restoration is the objective, <b>rehabilitation</b> in each <b>zone</b> has no probability of success.Similarly in 1975, Genevieve Atwood wrote in Scientific American:Surface mining without reclamation removes the land forever from productive use; such land can best be classified as a national sacrifice area.

Rhizosphere samples were collected from two of three plant species common to all sites; Eragrostis curvula, Atriplex semibaccata and Cynodon dactylon, {{as well as from}} bare areas, in order to allow comparisons across all site categories because of the rarity of the grasses on the lower slope of NV dams.

There was no difference in total infectivity between North West and Free State substrata, but within regions, there were differences in infectivity between <b>rehabilitation</b> ages, between <b>zones,</b> and between rhizosphere and bare areas. Toepaddock substrata and veld soil produced the highest total infection levels overall. On both dams and veld, total arbuscular levels differed between rhizosphere and bare substrata, and the percentage of arbuscules (max. 15. 4 %) and vesicles (max. 22. 0 %) as a proportion of total infection structures was low. A low correlation between infectivity and total spore numbers was also found. Spore numbers and the numbers of viable spores increased with zone down the slimes dams to the veld, and also differed within zones between rhizosphere and bare substrata with marked interactive effects. Substratum organic matter (SOM) levels differed between regions, and between zones within the North West region increasing with distance down the slopes to the veld, and were strongly correlated with total spore numbers. Substratum pH values and most AMF parameters were positively correlated in the order of RV>OV>NV dams, indicating that natural colonization of acidic NV sites by AMF is at very low rates, and that AMF colonizing RV slopes are not surviving the transition from RV to OV, with the associated increase in acidity, conductivity and decline in plant cover. Substratum conductivity differed between zones in both regions, with minor interaction between region and zone, and was negatively correlated with pH, AMF infectivity and total spore numbers. Our findings demonstrate that the ameliorant effects of liming and irrigation on substratum pH and conductivity are short-lived, but despite the physico-chemical constraints, a significant measurable AMF inoculum potential does exist on all substrata. Amelioration of tailings with organic matter and use of acid and salt-tolerant AMF would be expected to contribute to more persistent AMF communities and vegetation on gold and uranium slimes dams...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the amount}} of {{riparian}} vegetation can vary significantly over large spatial extents, and this variation is influenced by an array of factors. Riparian vegetation is an important component of riverine ecosystems and acts as a filter for terrestrial runoff, a control on bank stability and a key habitat area. Following European settlement in New South Wales (NSW) Australia in the late 18 th century, extensive areas of floodplain and riparian vegetation were cleared to allow farming of the rich alluvial soil with close proximity to a water supply. As a result of broad scale vegetation clearing, the extent and connectivity of riparian vegetation suffered. Increased awareness of the role played by a healthy riparian zone resulted in the legislated cessation of riparian vegetation clearing in the 20 th and early 21 st centuries. To counteract the post-settlement land clearing, the monitoring, revegetation and rehabilitation of these areas has become increasingly important for state and federal governments. This study assessed the changes that have occurred in the levels of riparian vegetation along easterly flowing, coastal draining rivers of NSW over a 30 -year period. This study measured riparian vegetation density and coverage using Landsat Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery across 28 river catchments in eastern NSW, assessing 19, 750 km of channel length overall with the study area representing 2970 km 2 of riparian zone. The initial and final state images were composed of five-year averages from 1987 - 1991, and 2009 - 2015 representing change over two decades. Changes in the spatial extent of riparian vegetation between the two time periods were identified using an image differencing change detection method. GIS software was used to analyse the results of the change detection operation, with various tools implemented to assess the levels of positive and negative change occurring in all major catchments that drain to the eastern seaboard. Gross net change has been assessed in addition to a stratified analysis investigating the change relative to adjacent land use. Utilising a change detection threshold in the NDVI analysis to delineate between significant and non-significant change highlighted spatial patterns across the state. Positive or negative change above the threshold was interpreted as an increase or decrease in vegetation density. Average positive change for the catchments in the study area was 8. 6 %, negative change was 2. 5 %, but 89 % of the area investigated showed no NDVI change. Further analysis of the change detection results indicated that significant NDVI change was occurring most commonly in or alongside channels bordered by agricultural land. Different climates and land use types across the large spatial extent of the study area create a range of factors driving vegetation change with the study finding variations in streamflow, active conservation, restoration, and <b>rehabilitation</b> of riparian <b>zones</b> being the most influential...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} baseline {{information on}} the ecological processes involved in the recruitment and regeneration of riparian vegetation. As {{there has been a}} paucity of basic ecological studies on riparian vegetation in Australia, the project is broad in scope, and gives a general picture of the factors influencing, the regeneration of riparian vegetation and provides a starting point for more detailed work. The project focuses on factors determining recruitment events and the life history traits of particular species in a river in the cool temperate zone of south western Australia (Blackwood River) and on a river in the dry tropics of the Kimberley region of north-western Australia (Ord River). By studying two contrasting river systems in different climatic zones, the influence of the physical environment and biotic factors in vegetation persistence and recruitment in the riparian zone can be distinguished. This will contribute to providing an ecological basis for the rehabilitation and management of riparian vegetation in these types of systems. The structure of the vegetation on the Blackwood River consists of an overstorey dominated by Eucalyptus rudis, with a shrub understory at ungrazed sites and with annual species dominant in areas grazed by livestock. On the Ord River there is a much more diverse overstsorey and a species-poor understorey dominated by perennial grasses. Fencing to exclude stock, or to at least manage grazing, is a fundamental step towards achieving rehabilitation of degraded riparian sites where recruitment may be severely limited. Exclosure experiments in the Blackwood River show little improvement in recruitment after three years, with only minor increases in the occurrence and cover of native species. Establishment of these species may be difficult with the increase in abundance of exotic grasses and annual herbs which has occurred {{as a result of the}} absence of grazing. These results are however for the short-term and a much longer period is required to look at the vegetation dynamics and successional processes of these sites. In the riparian zone, regeneration of the vegetation from soil seedbanks is important for annual species of herbs and grasses but of only minor significance for perennial species. For perennial species, particularly the overstorey, direct seedfall from existing vegetation occurs, and enhanced dispersal by floating downstream with flood debris is a consequential recruitment mechanism. Hence, reproductive phenology of the four species monitored in this study appears to be well adapted to the hydrological regime on the respective rivers. Position in the riparian landscape where seedlings manage to establish is strongly related to environmental conditions that provide adequate moisture but protect seedlings from flooding. Historical flow records can be used to develop an understanding of the natural flow regime for a particular river which can then be related to patterns of vegetation development in terms of reproductive phenology, seedling establishment and population structure, as well as plant community patterns in the riparian zone. Variability in natural flow regimes, as a disturbance, can therefore be used in conjunction with other abiotic and biotic factors in developing a model of vegetation dynamics for the riparian zone. For example, the regime of intermittent high frequency large flood disturbances on the Ord River prevents the establishment of stable states of the vegetation and the ecosystem is characterised by long periods of transition between short-lived stable states. This riparian ecosystem is thus driven by physical (allogenic) processes rather than by vegetation successional (autogenic) processes. In contrast, lower energy seasonal flooding on the Blackwood River allows mature stands of trees to develop throughout the river profile. Recruitment is continual, although species can also respond to large flood events. This disturbance regime results in long periods of stable status with short periods of transition. The vegetation is thus subject to longer periods of autogenic processes and, because of lower frequency flooding disturbance, shorter periods of allogenic processes. These results highlight the effect of the different fluvial regimes of the two rivers on the respective vegetation dynamics. Management of the riparian vegetation should therefore take into account the frequency and rate of change in the vegetation and that disturbed states and long periods of transition between states, particularly on the Ord River, are part of the natural process. This would suggest that altering the natural flow regimes, such as through river regulation, would have significant effects on riparian vegetation dynamics. This work has relevance to all aspects of riparian zone vegetation, including management of natural systems unaffected by man-made disturbances, for systems affected by stock grazing, for areas requiring rehabilitation and on regulated rivers. It highlights the importance of fluvial processes to riparian vegetation and indicates that understanding the natural flow regime of a target river is a critical first step in the management of riparian vegetation and in the planning of riparian vegetation <b>zone</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Where the riparian zone is highly modified, through, for example, livestock grazing and/or weed invasion, natural regeneration of the riparian vegetation may be a long term process. If intervention, such as replanting, is appropriate, care should be taken that species selected are adapted to particular site conditions, such as flooding regime, landscape position and river geomorphology...|$|R
40|$|Intermittent {{streams and}} flat sandy {{catchments}} are common throughout the world. In south Western Australia, Ellen Brook provides a model landscape {{for the study}} of water quality issues associated with managing flat sandy coastal catchments, where the highly permeable sands have limited capacity to intercept and store nutrients arising from agricultural activity. Revegetating riparian zones is universally used as a best-management practice to intercept nutrients and improve stream condition. However, the riparian zone can only be effective in nutrient removal if there is interaction between runoff and riparian vegetation. Key elements driving this interaction are slope, providing flow through the riparian zone and a mechanism for uptake and storage of nutrients (e. g. reactive soils). In addition, riparian vegetation is known to provide a suite of environmental benefits, however, there is little information on the influence of riparian vegetation on in-stream biota of intermittent streams. The questions posed in this thesis are 1) can vegetated riparian zones effectively ameliorate nutrient inputs in flat sandy catchments (no slope and unreactive soils) and 2) do riparian zones on intermittent streams in flat sandy catchments influence in-stream biological communities? This thesis compares hydrology and nutrient dynamics between an intermittent stream in a flat sandy landscape (Bingham Creek) and a perennial stream in a nearby landscape with slope and reactive soils (Lennard Brook). Nutrient stores within groundwater, soil and vegetation were analysed. A column experiment was undertaken to determine how the vertical rise and fall of groundwater affected nutrient dynamics in paddock and riparian soils and compared the effect of nutrient addition from fertiliser and cow manure. The thesis also examined the ecological condition of riparian vegetation and its influence on in-stream biota amongst a wider range of intermittent and perennial streams in this catchment. In flat sandy catchments, the lack of slope and unreactive soils reduced the capacity for riparian vegetation to intercept and store nutrients. The dominant flow path was the vertical rise and fall of groundwater in response to rainfall, which limited the interaction of groundwater with the active root zone of riparian soils, reducing the potential for nutrient assimilation. However, slow (0. 23 - 0. 3 m/day) horizontal groundwater flow through riparian zone, results in extended residence times (106 - 141 days), allowed nutrient transformations to occur. Riparian and paddock soils at Bingham Creek had a poor nutrient holding capacity, resulting in nutrients being stored in the groundwater (e. g. filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) 48 - 600 μg/L- 1) and not the soil (e. g. 4 - 510 mg. P/kg). Whereas at Lennard Brook the improved soil characteristics (increased iron oxides and clay) provided a greater opportunity for nutrient interception and storage by the soils (e. g. 29 - 1037 mg. P/kg) and groundwater flow to the stream was low in phosphate (e. g. FRP 10 - 74 μg/L- 1). The riparian vegetation had a similar community structure at both sites and contributed comparable amounts of litterfall (369 and 404 g/m 2) and nutrients per unit area (0. 8 - 1. 5 and 0. 5 - 1 mg. P/m 2) at Bingham Creek and Lennard Brook, respectively. This enhanced the organic matter content of underlying riparian soils that in turn slowed the rate of water movement (paddock 0. 08 - 0. 7 L/hr, riparian 0. 04 - 0. 24 L/hr), improved the phosphorus binding capacity of the soil and promoted loss of mineral nitrogen, probably by denitrification. However, the increased carbon content also supported a greater microbial community and the input of extra nutrients (including labile carbon) increased microbial respiration, leading to release of iron-bound phosphorus into groundwater. In the Ellen Brook catchment, flow regime (Global R = 0. 444, P < 0. 001) and the presence/absence of riparian vegetation (Global R = 0. 407, P < 0. 001) were the most influential factors associated with invertebrate assemblage composition. On average there were more invertebrate families in vegetated (30 ± 1. 4) streams than unvegetated (27 ± 3. 2) streams. Riparian vegetation helped shape and improve in-stream biological communities through the provision of organic matter for food and habitat and by limiting algal growth in stream water through shading. This was illustrated by a higher proportion of algal grazers (Chironominae and Physidae) in unvegetated streams and more detrital feeders (Leptoceridae, Gripopterygidae, Ceinidae) in vegetated streams. A conceptual model of hydrology and nutrient dynamics for riparian zones in flat sandy catchments was developed, which describes the key points of difference to the hydrological and nutrient dynamics in sloped catchments with reactive soils. Riparian vegetation appears to be acting similarly between catchment types but the capacity for riparian zones to remove nutrients in flat sandy catchments is limited due to soil type and hydrology. However, in these catchments, riparian zones are also the only sink contributing to a reduction in nutrient export from the catchment and so still have value in regulating nutrient dynamics. Clearly, riparian vegetation alone across the catchment alone cannot stem the flow of nutrients in flat sandy catchments. Instead, a multi-pronged approach is required to reduce nutrient export and improve the nutrient holding capacity of soils. Furthermore, riparian vegetation helps maintain and improve in-stream biological communities in intermittent and perennial streams in sandy catchments with low relief. Overall, riparian vegetation increased the retention of nutrients, improved soils and in-stream biodiversity, warranting the protection and <b>rehabilitation</b> of riparian <b>zones</b> in flat sandy catchments...|$|R
