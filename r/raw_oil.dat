25|$|In Norway in 2004, only Rieber {{worked with}} {{sealskin}} and seal oil. In 2001, the biggest producer of raw seal oil was Canada (two {{percent of the}} <b>raw</b> <b>oil</b> was processed and sold in Canadian health stores). Rieber had the majority of all distribution of raw seal oil in the world market, {{but there was no}} demand for seal oil. From 1995 to 2005, Rieber annually received between 2 and 3 million Norwegian krone in subsidy. A 2003–2004 parliamentary report says CG Rieber Skinn is the only company in the world that delivers skin from bluebacks. Most of the skins processed by Rieber have been imported from abroad, mainly from Canada. Only a small portion is from the Norwegian hunt. Of the processed skin, five percent is sold in Norway; the rest is exported to the Russian and Asian markets.|$|E

In this work the mild HDO at 250  °C was deeply investigated and it was shown that nickel-based catalysts could be promising for the hydrotreatment process of <b>raw</b> pyrolysis <b>oils.</b> Ru/C is still superior but too expensive and rare. A phase separation into polar and apolar molecules took place which favors a densification of energy and an isolation of platform molecules.

The used metal-oxide carrier had a minor influence. The nickel-based catalysts showed all a similar HDO activity, only NiCu/Al 2 O 3 had a slightly better performance.|$|R

For this purpose, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and {{linear discriminant analysis}} (LDA) coupled with the successive projections algorithm (SPA) have been employed to build screening models using three different optical paths and the following spectra ranges: 1. 0 mm (8814 – 3799 cm− 1), 10 mm (11, 329 – 5944 cm− 1 and 5531 – 4490 cm− 1) and 20 mm (11, 688 – 5952 cm− 1 and 5381 – 4679 cm− 1). The method is validated in a case study involving the classification of 140 diesel/biodiesel blend samples, which were divided into four different classes, namely: diesel free of biodiesel and <b>raw</b> vegetal <b>oil</b> (D), blends containing diesel, biodiesel and <b>raw</b> <b>oils</b> (OBD), blends of diesel and <b>raw</b> <b>oils</b> (OD), and blends containing a fraction of 5 % (v/v) of biodiesel in diesel (B 5).

40|$|As an {{alternative}} fuel for compression ignition engines, plant oils are in principle renewable and carbon-neutral. However, their use raises technical, {{economic and environmental}} issues. A comprehensive and up-to-date technical review of using both edible and non-edible plant oils (either pure or as blends with fossil diesel) in CI engines, based on comparisons with standard diesel fuel, has been carried out. The properties of several plant oils, {{and the results of}} engine tests using them, are reviewed based on the literature. Findings regarding engine performance, exhaust emissions and engine durability are collated. The causes of technical problems arising from the use of various oils are discussed, as are the modifications to oil and engine employed to alleviate these problems. The review shows that a number of plant oils can be used satisfactorily in CI engines, without transesterification, by preheating the oil and/or modifying the engine parameters and the maintenance schedule. As regards life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas emission analyses, these reveal considerable advantages of <b>raw</b> plant <b>oils</b> over fossil diesel and biodiesel. Typical results show that the life-cycle output-to-input energy ratio of <b>raw</b> plant <b>oil</b> is around 6 times higher than fossil diesel. Depending on either primary energy or fossil energy requirements, the life-cycle energy ratio of <b>raw</b> plant <b>oil</b> is in the range of 2 – 6 times higher than corresponding biodiesel.
