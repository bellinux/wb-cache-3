40|$|Induced {{mutagenesis}} can be {{an effective}} way to increase variability in self-pollinated crops {{for a wide variety of}} agronomically important traits. Crop resistance to a given herbicide can be of practical value to control weeds with efficient chemical use. In some crops (for example, wheat, maize, and canola), resistance to imidazolinone herbicides (IMIs) has been introduced through mutation breeding and is extensively used commercially. However, this production system imposes plant-back restrictions on <b>rotational</b> <b>crops</b> because of herbicide residuals in the soil. In the case of barley, a preferred <b>rotational</b> <b>crop</b> after wheat, a period of 9 – 18 mo is required. Thus, introduction of barley varieties showing resistance to IMIs will provide greater flexibility as a <b>rotational</b> <b>crop.</b> The objective of the research reported was to identify resistance in barley for IMIs through induced mutagenesis. To achieve this objective, a sodium azide-treated M 2 /M 3 population of barley cultivar Bob was screened for resistance against acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) -inhibiting herbicides. The phenotypic screening allowed identification of a mutant line showing resistance against IMIs. Molecular analysis identified a single-point mutation leading to a serine 653 to asparagine amino acid substitution in the herbicide-binding site of the barley AHAS gene. The transcription pattern of the AHAS gene in the mutant (Ser 653 Asn) and WT has been analyzed, and greater than fourfold difference in transcript abundance was observed.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to determine the persistence of imazapic at two Texas locations. Field studies were conducted at Yoakum and Stephenville, Texas. Imazapic was applied to peanuts in 1998 at 0, 70, 140, and 210 g/ha. These rates represent 0, 1, 2, and 3 X the labeled use rate in peanuts, respectively. In 1999, IR corn, conventional corn, cotton, grain sorghum and soybean were planted into the treated plots and were evaluated for carryover injury. Data collected to determine injury included stand counts, plant heights, and plant dry weights. To accurately assess carryover injury to the <b>rotational</b> <b>crops,</b> imazapic rates ranging from 2 to 35 g/ha were applied preemergence to the five <b>rotational</b> <b>crops</b> during 1999 to form standard curves. Soil samples were taken from the carryover plots throughout the year and were used in a controlled-condition bioassay to determine the amount of plant available herbicide remaining in the soil over time. A laboratory incubation study was performed on three Texas peanut-growing soils at two moisture contents. Soils were incubated for 0, 30, 60, 150, and 300 d at 30 C and then imazapic was chemically extracted and quantified using solid-phase extraction (SPE) high performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) equipped with a photodiode array detector. All field data from both locations showed no significant carryover injury to any <b>rotational</b> <b>crop</b> from any of the imazapic rates. Controlled-condition bioassay data indicated no significant reduction of fresh weight of grain sorghum or cotton from soil collected three months after treatment. These data support field data and the conclusion that up to a 3 X rate of imazapic did not cause carryover injury to five rotation crops planted the following year. Results from the incubation study showed similar rates of dissipation for the three soils. However, dissipation rate increased with increasing soil moisture indicating that soil moisture is a critical factor contributing to herbicide persistence...|$|R

Studies were conducted in Oregon and Washington to examine the soil persistence and activity of these herbicides on alfalfa <b>rotational</b> <b>crops.</b> Norflurazon at 1. 6 and 2. 4 lb ai/a and prodiamine at 1. 0 and 2. 0 lb ai/a were applied during the fall of 1987 or spring of 1988 in Oregon and Washington. Soil samples were collected from plots treated with the highest herbicide rate when <b>rotational</b> <b>crops</b> were planted and again at harvest during 1988 and 1989. These samples were chemically analyzed for herbicide residues. <b>Rotational</b> <b>crops</b> were planted 3 and 15 months after treatment (MAT) in the spring-applied sites and 6 and 18 MAT in the fall-applied site to assess {{the activity of the}} herbicides. For both soils and application timings, dissipation of norflurazon and prodiamine was characterized by a rapid initial loss followed by slow disappearance of the remaining herbicide. The logarithm of herbicide loss was a linear function of days after treatment (DAT). The rate of norflurazon loss was not different among locations. Degradation of prodiamine tended to be slowest in the fall-applied site in Washington, followed in turn by the springapplied site in Washington and the Oregon site (p = 0. 25). Relative crop sensitivity to norflurazon, ranked from most sensitive, was barley > spring wheat > field corn > potatoes > and beans. Crop sensitivity to prodiamine was ranked as field corn > barley > spring wheat > potatoes > and beans. Injury to barley and spring wheat planted 18 MAT resulted from residues of norflurazon applied at the high rate. Field corn and potatoes were injured significantly only when planted 3 and 5 MAT. No significant norflurazon injury was observed to beans during any planting interval. Prodiamine caused injury to field corn, barley, and spring wheat when planted 18 MAT. No injury to potatoes and beans was observed during any planting interval. Prodiamine was more toxic to susceptible crops at the low concentrations than norflurazon. Severe corn injury resulted from prodiamine residues of 0. 01 ppm at all locations. The norflurazon and prodiamine residues from chemical analyses corresponded well with the observed injury from each of the plant-back species when soil characteristics were considered. Similar amounts of norflurazon and prodiamine residues were detected in the fall- and spring-applied sites in Washington during the 3 and 5 MAT sample interval. However, spring wheat and potato injury were greater in the fall-applied trial.
