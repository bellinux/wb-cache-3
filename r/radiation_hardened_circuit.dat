As the standard effort progressed, implementation in Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) was initiated for high throughput applications. Eventually, a <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>circuit</b> was fabricated to function at over 20 Msamples/sec. Implementation of new technologies into space missions has always met resistance. The mentality of “If it works, why needs change? ” prevails in aerospace community. The notion of “not-invented-here”, or otherwise known as NIH disease further hampers progress. The first real mission application at GSFC of the lossless standard was for a small explorer, the Sub-millimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS- 1999) that needed to overcome insufficient onboard storage capacity. Subsequent mid-class explores for space science missions, Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE- 00), Microwave Anisotropic Probe (MAP- 01), followed. These implementations are all software based. Migration of new standards and technologies into larger class space missions is shown to be even more difficult. Until today, none of the launched NASA Earth observing missions has lossless compression onboard. The delay {{can be attributed to the}} long development time of larger class missions, th...|$|E
40|$|Space {{exploration}} and {{the rapid growth}} of the satellite communications industry has promoted substantial research into the effects of ionising radiation on modem electronic technology. The enabling electronics and computer processing has seen a commensurate growth in the use of radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in medicine. Numerous studies exist in both these fields but an analysis combining the fields of study to ascertain the effects of radiation on medically implantable electronics is lacking. A review of significant ground level radiation sources is presented with particular emphasis on the medical environment. Mechanisms of permanent and transient ionising radiation damage to Metal Oxide Semiconductors are summarised. Three significant sources of radiation are classified as having the ability to damage or alter the behavior of implantable electronics; Secondary neutron cosmic radiation, alpha particle radiation from the device packaging and therapeutic doses of high energy radiation. With respect to cosmic radiation, the most sensitive circuit structure within a typical microcomputer architecture is the Random Access Memory(RAM). A theoretical model which predicts the susceptibility of a RAM cell to single event upsets from secondary cosmic ray neutrons is presented. A previously unreported method for calculating the collection efficiency term in the upset model has been derived along with an extension of the model to enable estimation of multiple bit upset rates. An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator is used as a case example to demonstrate model applicability and test against clinical experience. The model correlates well with clinical experience and is consistent with the expected geographical variations of the secondary cosmic ray neutron flux. This is the first clinical data set obtained indicating the effects of cosmic radiation on implantable devices. Importantly, it may be used to predict the susceptibility of future implantable device designs to cosmic radiation. The model is also used as a basis for developing <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>circuit</b> techniques and system design. A review of methods to radiation harden electronics to single event upsets is used to recommend methods applicable to the low power/small area constraints of implantable systems...|$|E

40|$|Digital Radio Frequency Memories (DRFM) {{are widely}} used as modules in digital signal processing. These modules can provide several forms of signal {{manipulation}} and storage capabilities. With single event effects caused by environmental radiation {{the need for a}} <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> DRFM is increased. Typical <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> involves the use of specialized foundries utilizing proprietary CMOS libraries that are expensive to build or adding lead packages around a chip that is expensive and add weight to the chip. An alternative <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> technique is to utilize a <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> by design library. This library includes digital gates that have been hardened by the use of guard rings, reverse body bias or other methods. With the use of the hardened library, commercial synthesis tools can create a structural Verilog output from the behavioral VHDL design. The <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> by design <b>circuit</b> will be larger than a non-hardened design, but can be fabricated using standard foundries. This research also takes advantage of current advancements of commercially available software and designs that have led to a structured ASIC approach for fabricating a design. This structured ASIC approach fabricates a design in two stages. The first stage is the transistor and bottom metal layers with the second stage being the top metal layers. Silicon wafers can be fabricated in bulk using the first stage of uncommitted logic with separate top metal layer masks applied to commit the logic to a specific design. A <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> by design standard cell library was used to create the Structured ASIC standard cells and will allow production of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>circuits</b> with a short design time. For this research, a generic frequency shifting DSSM is proposed that targets a <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> by design Structured ASIC to deliver performance in processing as well as <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> at both the transistor level and gate level. This research produces a parameterizable DSSM VHDL design that can be easily modified to produce a DSSM with various signal processing and storage capabilities with minimal modifications. The designed DSSM was tested on an FPGA board for prototyping, but was ultimately targeted for the <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> by design structured ASIC. The design created through this research was compared to a non-hardened DSSM using a similar CMOS process for area, power, speed and Spur Free Dynamic Range...|$|R

Gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor technology is highly desirable for these applications because it consumes less power at higher speeds than silicon (Si) and shows superior radiation hardness over silicon technologies except for Single-Event-Upset (SEU). This thesis examines GaAs MESFETs fabricated in the Vitesse H-GaAsIII(R) process utilized in Direct Coupled FET Logic (DCFL) inverters. These simulations are targeted at determining the vulnerability of these devices to SEU. MESFETs fabricated on low-temperature grown GaAs (LT GaAs) epitaxial layers are investigated in addition to the conventional MESFET process using only bulk GaAs. Two- dimensional computer simulations are performed to determine the most effective method to simulate SEU charge collection mechanisms, and how effective the LT gaAs buffer layer is at reducing SEU vulnerability.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{radiation}} tolerant CMOS standard cell library, and demonstrate its effectiveness in implementing <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> digital <b>circuits.</b> We exploit {{the fact that if}} a gate is implemented using only PMOS (NMOS) transistors then a radiation particle strike can result only in logic a 0 to 1 (1 to 0) ip. Based on this observation, we derive our <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> gates from regular static CMOS gates. In particular, we separate the PMOS and NMOS devices, and split the gate output into two signals. One of these outputs of our radiation tolerant gate is generated using PMOS transistors, and it drives other PMOS transistors (only) in its fanout. Similarly, the other output (generated from NMOS transistors) drives only other NMOS transistors in its fanout. Now, if a radiation particle strikes one of the outputs of the radiation tolerant gate, then the gates in the fanout enter a high-impedance state, and hence preserve their output values. Our <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> gates exhibit an extremely high degree of SEU tolerance, which is validated at the circuit level. Using these gates, we also implement <b>circuit</b> level <b>hardening</b> based on logical masking, to selectively harden those gates in a circuit which contribute most to the soft error failure of the circuit. The gates with a low probability of logical masking are replaced by SEU tolerant gates from our new library, such that the digital design achieves a 90 % soft error rate reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that this reduction is achieved with a modest layout area and delay penalty of 62 % and 29 % respectively, for area mapped designs. In contrast with existing approaches, our approach results in SEU immunity for extremely large critical charge values (> 650 fC). I...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliable}} operation of Integrated Circuits (ICs) {{has become increasingly}} difficult to achieve in the deep sub-micron (DSM) era. With continuously decreasing device feature sizes, combined with lower supply voltages and higher operating frequencies, the noise immunity of VLSI circuits is decreasing alarmingly. Thus, VLSI circuits are becoming more vulnerable to noise effects such as crosstalk, power supply variations and radiation-induced soft errors. Among these noise sources, soft errors (or error caused by radiation particle strikes) have become an increasingly troublesome issue for memory arrays as well as combinational logic circuits. Also, in the DSM era, process variations are increasing at an alarming rate, {{making it more difficult}} to design reliable VLSI circuits. Hence, it is important to efficiently design robust VLSI circuits that are resilient to radiation particle strikes and process variations. The work presented in this dissertation presents several analysis and design techniques with the goal of realizing VLSI circuits which are tolerant to radiation particle strikes and process variations. This dissertation consists of two parts. The first part proposes four analysis and two design approaches to address radiation particle strikes. The analysis techniques for the radiation particle strikes include: an approach to analytically determine the pulse width and the pulse shape of a radiation induced voltage glitch in combinational circuits, a technique to model the dynamic stability of SRAMs, and a 3 D device-level analysis of the radiation tolerance of voltage scaled circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed techniques for analyzing radiation particle strikes in combinational circuits and SRAMs are fast and accurate compared to SPICE. Therefore, these analysis approaches can be easily integrated in a VLSI design flow to analyze the radiation tolerance of such <b>circuits,</b> and <b>harden</b> them early in the design flow. From 3 D device-level analysis of the radiation tolerance of voltage scaled circuits, several non-intuitive observations are made and correspondingly, a set of guidelines are proposed, which are important to consider to realize <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>circuits.</b> Two <b>circuit</b> level <b>hardening</b> approaches are also presented to <b>harden</b> combinational <b>circuits</b> against a radiation particle strike. These hardening approaches significantly improve the tolerance of combinational circuits against low and very high energy radiation particle strikes respectively, with modest area and delay overheads. The second part of this dissertation addresses process variations. A technique is developed to perform sensitizable statistical timing analysis of a circuit, and thereby improve the accuracy of timing analysis under process variations. Experimental results demonstrate that this technique is able to significantly reduce the pessimism due to two sources of inaccuracy which plague current statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) tools. Two design approaches are also proposed to improve the process variation tolerance of combinational circuits and voltage level shifters (which are used in circuits with multiple interacting power supply domains), respectively. The variation tolerant design approach for combinational circuits significantly improves the resilience of these circuits to random process variations, with a reduction in the worst case delay and low area penalty. The proposed voltage level shifter is faster, requires lower dynamic power and area, has lower leakage currents, and is more tolerant to process variations, compared to the best known previous approach. In summary, this dissertation presents several analysis and design techniques which significantly augment the existing work in the area of resilient VLSI circuit design...|$|R
