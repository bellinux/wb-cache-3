5|$|Murray had {{designed}} {{a car for}} the 1979 season called the BT47 that had a Chaparral 2J-type box <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> with twin variable geometry fans on the rear to maximize ground effect. The car was never built due to the FIA closing the loophole in the regulations for the 1979 season.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|At the tapered <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of {{the stomach}} and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity {{of the stomach}} makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E

5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle <b>rear</b> <b>end.</b> Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Sirex {{woodwasp}} {{are almost}} colourless and only have three stub-shaped pairs of sterna. They cut through host wood with their powerful mandibles. They have a pointed, dark tip at their <b>rear</b> <b>end,</b> which presses the drilling {{dust on the}} walls of the borehole. They closely resemble other larvae in the genus Sirex.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's <b>rear</b> <b>end.</b> The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E
5|$|On special occasions, such as Uposatha day, {{an orange}} stole is placed around its {{shoulders}} by the presiding monk and is fanned. A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men {{sit in the}} front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed. During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.|$|E
5|$|As no {{complete}} dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, {{is hard to}} determine. Illustrations {{and written}} accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its <b>rear</b> <b>end.</b> The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study {{of the few remaining}} feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the noise {{performance}} for the seat adjuster mechanism, noise and vibration measurements were conducted in both European and Australian cars for six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations on the driver's seat. The six modes of the driver's seat operations are: both up for the front and <b>rear</b> seat <b>ends,</b> both down for the front and <b>rear</b> seat <b>ends,</b> front seat end up, front seat <b>end</b> down, <b>rear</b> seat <b>end</b> up and <b>rear</b> seat <b>end</b> down. The eight modes of the seat operations are: forward, backward, both up for the front and <b>rear</b> seat <b>ends,</b> both down for the front and <b>rear</b> seat <b>ends,</b> front seat end up, front seat <b>end</b> down, <b>rear</b> seat <b>end</b> up and <b>rear</b> seat <b>end</b> down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and the root causes for the noise problems have been analysed and discussed for the six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations. The noise characteristics have been identified; the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify the sound quality of the seat adjuster and the assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with no changes in position. On the outside of turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E

5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|The drivers {{took the}} track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in wet weather, with lap times {{slower than the}} {{previous}} days' practice and qualifying sessions. Häkkinen maintained his good performance, setting a time of 2:03.392. Michael Schumacher was the second-fastest driver; Button was third, two-thousands of a second behind Schumacher. Barrichello completed the top four, three-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen. Giancarlo Fisichella struck the barriers heavily at turn 14 after spinning sideways and was launched into the air, landing upside-down; the session was suspended while marshals cleared the track of debris. Fisichella sustained a bruised left knee, {{and was forced to}} start the race with his team's spare car. Jacques Villeneuve damaged his car's <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> in a crash later in the session, but was able to continue.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{unfolding}} events {{seemed to}} {{have a negative impact on}} the cohesion between U.S. and South Vietnamese indigenous forces. The resolve of the South Vietnamese, Montagnard CIDG soldiers in particular, had apparently been shaken and they disobeyed an order to carry out a sweep operation at the <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the camp, and their Vietnamese commander even refused to leave his bunker to encourage the soldiers. The morale and discipline of the indigenous forces had sunk so low that they began to leave their defensive positions without permission, although their section of the camp was never subjected to a major ground attack. Consequently, the behavior of indigenous CIDG soldiers during the various stages of the battle, coupled with information that 'friendly' Montagnard soldiers had turned on U.S. Marines at Ngok Tavak, had the effect of unnerving U.S. Army soldiers in Khâm Đức. To ensure CIDG soldiers would not abandon their posts, U.S. soldiers threatened to shoot anyone attempting to run away.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:21.370, ahead of teammate Häkkinen who was two-tenths of a second slower. Ralf Schumacher (with a time of 1:21.604) was third quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher and Villeneuve. Fisichella and Frentzen followed in sixth and seventh. The two Arrows drivers were eighth and ninth (with Verstappen ahead of Pedro de la Rosa). Mika Salo rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session, Michael Schumacher used {{a new set of}} tyres and set the fastest time of 1:21.088; Coulthard finished with the second quickest lap. Barrichello was third fastest, in front of Häkkinen who struggled with a lack of grip and a loose <b>rear</b> <b>end.</b> Ralf Schumacher recorded the fifth fastest time. The Jordan drivers were sixth and seventh (with Trulli in front of Frentzen). de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
