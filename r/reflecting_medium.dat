Those that are averse from assenting to any new Discoveries, but such as they can explain by an Hypothesis, may for the present suppose, that as Stones by falling upon Water put the Water into an undulating Motion, and all Bodies by percussion excite vibrations in the Air; so the Rays of Light, by impinging on any refracting or reflecting Surface, excite vibrations in the refracting or <b>reflecting</b> <b>Medium</b> or Substance, and by exciting them agitate the solid parts of the refracting or reflecting Body, and by agitating them cause the Body to grow warm or hot; that the vibrations thus excited are propagated in the refracting or <b>reflecting</b> <b>Medium</b> or Substance, much after the manner that vibrations are propagated in the Air for causing Sound, and move faster than the Rays so as to overtake them; and that when any Ray is {{in that part of}} the vibration which conspires with its Motion, it easily breaks through a refracting Surface, but when it is in the contrary part of the vibration which impedes its Motion, it is easily reflected; and, by consequence, that every Ray is successively disposed to be easily reflected, or easily transmitted, by every vibration which overtakes it. But whether this Hypothesis be true or false I do not here consider. I content my self with the bare Discovery, that the Rays of Light are by some cause or other alternately disposed to be reflected or refracted for many vicissitudes.|$|E

And if the Ray at the point of Reflexion was in a Fit of easy Reflexion, the progression of the distances of these Fits from that point must begin from 0, and so be of the Numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And therefore the progression of the distances of the intermediate Fits of easy Transmission, reckon'd from the same point, must be in the progression of the odd Numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. contrary to what happens when the Fits are propagated from points of Refraction.|$|E

If a stone {{be thrown}} into stagnating Water, the Waves excited thereby {{continue}} {{some time to}} arise {{in the place where}} the Stone fell into the Water, and are propagated from thence in concentrick Circles upon the Surface of the Water to great distances. And the Vibrations or Tremors excited in the Air by percussion, continue a little time to move from the place of percussion in concentrick Spheres to great distances. And in like manner, when a Ray of Light falls upon the Surface of any pellucid Body, and is there refracted or reflected, may not Waves of Vibrations, or Tremors, be thereby excited in the refracting or <b>reflecting</b> <b>Medium</b> at the point of Incidence, and continue to arise there, and to be propagated from thence as long as they continue to arise and be propagated, when they are excited {{in the bottom of the}} Eye by the Pressure or Motion of the Finger, or by the Light which comes from the Coal of Fire in the Experiments above-mention'd? and are not these Vibrations propagated from the point of Incidence to great distances? And do they not overtake the Rays of Light, and by overtaking them successively, do they not put them into the Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission described above? For if the Rays endeavour to recede from the densest part of the Vibration, they may be alternately accelerated and retarded by the Vibrations overtaking them.|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{explore the}} {{performance}} of the time reversal approach in terms of temporal and spatial focussing in three different propagation environments: free space, partially <b>reflected</b> <b>medium</b> and fully <b>reflected</b> <b>medium.</b> Performance of the phase conjugation scheme is experimentally investigated in partially <b>reflected</b> <b>medium</b> and fully <b>reflected</b> <b>medium</b> based on the characteristics of focus sing and steering capabilities. We have explored numerically the E-field time evolution along the propagation path and the beam steering action of a 2. 45 GHz time reversal retrodirective array using dipole antennas excited by a I 0 nS 2. 45 GHz RP pulsed sinusoidal carrier. It is shown that temporal and spatially confined focussing can be achieved for a variety of different time reversal methods, un-modified, amplitude quantised and time decimated under sampled with a single transmitter and a receiver setup operating within a reverberation chamber at 2. 4 GHz under RP pulsed sinewave. Also it has been shown that, by introducing various size cluttering objects into the reverberant environment, the application of classical and differential time reversal methods does not significantly affect the spatio-temporal focus sing properties of the system. The possibility of deploying multiple transmitters inside the cavity is also briefly investigated. We have numerically demonstrated that temporal, spatial focussing and beam steering action can be achieved in free space using a slot array positioned in one wall of a metal air filled cavity utilizing a single antenna time reversal system. This presents an interesting possibility for a new type of beam steered array. The phase conjugation technique is an alternative to the time reversal method, which is suitable for monochromatic signals. Various phase conjugation implementation techniques have been developed for retrodirective array deployment this thesis employs a QUB developed IQ modulator based phase conjugator. It is experimentally shown that spatial localization of the field occurs within a radius of approximately 1. 5 - 2 A around the pilot source position using the single analogue phase conjugation unit operating at 2. 4 GHz for spatially confined data signaling in an enclosed highly reverberant multipath rich environment.

Validation results indicate that known profiles can be retrieved and that χ 2 tests upon retrieval parameters satisfy validity criteria.

The high quality hard X-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of the Compton reflection component {{for the first}} time in these sources. Using quasi-simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift/XRT data, as well as archival XMM-Newton data, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by Compton-thick material with column densities in excess of ~ 5 × 10 ^(24) cm^(− 2), and that their X-ray spectra above 3 keV are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum on Compton-thick material. Due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsic continuum components are not formally required by the data in any of the sources. We constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>medium</b> through the shape of the reflection spectra. Using archival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic X-ray luminosities consistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions.

The present spectrum is considerably different from several previous X-ray spectra recorded for PDS 456 since 1998. The ultra-high-velocity outflow seen as recently as February 2007 is not detected in absorption. Conversely, a significant reflection component is detected. The reflection model suggests the <b>reflecting</b> <b>medium</b> may be outflowing at a velocity v/c = - 0. 06 +/- 0. 02.

On the basis of observational data analyzed by us and collected from the literature, we study the temporal and spectral variability of the source in the optical/UV/X-ray bands and we propose a model that explains the spectrum emitted in this broad energy range. In this model, the intrinsic emission originating in the warm skin of the accretion disk is responsible for the spectral component that is dominant in the softest X-ray range. The shape of reflected spectrum as well as Fe K line detected in hard X-rays require the <b>reflecting</b> <b>medium</b> to be mildly ionized ({zeta} {approx} 500).

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{recently}} (Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 090504 (2011)) that entangled light with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations retrieves information from digital memory better than any classical light. In identifying this, a model of digital memory with each cell consisting of <b>reflecting</b> <b>medium</b> with two reflectivities (each memory cell encoding the binary numbers 0 or 1) is employed. The readout of binary memory essentially corresponds to discrimination of two Bosonic attenuator channels characterized by different reflectivities. The model requires an entire mathematical paraphernalia of continuous variable Gaussian setting for its analysis, when arbitrary values of reflectivities are considered. Here we restrict to a basic quantum read-out mechanism with non-Gaussian entangled states of light, with the binary channels to be discriminated being ideal memory characterized by reflectivity one i. e., an identity channel and thermal noise channel, where the signal light illuminating the memory location gets completely lost (zero reflectivity) and only a white thermal noise hitting the upper side of the memory reaches the decoder.

The purpose of this analysis is to establish the link between changes in the p-wave velocity in the reservoir, due to fluid substitution, and the critical distance (XC), a dynamic parameter. Two static parameters of the overburden are considered in the analysis: its thickness and its effective or equivalent P-wave velocity. Stochastic uncertainty analysis by means of Monte Carlo simulations was carried out to determine the sensitivity of XC to velocity contrast between that of the reservoir and the corresponding one to the overburden (incident medium). Results show that the effect of the velocity values in each medium, overburden and reservoir (<b>reflecting</b> <b>medium),</b> on estimates of XC depends on the velocity contrast between the two media. It turns out that the greater the velocity difference between the two media, the greater the effects associated with the reservoir P-wave velocity. On the other hand, the dependence of XC on overburden velocity (Vrms of the incident medium) is just the opposite. From the inversion viewpoint, predicting changes of the reservoir P-wave velocity from changes in critical distance is strongly dependent of the uncertainty in the initial estimate of the reservoir P-wave velocity, followed by degree of importance by the uncertainty in the overburden velocity. Other sources of uncertainty in this analysis turned out to be negligible. Geomechanical effects have not been accounted for in this analysis...|$|E
