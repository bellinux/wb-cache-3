40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{connections}} between broad indicators of economic conditions in the New York Metropolitan area and their national counterparts. Our examination provides two different views of the metropolitan economy. First, as is well known, employment growth in the region {{over the last seven}} years has been very poor, both in absolute terms and relative to the nation, suggesting a <b>region</b> <b>in</b> <b>decline.</b> On the other hand, the region's income growth has been considerably better, suggesting a region whose goods and services remain in healthy demand. Some methods of analyzing the data suggest that national and regional variables are more closely connected than they have been in a generation. Notwithstanding this, VAR analysis indicates that regional factors were the initial catalysts for the local recession in the 1990 s. However, this analysis also indicates that national developments, in particular the slow growth in employment following the 1990 - 91 recession, have been important factors behind the persistence of the local recession. This is unlike the experience of the 1970 s, when regional factors were primarily responsible for prolonging that recession. New York (N. Y.); Regional economics...|$|E

It compares {{the performance of the}} region in recent years with that of the nation and assesses the importance of national and local developments for the area’s economy.

For example, some of our evidence suggests that national and regional variables are more closely connected than they have been in thirty years. Notwithstanding this, our analysis also indicates that regional factors were the initial catalysts for the New York metropolitan area’s recession in the 1990 s, although national developments—in particular the slow growth in employment following the 1990 - 91 recession—were important factors behind the persistence of the local slump. We begin our investigation by examining the data on the metropolitan area’s employment and income and documenting their contrasting performances. We then present our statistical analysis of the interactions between the region and the nation. We conclude by placing our seemingly disparate findings into context.

Ideal MFA policy corrects market failures and is mostly amenity-augmenting. It has the capacity to enhance opportunities for farmers on urban fringe; stimulate growth <b>in</b> high-amenity rural <b>regions</b> accessible to cities that offer opportunities for high-value work; and generate growth in relatively remote high-amenity regions. The scope for market-failure-correcting MFA policy to propel economic growth <b>in</b> less-favored <b>regions</b> is limited – remoteness is non-responsive to policy in the short to medium term, and amenities that attract in-migration (e. g. proximity to sea, lakes, mountains, pleasant climate) are givens for favored locations but can at best be complemented by pro-active policy – but not trivial. While this paper focuses on regional economic growth, it well to remember that growth is not everything. Regions unlikely to experience growth need to create satisfying futures. Market-failure-correcting MFA policy has the potential to improve quality of life, well-being, and perhaps incomes in many if not all rural places regardless of location.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the characteristics, commonalities and contrasts between emerging and declining tourist destinations from a sustainable development perspective. This paper aims {{to contribute to}} current marketing theory relating to the sustainable management of destinations by investigating the influences of the regulatory (government structures), normative (value systems) and cognitive (social knowledge) dimensions on the activities of tourism entrepreneurs. Two regions are chosen {{as the basis for}} this research; Northern Ireland, a newly emerging tourism destination, and the Isle of Man, and well established tourism destination, which in recent years has moved into a stage of <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> terms of tourism. Tourism entrepreneurs encourage tourism development and destination competitiveness (Komppula 2014; Dwyer et al 2009), however this also requires the support of a range of stakeholders and government bodies (Bramwell and Sharman 2009; Hardy and Beeton 2001). Indeed, given that the tourism resources are often owned by various entities in many contexts, the need to achieve consensus in terms of tourism development can be a limiting factor (Jamal and Getz 1995). In addition, sustainability principles may be viewed differently, depending on the stage of development of the <b>region</b> <b>in</b> question (Canavan 2014; Hardy and Beeton 2009), <b>In</b> more advanced <b>regions,</b> tourism development may be ubiquitous and advantageous to locals; they understand and indeed have benefitted from tourism development. However, <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>decline</b> may find government has retreated from the development process, thereby sacrificing momentum in terms of strategic progress. <b>In</b> emerging <b>regions,</b> government may not have the knowledge or experience to support tourism development from a sustainable development perspective as institutional and sociocultural sustainability principles (Puhakka, Sarkki, Cottrell, Pirkko 2009) have not been established. Some regions may experience opposition to tourism development itself. Both scenarios depict a situation of poor governmental support, thereby demonstrating similarities, and possible opportunities for shared learning and practice. The research takes a qualitative approach, using case studies to provide rich and in-depth insights into two regions; one emergent (Northern Ireland) and one <b>in</b> <b>decline</b> (Isle of Man). In-depth interviews were carried out with a range of stakeholders, including local entrepreneurs and community associations. Findings are presented according to regulative, cognitive and normative dimensions. There are many similarities of emergent and declining destinations. Highlighted is the heightened importance of sustainable management in these contexts to avoid fragmentation, degradation and contestation.

40|$|Several regions {{across the}} EU, {{including}} the Netherlands, face {{the challenges of}} population decline, which entails changing demographics and related social and economic implications. Social ties are disrupted by continuous out-migration, causing a decrease in support systems which may adversely affect the liveability of an area. This paper looks into the connection between population decline and composition, {{and the level of}} new firm formation, in order to describe and analyse the relation between these variables. Although it is clear that fewer people will eventually lead to fewer (new) firms, we assess whether this inherent negative relationship differs across different degrees of population change and across regional contexts. Population <b>decline</b> occurs <b>in</b> different types of regional contexts which could also lead to different consequences. In this study, we distinguish between urban and rural areas in order to assess whether different regional contexts lead to distinct outcomes. In order to establish the impact of population decline on entrepreneurship, the paper examines data on population density, size, growth and decline, together with firm dynamics in the years 2003 till 2009 retrieved from the LISA database. In general, the results show that population growth is indeed positively related to the occurrence of entrepreneurship. When we assess different levels of population decline, we find that the relationship between population change and entrepreneurship holds most strongly for declining regions. This suggests that it will become more difficult for <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>decline</b> to maintain the same level of supply, affecting their autonomy and possibly the standard of living. Concerning the urban-rural dimension, urban regions will experience stronger impacts by population change. In conclusion, we find a clear distinction in the impact of the intensity of population change on new firm formation, particularly in the case of rural regions. Thus, the regional context and the severity of decline needs to be included in determining what kind of coping mechanism is needed when dealing with the consequences of decline.

These losses are an indication of increased temperatures which lead to snow loss via some combination of increased regularity of rain versus snow and increased melting during winter months. These natural variations make it challenging to quantify trends with confidence, to deduce observed changes to predict future climate, or to clearly detect changes in snow-pack due to human impact on warming trends.|$|R
50|$|The fynbos is {{the region}} of South Africa most {{affected}} by invasive alien species which collectively cover around 10% of the entire country. The most common invasive plants are wattles and hakeas, native to Australia, and pines native to Europe and the Californian coast of the United States. Pines had been introduced to South Africa by the 19th century and the wattles were imported into the mid-1870s to stabilize sand dunes. In 1997 {{it was estimated that}} invasion caused the fynbos <b>region</b> to <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> value by US$750 million per year.|$|R
