40|$|The Appellation of Origin {{system is}} aimed at {{reducing}} consumer's information costs, assuring a minimum quality standard and wine typicity, as well as maintaining a diversified supply {{in order to satisfy}} consumer s tastes heterogeneity. The effectiveness of the system is menaced by quantity and quality uncertainty, free riding phenomena, vertical relationships complexity and hold- up risks. The long term risk of the drop of the collective reputation of the Appellation justifies the economic regulation of the supply by the sectorial Organizations. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate ther role {{in the construction of the}} competitive advantage of the quality wine system. Then, the question that we address in this paper is that of the effectiveness of the supply regulation of quantity and quality in the Italian system of Appellation of Origin. We analyze the current context of the Italian Appellation of Origin Chianti Classico and the mechanisms of the supply economic regulation. At first, we describe the structural and commercial characteristics of the Appellation, the vertical relationships among the agents, the trend of the most important economic indicators of the Appellation.

Concerning the challenges that the current legal reality calls in the areas of information and communication to the tourist as well as the market organization in the provision of travel and tourism services.

40|$|The {{placenta}} {{has evolved}} in eutherian mammals primarily to provide nutrients for the developing fetus. The genetic {{control of the}} <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and demand for maternal nutrients is not understood. In this review we argue that imprinted genes have central roles in controlling both the fetal demand for, and the placental supply of, maternal nutrients. Recent studies on Igf 2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) knockout mouse models provide experimental support for this hypothesis. These show effects on placental transport capacity consistent with a role of IGF-II in modulating both the placental supply and fetal demand for nutrients. Imprinting of genes with such functions may have coevolved with the placenta and new evidence suggests that transporter proteins, {{as well as the}} regulators themselves, may also be imprinted. These data and hypotheses are important, as deregulation of supply and demand affects fetal growth and has long term consequences for health in mammals both in the neonatal period and, as a result of fetal programming, in adulthood...|$|E

40|$|Computational Grids, {{emerging}} as an infrastructure for next generation computing, enable the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed resources for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. As the {{resources in the}} Grid are heterogeneous and geographically distributed with varying availability {{and a variety of}} usage and cost policies for diverse users at different times and, priorities as well as goals that vary with time. The management of resources and application scheduling in such a large and distributed environment is a complex task. This thesis proposes a distributed computational economy as an effective metaphor for the management of resources and application scheduling. It proposes an architectural framework that supports resource trading and quality of services based scheduling. It enables the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and demand for resources and provides an incentive for resource owners for participating in the Grid and motives the users to trade-off between the deadline, budget, and the required level of quality of service. The thesis demonstrates the capability of economic-based systems for peer-to-peer distributed computing by developing users' quality-of-service requirements driven scheduling strategies and algorithms. It demonstrates their effectiveness by performing scheduling experiments on the World-Wide Grid for solving parameter sweep applications...|$|E

40|$|Thyroid hormone {{deprivation}} during fetal {{life has}} been implicated in neurodevelopmental morbidity. In humans, poor growth in utero is also associated with fetal hypothyroxinaemia. In guinea pigs, a short period (48 h) of maternal nutrient deprivation at gestational day (gd) 50 results in fetuses with hypothyroxinaemia and increased brain/body weight ratios. Thyroid hormone action is mediated by nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and is dependent upon the prereceptor <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> of triiodothyronine (T 3) by deiodinase enzymes. Examination of fetal guinea pig brains using in situ hybridization demonstrated widespread expression of mRNAs encoding TRα 1, α 2 and β 1, with regional colocalization of deiodinase type 2 (D 2) mRNA in the developing forebrain, limbic structures, brainstem and cerebellum at gd 52. With maternal nutrient deprivation, TRα 1 and β 1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in the male, but decreased in the female fetal hippocampus and cerebellum and other areas showing high TR expression under euthyroid conditions. Maternal nutrient deprivation resulted in elevated D 2 mRNA expression in males and females. Deiodinase type 3 (D 3) mRNA expression was confined to the shell of the nucleus accumbens, the posterior amygdalohippocampal area, brainstem and cerebellum, and did not change with maternal nutrient deprivation. In conclusion, maternal nutrient deprivation resulted in sex-specific changes in TR mRNA expression and a generalized increase in D 2 mRNAs within the fetal brain. These changes may represent a protective mechanism to maintain appropriate thyroid hormone action {{in the face of}} fetal hypothyroxinaemia in order to optimize brain development...|$|E
