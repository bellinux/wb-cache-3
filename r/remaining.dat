40|$|AbstractOptisol–GS {{storage medium}} allows donor corneas to <b>remain</b> viable {{until they are}} transplanted to cornea-blind recipients. In order to <b>remain</b> viable, the corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) must <b>remain</b> above 2 200 cells per mm 2. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine how long donor corneas may <b>remain</b> viable in Optisol-GS based on their ECD. Although our findings show that the ECD of corneas stored in Optisol-GS decreased steadily, it <b>remained</b> above the critical level of 2 200 cells per mm 2 for up to 9 days, suggesting that corneal buttons may <b>remain</b> viable for at least this amount of time...|$|R
