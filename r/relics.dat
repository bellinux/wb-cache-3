50|$|The reliquary {{could have}} arrived in Italy by the Crusaders in 1204, as many {{precious}} art pieces entered western Europe. It was also common that monks traveling west would give {{gifts to the}} monasteries. A theory of the <b>relic</b> being separated from the reliquary was due to its poor craftsmanship or creation by an immature student and was not worthy to house the true cross <b>relic.</b> The <b>relic</b> was taken out and worn on a necklace by Pope Innocent IV. Pope Innocent IV presented the <b>relic</b> to his new basilica, San Salvatore di Lavagna, in 1245 (where it still resides) and the box became an heirloom of the Fieschi Family. The <b>relic</b> and reliquary have never been put together.

5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his <b>relics</b> were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened {{at the spot where}} the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's <b>relics</b> were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the <b>relics</b> at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary <b>relics</b> that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The <b>relics</b> that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's <b>relics</b> were placed in their own shrine.|$|E

5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and <b>relics.</b> Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship.

50|$|However, {{when the}} Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb {{came to know}} of what had transpired, he had the <b>relic</b> seized {{and sent to the}} shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer, and had Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai imprisoned in Delhi for {{possessing}} the <b>relic.</b> Later, realizing his mistake, Aurangzeb decided to restore the <b>relic</b> to Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai and allowed him to take it to Kashmir. However, by that point, Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai had already died in imprisonment. In the year 1700, the <b>relic</b> finally reached Kashmir, along with the body of Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai. There, Inayat Begum, daughter of Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai, became a custodian of the <b>relic</b> and established the shrine.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Relic</b> density {{calculations}} {{are often}} used to constrain particle physics models, and in particular supersymmetry. In this paper, we will show {{that the presence of}} additional energy or entropy before the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis can however completely change the <b>relic</b> density constraints on the SUSY parameter space. Therefore one should be extremely careful when using the <b>relic</b> density to constrain supersymmetry as it could give misleading results, especially if combined with the future collider data. Alternatively, we will also show that combining the discoveries of the future colliders with <b>relic</b> density calculations can shed light on the inaccessible pre-BBN dark time physics. Finally we will present SuperIso <b>Relic,</b> a new <b>relic</b> density calculator code in Supersymmetry, which incorporates alternative cosmological models, and is publicly available...|$|R

5|$|By the mid-eighth century, Iona and Ireland had {{accepted}} Roman practices. Iona's {{place as the}} centre of Scottish Christianity was disrupted {{by the arrival of}} the Vikings, first as raiders, then as conquerors. Iona was sacked by Vikings 795 and 802. In 806 68 monks were killed and the next year the abbot withdrew to Kells in Ireland, taking the <b>relics</b> of St. Columba with him. There were periodic returns of abbots and <b>relics,</b> often ending in more massacres. Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and the Hebrides eventually fell to the Pagan Norsemen, curtailing the influence of the church in the Highlands and Islands. The threat posed by the Vikings may have forced a union between the kingdoms of Dál Riata and the Picts under Kenneth mac Alpin, traditionally dated to 843. In 849, according to the Annals of Ulster the abbot of Iona once again took Columba's <b>relics</b> to Ireland, but the earliest version of the Chronicles of the Kings of Scots says that in the same year they were removed by Kenneth mac Alpin, to a church he had built, probably at Dunkeld, perhaps indicating that the <b>relics</b> were divided.

5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization.

Monks are also used to collect relics; <b>relics</b> accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more <b>relics</b> are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all <b>relics</b> on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting.

5|$|In 1161, Edward the Confessor {{was made}} a saint, and objects {{connected}} with his reign became holy <b>relics.</b> The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity {{and that they were}} to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of <b>relics</b> drawn up by Richard Sporley, a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the holy communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold– all of which were to be considered precious <b>relics.</b> Although the claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey's part, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.|$|E
