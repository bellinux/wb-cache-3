40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{visibility}} and its breakdown by weather vocabulary. It discusses the development of <b>RVR</b> <b>systems</b> at airports in the Czech Republic, describes the measurement <b>systems</b> <b>RVR</b> MITRAS, MIDAS IV and history of selected airports. Other chapters describe the possible development of measurement techniques in RVR. The final section {{is devoted to the}} categories of runways...|$|R
5000|$|Today most {{airports}} use Instrumented Runway Visual Range or IRVR, {{which is}} measured by devices called forward scatter meters which provide simplified installation as they are integrated units and can be installed as single unit(s) at a critical location along the runway or transmissometers which are installed at {{one side of a}} runway relatively close to its edge. Normally three transmissometers are provided, one {{at each end of the}} runway and one at the midpoint. In the US, Forward Scatter RVRs are replacing transmissometers at most airports. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration: [...] "There are approximately 279 <b>RVR</b> <b>systems</b> in the NAS, of which 242 are forward scatter NG <b>RVR</b> <b>Systems</b> and 34 are older Transmissometer Systems." ...|$|R
50|$|Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning {{featured}} Mythic's Realm versus Realm (<b>RvR)</b> combat <b>system,</b> {{originally developed}} in Dark Age of Camelot. This took place within three different racial pairings: Dwarfs vs. Greenskins, Empire vs. Chaos, and High Elves vs. Dark Elves. Although {{there were only}} two races per pairing, players could travel to either of the other two pairings to help fight with their friends and allies. There were four types of RvR combat: Skirmishes (random world encounters), Battlefields (objective-driven battles in RvR-specific areas), Scenarios (instanced, point-based battles against the opposing faction), and Campaigns (invading enemy lands and capital cities). In RvR players fight other players and, to a lesser extent, non-player characters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{public-private}} partnership (PPP) has been acknowledged by many countries as an innovative {{approach to the}} procurement of public projects. In the long term of concession periods, Residual Value Risk (RVR) is a structured risk system which would happen {{at any time in}} the whole life before transfer of PPP/PFI projects, but consequently causes the Residual Value (RV) that the Government takes over cannot fulfill the specifications. So the <b>RVR</b> factor <b>system</b> was identified through the literature review and a worldwide structured questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the significance of the identified risk factors of RVR. Furthermore, the formation path of RVR was verified based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Through the proposed formation path of RVR, both the public sector and private sector can monitor the risks to help improve the implementation of PPP projects and achieve PPP project success...|$|R
2500|$|The {{ability to}} land in fog solved a major problem at London Heathrow and other British airports. Delays were commonplace when Category 1 (Cat 1 = [...] {{decision}} height and 600 metre runway visual range <b>RVR)</b> instrument landing <b>system</b> (ILS) was in use. The Trident's autoland system pioneered the use of lower landing minima, initially with Category 2 (100ft decision height and 400 metres RVR) and soon after [...] "zero-zero" [...] (Category 3C) conditions. Since Tridents could operate safely to airfields equipped with suitable ILS installations, they could operate schedules regardless of weather, while other aircraft were forced to divert.|$|R
40|$|A novel lidar {{technique}} for ozone measurements in clouds is proposed. An injection-locked XeCl excimer laser {{serves as the}} light source. The ozone molecule number density is calculated from the differential absorption of the antiStokes rotational Raman return signals from nitrogen and oxygen as the on-resonance and the vibrational-rotational Raman backscattering from nitrogen or oxygen as the off-resonance wavelength. Model calculations show that the main advantages of the new RVR Raman DIAL over a conventional Raman DIAL are a drastic reduction of the wavelength-dependent effects of particle scattering on the measured ozone concentration, an increase in temporal resolution, and reduced complexity of the apparatus. An <b>RVR</b> Raman DIAL <b>system</b> is presently under construction at GKSS. Its first application will be {{the study of the}} interaction of aerosol particles with ozone in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. (orig.) 12 refs.
