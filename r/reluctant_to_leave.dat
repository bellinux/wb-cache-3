5|$|Although Constantine was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> England, {{his poor}} health necessitated {{a return to}} Trinidad, {{but before he could}} do so he died of a heart attack, {{probably}} brought about by bronchitis, on 1 July 1971. His body was flown to Trinidad, where he received a state funeral before being buried in Arouca. He was posthumously awarded Trinidad's highest honour, the Trinity Cross. Later in the month, a memorial service was held in London in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1918, Baker {{received}} {{orders to}} return to the United States. <b>Reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> France and return to his life in America, he decided to take a final flight at his squadron's airfield in Toul. As he went for his own plane, the mechanic brought out a recently repaired one instead, in need of a test flight. The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he could not let anyone else test the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> having occupied the building for over 40 years.

50|$|Later in 1919, John Taylor, Labour MP for Chester-le-Street since 1906 and {{a friend}} of Lawson's, {{resigned}} his seat due to ill health. Though <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> risk <b>leaving</b> Durham and the colliery for London and Parliament, Lawson was persuaded to stand for Labour in the by-election.

5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss, Rona and Marietta Blau {{left the}} Radium Institute {{because of their}} Jewish {{heritage}} and the antisemitic persecution they experienced in the laboratory. Rona first returned to Budapest and worked in an industrial laboratory, but within a few months, the position was eliminated. She worked from October to December 1938 in Sweden, and then accepted a temporary position for one year at the University of Oslo, which had been offered by Gleditsch. <b>Reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her home, {{at the end of}} her year in Oslo, Rona returned to Hungary.

Watts is Black's initial mentor in the group, and they investigate cases together as partners. Although Watts' faith in the group is shaken when he discovers their responsibility for a deadly viral outbreak, he is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and fights Black's attempts to sabotage and expose the group's work. He convinces Emma Hollis to join the group, using a potential cure for her father's illness as leverage.

5|$|After {{a request}} from Army Group F to Himmler, a {{decision}} was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: the Bosnians were very <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.|$|E

Barley tells him that since his background was with the Clan, it made a difference. He also questions Ravenpaw's belonging in the barn which shocks and offends Ravenpaw. It also makes him think that maybe he does belong in the clans.|$|R

He helped Forest gain automatic promotion finishing {{second in}} the league, as Forest were promoted from League One to the Championship. At {{the end of the}} season, Colchester United who had just been relegated from the Championship had their £100k move for Lockwood accepted. Forest were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> let Lockwood <b>leave</b> but agreed <b>to</b> sell due to the players desire for guaranteed first team football.|$|R
5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, Baker was {{transferred}} to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before leaving for the front.|$|E

While in Israel, Katz served in the Israeli Defense Forces and studied politics, history, and Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University. As a {{committed}} Zionist, Katz was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>leave</b> Israel, saying, “I believed that Jews belong in Israel”. Nevertheless, in 1997 Katz’ husband was offered a research fellowship in endocrinology at the National Institutes of Health and they moved to Washington with their three children.

Although <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{her job as a}} nurse, Ann agrees to attend the job interview, and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests they make a game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar. April pretends to be Janet Snakehole, an aristocratic widow with a dark secret, while Andy poses as his frequent alter-ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin.|$|E
5|$|In 1325, EdwardII {{was faced}} with a demand from his brother-in-law, Charles IV of France, to perform homage for the English Duchy of Aquitaine. Edward was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country, as discontent was once again brewing domestically, {{particularly}} over his relationship with the favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger. Instead, he had his son Edward created Duke of Aquitaine in his place and sent him to France to perform the homage. The young Edward was accompanied by his mother Isabella, who was the sister of King Charles, and was meant to negotiate a peace treaty with the French. While in France, Isabella conspired with the exiled Roger Mortimer to have Edward deposed. To build up diplomatic and military support for the venture, Isabella had Prince Edward engaged to the twelve-year-old Philippa of Hainault. An invasion of England was launched and EdwardII's forces deserted him completely. The king was forced to relinquish the throne to his son on 25 January 1327. The new king was crowned as EdwardIII on 1 February 1327.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} {{had decided that}} the RUF could not be trusted, {{and would have to}} be confronted and forced to enter the UN's Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. They assessed that there were three options available to achieve this—to deploy British forces against the RUF, for UNAMSIL to expand its operations and confront the RUF, or for the Sierra Leonean government to use loyal forces (the SLA, former SLA personnel, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and several other militia groups) to take on the RUF. Richards estimated that a British deployment against the RUF would require at least a brigade-sized force (in excess of 5,000 troops). Nevertheless, British forces' involvement in Sierra Leone was politically unpopular in Westminster and the MoD could not assemble such a force while maintaining its commitments elsewhere, so the use of British forces to directly confront the RUF was ruled out. Also ruled out was a UNAMSIL-led confrontation. Although UNAMSIL's mandate would have allowed it to enter into combat with the RUF, the national contingents were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their bases and its focus remained on peacekeeping rather than the peace enforcement that the British and others believed was necessary.|$|E

However, Shrek was outside about to tell her he loved her when he overheard the conversation and thought she was referring to him. The next morning, Fiona decides to tell Shrek, but he has already brought Lord Farquaad to her.

Stewie finally figures {{out how to}} modify the remote device {{so that they can}} return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family– who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human– hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device {{that would allow them to}} return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, Peter, and is sent to the pound where he is to be euthanized later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.|$|E
5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
5|$|For Kinkladze, {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season {{followed}} a similar pattern to the previous season, comprising a mixture of starts and substitute appearances. Jim Smith resigned from his managerial position at Derby on 7 October 2001, leaving Kinkladze, a Smith favourite, bitterly disappointed. The appointment of new manager Colin Todd signalled a change in the club's playing style. Todd did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd's first two months in charge. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took the unusual step of using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team. Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy. According to Kinkladze's agent, Manchester City, as well as Spanish clubs Valencia, Mallorca and Málaga, were all interested in signing Kinkladze. However, Todd was sacked on 14 January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League, and John Gregory was appointed as manager on 30 January 2002. Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation {{for the third time in}} his career. The club, who were £35 million in debt, started an end-of-season clear-out to reduce their annual £17 million wage bill. Derby's actions included off-loading of some of the highest earners, and the manager informed Kinkladze that he had no future at the club. However, Kinkladze, whose contract ended in summer 2003, was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the club and turned down a move to Turkish champions Galatasaray.|$|E

50|$|In Payyavoor village {{there was}} a Brahmin family known as Ayyankara. The lady of the Ayyankara royal family went for her usual bath in the nearby Payyvur river. As she was bathing, she heard a ringing sound, similar to the sound made by anklets. To her {{surprise}} she spotted a baby floating in a basket of flowers in the river water. Anxious for a child, she immediately took the boy home. Her husband considered the baby to be a blessing from their god Shiva. The child grew up. In his youth, {{he was fond of}} hunting and he would often kill birds and animals and would consume their roasted flesh. This practice was highly unacceptable in the eyes of his parents, for which the boy would often receive scolding. Unable to bear this, one day the boy decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> home. On seeing that his mother was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> let him <b>leave,</b> he looked at her in fury with fiery eyes. On seeing this terrible expression of her son, she bowed to him and understood that her son was no ordinary boy. Thus, his divinity was revealed and he was thus understood to be Muthappan.|$|R

Female pinyon jays may {{be vulnerable to}} nocturnal and diurnal predators because they are extremely <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their nests.

25|$|Inimicus are piscivorous ambush predators. They are nocturnal and {{typically}} lie partially buried {{on the sea}} floor or on a coral head during the day, covering themselves with sand and other debris to further camouflage themselves. They have no known natural predators. When threatened, they spread their brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, they are very <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their hiding places. When they do move, they display an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion---they crawl slowly along the seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of their pectoral fins as legs.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that ants can protect plants against insect herbivores, but the underlying mechanisms remain almost undocumented. We propose and test the pheromone avoidance hypothesis [...] an indirect mechanism where insect herbivores are repelled not only by ants but also by ant pheromones. Herbivores subjected to ant predation will experience a selective advantage if they evolve mechanisms enabling them to avoid feeding within ant territories. Such a mechanism could {{be based on the}} ability to detect and evade ant pheromones. Field observations and data from the literature showed that the ant Oecophylla smaragdina distributes persistent pheromones throughout its territory. In addition, a laboratory test showed that the beetle Rhyparida wallacei, which this ant preys on, was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> feed on <b>leaves</b> sampled within ant territories compared with leaves sampled outside territories. Thus, this study provides an example of an ant-herbivore system conforming to the pheromone avoidance hypothesis...|$|R
