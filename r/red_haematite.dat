50|$|While {{there were}} {{suggestions}} that settlers around the Woodstock area had recognized iron deposits {{in the surrounding}} landscape in approximately 1820, {{it was not until}} sixteen years later in 1836 that Dr. Jackson of Boston, who was on a geological survey conducted by the state of Maine, confirmed the presence of iron ore. The ore was immediately recognized as high quality with great potential. Dr. Jackson allegedly identified it as a compact <b>red</b> <b>haematite,</b> the mineral form of iron that can range in colours from black and silver to red. The ore was said to be able to produce a yield of 44 percent pure iron or 50 percent cast iron, and one cubic foot of the iron would weigh approximately 200 pounds. Surveyors speculated that there was roughly 45,000,000 cubic feet of ore, which translated into about 225,000,000 pounds worth of iron that could be mined from the area.|$|E

"The {{ironstone}} mines {{there had}} been worked for some considerable time, and the ore was carried by rail and by sea to the coal districts of Lancashire, to the Staffordshire blast furnaces, and to Wales. The mining operations were, of course, very limited, {{and the price of}} the ore subject to extensive fluctuations, owing to the circumstance that the <b>red</b> <b>haematite</b> ore was only used as an admixture to other ores {{to improve the quality of}} iron, and the ironmasters used a small proportion of this more expensive ore, or tried to do entirely without it, whenever they could not obtain a sufficiently remunerative price for their pig iron in the market. Pure hematite iron, as such, was generally disliked in the trade on account of a certain amount of red shortness which it was known to give to all kinds of puddled iron produced from it; besides the red hematite was thought difficult to smelt by itself" ...|$|E
3000|$|Ochres {{are natural}} {{products}} related to rock weathering, whose predominant phases are phyllosilicates (clays). The presence {{of less than}} 2 % chromophores, such as iron oxides and hydroxides, the <b>red</b> <b>haematite</b> (α-Fe 2 O 3) and yellow goethite and lepidocrocite (α-FeOOH and γ-FeOOH respectively), is sufficient to impart a deep colour to the rock [1, 12]. Other minerals are commonly present and can help to ascertain provenance and paragenesis, such as quartz (SiO 2), feldspars ((Na, K)AlSi 3 O 8), micas and clays (complex hydrosilicates), gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O), ferrihydrite Fe 10 O 14 (OH) 2, maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), iron sulphates [jarosite group, KFe 3 [...]...|$|E
50|$|The Stierbergsteich was artificially {{created in}} order to impound water for an {{overshot}} water wheel sited further downstream. The wheel drove pumps that lifted pit {{water out of the}} shafts of nearby mines in which <b>red</b> iron ore (<b>haematite</b> was mainly extracted.|$|R
30|$|The red pigment was {{identified}} as <b>red</b> ochre (<b>haematite).</b> Pigments made from ochre are often discovered as long-lasting colourful remains in archaeological contexts. Raman bands recorded on the red pigment showed that a well-crystallised haematite is used. In the Raman spectrum of the pigment, anatase was detected; the most obvious possibility of the detection of this mineral is its simple presence already in the natural geological materials. Both rutile and anatase have been found by other authors in red pigment samples [42]. Red ochre was found combined with carbon black to produce tonalities of dark red and brown.|$|R
25|$|South-east of {{the summit}} of Esk Pike is Ore Gap, the col {{separating}} it from Bow Fell. The soil here is <b>red</b> due to <b>haematite,</b> and climbing lore suggests that magnetic compasses cannot be trusted in this locality. North of the gap is Angle Tarn, a feeder of the Langstrath. This round tarn occupies a corrie beneath Hanging Knotts, small trout lurking in its 50-foot depths.|$|R
40|$|Raman spectroscopic {{analyses}} of fragmented wall-painting specimens from a Romano-British villa dating from ca. 200 AD are reported. The predominant pigment is <b>red</b> <b>haematite,</b> to which carbon, chalk and sand {{have been added}} to produce colour variations, applied to a typical Roman limewash putty composition. Other pigment colours are identified as white chalk, yellow (goethite), grey (soot/chalk mixture) and violet. The latter pigment is ascribed to caput mortuum, a rare form of haematite, to which kaolinite (possibly from Cornwall) has been added, presumably in an effort to increase the adhesive properties of the pigment to the substratum. This {{is the first time that}} kaolinite has been reported in this context and could indicate the successful application of an ancient technology discovered by the Romano-British artists. Supporting evidence for the Raman data is provided by X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDAX {{analyses of}} the purple pigment. ...|$|E
50|$|Several {{stone age}} {{artefacts}} {{have been found}} in the mine during archaeological works in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their age was established with radiocarbon dating as older than 20,000 years. Later, radiocarbon dating yielded the age of the oldest mining activities as 41,000 to 43,000 years. This would make Ngwenya the oldest known mine. The site was known to Early Man for its deposits of <b>red</b> and specular <b>haematite,</b> used in cosmetics and rituals.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} work, a multi-analytical {{approach}} {{was used to}} analyze samples collected from the wall paintings of Qasr el-Ghuieta temple, Kharga Oasis, Egypt. The temple is {{dating back to the}} 27 th dynasty (525 – 404 BC) and was completed during the Ptolemaic period. The samples were analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis system (EDX), Raman microscopy and Fourier transform infrared–attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR–ATR). The chromatic palette used in the temple was identified as Egyptian blue (cuprorivaite), <b>red</b> ochre (<b>haematite),</b> yellow ochre (goethite) and carbon black (from a vegetable origin). The green pigment was identified as green earth, however, a green tonality was also obtained through a mixture of Egyptian blue and yellow ochre, and in some samples, carbon black was also found. Several amounts of anatase and carbon black were found in the red and yellow ochre samples, respectively. The analysis showed that the preparation layer is almost made of pure gypsum, while the plaster layer based mainly on gypsum with variable amounts of quartz, calcite and clay minerals. The results showed that the painting materials and techniques used in the temple are almost the same of those used in the Egyptian temples with respect to the stratigraphy of paint layers, chromatic palette and the painting technique employed.|$|R
30|$|In this study, the {{complementary}} use of optical microscopy, Raman microscopy, FTIR–ATR and ESEM–EDX mapping on micro-samples allowed direct {{identification of the}} minerals contained in pigment and plaster samples collected from wall paintings of Qasr el-Ghuieta temple, Kharga Oasis, Egypt. The {{results showed that the}} pigments used were Egyptian blue (cuprorivaite), <b>red</b> ochre (<b>haematite),</b> yellow ochre (goethite) and carbon black (from a vegetable origin). The green pigment was identified as green earth (Terre Verte), and a green tonality was obtained through a mixture of Egyptian blue and yellow ochre, and in some samples, carbon black was also found. In particular, Raman microscopy was really helpful for identifying individual grains in both the pigment and plaster samples. Several amounts of anatase and carbon black were found in the red and yellow pigments, respectively. The analysis showed that the preparation layer was made of gypsum while the plaster samples consist of quartz, gypsum, calcite and clay minerals. No {{significant differences were found between}} the wall decorations of Qasr el-Ghuieta temple, Kharga Oasis, Egypt and those applied in the Pharaonic temples, and their chemical composition and stratigraphy are almost the same. The findings of this study are in accordance with previous analyses of ancient Egyptian pigments, which indicate the continuous use of artificial and natural earth pigments. The results will be used in the conservation–restoration interventions regarding these decorations.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNon-destructive {{analysis}} of the artist’s palette of ancient wooden panel paintings is a difficult task and studies are rare. Here we compare different methods of {{analysis of}} a wooden panel painting, dated to the early sixteenth century, mainly by Raman and infrared spectroscopies. Raman spectra were recorded on collected/sampled micrometric fragments using portable Raman instruments with laser excitation lines at 532 and 785 nm and transportable Raman instruments at 532, 633 and 785 nm; a fixed 1064 nm Raman spectrometer was also used. Infrared analyses were performed in Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR-FTIR) mode. Using the portable instrument, the Raman spectra evidenced white lead, calcite and vermilion only. Raman spectra recorded by transportable and fixed instruments enabled the identification {{of most of the}} artist’s palette: (i) white lead, calcite, gypsum and cerussite for white colour; (ii) vermilion, <b>red</b> lead, litharge, <b>haematite</b> for red; (iii) azurite, indigo and lapis lazuli for blue. IR spectra gave information on the organic binding media. XRF analysis on a brown pigment suggested an heterogeneous mixture of a red pigment (such as haematite and/or minium) and a green one as malachite. GC-MS analysis allowed identifying terpenic resin in the composition of the outer protective layer...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} {{of an oil}} painting in seriously damaged condition with an important historical and a heterodox detail with possible origins in the late fifteenth century has afforded the opportunity for Raman microscopic analysis prior to its restoration being undertaken. The painting depicts a risen Christ following His crucifixion in a ‘noli me tangere’ pose with three women in an Italian terrace garden with a stone balustrade overlooking a rural landscape and an undoubted view of late-medieval Florence. The picture has suffered much abuse and is in very poor condition, which is possibly attributable to its controversial portrayal of a polydactylic Christ with six toes on His right foot. By the late sixteenth century, after the Council of Trent, this portrayal would almost certainly have been frowned upon by the Church authorities or more controversially as a depiction of the holy. Raman spectroscopic analysis of the pigments places the painting as being consistent chronologically with the Renaissance period following the identification of cinnabar, <b>haematite,</b> <b>red</b> lead, lead white, goethite, verdigris, caput mortuum and azurite with no evidence of more modern synthetic pigments or of modern restoration having been carried out. An interesting pigment mixture found here {{is that of the}} organic dye carmine and cinnabar to produce a particular bright red pigment coloration. Stratigraphic examination of the paint fragments has demonstrated the presence of an orange resin layer immediately on top of the canvas substrate, effectively rendering the pigment as a sandwich between this substratal resin and the overlying varnish. The Raman spectroscopic evidence clearly indicates that an attribution of the artwork to the Renaissance is consistent with the scientific analysis of the pigment composition...|$|R
