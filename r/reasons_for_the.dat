30|$|Fortunate {{cases that}} are able to pass checks by case-filing judges and the vice {{president}} of courts are still not cases. To be a case, a dispute needs to obtain a name in a legal sense, which is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case reflects the attributes of its civil legal relationship. After a case-filing court accepts a plaintiff’s request to proceed with the case as a lawsuit, the case still must go through some legal operations, in order to name it with a corresponding name—the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case—from the system of legal rules and principles. Various names exist to describe <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> a case. In civil case <b>reasons,</b> <b>for</b> example, it is common to see divorce, contracts for purchase and sale, financial transactions, labor disputes, and property ownership.|$|R

5|$|Although the Rzeczpospolita had not {{formally}} participated {{directly in the}} Thirty Years' War, the alliance with the Habsburg Monarchy contributed to getting Poland involved in new wars with the Ottoman Empire, Sweden and Russia, and therefore led to significant Commonwealth influence {{over the course of}} the Thirty Years' War.

5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration.

5|$|In 2006 Bayern {{purchased}} {{land near}} the Allianz Arena {{with the purpose}} of building a new youth academy.

The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.|$|E

There are various <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 2017 sources {{confirmed}} that Cotto had parted ways with promoter Roc Nation Sports.

A fight with Japanese boxer Yoshihiro Kamegai (27-3-2, 24 KOs) was penciled in for June 24, but fell through. HBO also did not back the fight.|$|E

5|$|One of the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{increase}} {{in the numbers of}} skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E
