5|$|Banksia serrata has {{a central}} taproot and few lateral roots. Clusters of fine {{branched}} proteoid roots up to 15cm (6in) long arise from larger roots. These <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, {{such as the}} phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{vascular}} plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. <b>Roots</b> <b>are</b> often {{adapted to}} store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.telmatiaea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
50|$|Cecil Adams {{has written}} that John the Conqueror <b>root</b> <b>is</b> the <b>root</b> of St. John's wort. St. John's wort <b>root</b> <b>is</b> a thin and thread-like root, while John the Conqueror <b>root</b> <b>is</b> a tuber. John the Conqueror <b>root</b> <b>is</b> carried by the user, and the spell is cast by rubbing the root, {{which could not be}} done with a {{filamentous}} root.|$|R

5|$|M3 {{is known}} {{from a single}} {{specimen}} each from Oberdorf, Affalterbach, and Tägernaustrasse. In addition to the main crests, there are two or three additional smaller crests. The <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|The anterolabial {{cingulum}} and anteroconid {{are both}} absent on m3. The mesolophid is usually absent. As in m2, {{there are two}} roots at the front in A.donovani and only one in A.praeuniversitatis, but the front <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> usually fused in A.donovani.|$|E
5|$|The <b>roots</b> <b>are,</b> generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> close to the surface.|$|E

5|$|Chantenay carrots. Although the <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> {{shorter than}} other cultivars, they have {{vigorous}} foliage and greater girth, being broad in {{the shoulders and}} tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing. Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E

5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.scabrella, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. B.scabrella is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted {{by the smell of}} bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{once part of}} the estate linked to Clevedon Court. It is now managed via a Higher Level Stewardship {{agreement}} between the National Trust and Natural England. This has involved removing trees whose <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> growing into the earthen banks of the site. In particular non native Turkey Oaks, which provide a habitat for damaging Gall wasps, are being removed. Cattle are also being used to manage the scrub and encourage the growth of flowers such as orchids.|$|E

5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|Dubstep's early <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> in {{the more}} {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short <b>roots,</b> <b>are</b> easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
30|$|To monitor <b>root</b> colonization, <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> {{analyzed}} after 4  days of germination {{and at the}} end of the experiment. <b>Roots</b> <b>were</b> thoroughly washed with deionized water, {{cut into}} 1  cm length segments which were placed overnight in a 10 % KOH solution at room temperature. <b>Roots</b> <b>were</b> then washed 5 times with sterilized H 2 O and incubated in 1 % HCl solution for 3  min. Later on, <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> mounted in 0.05 % trypan blue in lactophenol for microscopic examination (Michal Johnson et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Objective. Comparing {{effect of}} {{different}} restoration techniques on fracture resistance of compromised roots. Methods. Crowns of 100 single-rooted teeth were sectioned and 10 <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> kept as negative control group (Group 1). Remaining <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> instrumented and divided into one and {{positive control group}} of 10 samples (Group 2) and 4 experimental groups of 20 samples each. Group 3 : <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> obturated with gutta-percha; Group 4 : <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> restored with gutta-percha, composite, and glass fiber post; Group 5 : <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> obturated with Resilon; Group 6 : <b>Roots</b> <b>were</b> restored with Resilon, composite, and glass fiber post. <b>Roots</b> <b>were</b> weakened before obturation in groups 2, 3, and 5 and after obturation in groups 4 and 6. Fracture strengths were measured using Dartec testing machine and fracture load was recorded in kilo-Newton. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and Tukeys test. Results. The fractures resistance of restored <b>roots</b> <b>was</b> significantly higher in groups 4, 5, and 6 than in Groups 2 and 3. There {{were no significant differences}} between groups 1, 4, 5, and 6. Conclusions. Restoration of weakened roots with Resilon or bonding an intermediate composite resin to coronal radicular dentin and to glass fiber post increased their fracture resistance...|$|R
30|$|At {{least five}} plants of each Artemisia species were {{carefully}} {{removed from the}} soil. The <b>roots</b> <b>were</b> washed carefully.

5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
5|$|The Shiva-related {{tradition}} {{is a major}} part of Hinduism, found all over India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bali (Indonesia). Its historical <b>roots</b> <b>are</b> unclear and contested. Some scholars such Yashodhar Mathpal and Ali Javid have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways. Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.|$|E
