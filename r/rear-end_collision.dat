5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a <b>rear-end</b> <b>collision</b> if they tailgate cars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rear-end</b> <b>collisions</b> {{comprise}} {{a large proportion}} of all vehicle crashes. A variant of the standard centre high mounted stop light (CHMSL) that flashes under conditions of heavy braking was developed to reduce the incidence and severity of <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions.</b> The developer of the Heavy Braking Light commissioned MUARC to conduct a driving simulator evaluation of the effectiveness of the Heavy Braking Light. Forty-two participants completed a series of simulator drives that were designed to examine whether participants’ braking performance under certain conditions was more effective in response to a heavily braking vehicle fitted with the Heavy Braking Light compared with a heavily braking vehicle fitted with a standard CHMSL. Among other things, it was found that, relative to the CHMSL condition, participants reacted by braking in a shorter time at an intermediate headway to the Heavy Braking Light, and braked harder in response to the Heavy Braking Light at both a near and intermediate headway. The results suggest that the Heavy Braking Light is a device that, through widespread use, may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and severity of <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the cost of <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions</b> in Denmark, and to define the potential financial benefits of a high, center-mounted auxiliary brake light for automobiles. The study was limited to passenger cars struck from behind. The annual cost of two different preventive programs involving auxiliary brake lights was compared to the annual cost of the accidents expected to be prevented in each program. The finding was that <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions</b> cost on average over 13, 700 1980 Danish kroner (approx. US$ 2300), 70 % of which was property damage. There are so many <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions</b> that even if the new brake-light configuration were only one-third as effective in Denmark as it has been in U. S. field trials the mounting of required auxiliary lights would be a sound investment. Substantial savings would be anticipated whether the auxiliary brake lights were required on all passenger cars as of a particular date, or only on newly registered passenger cars, although the former preventive program is preferable by usual cost benefit criteria.

Naturalistic driving data and accident {{data show that}} <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions</b> {{are the most common}} type of accident in car following situations. Furthermore, distraction from secondary- tasks-has been shown to be one of the leading causes of <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions.</b> The aim of this thesis was to analyze driver behaviour in car following situations in order to gain insight into the influence of factors such as secondary tasks to the likeliness of <b>rear-end</b> <b>collisions.</b> A steady state car following scenario was defined and used to extract data representing car following situations from commutes on main arterial road segments. This data was studied to determine the effects of secondary tasks on driver behaviour measured by, among other variables, headway time to the lead vehicle. Driving data from passenger vehicles in the euroFOT project –the largest ongoing field operational test in Europe— was used in this study. The results presented in this thesis indicate that traditional measures of longitudinal and lateral control such as lane position and headway time are less affected by secondary tasks than measures related to driver control inputs such as peak steering angle acceleration in steady state following situations...|$|R
