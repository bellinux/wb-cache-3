40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdvanced {{maternal}} age (AMA) is {{the most}} frequent indication for amniocentesis in predicting balanced reciprocal translocations, and abnormal ultrasound findings are indications in predicting unbalanced reciprocal translocations; however, to date, no {{studies have focused on}} <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations.</b> MethodsA retrospective review was conducted on 16, 749 pregnant women who underwent midtrimester amniocentesis between January 1981 and December 2010. <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> were identified in 39 cases. ResultsThe percentage of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> in all amniocentesis cases was 0. 23 % (39 / 16, 749); 31 were balanced and eight were unbalanced. De novo abnormality occurred in 17 cases, or in 43. 6 % of all <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations.</b> The two major indications for amniocentesis with a diagnosis of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> were AMA (41. 0 %, n =  16) and a parent with abnormal karyotypes (18. 0 %, n =  7). The highest percentage of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> was found in parents with abnormal karyotypes (2. 8 %, 7 / 252), but neither of the indications were clearly superior for detecting de novo <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations.</b> ConclusionAlthough AMA is an indication for amniocentesis in approximately two-fifths of cases with <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations,</b> the indication of parent with abnormal karyotypes was more likely to lead to the detection of non-de novo <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations,</b> suggesting that parents with abnormal karyotypes need careful prenatal consultation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> {{have been}} seen {{involving}} all combinations of acrocentric chromosomes. The most common translocation in humans involves chromosomes 13 and 14 and is seen in about 0.97 / 1000 newborns. Carriers of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> are not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, {{but there is a}} risk of unbalanced gametes that lead to miscarriages or abnormal offspring. For example, carriers of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> involving chromosome 21 have a higher chance of having a child with Down syndrome. This is known as a 'translocation Downs'. This is due to a mis-segregation (nondisjunction) during gametogenesis. The mother has a higher (10%) risk of transmission than the father (1%). <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> involving chromosome 14 also carry a slight risk of uniparental disomy 14 due to trisomy rescue.|$|R
40|$|Rearrangements of the {{acrocentric}} chromosomes (<b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> and isochromosomes) {{are associated}} with an increased risk of aneuploidy. Given this, and the large number of reported cases of uniparental disomy (UPD) associated with an acrocentric rearrangement, carriers are presumed to be at risk for UPD. However, an accurate risk estimate for UPD associated with these rearrangements is lacking. A total of 174 prenatally identified acrocentric rearrangements, including both <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> and isochromosomes, were studied prospectively to identify UPD for the chromosomes involved in the rearrangements. The overall goal {{of the study was to}} provide an estimate of the risk of UPD associated with nonhomologous <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> and homologous acrocentric rearrangements. Of the 168 nonhomologous <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> studied, one showed UPD for chromosome 13, providing a risk estimate of 0. 6 %. Four of the six homologous acrocentric rearrangements showed UPD, providing a risk estimate of 66 %. These cases have also allowed delineation of the mechanisms involved in producing UPD unique to <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations.</b> Given the relatively high risk for UPD in prenatally identified <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> and isochromosomes, UPD testing should be considered, especially for cases involving the acrocentric chromosomes 14 and 15, in which UPD is associated with adverse clinical outcomes...|$|R

50|$|<b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation</b> (ROB) {{is a rare}} form of {{chromosomal}} rearrangement that, in humans, generally occurs in the five acrocentric chromosome pairs, namely 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22.

They are named after the American biologist William Rees Brebner Robertson Ph.D. (1881-1941), who first described a <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation</b> in grasshoppers in 1916. They are also called whole-arm translocations or centric-fusion translocations. They are a type of chromosomal translocation.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} {{with five}} biotin-labeled probes (three alphoid probes, a probe specific for beta-satellite sequences in all acrocentric chromosomes, and an rDNA probe) was used to characterize 30 different <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations,</b> including three t(13; 13); one t(15; 15), four t(21; 21), three t(13; 14), two t(13; 15), two (13; 21), two t(13; 22), one t(14; 15), eight t(14; 21), two t(14; 22), and two t(21; 22). Of 8 de novo homologous translocations, only one t(13; 13) chromosome was interpreted as dicentric, while 19 of 22 nonhomologous <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> were dicentric. The three monocentric nonhomologous translocations included both of the t(13; 21) and one t(21; 22). Two of 26 translocations studied using the beta-satellite probe showed a positive signal, while rDNA was undetectable in 10 cases studied. These results indicate that most homologous <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> appear monocentric, while the bulk of nonhomologous translocations show two alphoid signals. A majority of the breakpoints localized using this analysis seem to be distal to the centromere and just proximal to the beta-satellite and nuclear-organizing regions...|$|R

40|$|Most <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> are dicentric, {{suggesting}} that the location of chromosomal breaks leading to their formation occur in the acrocentric short arm.

Breakpoints in satellite III DNA, specifically between two chromosome 14 -specific subfamilies, pTRS- 47 and pTRS- 63, have been indicated for most of the dicentric 14 q 21 q and 13 q 14 q translocations that have been studied. We have analyzed the structure of 36 dicentric translocations, using several repetitive DNA probes that localize to the acrocentric short arm. The majority of the translocations retained satellite III DNA, while others proved variable in structure. Of 10 14 q 21 q translocations analyzed, satellite III DNA was undetected in 1; 6 retained one satellite III DNA subfamily, pTRS- 47; and 3 appeared to contain two 14 -specific satellite III DNA sub-families, pTRS- 47 and pTRS- 63. In 10 / 11 translocations involving chromosome 15, the presence of satellite III DNA was observed.

40|$|<b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> are {{the most}} common translocations found in humans (1). The {{breakpoints}} forming these rearrangements are at or near the centromers of both chromosomes involved. The carriers of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> are usually normal in other respects. Such a translocation of chromosome 21 to the other chromosome 21 or to one of the other acrocentrics is frequently a cause of familial Down Syndrome (2 - 4).

40|$|Summary.

The experiments were designed to investigate several pre-viously reported unusual chromosome segregation ratios in sheep, to test the fertility of translocation heterozygous ewes mated to rams of normal karyotype and to test both the fertility and segregation patterns of sheep which were double translocation heterozygotes. The fertility of the translocation heterozygous ewes was normal as assessed from conception to first service, numbers ofnon-conceiving ewes and lambing percentages. Two types of double translocation heterozy-gous rams mated to ewes ofnormal karyotype produced regular chromo-some segregation patterns in their progeny and the matings were of normal fertility. Double translocation heterozygous ewes were also fertile. Four sheep were bred with 51 chromosomes. Two of these were triple heterozygotes with three different <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> 51,xy, t 1 t 2 t 3 and 51,xx,t 1 t 2 t 3 and two were homozygous for one translocation and heterozygous for the others, namely 51,xx,t 1 t 1 t 3 and 51,xx,t 1 t 3 t 3.

50|$|In an {{acrocentric}} chromosome the p arm contains genetic material including repeated sequences such as nucleolar organizing regions, {{and can be}} translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation.</b> The domestic horse genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is homologous to two {{acrocentric chromosome}}s in the conspecific but undomesticated Przewalski's horse. This may reflect either fixation of a balanced <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation</b> in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes; in this case, because more species are extant, {{it is apparent that}} the evolutionary sequence is a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see Karyotype#Aneuploidy).|$|E
5000|$|About {{one in a}} {{thousand}} newborns have a <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation.</b> The most frequent forms of Robertsonian translocations are between chromosomes 13 and 14, 14 and 21, and 14 and 15, and occur when the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes fuse at the centromere and the two short arms are lost.|$|E
50|$|In humans, when a <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation</b> {{joins the}} long arm of {{chromosome}} 21 {{with the long}} arm of chromosomes 14 or 15, the heterozygous carrier is phenotypically normal because there are two copies of all major chromosome arms and hence two copies of all essential genes. However, the progeny of this carrier may inherit an unbalanced trisomy 21, causing Down syndrome.|$|E
40|$|<b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> are {{the most}} common {{structural}} dicentric rearrangements in humans. The stability of these dicentrics is attributed to the inactivation of one centromere by mechanisms which are currently unknown. The presence and amounts of centromeric proteins (CENPs) differ between the centromeres of the few dicentrics which have been studied, providing a limited understanding of the protein components necesssary for centromeric function. However, CENP-C previously has been observed only at the active centromeres in two dicentric chromosomes. In the present investigation, the presence and localizations of several centromeric antigens, CENP-B,-C and-E, have been determined in 12 dicentric <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations.</b> Each translocation was studied initially using in situ hybridization with a-satellite DNA probes to determine the active centromere. Subsequent immunofiuorescence of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies generated to various centromeric antigens demonstrated that the protein composition differs at the two centromeres of these dicentric translocations. While CENP-B was present at both active and inactive centromeres, CENP-C and-E were located at active centromeres only in the majority of translocations. These results confirm previous observations of CENP-C at active centromeres and provide the first evidence that CENP-E correlates with active centromeres as well, demonstrating that at least two specific centromeric proteins are required for human centromeric function...|$|R
50|$|Most {{people with}} <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> have only 45 {{chromosomes}} {{in each of}} their cells, yet all essential genetic material is present, and they appear normal.

40|$|The {{frequencies}} of balanced chromosome rearrangements were estimated from three series of advanced maternal-age prenatal genetic studies, and {{were compared to}} the frequencies that had been estimated from consecutive newborn surveys. In the maternal-age prenatal studies, the frequencies were: <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations,</b> 0. 11 %; reciprocal translocations, 0. 17 %; and inversions, 0. 12 %. The total frequency of balanced rearrangements in the prenatal genetic studies performed with banding (0. 40 %, or 1 in 250) was twice that in the consecutive newborn surveys performed without banding (0. 19 %, or 1 in 526). The difference was limited to inversions and reciprocal translocations; the frequency of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations</b> was similar in the prenatal series and the newborn surveys. Both familial and de novo rearrangements were more common than anticipated. The de novo cases provided a mutation rate estimate of 4. 3 per 10, 000 gametes per generation (compared with 1. 78 to 2. 2 per 10, 000 gametes in other surveys).

50|$|This {{can occur}} either because each cell {{contains}} a full extra copy of chromosome 13 (a disorder known as trisomy 13 or trisomy D), or because each cell contains an extra partial {{copy of the}} chromosome (i.e., <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocation)</b> or because of mosaic Patau syndrome. Full trisomy 13 is caused by nondisjunction of chromosomes during meiosis (the mosaic form is caused by nondisjunction during mitosis).|$|E

40|$|Speciation {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by changes in chromosomal number or form even though such changes significantly reduce the fertility of hybrid intermediates. We have addressed this evolutionary paradox by expanding the principle that nonrandom segregation of chromosomes takes place whenever human or mouse females are heterozygous carriers of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations,</b> a common form of chromosome rearrangement in mammals. Our analysis of 1170 mammalian karyotypes provides strong evidence that karyotypic evolution is driven by nonrandom segregation during female meiosis. The pertinent variable in this form of meiotic drive {{is the presence of}} differing numbers of centromeres on paired homologous chromosomes. This situation is encountered in all heterozygous carriers of <b>Robertsonian</b> <b>translocations.</b> Whenever paired chromosomes have different numbers of centromeres, the inherent asymmetry of female meiosis and the polarity of the meiotic spindle dictate that the partner with the greater number of centromeres will attach preferentially to the pole that is most efficient at capturing centromeres. This mechanism explains how chromosomal variants become fixed in populations, as well as why closely related species often appear to have evolved by directional adjustment of the karyotype toward or away from a particular chromosome form. If differences in the ability of particular DNA sequences or chromosomal regions to function as centromeres are also considered, nonrandom segregation is likely to affect karyotype evolution across a very broad phylogenetic range...|$|R
