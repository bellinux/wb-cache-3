50|$|This {{unsprung}} weight is cushioned from uneven road surfaces {{only by the}} compressive resilience of the tire (and wire wheels if fitted), which aids the wheel in remaining {{in contact with the}} road surface when the wheel inertia prevents close-following of the ground surface. However, the compressive resilience of the tire results in rolling resistance which requires additional kinetic energy to overcome, and the rolling resistance is expended in the tire as heat due to the flexing of the <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> bands in the sidewalls of the tires. To reduce rolling resistance for improved fuel economy and to avoid overheating and failure of tires at high speed, tires are designed to have limited internal damping.|$|E

50|$|Because of punk, London {{retained}} a considerable degree of influence over fashion, most {{significantly in the}} boutiques of the King's Road, where Vivienne Westwood's boutique, SEX, which opened in 1971, blew with the prevailing wind. This temple of British iconoclasm centered on fetishistic accessories and ranges of clothing in which black <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> studs were the external signs of an underlying sadism. Postmodernist and iconoclastic in essence the punk movement was a direct reaction to the economic situation during the economic depression of the period, the vehicle for a hatred that was more visceral than political. Punk had at its heart a manifesto of creation through disorder. With their ripped T-shirts, Native American hairstyles, Doc Martens, bondage trousers, and chains, the punks exported an overall feeling of disgust around the globe.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficacy}} of weatherstripping can be significantly increased by specialty coatings during manufacture. Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere {{to all of}} these weatherstrip materials. Like other paints and coatings, a large variety of weatherstrip coatings are commonly available, with a large variety of coating performances. Silicone is the most difficult to adhere to, but at least one coating is commercially available. After bonding to the weatherstrip, these coatings provide chemical and ultraviolet resistance, decrease the static coefficient of friction (thereby reducing the force required to open or close doors), and reduce or eliminate noise. In vehicles without coated weatherstripping, the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above-mentioned issues along with others such as rust following premature failure of the paint. That some cars have non-coated weatherstripping is surprising, given that the cost of the coating is less than US$1 to US$3 per vehicle, whereas the <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> is tens of dollars; an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth US$100 to US$300 in the total cost of the vehicle, which includes all labor and costs of the manufacturing equipment.|$|E

5000|$|A knockbox (informally {{known as}} a [...] "bash bin" [...] or [...] "coffee column") is a device used to store spent espresso grounds, called a puck, after a shot of espresso has been pulled. It is {{generally}} made out of stainless <b>steel</b> or plastic, <b>and</b> has a sturdy bar {{known as a}} [...] "bash bar", against which a portafilter is tapped to release the puck. Because the espresso puck is typically very hot after extraction, knockboxes need to be sturdy. Further, they are also subject to repetitive knocking and tapping to dislodge espresso after use, <b>and</b> thus <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> stainless <b>steel</b> are {{the most commonly used}} materials. In various coffee houses they are seen as drawers which are integral within the bar structure, or as stainless steel boxes usually located near the grinder for convenience.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{the complex}} {{transverse}} horizontal drive {{it was decided to}} use a vertical longitudinal rear-engined layout, Instead of the very low horizontal frame of the first two chassis, this was slightly higher at the front and ramped gently upward and tapered outward toward the rear, where the Cummins VIM V6-200 engine was mounted. This 9.6-litre 90-degree vee-six engine developed 192 bhp at 2600rpm and was compact enough to fit under the rear seat on a bodied bus and allow drive to pass through a conventional Daimler SCG Daimatic four-speed semi-automatic gearbox to a straight spiral-bevel rear axle manufactured by Eaton, an electrically operated two-speed axle being optional. All round air suspension was standard, with <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> leaf options. Although some drawings show a front-mounted radiator, standard production versions had this mounted on the rear offside, as on the Fleetline. Other components such as the front axle, steering, brakes, driving controls etc. were {{similar to those of the}} Fleetline. The model was announced as the Roadliner model SRC6-36, this was the third and last Daimler bus chassis to be given a model name as well as an alphanumeric code.|$|E
40|$|Steel-reinforced {{elastomeric}} isolators (SREIs) {{have been}} shown to be efficient devices to protect structures against moderate and severe earthquakes by isolating them from ground motions. Bridge elastomeric isolators, however, deteriorate when undergone repetitive loading cycles due to either earthquakes or traffic loadings. One major damage type observed dominantly in these devices is delamination or de-bonding between rubber and supporting plates and steel reinforcements, if cold-bonded. This paper investigates potential damage scenarios likely to occur in cold-bonded bridge SREIs. It also looks into bonding properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> in tension and shear, the two important functional characteristics of elastomeric isolators. In this study, experimental tests are employed in order to observe the bonding behavior between <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel.</b> Damage states have been organized and it is observed that the adhesive properties and level of shear deformations govern bonding characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Acousto-ultrasonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation {{has been conducted}} to evaluate the adhesive bond strength between <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> plates using the stress wave factor (SWF) measurement technique. Specimens with different bond strength were manufactured and tested using the SWF technique. Two approaches were used to define the SWF. One approach defines the SWF as the signal energy and the other approach defines the SWF as the square root of the zero moment of the frequency spectrum of the received signal. The strength of the rubber-steel adhesive joint was then evaluated using the destructive peel strength test method. It was observed that in both approaches higher values of the SWF measurements correspond to higher values of the peel strength test data. Therefore, these {{results show that the}} stress wave factor technique has the potential of being used in quality assurance of the adhesive bond strength between <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> substrates...|$|E
40|$|Machine {{elements}} and mechanical components have often surfaces with anisotropic roughness, which {{may result from}} the machining processes, e. g. grinding, or from wear. Hence, {{it is important to}} understand how surface roughness anisotropy affects contact mechanics properties, such as friction and the interface separation, which is important for lubricated contacts. Here we extend and apply a multiscale mean-field model to the lubricated contact between a soft (e. g. <b>rubber)</b> elastic solid <b>and</b> a rigid countersurface. We consider surfaces with anisotropic surface roughness, and discuss how the fluid flow factors and friction factors depend on the roughness. We present an experimental study of the lubricated sliding contact between a nitrile butadiene <b>rubber</b> O-ring <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces with different types of isotropic and anisotropic surface roughness. The good quantitative comparison between the experimental results and the theory predictions suggests that the multiscale lubrication mechanisms are accurately captured by the theory...|$|R

40|$|A seismic {{isolator}} has {{the main}} function {{to be extremely}} deformable for horizontal forces, but at same time sufficiently stiff when loaded with vertical actions. These properties may be strongly influenced by both the isolator geometry (i. e. overall dimensions, number <b>and</b> thickness of <b>rubber</b> pads <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> laminas) <b>and</b> the mechanical properties of rubber pads. Mechanical properties of the pads, especially Young modulus, may be evaluated {{as a function of}} hardness, by means of consolidated empirical formulas. In this work, the influence of <b>rubber</b> pads thickness <b>and</b> hardness on both vertical and horizontal stiffness of realistic seismic isolators is discussed. Three full 3 D Finite Element models referred to three different seismic isolators having different slenderness are analysed in detail in both vertical compression (elastic analysis) and simple shear in large deformations.
