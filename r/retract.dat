40|$|Background: The {{number of}} <b>retracted</b> {{scholarly}} articles has risen precipitously in recent years. Past {{surveys of the}} <b>retracted</b> literature each limited their scope to articles in PubMed, though many <b>retracted</b> articles are not indexed in PubMed. To understand the scope and characteristics of <b>retracted</b> articles across {{the full spectrum of}} scholarly disciplines, we surveyed 42 of the largest bibliographic databases for major scholarly fields and publisher websites to identify <b>retracted</b> articles. This study examines various trends among them...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>retracted</b> vowel is a vowel {{sound in}} which the body or root of the tongue is pulled back into the pharynx. The most <b>retracted</b> {{cardinal}} vowels are , which are so far back that the epiglottis may press against the back pharyngeal wall, and [...] Raised or front vowels may be partially <b>retracted,</b> for example by an adjacent uvular consonant or by vowel harmony based on <b>retracted</b> tongue root. In both cases, , for example, may be <b>retracted</b> to [...]|$|R

5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{feeds on}} plankton. The tentacles of the dactylzooids are {{normally}} extended all the time. If an object is waved about above the coral, {{it will cause}} the tentacles to <b>retract</b> and then the coral can be handled without experiencing the painful stings caused by the cnidocytes.|$|E

40|$|Previous phonetic {{studies show}} a co-articulatory effect of <b>retracted</b> consonants on {{adjacent}} high vowels resulting in tongue-root retraction and tongue-body lowering. The present study uses ultrasound imaging {{to investigate whether}} an inherently low vowel would also show evidence for retraction or show opacity as observed cross-linguistically with other tongue root and tongue body phenomena. Focusing on the two <b>retracted</b> conditions claimed in previous studies (VC and CV sequences with <b>retracted</b> consonants), {{results of the present}} study show that compared to the position of the tongue-root in non-retracted contexts, the low vowel has a significantly more <b>retracted</b> tongue-root when it precedes <b>retracted</b> consonants. No significant difference in tongue-root position is observed between /a / in a CV sequence with <b>retracted</b> consonants and /a/ in a non-retracted context. Thus even though the low vowel is not opaque to retraction in St’át’imcets, it <b>retracts</b> only when preceding consonants, not following <b>retracted</b> consonants...|$|R
5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to <b>retract</b> the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to <b>retract</b> the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to <b>retract</b> them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can <b>retract</b> inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that scientific misconduct (data fabrication or falsification) is goal-directed behavior. This hypothesis predicts that papers <b>retracted</b> for misconduct: are targeted to journals {{with a high}} impact factor (IF); are written by authors with additional papers withdrawn for misconduct; diffuse responsibility across many (perhaps innocent) co-authors; and are <b>retracted</b> slower than papers <b>retracted</b> for other infractions. These hypotheses were initially tested and confirmed in a database of 788 papers; here we reevaluate these hypotheses in a larger database of 2, 047 English-language papers. Journal IF was higher for papers <b>retracted</b> for misconduct (p 1 retraction (p < 0. 0001). Papers flawed by misconduct diffuse responsibility across more authors (p < 0. 0001) and are withdrawn more slowly (p < 0. 0001) than papers <b>retracted</b> for other reasons. Papers <b>retracted</b> for unknown reasons are unlike papers <b>retracted</b> for misconduct: they are generally published in journals with low IF; by authors with no other retractions; have fewer authors listed; and are <b>retracted</b> quickly. Papers <b>retracted</b> for unknown reasons appear not to represent a deliberate effort to deceive...|$|R

40|$|<b>Retracting</b> {{published}} scientific articles {{is increasingly}} common. Retraction is a self-correction {{mechanism of the}} scientific community to maintain and safeguard the integrity of scientific literature. However, a <b>retracted</b> article may pose a profound and long-lasting threat to the credibility of the literature. New articles may unknowingly build their work on false claims made in <b>retracted</b> articles. Such dependencies on <b>retracted</b> articles may become implicit and indirect. Consequently, it becomes increasingly challenging to detect implicit and indirect threats. In this article, our aim is to raise the awareness of the potential threats of <b>retracted</b> articles even after their retraction and demonstrate a visual analytic study of <b>retracted</b> articles with reference {{to the rest of the}} literature and how their citations are influenced by their retraction. The context of highly cited <b>retracted</b> articles is visualized in terms of a co-citation network as well as the distribution of articles that have high-order citation dependencies on <b>retracted</b> articles. Survival analyses of time to retraction and post-retraction citation are included. Sentences that explicitly cited <b>retracted</b> articles are extracted from full text articles. Transitions of topics over time are depicted in topic-flow visualizations. We recommend that new visual analytic and science mapping tools should take <b>retracted</b> articles into account and facilitate tasks specifically related to the detection and monitoring of <b>retracted</b> articles...|$|R
5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally <b>retract</b> his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can <b>retract</b> into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily.|$|E

Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would <b>retract</b> the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E

40|$|Background In {{about one}} in 10, 000 cases, a {{published}} article is <b>retracted.</b> This very often means that the results it reports are flawed. Several authors have voiced concerns {{about the presence of}} <b>retracted</b> research in the memory of science. In particular, a <b>retracted</b> result is propagated by citing it. In the published literature, many instances are given of <b>retracted</b> articles that are cited both before and after their retraction. Even worse is the possibility that these articles in turn are cited {{in such a way that}} the <b>retracted</b> result is propagated further. Methods We have conducted a case study to find out how a <b>retracted</b> article is cited and whether <b>retracted</b> results are propagated through indirect citations. We have constructed the entire citation network for this case. Results We show that directly citing articles is an important source of propagation of <b>retracted</b> research results. In contrast, in our case study, indirect citations do not contribute to the propagation of the <b>retracted</b> result. Conclusions While admitting the limitations of a study involving a single case, we think there are reasons for the non-contribution of indirect citations that hold beyond our case study...|$|R
5|$|The 767 {{interior}} introduced larger overhead bins {{and more}} lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service doors are an overhead plug type, which <b>retract</b> upwards, and commonly used doors can {{be equipped with}} an electric-assist system.|$|E
5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could <b>retract</b> into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E

In these early fossils (mostly {{of the genus}} Proganochelys), the teeth have already been lost, and a keratin beak {{is suggested by the}} mandibles. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern turtles are the presence of the palatal teeth (lost in modern species), the inability to <b>retract</b> the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley in the jaw closing anatomy.|$|E

5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When muscles in {{the wall of the}} rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches {{to the back of the}} rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then <b>retract</b> the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to <b>retract</b> the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to <b>retract</b> as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
