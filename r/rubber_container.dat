50|$|Most chemical-reaction {{monopropellant}} rocket systems {{consist of}} a fuel tank, usually a titanium or aluminium sphere, with an ethylene-propylene <b>rubber</b> <b>container</b> or a surface tension propellant management device filled with the fuel. The tank is then pressurized with helium or nitrogen, which pushes the fuel out to the motors. A pipe leads from the tank to a poppet valve, {{and then to the}} decomposition chamber of the rocket motor. Typically, a satellite will have not just one motor, but two to twelve, each with its own valve.|$|E
50|$|Drip Tank: The drip tank serves two purposes. 1) The {{friction}} {{produced from}} {{contact between the}} rough and the lap creates heat, which can damage the lap and create stress fractures in the stone. The drip tank allows the user to choose a drip rate via spigot and to position the spigot over the lap, nearer or farther from the arbor. 2) The dust produced from grinding minerals can cause pulmonary disease if inhaled. The flow of water captures the particles in a slurry, which drains into a <b>rubber</b> <b>container</b> around and below the lap. This container has an exit tube that drains into a second receptacle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling, calculations and analysis using Finite Element Method (FEM) of the <b>rubber</b> tyred <b>container</b> stacking crane in ports. All {{elements of the}} <b>rubber</b> tyred <b>container</b> stacking crane was modeled and made its calculations. Although stress and deformation analysis of crane bridge girder and buckling analysis of the crane legs are performed. ANSYS Workbench program {{has been used to}} perform the finite element method. In addition, <b>rubber</b> tyred <b>container</b> stacking crane has been modeled by using Autodesk INVENTOR 2010 program. Stress, deformation and buckling analysis have been compared with calculations. The aim of this work is to consider the new possibilities and the gains of finite element method over conventional calculation methods on <b>rubber</b> tyred <b>container</b> stacking crane design. When we examine the results, deformation formed on crane system is not significant when considering geometric dimensions of model and it was observed that the stress values remain under the yield strength of the steel which is used for crane brigde and legs...|$|R

Subsequent expansion of its facilities have continued into the present day.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of three}} factory workers {{standing}} at a table, working with rubber, ca. 1930. At center is a table with strips of {{what appear to be}} <b>rubber,</b> metal <b>containers,</b> and tools placed upon it. To the left is a worker facing the table and working with the rubber. He is visible wearing jeans, a white tank top, an apron, and a white visor. On {{the other side of the}} table to the right is a worker who appears to be cutting the strips of rubber with large scissors. He is visible wearing slacks, a collared button-down shirt with rolled up sleeves, a cap, and glasses. In the background are two other workers, shelves containing rubber strips, and machinery...|$|R

After the United States expressed concerns about related seizures from two other Dutch ships in service to the United States— and —the British Foreign Office issued a statement that reported that contraband intended for Germany—which included four packages of <b>rubber,</b> and seven <b>containers</b> of wool—had been found among Tubantias mail.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of parenteral drug products are manufactured in glass vials with an elastomeric rubber stopper and a crimp cap. The vial sealing {{process is a}} critical process step during fill-and-finish operations, as it defines the seal quality of the final product. Different critical capping process parameters can affect rubber stopper defects, <b>rubber</b> stopper compression, <b>container</b> closure integrity, and also crimp cap quality. A sufficiently high force to remove the flip-off button prior to usage is required to ensure quality of the drug product unit by the flip-off button during storage, transportation, and until opening and use. Therefore, the final product is 100...|$|R
50|$|The Port of New Orleans is {{the center}} of the Lower Mississippi River port complex in Louisiana. Connected to America's heartland by the great 23,300 {{kilometer}} inland waterway of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, the Port of New Orleans is the port of choice {{for a wide range of}} cargoes that include <b>rubber,</b> coffee, steel, <b>containers,</b> and manufactured goods. Some 6,000 vessels and 500 million tons of cargo travel up and down the Mississippi River each year, including over half of the country's grain exports. With this extremely high rate of traffic, the Port of New Orleans is seen as the center point of American waterway trade.|$|R
50|$|By 1950, International Shoe had the {{capability}} to make 70 million pairs of shoes a year; its businesses also included tanneries, <b>rubber</b> heels, cement, <b>containers,</b> and material for shoe linings. Rand's death the previous year began {{a change in the}} company's outlook as the Rand family influence began to decrease. Frank Rand's sons Edgar E. Rand and Henry Hale Rand both served as president, but the company began a period of diversification due to the influence of Maurice R. Chambers even before he became president in 1962. Major acquisitions included high-end shoe maker Florsheim in 1952, Canada's largest shoe maker Savage Shoes, Ltd. in 1954, and Caribe Shoe Corporation of Puerto Rico in 1958. That last deal led to the closing of a plant in Chester, Illinois, that had operated since 1916 and was making 5,000 shoes a day. A retail division began in 1959, and International Shoe began buying companies in other countries and even in businesses other than shoes.|$|R
40|$|Storage yards at {{container}} terminals serve as temporary buffers for inbound and outbound <b>containers.</b> <b>Rubber</b> tyred gantry cranes (RTGCs) {{are the most}} frequently used equipment in yards for container han-dling. The efficiency of yard operations heavily depends on the productivity of these RTGCs. As the workload distribution in the yard changes over time, dynamic deployment of RTGCs among storage blocks (container stacking areas) is an important issue of terminal operations management. This paper addresses the crane deployment problem. Given the forecasted workload of each block in each period of a day, the objective is to find the times and routes of crane movements among blocks so that the total delayed workload in the yard is minimized. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and solved by Lagrangean relaxation. To improve the performance of this approach, we augment the Lagrangean relaxation model by adding additional constraints and modify the solution procedure accordingly. Computational experiments show that the modified Lagrangean relaxation method generate...|$|R
