5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the <b>ruling</b> <b>in</b> Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's <b>ruling</b> <b>in</b> Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{to slavery}} began to {{organize}} in Indiana around 1805, and in 1809 abolitionists {{took control of}} the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves. By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution. In 1820, an Supreme Court of Indiana <b>ruling</b> <b>in</b> Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state. An additional Supreme Court <b>ruling</b> <b>in</b> 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark, helping {{to bring an end to}} indentured servitude.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus <b>ruling</b> <b>in</b> the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} of the <b>ruling</b> <b>in</b> Anisminic, {{it appears that}} there may be {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide.

The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
