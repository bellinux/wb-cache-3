5|$|Sagan {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} told on the <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he had to ride hard {{to stay away from the}} chasing group, but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway. Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Board of State Park Advisers was {{established}} under a 1925 state law. The law, which was amended in 1931, gave {{the director of}} the Illinois Department of Public Works jurisdiction over the state parks. The Public Works position was a result of 1917 reforms by Governor Frank Lowden. The law also mandated a system of state parks, under the Illinois Department of Conservation, later renamed the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Per the 1925 mandate, White Pines Forest became a state park in 1927 after its proponents enlisted the support of the Chicago Tribune and WGN <b>Radio.</b> <b>That</b> year, Governor Len Small moved to purchase White Pines for $63,949.|$|E

5|$|The actors {{selected}} {{to portray the}} protagonists invested much time and research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, sampling and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a fundamental visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.|$|E
5|$|The {{telegram}} {{was intercepted}} by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor {{and that the}} telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler sent a reply to Göringprepared with Bormann's helpinforming him that, unless he resigned immediately, he would be executed for high treason. Soon afterward, Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring, his staff, and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg. Bormann made an announcement over the <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> Göring had resigned for health reasons.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E

5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength {{afterglow}} emission (ranging from X-ray through <b>radio)</b> <b>that</b> follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E

5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} {{about how}} much danger the production encountered during the 1932–33 winter season. The Hollywood Reporter said in October 1932 that the Nanuk {{was caught in the}} ice off Alaska and sled dog teams had to be used to rescue the film crew. However, crew on the film noted that the Nanuk wintered in Grantley Harbor at Teller. A press release by MGM in November 1932 claimed that the Nanuk reported via <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> it was frozen in the sea ice and drifting with 35 people aboard, unable to continue shooting until the spring. A report by the New York Times in February 1933 also claimed the Nanuk was locked in sea ice between Teller and Barrow. Peter Freuchen also relates that the Nanuk was blown off course by heavy winds several times.|$|E
5|$|With ten laps of {{the race}} remaining, Rossi {{reported}} to his team over the <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> his front tyres were degrading, while Vandoorne was experiencing the same issue. King quickly closed the gap to Yelloly and overtook him for ninth place on the 32nd lap. Vandoorne held the lead for the remainder {{of the race}} and crossed the start/finish line after 40 laps to secure his third consecutive GP2 feature race victory of the season, and his seventh in the series. He finished six seconds ahead of Rossi who reduced his speed, with Leal third on the road, but was issued with a ten-second time penalty upon being judged by the stewards to have been unsafely released from his pit stall. As a result, Canamasas inherited third-place, ahead of Pic and Sirotkin. Leal, Stanaway, Maricello, King and Yelloly rounded out the top-ten points-scoring finishers. Binder, de Jong, Lynn, Gasly and Vișoiu were the next five finishers, with Haryanto, Berthon, Nato, Stöckinger, Cecotto, Negrão and Amberg the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> {{he was losing}} rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E

5|$|Di Grassi {{took over}} the lead with d'Ambrosio second; both drivers were half a lap ahead of the battling drivers, who had more {{available}} electrical energy. Félix da Costa and his teammate Frijns joined the leading group of drivers after being under the minimum pit stop time by three seconds. The safety was deployed for the third (and final) time when Duval stopped on track after leaving the chicane with a battery issue, prematurely ending his race. This allowed the field to close up to di Grassi and d'Ambrosio. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead at the restart. Vergne immediately pushed hard and attempted to pass López for third but the two drivers made contact at the turn three chicane. He attempted the same manoeuvre one lap later but López cut the chicane to avoid hitting Vergne and the latter demanded on his <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> López cede the position. Both Andretti cars were investigated because their pit stop times were faster the minimum permitted time of one minute because the team believed it was 57 seconds. López drew near to d'Ambrosio and Vergne remained close behind López. The battle allowed di Grassi {{to pull away from}} the field. Félix da Costa slowed and stopped his car on the 33rd lap with a broken driveshaft, causing him to retire. His teammate Frijns was issued with a drive-through penalty for being below the minimum pit stop time. Two laps later, López pushed hard and steered onto the outside line in an attempt to pass d'Ambrosio but spun under braking for the first corner, sliding off into the turn's run-off area. Buemi activated FanBoost and lined up an overtake on Rosenqvist (who locked his front tyres) but spun under braking for turn one, and narrowly avoided striking López's stranded car. Both drivers fell down the order. The electrical power in Engel's car depleted slowly after exiting turns five and six, ending his race. Buemi recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 40, completing a circuit at one minute and 3.102 seconds. This earned him one championship point. D'Ambrosio continued to hold back Vergne and the remaining seven cars behind him had more electrical energy available. D'Ambrosio locked his tyres under braking for the first corner, allowing Vergne to pass him for second place. Vergne then started to draw closer to di Grassi.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{attacked}} Heidfeld but {{collided with}} the rear-end of his car at turn eight, send him spinning {{into the path of}} his teammate Rosenqvist, who was unable to swerve to avoid him, and ploughed into his vehicle. It came after Rosenqvist was sent airborne following contact with Evans's rear wheel. Despite his vehicle's back-end sustaining damage, Evans told his team over the <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he could continue, but Rosenqvist was forced to retire. Prost however was delayed long enough to allow Evans move ahead of him for fifth place. Heidfeld was unhurt and was able to rejoin the race. On lap 44, D'Ambrosio lost third position to Bird who passed him around the outside at turn three. D'Ambrosio then ran out of electrical energy, allowing Gutiérrez into tenth. Di Grassi conserved his electrical energy usage and crossed the start/finish line after 45 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 1.966 seconds behind with Bird in third, Evans fourth and Prost fifth. López recovered from his lap 35 spin to secure sixth place, and Abt took seventh. Carroll, Piquet and Gutiérrez completed the top-ten points-scoring positions. Frijns, Heidfeld, Buemi and d'Ambrosio filled the next four positions with Sarrazin and Rosenqvist the last of the classified finishers. It was di Grassi's first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Di Grassi's win ended e.Dams-Renault's streak of six consecutive victories, extending back to the 2016 Berlin ePrix. Four drivers led the field and the lead changed three times {{during the course of the}} ePrix. Di Grassi led once for a total of 19 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the Viet Cong, a helicopter gunship from the U.S. 68th Assault Helicopter Company {{was shot down}} and crashed in the Quảng Giao rubber plantation, about four kilometres away from Bình Giã, killing four of its crewmen. On December 31, the U.S. Marines Advisory Group sent a team of four personnel, led by Captain Donald G. Cook, to Bình Giã to observe conditions on the battlefield. At the same time, the 4th Marine Battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover {{the bodies of the}} dead American crewmen. Acting against the advice of his American advisor, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho, commander of the 4th Marine Battalion, sent his 2/4th Marine Battalion company out to the Quảng Giao rubber plantation. Unknown to the 4th Marine Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment had assembled in the plantation. About one hour after they had departed from the village of Bình Giã, the commander of the 2/4th Marine Battalion reported via <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> his troops had found the helicopter wreckage, and the bodies of four American crewmen. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong opened fire and the 2/4th Marine Battalion was forced to pull back. In an attempt to save the 2nd Company, the entire 4th Marine Battalion was sent out to confront the Viet Cong. As the lead element of the 4th Marine Battalion closed in on the Quảng Giao plantation, they were hit by accurate Viet Cong artillery fire, which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks. Having absorbed heavy casualties from the Viet Cong's ambush, the 2/4th Marine Battalion had to fight {{their way out of the}} plantation with their bayonets fixed. During the entire ordeal, the company did not receive artillery support because the plantation was beyond the range of 105mm artillery guns based in Phước Tuy and Bà Rịa. They however escaped with the crucial support of the U.S. aircraft and helicopters whose rocket attacks forced the enemy to pull back and halted their attempt at pursuit.|$|E
