50|$|As we can {{see from}} this figure, the {{majority}} of collaborative activities in conventional libraries are co-located and synchronous, whereas collaborative activities relating to digital libraries are more remote and synchronous.

A prototype of the WPA was developed on Google Glass for supporting surgeons in three di↵erent scenarios: (1) touch-less interaction with medical images, (2) tele-presence during surgeries, and (3) mobile access to Electronic Patient Records (EPR) during ward rounds. We evaluated the system in a clinical simulation facility and found that while the WPA can be a viable solution for touch-less interaction and <b>remote</b> <b>collaborations</b> during surgeries, using the WPA in the ward rounds might interfere with social interaction between clinicians and patients.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel corpus of natural language dialogues obtained from humans performing a cooperative, remote, search task (CReST) as it occurs naturally {{in a variety}} of scenarios (e. g., search and rescue missions in disaster areas). This corpus is unique in that it involves <b>remote</b> <b>collaborations</b> between two interlocutors who each have to perform tasks that require the other’s assistance. In addition, one interlocutor’s tasks require physical movement through an indoor environment as well as interactions with physical objects within the environment. The multi-modal corpus contains the speech signals as well as transcriptions of the dialogues, which are additionally annotated for dialog structure, disfluencies, and for constituent and dependency syntax. On the dialogue level, the corpus was annotated for separate dialogue moves, based on the classification developed by Carletta et al. (1997) for coding task-oriented dialogues. Disfluencies were annotated using the scheme developed by Lickley (1998). The syntactic annotation comprises POS annotation, Penn Treebank style constituent annotations as well as dependency annotations based on the dependencies of pennconverter. 1...|$|R

50|$|In February 2016, Meron Gribetz {{introduced}} the Meta 2 at TED (conference). The Meta 2 consisted of an augmented reality headset {{that makes it}} possible for users to see, grab and interact with move holograms in a natural fashion. The headset has an onboard color camera (720p) and four speakers for near-ear audio. It supports Windows-based applications (Mac applications expected later in 2016). Meta 2 is fully hand-controlled, with types of AR applications that include 3D modeling, web browsing, and <b>remote</b> <b>collaboration</b> (e.g., colleagues in different locations can view and manipulate holograms with their hands). At TED, Gribetz suggested this new technology was designed to allow users to interact with virtual objects yet maintain their sense of presence and interaction with their natural surroundings rather than being focused or distracted by traditional 2D computer screens. Meta currently produces augmented reality technology that enables users to interact with virtual objects rendered by a head-mounted display.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates two current advancements of collaborative technologies for architectural design. The paper focuses on technologies that support synchronous design collaboration, in particular, 3 D virtual worlds for supporting <b>remote</b> design <b>collaboration,</b> and tangible user interfaces (TUIs) for enhancing co-located design collaboration. Both technologies enable designers to collaborate by interacting with 3 D models as the design representations. The paper analyzes {{the effect of}} these technologies on design collaboration and cognition through a comprehensive interpretation of the results from two independent studies. These two studies, using protocol analysis and each focusing on a different mode of design collaboration, provide the foundation for characterizing the designers' cognition, communication and interaction when using the new technologies. The 3 D virtual worlds study investigates <b>remote</b> design <b>collaboration</b> in a 3 D virtual world {{in order to understand the}} changes of design behavior when designers are physically remote but virtually co-located as avatars within their design representation in the form of a 3 D model.
