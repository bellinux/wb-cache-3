25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} refrigeration systems, {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} organic loading on BOD and COD removal in primary facultative ponds. The study was based on six full-scale pond plants in which average removals of unfiltered biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 72 and 50 %, respectively. For filtered samples, the removals were 89 and 83 %, respectively. First-order <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> assuming ideal hydraulic patterns (completely mixed and plug-flow) decreased with increments in the mean hydraulic retention time (HRT). Reduction in organic loading also caused a decrease in <b>removal</b> <b>rates.</b> The results emphasized that HRT and surface organic loading are more reliable to estimate first-order <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> than traditional Arrhenius-style equations.

500|$|By the 1900s, feral horse {{populations were}} in decline, {{and there was}} concern that the horses were {{destroying}} land and resources wanted by ranching and hunting interests.

[...] By the 1950s, modern practices for capturing [...] horses {{came to the attention of}} individuals such as Velma Bronn Johnston, also known as [...] "Wild Horse Annie," [...] who felt the measures were extreme and cruel. Their activism resulted in the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act in 1959. However, the 1959 Act did not resolve all the advocate's concerns, leading to the passage of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service manage these herds. Although the BLM struggled to implement adequate herd management in many areas, in 1973 they began a successful program for rounding up excess numbers, and adopting out these captured horses and burros to private owners. [...] This remains the primary method of removing excess horses and burros from managed land, though in recent years the adoption rate has not kept up with the <b>removal</b> <b>rate,</b> and most horses are currently diverted to long-term holding facilities.

In this paper, it was {{investigated}} the changes of structure of sepiolites under different conditions of acid treatments and heat treatments using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR). At the same time, through the tannin adsorption experiments, it was studied the changes adsorption properties of sepiolites by acid treatments and heat treatments.

I also examined the variability in NO 3 <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> between riparian sites and the relationship between patches of elevated organic matter in the subsoil and groundwater NO 3 <b>removal</b> <b>rates.</b> My study was based on a mesocosm approach to stimulate NO 3 dynamics in the shallow groundwater. These mesocosms were obtained from paired forested and suburban (mowed vegetation dominated by non-woody species) vegetated areas at two different sites. Intact horizontal mesocosms (15 cm diam., 40 cm long PVC cores) were extracted from fine to medium textured sands. The soils were derived from stratified glacial drift and were classified as Typic humaquepts or Umbric endoaquods. At each site, I obtained mesocosms from at least 35 cm below the dormant season water table depth. These mesocosms were placed in a controlled environment chamber and continuously dosed with bromide and NO 3 amended groundwater for 71 days. Mass balance calculations were completed to determine the rate of groundwater NO 3 -N removal from each saturated mesocosm. There was no significant difference in groundwater NO 3 <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> between forested and suburban vegetated areas within sites.

30|$|Pathogen {{contamination}} (e.g., bacteria, protozoa, and viruses) poses {{a serious}} risk in water resources. The transport of pathogens from surface water to groundwater increases {{the vulnerability of}} groundwater (Jin and Flury [2002]). These authors reported that 70 % of the water-borne microbial illness outbreaks in the United States {{have been associated with}} ground water. Pathogens such as viruses are much smaller than bacteria and protozoa, and many can potentially reach groundwater through porous soil matrices. Jin and Flury ([2002]) reviewed the fate and transport of viruses in porous media to understand mechanisms and modeling of virus sorption, and concluded that factors such as solution chemistry, virus properties, soil properties, temperature, and association with solid particle influences virus survival, transport, and sorption in porous media.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The 1990 {{contract}} and the 1991 fundholding scheme encouraged speculation that general practitioners (GPs) may remove patients from their lists for financial reasons. Despite assertions that patient removals are increasing, little evidence {{exists on the}} number or trends in removals. AIM: To describe the epidemiology of removals by time, place, and person, and to determine whether removals have increased in recent years. METHOD: Descriptive analysis of routine data relating to all removals of Sheffield residents from GP lists during 1991 - 1996. RESULTS: Removal from a doctor's list was a rare event (2. 4 per 1000 patients per year) that did not become more common over the period examined. <b>Removal</b> <b>rates</b> varied by age, sex, and practice, with relatively high rates among children, young women, and the over- 75 s. There was a significant tendency for higher <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> in more deprived parts of the city. CONCLUSION: <b>Removal</b> <b>rates</b> have not increased in Sheffield. The reasons for the variation in rates by age, sex, and practice are unknown.
