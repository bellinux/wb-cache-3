5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled <b>refugees</b> have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese <b>refugees</b> resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the <b>refugees</b> surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against <b>refugees</b> were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the <b>refugees</b> {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the <b>refugees</b> to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the <b>refugees</b> who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants.

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to review}} the growing body of {{research}} on the psychosocial well-being of <b>refugee</b> children.

Next, we briefly summarize the literature on <b>refugee</b> children’s mental health as the starting point for a critical reflection on the dominance of the symptom-focused, trauma-centred approach which characterises much of <b>refugee</b> research.

40|$|<b>Refugee</b> {{photography}} {{is often used}} to convey situations of precariousness and urgency, as visibility can help raise awareness and elicit empathy. Critical perspectives in relation to photographic representations can provide more nuanced understandings of <b>refugee</b> lived experiences over time.

These photographs depict different <b>refugee</b> situations from some 20 to 35 years ago. As a <b>refugee</b> studies scholar interested in visual-based research, I wished to analyze how <b>refugee</b> lived experiences were represented through these photographs from another era. The application of the iconographic-iconologic image framework suggests various themes evoked through these photographs, which still have currency in today's highly polemic discourses on the global <b>refugee</b> regime and are still prominent in present-day discourses and contemporary <b>refugee</b> literature. This qualitative analysis shows the potential of photographs to highlight how precarious <b>refugee</b> situations persist over time despite intense international efforts in this field.
