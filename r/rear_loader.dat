50|$|A unique rear-loading system {{involves}} a <b>rear</b> <b>loader</b> and a front-loading tractor (usually a Caterpillar front loader with a Tink Claw) for yard waste collection (and in some cities, garbage and recycling). The front loader picks up yard waste {{set in the}} street, and then loaded {{into the back of}} a <b>rear</b> <b>loader.</b> This system is used in several cities, including San Jose.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>loaders</b> have {{an opening}} at the rear that a waste {{collector}} can throw waste bags or empty the contents of bins into. Often in many areas they have a lifting mechanism to automatically empty large carts without the operator having to lift the waste by hand.|$|R
50|$|The WSI {{brand is}} a very big company for solid waste {{collection}} in Canada. The company predecessor was Capital Waste Services it was slowly absorbed into WSI just after the foundation of the company in 2001. The company has an enormous fleet of trucks in Canada and the U.S., the trucks are mostly front <b>loader</b> with some <b>rear</b> <b>loaders</b> and side loaders (mostly Labrie Expert 2000's). Today the company's website is still up but the company is defunct after merging in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|A grapple {{truck is}} a truck {{that has a}} grapple loader mounted to its frame which is used for loading and {{sometimes}} hauling bulky waste. A grapple loader is defined by ANSI Z245.1 as:“a hydro-mechanical device able to rotate on an axis with a grapple or bucket attached {{at the end of}} the bottom, which is intended for the collection of waste that due to size and/or weight is impractical to containerize.” [...] Grapple trucks are commonly used by municipal sanitation or public works departments, and by waste collection companies. Grapple trucks can also sometimes be used in road construction and repair. There are six types of bulky waste collection system in which grapple trucks are used: loader and body systems, rear steer system, rolloff systems, <b>rear</b> mounted <b>loader</b> and haul truck systems, <b>rear</b> mounted <b>loader</b> and trailer systems, and transfer systems.|$|R
50|$|Another popular {{system for}} the <b>rear</b> <b>loader</b> is a rear load {{container}} specially built to fit a groove in the truck. The truck will have a chain or cable system for upending the container. The waste will then slide into the hopper of the truck.|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>rear</b> <b>loader</b> usually {{compacts}} {{the waste}} using a hydraulically powered mechanism that employs a moving plate or shovel to scoop the waste {{out from the}} loading hopper and compress it against a moving wall. In most compactor designs, the plate has a pointed edge (hence giving it the industry standard name packer blade) {{which is designed to}} apply point pressure to the waste to break down bulky items in the hopper before being drawn into {{the main body of the}} truck.|$|E
40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional control valve spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves. This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different load control valves, directional control valve spools, restrictors, hoses and sequence valves. Measurements are done with a <b>rear</b> <b>loader</b> and they include flow and pressure measuring. These measurements are done to figure out which combination is the best compromise between energy consumption, oscillations and cost. This compromise should also fill all standardization requirements. Several solutions are found that are not ideal, one solution which is recommended and a couple of which are recommended in case oscillations are still needed to be degreased. Future solutions are also discussed but they require many changes to the hydraulic fundamentals of the refuse collectors. These solutions are likely to be possible for the coming generations of refuse collectors...|$|E
5000|$|The TUSK {{system is}} a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be {{upgraded}} without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in maneuver warfare, items like the <b>rear</b> slat armor, <b>loader's</b> gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the [...]50 in caliber machine gun {{will be added to}} the entire M1A2 fleet over time.|$|R
