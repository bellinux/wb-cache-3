During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's <b>Radar</b> <b>Target</b> Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{designated}} a stealth fighter, measures {{were taken to}} reduce the Typhoon's radar cross section (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect. An example of these measures is that the Typhoon has jet inlets that conceal {{the front of the}} jet engine (a strong <b>radar</b> <b>target)</b> from radar. Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept, so will reflect radar energy well away from the front sector. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing leading edges, the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and strakes.|$|E

This paper deals with the application of time-frequency decompositions for improving the performance of neural networks for this kind of targets.

The proposed detector is compared with a single neural network for radar detection, showing that time-frequency decompositions improve the performance of neural networks for slow fluctuating <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> detection, specially for low values of the probability of false alarm.

40|$|Abstract-The use of {{information}} theory to design waveforms for the measurement of extended <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> exhibiting reso-nance phenomena is investigated. The target impulse response is introduced to model target scattering behavior. Two radar waveform design problems with constraints on waveform energy and duration are then solved. In the first, a deterministic target impulse response is used to design waveform/receiver-filter pairs for the optima 1 detection of extended targets in additive noise. In the second, a random target impulse response is used to design waveforms that maximize the mutual information between a target ensemble and the received signal in additive Gaussian noise. The two solutions are contrasted to show {{the difference between the}} characteristics of waveforms for extended target de-tection and information extraction. The optimal target detection solution places as much energy as possible in the largest target scattering mode under the imposed constraints on waveform duration and energy. The optimal information extraction solution distributes the energy among the target scattering modes in order to maximize the mutual information between the target ensemble and the received radar waveform.

40|$|Radar {{signatures}} of complex targets for different frequencies, aspect angles and target positions {{are needed in}} various radar application areas. In addition, specific scattering centers of complex real <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> have a strong impact on the overall signature of the target. However, measurements are mostly inefficient for providing the required information and for studying the behaviour of such targets, {{as well as for}} performing the required radar tasks. Thus, radar signature predictions are very important in radar applications and are basically derived by applying numerical modeling tools developed within the computational electromagnetics community. In this paper, numerical modeling results of radar signatures for various large and complex targets are presented, which highlight recent advances in two different simulation codes developed at FGAN-FHR. The main objective of the simulations is to study the electromagnetic properties of significant scattering centers like deep cavities, which often arise in real <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> (aircraft, vehicles etc.). Another important task is to investigate the high resolution range profile (HRRP) behaviour of such structures as well as the effect of those scattering centers to the overall radar cross section (RCS) of the corresponding targets. Further, the presented simulation results provide investigation of the trade-off between computation time and accuracy for the applied numerical modeling methods, which is very important for successful and accurate simulation of complex <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> with reasonable computation times...|$|R
