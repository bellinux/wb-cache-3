25|$|The {{field of}} {{clinical}} psychology {{in most countries}} is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the U.S., professional ethics are largely defined by the APA Code of Conduct, which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as {{it is designed to}} guide <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior,</b> the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} antecedents {{and consequences of}} felt responsibility for constructive change {{within the context of}} corporate social responsibility (CSR). A moderated mediation model is proposed wherein proactive personality predicts felt responsibility, which in turn influences three types of individual-level socially (ir) responsibile behaviors both within and beyond organizational boundaries (i. e., socially <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors</b> in the workplace, counterproductive work <b>behaviors,</b> and socially <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors</b> outside the workplace). Perceptions of CSR were predicted to place a situational boundary condition on the effects of felt responsibility. Predictions tested on a large employee sample showed that proactive personality drives socially (ir) <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors</b> via felt responsibility, but that when individuals perceive a high level of CSR, the predictive power of felt responsibility is diminished (illustrating the potential power of socially responsible workplace environments). The findings from this work shed light on best-practices for the development of CSR initiatives in addition to furthering our understanding of individual-level responsibility. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is broad}} {{consensus}} {{on the need to}} shift to a new paradigm of lifestyles and economic development, given the unsustainability of current patterns. Research on consumer behavior is to {{play a crucial role in}} shedding light on the motives underpinning the adoption of <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Stemming from a thorough discussion of existing approaches, this book argues that the perspective of analysis has to be modified. First, acknowledging that a profile of the responsible consumer does not exist, since all of us can be more or less sustainable and environment-friendly: the sustainability of an individual should not be considered as given, being something dynamic that changes according to both subjective and contextual factors. Moreover, the book hypothesizes that integrating dimensions and perspectives that have been so far overlooked by mainstream research will help deconstruct <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors</b> adopting a flexible and holistic approach. Relevant policy implications are discussed, and empirical research on <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors</b> is illustrated. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of consumer behavior, sustainable consumption, environmental psychology and environmental studies in general...|$|R
30|$|Socially <b>responsible</b> {{consumption}} <b>behavior</b> {{can be one}} of {{the consumer}} characteristics and is closely related to CSR (Carroll 1991; Mohr et al. 2001). Those consumers showing high levels of socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behavior</b> recognized the obligation to make socially responsible consumption decisions and expect companies to operate responsibly to address social and environmental issues. Socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behavior</b> may closely relate to consumers’ motivation to consider CTSCA information and also affect their overall responses.|$|R
25|$|Relationship {{quality is}} {{positively}} associated with partners' level of conscientiousness, and highly conscientious people {{are less likely to}} get divorced. Conscientiousness is associated with lower rates of behavior associated with divorce, such as extramarital affairs, spousal abuse, and alcohol abuse. Conscientious behaviors may have a direct influence on relationship quality, as people low in conscientiousness are less responsible, less responsive to their partners, are more condescending, and less likely to hold back offensive comments. On the other hand, more conscientious people are better at managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, perhaps because they elicit less criticism due to their well-controlled and <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
25|$|CSR {{is known}} for {{impacting}} employee turnover. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and {{that the ability to}} retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> and therefore reduces employee turnover. Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of university students’ background variables (gender, age, grade and natu re experience) on their <b>responsible</b> environmental <b>behaviors.</b> A total number of 307 students (134 females, 173 males) enrolled in various departments of Akdeniz University constituted the sample of the study. University Students’ <b>Responsible</b> Environmental <b>Behavior</b> Scale (USREBS) developed by the authors was used for this investigation. USREBS included 33 items on a six point Likert type scale (never to always) and consisted of seven sub-dimensions with acceptable reliability coefficient values (political behavior – α =. 91, warning behavior – α =. 84; legal behavior – α =. 84; recycling behavior – α =. 72; physical protection behavior – α =. 69; saving behavior – α =. 76 and persuasion – α =. 86). Separate MANOVA analyses revealed that university students’ <b>responsible</b> environmental <b>behaviors</b> significantly varied across gender, grade, reading nature-related publications and participation in nature-related activities.

30|$|Consumers’ {{consideration}} of a company’s CSR efforts {{may be affected}} by consumer characteristics and socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behavior.</b> Consumers are not a homogenous group {{in terms of their}} socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behavior</b> (Gonzalez et al. 2009) and those consumers with a higher level of awareness and concern regarding CSR respond more positively to a company’s CSR practices (Tian et al. 2011). Öberseder et al. (2013) further found that consumers more positively evaluate a firm’s CSR practices when there is congruency between a consumers and a firm’s identity. Even though many researchers have confirmed that a firm’s CSR practices can positively influence consumer responses (Mohr and Webb 2005; Sen and Bhattacharya 2001; Tian et al. 2011), no study has yet examined the relationship with the {{consideration of}} consumer characteristics of socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behavior.</b> There is a clear need to understand the relationship between socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behavior</b> and consumer responses, and to apply this understanding when evaluating the practical effects of the presence of CTSCA disclosure on an apparel retailer’s website on consumer responses.|$|R

In specific, the present study measured the true effects of the CTSCA on consumer responses by using socially <b>responsible</b> consumption <b>behaviors</b> as covariates.

Although addressing CTSCA requirements on the website is not required for all retailers, the findings of the study revealed that the CTSCA disclosure on the website would provide beneficial outcomes with retailers.
