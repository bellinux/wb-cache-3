In the 1950s the froth flotation technique was adapted for deinking recycled paper. Use of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> increased in the 1970s mainly in graphic and hygienic papers, and accelerated in the 1980s. The annual growth in use of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> increased by 6% between 1980 and 1996. The use of virgin fibres only increased 2% in the same period. In 1997 <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> production was 42% of the total paper production.|$|E

40|$|Europe {{is one of}} {{the global}} leaders in paper recycling. <b>Recovered</b> <b>paper</b> is an {{indispensable}} raw material (around 50 % of the fibrous raw material is <b>recovered</b> <b>paper),</b> which contributes to the sustainability of the sector. However, certain factors do have a limiting influence on the possibility of an extended use of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper,</b> such as the quality of the <b>recovered</b> <b>paper,</b> the poor sorting activities, the price for <b>recovered</b> <b>paper,</b> the acceptance/demand of recovered paper-containing products by the consumers, the recyclability of the paper products, etc. Against this background, the COST Action E 48 – “The limits of paper recycling” – has analyzed the issues that predominantly influence the competitiveness of the paper and board recycling industry, and detected potentials for an extended use of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> in the European paper industry.

40|$|The {{recovery}} and utilization of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> have increased over past decades {{all over the}} world due to economic, environmental, and social issues. However, {{it is well known that}} an extended <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> collection is detrimental to its quality, either by the exploitation of lower quality sources such as households, or the spreading of commingled systems instead of selective collection systems. The influence of these two factors was assessed by analyzing the quality of different <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> grades used as raw material in a mill located in Madrid (Spain) producing newsprint and light weight coated paper from <b>recovered</b> <b>paper.</b> Part 1 of the paper deals with the impact of increased collection rates on the quality of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> and Part 2 with the use of commingled collection systems. Results of Part 1 show that increased collection rates have a large impact on the quality of the <b>recovered</b> <b>paper.</b> The quality, measured as total unusable material and moisture contents, had deteriorated very rapidly in only four years (2005 - 2008) as a consequence of increased collection rates. Collection rates increased in Spain from 58. 5 % to 68. 6 % during this period, resulting in more than 50 % increase of total unusable material and 25 % of moisture content. The downgrading of the quality of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> is one of the major threats for extending the current limits of paper recycling. Therefore, future challenge is to increase its availability but maintaining its quality...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Near-infrared (NIR) {{spectroscopy}} is {{a widely}} used method for material identification for laboratory and industrial applications. While standard spectrometers only allow measurements at one sampling point at a time, NIR Spectral Imaging techniques can measure, in real-time, both {{the size and shape}} of an object as well as identify the material the object is made of. The online classification and sorting of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> with NIR Spectral Imaging (SI) is used with success in the paper recycling industry throughout Europe. Recently, the globalisation of the recycling material streams caused that water-based flexographic-printed newspapers mainly from UK and Italy appear also in central Europe. These flexo-printed newspapers are not sufficiently de-inkable with the standard de-inking process originally developed for offset-printed paper. This de-inking process removes the ink from <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> and is the fundamental processing step to produce high-quality paper from <b>recovered</b> <b>paper.</b> Thus, the flexo-printed newspapers are a growing problem for the recycling industry as they reduce the quality of the produced paper if their amount exceeds a certain limit within the <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> material. This paper presents the results of a research project for the development of an automated entry inspection system for <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> that was jointly conducted by CTR AG (Austria) and PTS Papiertechnische Stiftung (Germany). Within the project an NIR SI prototype for the identification of flexo-printed newspaper has been developed. The prototype can identify and sort out flexoprinted newspapers in real-time and achieves a detection accuracy for flexo-printed newspaper of over 95 %. NIR SI, the technology the prototype is based on, allows the development of inspection systems for incoming goods in a paper production facility as well as industrial sorting systems for <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> in the recycling industry in the near future.

40|$|Paper {{is one of}} {{the most}} common mass {{products}} used nowadays. Present paper consumption has reached almost 400 million metric tons globally. Such a huge volume of production requires stable and continuous supply of raw materials in the form of wood and <b>recovered</b> <b>paper.</b> This article presents the current situation in the field of raw materials supply for the paper industry. Firstly it needs to be underlined that in the 21 st century <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> has already become as equally an important raw material as wood, and soon the production of paper from secondary fibre pulps may match the volume of production of paper from virgin pulps. Moreover a detailed insight into future challenges and possibilities of broadening the raw materials base for the production of paper is also given. Finally the best possible methods to ensure a constant supply of wood and <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> for industry are also featured...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{there have been}} {{major changes in the}} trade flows of the raw {{materials}} (pulp logs, wood chips, pulp, and <b>recovered</b> <b>paper)</b> used to make paper. These changes have been driven primarily by the growth of the paper industry in China, the emergence of new suppliers of wood raw materials, and the increased importance of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> as a raw material for the production of paper. China’s paper industry has grown rapidly in the past 10 years, and its output now trails only that of the United States. China, however, lacks the raw materials to support much of its papermaking capacity and thus has become increasingly dependent upon imports of wood pulp, <b>recovered</b> <b>paper,</b> and wood chips. New suppliers of pulp, wood chips, and pulp logs have emerged in recent years as paper producers have looked for cheaper sources of fiber. These ne...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} paper {{we want to}} explore {{a new way to}} handle <b>recovered</b> <b>paper.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand the situation with China. Since years, this country is the most important market for recovered wastepaper collected in western countries from households. The efforts to get it there, necessitate an enormous number of transport movements, both within Europe and outwards to China and this number is growing exponentially. This paper is the result of a research of an alternative collecting and processing (The WastePaper Mining) concept, which will make a substantial contribution to reducing the number of transport movements and alleviating the pressure on infrastructure capacity. It will have potentially great implications for the collection and movement of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper.</b> On the balance that makes it possible to come a big step nearer to achieving sustainable logistics in the <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project {{was focused on}} the improvement of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> processing by flotation deinking for ink removal from deinked pulp. In an integral consideration the challenges of recycling of graphic paper products were defined in eight sub-projects, covering all relevant process steps of recycling (paper recovery, <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> processing, paper production, paper converting). Beside logistic problems in the recovery of office papers, different technological aspects of processing graphic paper products were evaluated and improved. Additionally, <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> processing in industrial operation was optimized. The obtained findings allow in total to produce graphic paper products more recycling-friendly, to recover them more specific by grade and to increase the quality of deinked pulp, resulting in a larger potential for the use of secondary fibers in paper production.

40|$|The need to {{increase}} the recovery rates of recyclables from households, reducing {{at the same time}} the collection costs, has favored the spreading of commingled collection systems. This study presents a thorough analysis of the quality of a secondary source of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> of a Spanish newsprint mill, imported from the United Kingdom, where these systems are widely practiced. The results show that the quality of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> from commingled systems is very far from the quality obtained with selective systems: the unusable material content vary from 1 % to 29 % (11. 9 % on average) compared to less than 1 %. Larger materials recovery facilities (MRF), less oversaturated and with advanced sorting techniques, have demonstrated to be able to render better qualities, the unusable material content varying from 0. 3 % to 16. 6 % (8. 1 % on average). However, the quality is still far from contamination levels typically found with selective systems, especially in terms of non-paper components. This fact limits significantly the use of this <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> for graphic paper production where the major potential for an extended use of <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> in papermaking lies. Furthermore, there is a discussion on the cost efficiency of these systems and how the legislation and private or public initiatives are affecting the spreading of these systems, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom...|$|E
