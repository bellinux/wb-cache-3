The investigation has shown that using the Danish reference year based on the period 1975 - 1990 will result in deviations of up to 39 % compared with thermal performance calculated with multi-yearmeasured weather data. For the newer local <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> based on the period 2001 - 2010 the maximum deviation becomes 25 %. The investigation further showed an increase in utilization with an increase in global radiation.

40|$|Objectives Acoustic neuroma is {{a benign}} tumour {{accounting}} for approximately 6 e 10 % of all intracranial tumours and occurs mainly in patients aged $ 50 years. Our {{aim was to}} investigate {{a wide range of}} occupational exposures, individual occupational titles and socioeconomic status (SES) as potential risk factors for acoustic neuroma. Methods We conducted a population-based caseecontrol study of 793 acoustic neuroma cases identified through the Swedish Cancer Registry and 101 762 randomly selected controls. Information on SES and occupation was obtained from censuses and linked to job-exposure matrices. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and calculate 95 % CIs. Results An increased OR was seen for mercury exposure < 10 <b>years</b> before the <b>reference</b> <b>year</b> (OR 2. 9; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 6. 8), and a more modest association for benzene exposure (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 0 to 3. 2) $ 10 <b>years</b> before the <b>reference</b> <b>year.</b> We observed a threefold increased risk for females working as tailors and dressmakers $ 10 <b>years</b> before the <b>reference</b> <b>year,</b> and a more than threefold significantly elevated OR for those working as truck and conveyor operators < 10 <b>years</b> before the <b>reference</b> <b>year.</b> We found no convincing evidence that SES is related to disease development. Conclusion We observed an increased risk of acoustic neuroma associated with occupational exposure to mercury, benzene and textile dust. Men working as truck and conveyor operators < 10 <b>years</b> before the <b>reference</b> <b>year</b> had the highest increased risk of acoustic neuroma, but it is unclear what in those occupations might contribute to disease development. Our study also suggested an association between acoustic neuroma and being a class teacher or policeman.

Calculated mean relative velocity changes from 2013 to 2014 are shown by green, those from 2011 to 2014 by blue, and those from 2011 to 2013 by cyan. Plots by red indicate the velocity changes in each year to that of 2012.
