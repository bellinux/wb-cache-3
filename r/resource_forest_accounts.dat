40|$|Context: Forests {{provide a}} wide range of goods and services. Monitoring this {{renewable}} resource and all the outputs related is necessary to ensure forest sustainable management. Due to the complexity of the forest sector, a suitable <b>accounting</b> for <b>forests</b> is necessary to consider all costs and benefits. Improvements of <b>forest</b> <b>accounting</b> methods at international level over the last decades have to be continued. Aims: This paper attempts to share the French experience in order to promote <b>forest</b> <b>accounts,</b> and strategic and methodological discussions around forestry statistics. Working on <b>forest</b> <b>accounts</b> should lead to a better harmonization and a lightening of reporting burden while facilitating the use of relevant indicators. Methods: We remind the history of <b>forests</b> <b>accounts</b> and then we present some worthwhile methodological points of the French <b>forest</b> <b>accounting</b> work. Results: We would like to emphasize the difficulties of implementation and the importance of consistency between all statistic processes. Conclusion: We underline in this paper that in order to play a significant role as tool for inducing movement towards ecologically, economically and socially sound policy making, <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> <b>accounting</b> needs for a shift in ways of thinking, claims for further multidisciplinary research in particular in the field of non productive ecosystem services and requires active promotion by powerful actors and international institutions...|$|R
40|$|The urgent {{task for}} the {{effective}} functioning of the national economy {{is the need to}} reflect income from the use of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> in <b>accounting,</b> which will allow management personnel to prove the effectiveness of environmental protection measures, to assess the amount of expenses taken during restoration and protection of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> The study aims at identifying characteristics of forest rent to determine the amount and its reflection in the accounting for its management. The author understands a forest rent as the income received from the owner of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> The above procedure for determining the amount of forest rent can be used to display it in the <b>accounting.</b> A <b>forest</b> rent is a type of business income, so for its reflection in the accounting it is proposed to open the analytical accounts to account 79 named «Financial results». To determine the amount of forest rent and its reflection in the accounting the author suggests the calculation form of a forest rent. In order to manage the size of a forest rent and expenses incurred to obtain it the author proposes to use the information from the developed report about the forest rent formation. The displaying <b>forest</b> rents in <b>accounting</b> will provide accurate and deep information to the management about the revenue and assets of a company. The rational use of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>accounting</b> reflection of a forest rent will strengthen control over the influence of human activity on natural resources and keep the conception of sustainable development. ...|$|R

40|$|In Namibia, as in {{many parts}} of Africa, {{households}} are highly dependent on fastdegrading <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> for their livelihoods, including energy needs. Using data originally collected for Namibia's <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> <b>accounts</b> and insights from a nonseparable household model, this paper empirically estimates household fuelwood demand. In particular, the factors underlying the substitution between fuelwood collected from open access <b>forest</b> <b>resources,</b> cow dung and fuelwood purchased from the market are analysed. Heckman two-step estimates show that households respond to forest scarcity, as measured by the opportunity costs of collecting fuelwood, by increasing labour input to collection more than by reducing energy consumption. There is limited evidence for substitution from fuelwood to other energy sources, particularly with the declining availability of forest stocks. All of the estimated elasticities are low confirming observations made elsewhere, particularly in South Asia. Policy interventions including energy efficiency measures and tree planting schemes are considered in the Namibian context.

40|$|Nowadays, {{deforestation}} of {{territories and}} degradation of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> {{is a global}} problem as it leads to a climate change, soil degradation, the decline in natural reproduction of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and to the disappearance of many valuable species of forest cultures. Due {{to the importance of}} the preservation of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> for environment it is necessary to revise the conceptual approach to the reflection of such resources both at the micro- and at the macroeconomic level. Preservation, rational use and reproduction of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> is one of the priorities of forestry development inUkraine. Accounting is a tool which allows to form the information about the condition and availability of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> In this regard, we consider that the accounting information is an important tool for the preservation of forest assets and the reduction of anthropogenic impacts on these slowly recovering natural resources. The reflection of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> in <b>accounting</b> should be implemented {{on the basis of the}} rules defined in the P(S) BU 30 called «Biological Assets» and IAS 41 called «Agriculture». In addition, we consider that while reflecting of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> in <b>accounting</b> it’s necessary to take into account the life cycle of the tree stand which consists of several stages where each one should be taken into account in the recognition of expenses on their reproduction. For the formation of analytical cuts of the costs of care for the <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and their protection is proposed to open the following 3 sub-accounts to the account 155 called «Expenses on the formation of forest resources»: the first is «Expenses on the landing of forest cultures», the second is «Expenses on care for forest resources» and the third one is «Expenses on the protection of forest resources». Sustainable forest management involves the reproduction of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> One of the main criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of forest management on the basis of sustainable development is the increasing of their productivity, the achievement and maintenance of high level of sanitary state of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and provision of stable viability of forest ecosystems providing appropriate security and protection of <b>forest</b> <b>resources.</b> The proposed method of <b>accounting</b> of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> matches to the basic principles of the concept of sustainable development as it allows to generate the information about the reproduction of natural capital in the system of accounting and business entities reporting. The proposed changes in accounting will improve the enterprise management system of forest complex by forming the complete and reliable information about the availability and condition of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>forest</b> products.

The adaptation of the model to country-specific situations gives the possibility to further enhance the model calculations. ContextWith the rising demand for energy from renewable sources, up-to-date information about the available amount of biomass on a sustainable basis coming from forests became of interest to a wide group of stakeholders. The complexity of answering the question about amounts of biomass potentials from forests thereby increases from the regional to the European level. AimsThe described ITOC model aims at providing a tool to develop a comparable data basis for the actual biomass potentials for consumption. MethodsThe ITOC model uses a harmonized net annual increment from the National Forest Inventories as a default value for the potential harvestable volume of timber. The model then calculates the total theoretical potential of biomass <b>resources</b> from <b>forests.</b> By <b>accounting</b> for harvesting restrictions and losses, the theoretical potential of biomass <b>resources</b> from <b>forests</b> is reduced and the actual biomass potentials for consumption estimated. ResultsThe results from ITOC model calculations account for the difference between the amounts of wood measured in the forests and the actual biomass potentials which might be available for consumption under the model assumptions. ConclusionThe gap between <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> assessments and biomass potentials which are available for consumption can be addressed by using the ITOC model calculation results...|$|R

Forest products used for fuel, poles, timber and non-timber {{were included in the}} accounts, but charcoal production on private land was excluded. Forest use directly contributed some 3 per cent of the gross national product, N$ 1 �billion (US$ 160 �million), and the total direct and indirect economic impact of forest use in the broader economy was some N$ 1. 8 billion (US$ 288 �million). The standing forest assets had an estimated capital value of N$ 19 billion (US$ 304 �million), comparable with the values for fish, minerals and wildlife. On a national level, stocks are underused. However, some localised over-harvesting occurs, which might be ameliorated through community forest management and trade in products, but capture of resource rent by government should be restricted to commercial forest use. forests, use value, asset value, resource accounts, Namibia,...|$|R

This paper attempts {{to examine the relationship between}} economic value and species diversity of a hill dipterocarp forest in Peninsular Malaysia. The rank-abundance curve described a lognormal distribution pattern, indicating high diversity communities. The species diversity indices obtained were high: Fisher’s alpha diversity index ranged from 96. 53 to 109. 56, Shannon-Weiner index were 5. 29 to 5. 39, while values of Simpson Index ranged from 134. 02 to 151. 11. The estimated mean stumpage value per hectare was Malaysian Ringgit RM 25 413 and the main contribution was from the family Dipterocarpaceae. The regression analysis showed that the relationship between stumpage value and species diversity was not significant at the 5 % level (p> 0. 05). Timber volume, size of trees and the presence of high timber value have great influence on the stumpage value for a given forest area...|$|R

Based on forest production and trade data for China, we present a conceptual framework for resource flow analysis, calculate the quantities and analyze the characteristics of flows of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> (primarily wood and wood byproducts) during the critical early economic development of China (from 1953 to 2000) by converting the <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> flows into log equivalents (i. e., the quantity of logs required to generate a unit of each type of product). The consumption of <b>forest</b> <b>resources</b> has accelerated throughout the study period, and the structure and efficiency of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> utilization have both improved. The proportion of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> flows obtained from outside China has increased, and most of this wood was consumed by wood-processing industries.
