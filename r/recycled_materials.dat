5|$|In autumn 2011, North Michigan Avenue was {{completely}} repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable stone-matrix asphalt pavement mix that incorporated {{high levels of}} <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and asphalt millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills. The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street. In July 2012, the City of Chicago and CDOT were honored with the Environmental Leadership Award from the National Asphalt Pavement Association.|$|E

After his home {{was destroyed by}} a fire in 2007, Simon redesigned it to be environmentally friendly; much of the interior is constructed from <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> while solar panels provide virtually its entire power needs. The building has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certificate. He had an extensive art collection; he owned paintings by Thomas Hart Benton, John Singer Sargent {{and one of the}} original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. He also had a sculpture by Robert Graham and works by Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren, Ed Ruscha and Richard Estes.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper deals with behavior of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> at higher temperature. Assessment of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> influence {{takes place on}} four kinds of thermoplastic materials, which are always high-heat polycarbonate (PC-HT) with different amount of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> (pure polycarbonate, polycarbonate with twenty percent of <b>recycled</b> <b>material,</b> polycarbonate with thirty percent of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> and hundred percent of recycled polycarbonate). Specimens were prepared by the mostly used technology for production products, which is injection molding. Each kind of material is one by one loaded by high temperature 110 °C and consequently tested. This temperature was chosen because we encounter products made with <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> additive, {{which can be used}} at elevated temperatures. To determine behavior of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> at this high temperature, one basic mechanic material tests is used.

40|$|Abstract. This work aims to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> and effect of particle size on the mechanical properties of the <b>recycled</b> <b>material.</b> Tested material is polyamide 6. Every manufacture of any plastic parts produces {{a certain amount of}} waste, such as defective injects or cold runner system from injection molding technology. When size of this material is reduced, particles of different sizes are made. From large particles similar to the original granulate material, to dust particles. This size variation can cause problems during subsequent processing. These particles of different size have distinct melting rate.

25|$|The {{amount of}} energy saved through {{recycling}} depends upon the material being recycled {{and the type of}} energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life-cycle analysis using real energy values. In addition, exergy, which is a measure of useful energy can be used.

This investigation includes both, <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> in direct contact with food and <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> separated by a virgin polymer layer (functional barrier) from the food. The objective was to study the efficiency of functional barriers with regard to the transfer of inadmissible compounds. However, the results of the experimental migration data lead to the development of a mathematical model that takes the impurification of a functional barrier layer into account. In the third part of the thesis this model was validated by comparison of experimentally measured migration data and calculated values. Finally, on the basis of all achieved results the practical application of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> for food contact was discussed with regards to both, the current regulation in the European Food Law and the threshold of regulation concept of the American Food and Drug Administration...|$|R
