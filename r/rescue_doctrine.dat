500|$|In 2006, What's So Amazing About Grace? placed 17th on Christianity Todays list {{of fifty}} books that had most shaped Evangelicals. That year, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, {{compared}} What's So Amazing About Grace? to Chuck Swindoll's book The Grace Awakening, calling both [...] "wonderful books on grace [...] did {{a valuable service}} <b>rescuing</b> the <b>doctrine</b> of grace from the legalists who say that we must earn our salvation". Christian professor Craig Detweiler writes in his 2008 book A Purple State of Mind: Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture that, {{if he could have}} given his students a graduation present, {{it would have been a}} copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? because many of his Christian students were more concerned with avoiding the forbidden than they were with enjoying the permitted. Detweiler writes that Christianity was founded on forgiveness and that Christians should not bear the burden of guilt, and he therefore agrees with Yancey that [...] "grace" [...] is [...] "our last best word".|$|R
50|$|Gale {{worked in}} the 1660s on manuscripts for a {{large-scale}} and erudite theoretical work of intellectual history; a hint in Grotius's De Veritate (i. 16) gave him {{the idea of the}} derivation of all ancient learning and philosophy from the Hebrew scriptures. He therefore traced European languages to the Hebrew language, and all the theologies, sciences, politics, and literature of pagan antiquity to a Hebrew tradition. In a similar way he dealt with the origin of all philosophies. He also accounted for the errors of pagan philosophy and Catholic divinity by the theory of corruption by successive apostasies from a divine original. Constructively he proposed a reformed Platonism, and tried to <b>rescue</b> the Calvinistic <b>doctrine</b> of predetermination from difficulties. Work left in store escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666.|$|R
5000|$|In the USA, the <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine</b> {{of the law}} of torts {{holds that}} if a {{tortfeasor}} creates a circumstance that places the tort victim in danger, the tortfeasor is liable not only for the harm caused to the victim, but also the harm caused to any person injured in an effort to rescue that victim. This doctrine was originally created in case law by Wagner v. International Railway, 232 N.Y. 176 (1926), in which Justice Cardozo stated [...] "Danger invites rescue. The cry of distress is the summons to relief ... The emergency begets the man. The wrongdoer may not have foreseen the coming of a deliverer. He is accountable as if he had." ...|$|E
50|$|In the European Theater, {{there was}} very little {{opportunity}} for ground rescue. Most flights were over enemy-occupied territory, where a landing meant immediate capture. In the UK area of the European Theatre, the British military was at the time creating its own Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service which would be based largely on civilian mountain <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The RAFMRS has rescued many American aircrew, or recovered remains, from USAF crashes over its UK territory. Crashes during over-water flights created a great many casualties, the Eighth Air Force initiated a 'sea rescue' group. From its creation in 1943 {{until the end of the}} war, the recovery rate of aircrews downed at sea rose from less than five percent to over forty percent.|$|E
50|$|After she {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor via San Francisco, California, {{it was discovered that}} the submarine's hydraulic plant required an overhaul. This delayed departure on patrol for one month. Meanwhile, Lt. Cmdr. Freeland H. Carde, Jr., relieved Commander (Cmdr.) James B. Grady. On 15 June, fully loaded with provisions and torpedoes, Whale commenced her 11th war patrol. En route to the Marianas, Whale conducted training drills - emphasizing evasive dives from aircraft - and battle surface drills. She arrived at Saipan on 21 June and, the next day, commenced patrolling across the Japan-Wake Island supply lines until 30 June when she headed for Guam. She arrived there on 6 July and got underway the following day for lifeguard duty. From 8-23 July, Whale conducted lifeguard patrols in the areas of Nanpō Islands, Marianas, and Bungo Suido. Whale sighted several American B-29 Superfortress and B-24 Liberator bombers overhead. She also encountered a few freighters afloat but could not get in position to attack. On occasion at night, she spotted Japanese planes that were searching the water for lights. During this period, Whale rescued 15 downed aviators, saving several under adverse conditions. For example, on 26 July, while going in close for a rescue, Whale sighted 43 floating naval mines in 20 minutes, many close aboard. As a result of this lifeguard duty, Whale discovered many flaws in the air-sea <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine</b> and made several noteworthy recommendations to improve future operations.|$|E
40|$|This Note {{asserts that}} courts should {{continue}} to apply the traditional maritime <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine</b> along with its “wanton or reckless” standard when assessing whether a rescuer injured during a maritime rescue attempt stemming from a negligent tortfeasor’s conduct may recover {{for his or her}} injuries. Part I will analyze the arc of rescue doctrine–related case law surrounding the aforementioned circuit split, scrutinizing how the <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine</b> has been impacted by the larger-scale paradigm shift in apportioning liability from contributory negligence to comparative negligence. Part II will discuss the circuit split directly and argue that in light of admiralty law’s historical and statutory commitment to encouraging nearby seafarers to aid those in peril despite no broad, universal tort law duty to rescue, it is consistent and appropriate to preserve the traditional maritime <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine.</b> Finally, Part III will discuss important policy considerations favoring a “wanton or reckless” standard of care in the maritime rescue context, including both incentivizing life-saving rescue attempts and properly allocating costs under principles of law and economics...|$|E
40|$|In its 1984 {{decision}} New York v. Quarles, the Supreme Court {{announced the}} public safety exception, under which statements made by un-Mirandized suspects can be admissible when made {{in response to questions}} reasonably asked to protect the safety of the arresting officers or the general public. During the investigation of terrorism cases, law enforcement agencies have begun to extend the time of un-Mirandized questioning of suspects, with the hope that courts will find that {{the public safety}} exception makes the suspects’ statements admissible in the ensuing prosecutions. This Article argues that in announcing the public safety exception, the Court implicitly analogized the role of police interrogation in situations implicating public safety to the actions of criminal defendants in situations of self-defense and defense of others. Recognizing this implicit analogy can provide guidance on the applicability and limits of the public safety exception and related issues, such as the <b>rescue</b> <b>doctrine,</b> to the investigation of terrorism suspects. The comparison can also draw upon the reasoning involved in recognizing battered woman syndrome, which has been used to broaden the circumstances under which suspects might have reasonably acted in self-defense. The evaluation of the reasonableness of self-defense in the context of battered woman syndrome can be analogized to evaluating the admissibility of terrorism suspects’ un-Mirandized statements, which might be affected by the frequency and severity of terrorist activities {{that took place in the}} time leading up to the arrest of the suspects...|$|E
