The process of transporting the sheet material begins with its separation from the stack, move into the treatment zone and outputting to the <b>receiving</b> <b>table.</b> The aim of this work {{is to determine the}} possibility of pre-analytical method without the element to be contacted cutting sheet material, its transport and fixation in the cutting zone due to the vacuum chamber. The advantage is that the vacuum transport, that the sheet material does not operate mechanical strength. Also semi-products are not deformed or damaged actuators conveyors. Using the method without the element to be contacted trimming sheet material cutting tool eliminates contact with the contacting element. Since the blade is in contact directly with only semi-finished product that it can be assumed that its bluntness is minimized, and the streamlined design of the transport system greatly simplifies the implementation of the technological process of pruning. ??????????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ? ??????????? ?????. ??????? ??????????????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??? ????????? ?? ?????, ??????????? ? ???? ????????? ? ?????? ?? ???????? ????. ????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?????????, ??? ??????????????? ? ???????? ? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ????????? ??????. ????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????? ??, ??? ?? ???????? ???????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ????, ??? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????. ????? ???? ????????????? ?? ????????????? ? ?? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????????????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????. ????????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????? ? ??????????????, ?? ????? ????????????, ??? ??? ?????????? ???????? ? ????????, ? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a Bluetooth channel state {{dependent}} data segmentation and reassembly (CSD-SAR) scheme and a queue state dependent priority (QSD-PR) scheduling policy. The CSD-SAR maintains a <b>receiving</b> frequency <b>table</b> to predict channel conditions and selects the best packet type and packet size to transmit data. In addition, the QSD-PR also uses the <b>receiving</b> frequency <b>table</b> to avoid bad frequencies {{and gives a}} selected master-slave pair, which has more queued data to send between each other and has a higher priority to eliminate the wastage of slots. The conventional scheduling policy, Round Robin (RR), yields poor performance with the time division duplex (TDD) based MAC protocol and results in slot wastage and may not ensure fairness. Simulation results show that OUT proposed scheme achieves better link utilization and higher throughput with bounded delay compared to the RR scheme in error-free and error-prone environments. Our scheme can also eliminate interference to other wireless networks that share the same spectrum, such as WLANs, by avoiding selecting channels occupied by other network...|$|R
