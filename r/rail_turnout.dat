40|$|The short {{service life}} of <b>rail</b> <b>turnouts</b> {{and the related}} noise and {{vibration}} disturbance, {{are directly related to}} their dynamic distress. Especially in the case of urban rail systems, such problems are amplified due to the increased train frequency and the proximity to inhabited structures. This paper presents three new concepts for the reduction of noise and vibration produced by railway turnouts in urban railway lines, and provides an assessment of their performance. The effectiveness of the three new concepts is first evaluated analytically, using two different methodologies, earlier validated against line measurements on existing turnouts. Then, the actual performance of one of the three concepts, along with the effectiveness of the two analysis methodologies, is verified through real-scale measurements. Based on the presented analyses, all three new concepts are shown to provide a substantial enhancement of turnout performance. Furthermore, soil conditions and soil-structure interaction are shown {{to play an important role}} in the behavior of the investigated systems. © 2009 ASCE...|$|R
50|$|In October 2014, {{inspectors}} {{conducted a}} survey of Crimea {{and concluded that the}} structures of <b>rail</b> tracks and <b>turnouts</b> were in poor condition. As a result, the maximum speed was reduced to 40 km/h, 25 km/h, and occasionally 10 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running <b>rails.</b> <b>Turnouts</b> for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>turnouts</b> {{are built}} to enable {{flexibility}} in the rail network as they allow for vehicles to switch between various tracks, therefore maximizing the utilisation of existing rail infrastructure. In general, railway turnouts are a safety-critical and expensive feature to a rail system as they suffer aggressive operational loads, in comparison to a plain rail track, and thus require frequent monitoring and maintenance. In practice, great consideration {{is given to the}} dynamic interaction between the turnouts components as a failed component may have adverse effects on the performance of neighbouring components. This paper presents a nonlinear 3 D finite element (FE) model, taking into account the nonlinearities of materials, in order to evaluate the interaction and behaviour of turnout components. Using ABAQUS, the finite element model was developed to simulate standard concrete bearers with 60 [*]kg/m rail and with a tangential turnout radius of 250 [*]m. The turnout structure is supported by a ballast layer, which is represented by a nonlinearly deformable tensionless solid. The numerical studies firstly demonstrate the importance of load transfer mechanisms in the failure modes of the turnout components. The outcome will lead to a better design and maintenance of railway turnouts, improving public safety and operational reliability...|$|R

40|$|Railroad {{engineering}} {{practices and}} Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations require track to be inspected for physical defects at specified intervals, {{which may be}} as often as twice per week. Currently, most of these inspections are manual and are conducted visually by railroad track inspectors. Inspections include detecting defects relating to the ties, fasteners, rail, special trackwork and ballast section. Enhancements to the current manual inspection process are possible using advanced technologies such as machine vision, which consists of recording digital images of track elements of interest and analyzing them using custom algorithms to identify defects or their symptoms. Based on analysis of FRA accident data, discussion with railroad track engineering experts and consultation with Association of American Railroads (AAR) researchers, this project focuses on using machine vision to detect irregularities and defects in cut spikes, <b>rail</b> anchors, <b>turnout</b> components and the crib ballast. Because inspection data will be stored digitally, comparative and trend analyses of track component condition are possible through data mining and Information Technology (IT) procedures.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{is described in}} order to assess loads applied on a turnout due to track-train interaction. Co-simulation is used between a finite element method (FEM) model of the turnout and a multibody system (MBS) of the vehicle. Wheel/rail contact forces are computed in the MBS and applied to the <b>rails</b> of the <b>turnout</b> modelled as FEM beams. FEM displacements under the wheel are accounted in the MBS in the next time step. A modification has been applied to the semi-Hertzian (SH) method used to assess wheel/rail forces. This adapted SH method is designed to take in account the relative flexibility of the components of the turnout, like the stock rail and the switch rail. Such parts have their own degree of freedom and may in some extent behave independently: the proposed method takes it in account in the contact search. The co-simulation has been first used in a referenced case-study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{stiffness}} and damping characteristics under the <b>turnout</b> <b>rail</b> are important factors affecting vehicle safety and stable running. According to the variable cross-section {{structure of a}} single 60 kg/m turnout No. 18, a multi-body dynamic model of the vehicle-turnout coupled system is established. Based on the orthogonal test method, 25 group working conditions have been designed with {{the combination of the}} sub-rail {{stiffness and}} damping parameters. It has been found that the stiffness parameters under the rail have a greater impact on the vehicle’s performance through the range analysis of the simulation results. The vertical sub-rail stiffness mainly influences the vehicle’s vertical response and Sperling indicator. The lateral stiffness effects the derailment coefficient and the riding comfort. The matching scheme of the sub-rail stiffness and damping parameters is deduced by aiming towards the optimal vehicle security, stability and comfort, which provides a reference for the sub-rail structure design...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} of {{the railway}} superstructure is mainly influenced by its quality, by the operational technical conditions, climatic phenomena {{and above all}} by the dynamic load by the pair of wheels of the rail vehicles and also {{by the quality of}} railway subgrade. Simultaneously, the dynamic parameters also depend on the speed of rail vehicles, on the arrangement of axles, their spring mounting and on the spring mounting of the body casing or on the weight acting on the axle, and last but not least, also {{on the quality of the}} running surface of the wheel tyre. The dynamic effects of sets of wagons are transferred through the rails to the rail pads below the base of the rails, then to the sleepers or bearers and fastening system, then to the ballast bed and also to the superstructure construction. This fact applies especially for turnout structures. In turnout rigidity is changed and also there is a place where the wheel passes over a gap (in case of fixed crossings). In particular of above mentioned reasons, turnout is a place where high dynamic effects occurre and that is why often defects occurre. Dissertation thesis will be focused on measurement and analysis of the dynamic effects on turnout. The point of the thesis will be updating recent system (observing of the geometrical parameters and wear of the <b>rails</b> in <b>turnouts)</b> for dynamic effect observe. Methodology of the measurement and convenient mathematical apparatus for analysing dynamic effect will be proposed...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by the {{manufacturing}} process of switch <b>rails</b> for railway <b>turnouts,</b> a method for the optimization of switch rail profile geometry is presented. The switch rail profile geometry is parameterized with four design variables to define a B-spline curve for the milling tool profile, and two design variables to prescribe the deviation from the nominal vertical path of the milling tool. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective minimization problem with objective functions based on the contact pressure and the energy dissipation in the wheel–rail contact. The front of Pareto optimal solutions is determined by applying a genetic type optimization algorithm. The switch rail profile designs are evaluated by simulations of dynamic train–turnout interaction using a commercial code for multi-body dynamics. The vehicle model is a freight wagon with Y 25 bogies and 25 metric tonnes axle load. Traffic is simulated in both travelling directions in the diverging route of a 60 E 1 - 760 - 1 : 15 turnout. It is concluded that the obtained set of Pareto optimal solutions corresponds to a rather small variation in design variables where increased profile height and increased profile shoulder protuberance are preferred for both objectives...|$|R
40|$|Severe wear is {{a common}} damage {{mechanism}} in railway turnouts, which strongly affects the dynamic performance of railway vehicles and maintenance costs of tracks. This article explores the effects of profile wear on contact behaviors in the wheel–rail/switch contact and dynamic interaction, and nominal and measured worn <b>turnout</b> <b>rail</b> profiles are used as boundary conditions of wheel–rail contact. The calculation of the dynamic loads and the resultant contact stresses and internal stresses {{makes it possible to}} rationally design railway turnouts and correctly select the material to be applied for their components. For these reasons, the multi-body system SIMPACK and finite element software ANSYS are used to calculate the features of load and subsequently distributions of contact stresses and internal stresses in the regions of wheel–turnout components. The results show that profile wear disturbs the distribution of wheel–rail contact point pairs, changes the positions of wheel–rail contact points along the longitudinal direction, and affects the dynamic interaction of vehicle and turnout. For the measured profile in this article, profile wear aggravates vertical dynamic responses significantly but improves lateral dynamic responses. Profile wear disturbs the normal contact situations between the wheel and switch rail and worsens the stress state of the switch rail...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} costs {{incurred}} by railway companies is the maintenance of turnouts. This situation occurs because the large dynamic forces between the wheels of a train and the <b>rails</b> of a <b>turnout</b> cause excessive wear, rolling contact fatigue and rapid degradation of other components. A thorough understanding of the dynamic interaction between a train and a turnout {{could lead to a}} better design of the corresponding vehicle/track or of the damage mechanisms and subsequently to a smarter maintenance planning. Such an insight can be obtained through a detailed model of the train-turnout interaction. Such models exist in the literature for vehicle-track interaction, but they have some shortcomings when it comes to train-turnout interaction. This leads to the following research questions: 1. How to model the wheel rail contact? In this thesis different models are presented for the search of the contact location {{as well as for the}} normal and the tangential contact problem. Especially the relation between the contact models and vehicle dynamic simulation is investigated. 2. How to model the interaction between the wagons of the train? A quasi static approach has been presented and the results have been compared to results obtained through dynamic simulation. The analysis of the contact models in this dissertation will help researchers choose between the different contact models and their interaction with vehicle dynamic software. This should enable researchers to accurately model the contact in turnouts so that the deterioration mechanisms in turnouts can be understood. In turn, this understanding should lead to better maintenance and associated cost savings. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
