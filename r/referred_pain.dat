5|$|Sometimes, pain {{caused in}} one part of the body feels like it is coming from another part of the body. This is called <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b> The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b> For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E

50|$|Non-dental {{causes of}} {{toothache}} {{are much less}} common as compared with dental causes. In a toothache of neurovascular origin, pain is reported in the teeth {{in conjunction with a}} migraine. Local and distant structures (such as ear, brain, carotid artery, or heart) can also <b>refer</b> <b>pain</b> to the teeth. Other non-dental causes of toothache include myofascial pain (muscle pain) and angina pectoris (which classically <b>refers</b> <b>pain</b> to the lower jaw). Very rarely, toothache can be psychogenic in origin.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the pain}} is on the body and whether it radiates (extends) or moves to any other area. This can give {{indications}} for conditions such as a myocardial infarction, which can radiate through the jaw and arms. Other <b>referred</b> <b>pains</b> can provide clues to underlying medical causes.|$|R
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of {{this model}} arises from its {{inability}} to explain why there is a delay between the onset of <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> after local pain stimulation. Experimental evidence also shows that <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> is often unidirectional. For example, stimulated local pain in the anterior tibial muscle causes <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> in the ventral portion of the ankle; however <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> moving {{in the opposite direction}} has not been shown experimentally. Lastly, the threshold for the local pain stimulation and the <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> stimulation are different, but according to this model they should both be the same.|$|E

5000|$|The neuroanatomic {{basis of}} {{referred}} earaches rests within {{one of five}} general neural pathways.

40|$|Disturbances in the {{integrity}} of the upper cervical spine are now well known to be associated with head pain and can give rise to chronic daily head-aches (1 – 3). Head pain that derives from cervical dysfunctions or disease is now contained under the category of cervicogenic headaches (4), which describes a heterogeneous group of disorders that commonly <b>refer</b> <b>pain</b> from structures in the cervi-cal spine region (e. g. joints, muscle, nerve) to various regions in the head. The mechanisms that underlie head <b>pain</b> <b>referred</b> from the neck are not entirely understood. There is general consensus that the trigeminocervical complex, which is located in the lower brainstem and upper three cervical spinal segments and receives multipl...|$|R
25|$|One {{example of}} this is <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> in the calf. McKenzie showed that the <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> would move closer to the spine when the patient bent {{backwards}} in full extension a few times. More importantly, the <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> would dissipate even after the movements were stopped.|$|E
25|$|As with {{myocardial}} ischaemia <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> {{in a certain}} portion of the body {{can lead to a}} diagnosis of the correct local center. Somatic mapping of <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> and the corresponding local centers has led to various topographic maps being produced to aid in pinpointing the location of pain based on the referred areas. For example, local pain stimulated in the esophagus is capable of producing <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> in the upper abdomen, the oblique muscles, and the throat. Local pain in the prostate can radiate <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> to the abdomen, lower back, and calf muscles. Kidney stones can cause visceral pain in the ureter as the stone is slowly passed into the excretory system. This can cause immense <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> in the lower abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|Axon reflex {{suggests}} that the afferent fiber is bifurcated before connecting to the dorsal horn. Bifurcated fibers do exist in muscle, skin, and intervertebral discs. Yet these particular neurons are rare and are not representative of the whole body. Axon-Reflex also does not explain the time delay before the appearance of <b>referred</b> <b>pain,</b> threshold differences for stimulating local and <b>referred</b> <b>pain,</b> and somatosensory sensibility changes {{in the area of}} <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} all the above in the cantilevered head position, with the chin poked out, is to compress every facet joint in the cervical spine. This predisposes to acute locking episodes. At {{the top of the}} cervical spine, this often manifests as cervicogenic headache, with <b>pain</b> <b>referring</b> over the head from the C0/1, C1/2, and/or C2/3 joints, and from the insertion of the upper trapezius fibres onto the nuchal line of the occiput. In older patients, especially with osteophytes and/or where the intervertebral foramina are already diminished, this compression and further reduction of the foraminal spaces can result in irritation and impingement of the nerve roots, <b>referring</b> <b>pain</b> some distance down the arm(s).|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} the co-occurence of musculoskeletal {{pain and}} depressive symptoms {{first in the}} entire Finnish population 30 {{years of age or}} older and then more closely among working people 30 – 64 years of age. In this study, musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> <b>refers</b> to <b>pain,</b> ache or motion-related soreness that occurred during the past month in the back, neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, fi ngers, hip, knee, ankle or foot. Depressive symptoms cover mild, moderate and severe symptoms...|$|R
25|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{are in line}} with this mechanism of <b>referred</b> <b>pain,</b> such as dependency on stimulus and the time delay in the appearance of <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> as compared to local pain. However, the appearance of new receptive fields, which is interpreted to be <b>referred</b> <b>pain,</b> conflicts with the majority of experimental evidence from studies including studies of healthy individuals. Furthermore, <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> generally appears within seconds in humans as opposed to minutes in animal models. Some scientists attribute this to a mechanism or influence downstream in the supraspinal pathways. Neuroimaging techniques such as PET scans or fMRI may visualize the underlying neural processing pathways responsible in future testing.|$|E
25|$|This {{represents}} one of the earliest theories on the subject of <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b> It is {{based on the work of}} W.A. Sturge and J. Ross from 1888 and later TC Ruch in 1961. Convergent projection proposes that afferent nerve fibers from tissues converge onto the same spinal neuron, and explains why <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> is believed to be segmented in much the same way as the spinal cord. Additionally, experimental evidence shows that when local pain (pain at the site of stimulation) is intensified the <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> is intensified as well.|$|E
25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> has {{no central}} mechanism. However, it does {{say that there}} is one central {{characteristic}} that predominates. Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E

40|$|Cutaneous allodynia {{is defined}} as the {{perception}} of pain when a non-noxious stimulus is applied to normal skin. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in migraine patients during an acute attack. It is thought to result from central sensitization of neurons in the trigemino-vascular system and may spread to areas beyond that of the <b>referred</b> head <b>pain.</b> In a recent study, migraine patients demonstrated increased temporal summation to painful mechanical stimuli in their <b>referred</b> head <b>pain</b> area between attacks. This suggests that changes in physiologic properties of nociceptive neurons may occur in migraine patients between attacks. We describe a migraine patient with interictal cutaneous allodynia contralateral to her usual head pain...|$|R
25|$|Radiating pain is {{slightly}} different from referred pain; for example, the pain {{related to a}} myocardial infarction could either be referred or radiating pain from the chest. <b>Referred</b> <b>pain</b> is when the pain is located away from or adjacent to the organ involved; for instance, when a person has pain only in their jaw or left arm, {{but not in the}} chest. <b>Referred</b> <b>pain</b> has been described since the late 1880s. Despite an increasing amount of literature on the subject, the biological mechanism of <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> is unknown, although there are several hypotheses.|$|E
25|$|Central {{hyperexcitability}} {{is important}} for the extent of <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further, recent {{research}} has found that ketamine, a sedative, is capable of blocking <b>referred</b> <b>pain.</b> The study was conducted on patients suffering from fibromyalgia, a disease characterized by joint and muscle pain and fatigue. These patients were looked at specifically due to their increased sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> appears in a different pattern in fibromyalgic patients than non-fibromyalgic patients. Often this difference manifests as a difference in terms of the area that the <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> is found (distal vs. proximal) as compared to the local pain. The area is also much more exaggerated owing to the increased sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{suffering}} is sometimes {{used in the}} narrow sense of physical pain, but more often it <b>refers</b> to mental <b>pain,</b> or more often yet it <b>refers</b> to <b>pain</b> in the broad sense, i.e. to any unpleasant feeling, emotion or sensation. The word <b>pain</b> usually <b>refers</b> to physical <b>pain,</b> {{but it is also}} a common synonym of suffering. The words pain and suffering are often used both together in different ways. For instance, they may be used as interchangeable synonyms. Or they may be used in 'contradistinction' to one another, as in [...] "pain is physical, {{suffering is}} mental", or [...] "pain is inevitable, suffering is optional". Or they may be used to define each other, as in [...] "pain is physical suffering", or [...] "suffering is severe physical or mental pain".|$|R
30|$|Patients {{with this}} {{syndrome}} may <b>refer</b> shoulder <b>pain</b> at the ACJ {{and at the}} coracoid, posterior shoulder pain sometimes irradiated to the cervical paraspinal region and to the lateral aspect of the arm, or even radicular symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{confused}} with pressure point massage, this involves deactivating trigger points that may cause local <b>pain</b> or <b>refer</b> <b>pain</b> and other sensations, such as headaches, {{in other parts}} of the body. Manual pressure, vibration, injection, or other treatment is applied to these points to relieve myofascial pain. Trigger points were first discovered and mapped by Janet G. Travell (President Kennedy's physician) and David Simons. Trigger points have been photomicrographed and measured electrically and in 2007 a paper was presented showing images of Trigger Points using MRI. These points relate to dysfunction in the myoneural junction, also called neuromuscular junction (NMJ), in muscle, and therefore this technique is different from reflexology, acupressure and pressure point massage.|$|R

25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} {{one can see}} why understanding of <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> can lead to better diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when <b>referred</b> <b>pain</b> moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|E

40|$|A phenomenological, {{qualitative}} enquiry {{was implemented}} {{to gain an}} in-depth understanding of the lived-through spinally <b>referred</b> leg <b>pain</b> experience, from a physiotherapy specific research perspective. The methodology {{of the study is}} drawing from the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl, and Giorgi’s (2009) modification of his phenomenological method. For Husserl, the central theme and purpose in phenomenology is to describe the essence of the phenomenon as a presence to consciousness; by the means of phenomenological attitude and reduction, including bracketing, and conscious acts. Descriptions of the phenomenon of interest were obtained from four participant volunteers through individual, face to face interviews. Participants were asked to describe concrete situations of spinally <b>referred</b> leg <b>pain,</b> in as much detail as possible. The phenomenological analysis showed that the most essential aspect of lived-through experience is the overriding presence of pain. The other key constituents, which are all interrelated, were: interference with life, emotional engagement, sense of resilience, sense of diagnostic uncertainty, treatment hope and expectation, trust in others and resignation. This study contributed to phenomenological insights into spinally <b>referred</b> leg <b>pain</b> experiences, and has significant implications to understanding the phenomenon from a physiotherapy disciplinary perspective...|$|R
