5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and <b>Rusyns.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{few studies}} made thus far of the {{genetics}} of <b>Rusyns</b> indicate a common ancestry with other modern Europeans. An analysis of maternal lineages found that <b>Rusyns</b> {{have the highest}} frequency of Haplogroup H1 (mtDNA) found to that date. Haplogroup M* also reaches its regional peak among <b>Rusyns.</b> Analysis of population genetics shows statistical differences between <b>Rusyns</b> and other Slavic or European populations.|$|E
25|$|The ethnic {{relationship}} of Prešov Region {{is complex and}} volatile. A long-term cultural and everyday cohabition of <b>Rusyns,</b> Slovaks and Hungarians, under the prepodence of the non-Rusyn element led to the linguistic Slovakization of <b>Rusyns,</b> while in some parts (in cities and ethnic islands in the south) they were Magyarized. Still, in both cases they preserved their religion (Greek Catholicism). Until the 1920s, the Slovak-speaking Greek-Catholics composed a transitional group that was connected with the <b>Rusyns</b> through religion and traditions, with Slovak as their language. Their number was gradually increasing with the transition of the parts of Rusyn population to the Slovak language. Slovakization of the Rusyn population increased in the times of the Czechoslovakian authorities (since 1920). The Greek Catholics and Orthodox started to perceive themselves as Slovaks. It is difficult to estimate {{the distribution of the}} Orthodox and the Greek Catholics by the language as well as to determine the number of <b>Rusyns</b> because both the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian censuses provided the incorrect number of <b>Rusyns,</b> but it contains roughly 50-100 000 people. According to censuses the decrease of the number of <b>Rusyns</b> was influenced not only by Slovakization but also by emigration of a significant number of <b>Rusyns</b> from Prešov, mainly to the Czech lands.|$|E
50|$|Both Pannonian <b>Rusyn</b> and Carpathian <b>Rusyn</b> are East Slavic languages. Pannonian <b>Rusyn</b> {{differs from}} Carpathian <b>Rusyn</b> {{in that the}} former has been {{influenced}} by the surrounding South Slavic languages (especially Serbian) whilst the latter has {{been influenced by the}} surrounding West Slavic languages (especially Polish and Slovak. Both forms of <b>Rusyn</b> are closely related to Russian Church Slavonic, Old Ruthenian and modern Russian.|$|R

25|$|A {{considerable}} {{controversy has}} arisen regarding the Rusyn separatist movement {{led by the}} Orthodox priest Dmitri Sidor (now Archbishop of Uzhorod, in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)), {{his relationship with the}} Russian Orthodox Church and funding for his activities.

25|$|The Slovak {{pressure}} on <b>Rusyns</b> in Slovakia increased after 1919 when Czechoslovakia incorporated Transcarpathia {{to the east}} of the Uzh River. The Slovakization of <b>Rusyns</b> (and Ukrainians) {{was a part of the}} program of the Slovak People's Party, whose leader refused to cooperate with the Rusyn politicians of Transcarpathia but cooperated with Hungarian-speaking A. Brody. Therefore, the Rusyn politicians opened the links with the Czech political parties which were supportive of neutrality towards the Rusyn question. The cultural Slovak-Rusyn relations at the time were minimal.|$|E

In the first part are shown in an expressive manner the opposing tendencies leading the expansion of the <b>Rusyn</b> language within the spectrum of belles-lettres and academic literature, resulting from the functions of those two kinds of discourse and their traditions within European literature.
