40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the experimental validation and some application {{examples of the}} proposed wafer/pad friction models for linear chemical–mechanical planarization (CMP) pro-cesses in the companion paper. An experimental setup of a linear CMP polisher is first presented and some polishing processes are then designed for validation of the wafer/pad friction modeling and analysis. The friction torques of both the polisher spindle and roller systems are used to monitor variations of the friction coefficient in situ. Verification of the friction model under various process parameters is presented. Effects of pad conditioning and the wafer film topography on wafer/pad friction are experimen-tally demonstrated. Finally, several application examples are presented showing {{the use of the}} <b>roller</b> <b>motor</b> current measure-ment for real-time process monitoring and control.

40|$|A {{customized}} combined methodology {{based on}} both 2 D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and lumped parameters numerical modeling, useful for simulating the hydraulic behavior of orbit annular machines, {{has been developed}} and here presented. More in details, the predictive capabilities of this CAE (computer-aided engineering) tool can be applied {{for the study of}} both roller and gerotor architectures and considering both pumping and motoring operating mode. First of all, an in-house developed 2 D CFD methodology, based on the integration of the stationary form of the Reynolds equation for the determination of the pressure distribution inside the lateral clearances bounded by the sides of the stator-rotor group and the valve plate, as well as the internal manifold surface, is firstly presented and applied. The same computational procedure has been also involved for the investigation of the leakages through the clearance between the valve plate and the balancing ring. After that, a lumped and distributed parameters numerical model has been involved for the simulation of a typical orbit <b>roller</b> <b>motor</b> operation. In this case, particular care has been devoted to the modeling of the axial leakage clearances, adopting analytical interpolation functions deducted from the numerical results calculated applying the previously described 2 D CFD methodology. Finally, the whole CAE approach has been validated by means of a comprehensive numerical versus experimental comparison, obtaining a general good accordance for the overall operating field of this particular type of hydraulic unit...|$|E

50|$|The general lay out of {{the vehicle}} mimicked that of the Vickers vehicle it was based on. The {{suspension}} was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used on the Light Tank Mk VI of the Royal army and was invented by Sidney Horstmann. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it had the advantage of having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field. The drive sprocket was in the front, but there were no idlers or return <b>rollers.</b> <b>Motor</b> power {{came in the form of}} a Meadows 5 cylinder gasoline engine, producing 51 hp, coupled with a four speed preselector gearbox. Steering was a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was man powered by the three man crew. The T-13s were not equipped with a radio.|$|R

One of his major concerns was the upkeep of the courts, and he insisted on high standards of court maintenance. In 1910, the club purchased a <b>motor</b> <b>roller</b> for the courts in order to replace the horse roller.|$|R
50|$|The gerotor motor is {{in essence}} a rotor with N-1 teeth, {{rotating}} off center in a rotor/stator with N teeth. Pressurized fluid is guided into the assembly using a (usually) axially placed plate-type distributor valve. Several different designs exist, {{such as the}} Geroller (internal or external <b>rollers)</b> and Nichols <b>motors.</b> Typically, the Gerotor motors are low-to-medium speed and medium-to-high torque.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} {{a case study in}} predictive maintenance at a distribution warehouse. A simulation model was built with ARENA# 5. 0 for integrating predictive maintenance strategies with production planning strategies, for a conveyor system. Equipment health was monitored using condition-based parameters such as temperature and vibration for mechanical and electrical components such as <b>rollers,</b> electrical <b>motors,</b> and gearboxes. This diagnostic information was then integrated with a simulation model to simulate various equipment breakdown and failure conditions. Integration of condition-based monitoring of conveying equipment with a simulation model of the distribution system has provided a useful analytical tool for management to reduce production downtime due to unplanned maintenance activities [...] in this instance, downtime was reduced by more than 50 % and work in process inventory was reduced by more than 65 %...|$|R
40|$|The <b>roller</b> {{electrical}} <b>motor</b> (REM) {{consists of}} non-magnetic stainless steel cylinders rolling on parallel stainless steel rails {{of the same}} diameter with an electrical current passing from rail to rail through the rolling cylinders. The REM {{is found to be}} capable of carrying heavy loads, the electrical driving force increasing as the current and loading are raised. When the REM carries a 50 kg load the driving force increases at the rate of 80 mN A(- 1). At 30 A the REM is capable of driving external frictional loads of 1. 7 and 2. 2 N while carrying loads of 50 and 100 kg respectively. This paper describes the characteristics of the REM and discusses the origin of the driving force. A thermal expansion theory is developed to explain the experimental results...|$|R
30|$|Typical screw-drive robot {{is usually}} {{composed}} of a rotator, elastic support arms, <b>rollers</b> and a <b>motor</b> for driving. The rollers have a constant incline angle {{with respect to the}} cross section of the pipe. When the motor turns, the whole body moves forward. If the motor turns reversely, the body moves backward. To propel a screw-drive-type robot, one motor is enough for straight pipe and elbow. However, for the T-shape pipe, extra navigation mechanism is needed.|$|R
50|$|These are {{a modern}} {{version of the}} old {{storefront}} crank-up awnings of the last century. Tension arms and a roller bar are supported by a torsion bar. The torsion bar fits into wall or soffit brackets that spread the load to {{the width of the}} wall. Hand-cranked awnings are still available, but motorized awnings are now most common. The motor is inside the <b>roller</b> tube. Many <b>motors</b> now have a built-in receiver and are operated by remote control or home automation.|$|R

5000|$|... 1867 was Wootton's most {{successful}} season ever with 142 wickets in just nineteen games; though he again failed against the Gentlemen where Alfred Lubbock and E.M. Grace made large scores, {{he was more}} terrifying than ever elsewhere until August. The exceptionally hot and dry summer of 1868, however, saw him lose a little of his deadliness with thirty-six fewer wickets, but Wootton recovered this ground for one last time in 1869 before, {{at the beginning of}} the 1870s, losing his skill for good just before the heavy <b>roller</b> and <b>motor</b> mower eliminated the shooters that made him so feared. Wootton took ninety wickets in 1870, but was so ineffective after May in 1871 with the first extensive use of heavy rollers, as to drop out of first-class cricket at the end of July with a mere ten wickets in eight games. A few deadly games in 1872 suggested he was still capable of terrorising batsmen at Lord's, but around this time Wootton showed an interest in giving up cricket for a career as a farmer, which he did following a benefit in 1873.|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} 1871, George Freeman {{had started a}} {{business}} as an auctioneer and this restricted his appearances that year. Although he was not quite so lethal {{as he had been}} in the previous four seasons, it was still a surprise when Freeman did not play in the early matches of the 1872 season, reappearing only against Gloucestershire for his own benefit match. W. G. Grace scored 150 against him, and for the next five years Freeman, with a growing business claiming all his time, played only very occasionally in minor matches for the Malton club. In 1878, however, playing as an amateur, Freeman appeared in first-class cricket for the first time in six years against Middlesex at Lord’s, but lack of practice and the improvement in pitches from the heavy <b>roller</b> and <b>motor</b> mower meant he could not take more than three wickets at a cost of ninety-one runs. He played once against each of the first two Australian touring teams, but took only two wickets in total. However, George Freeman still bowled with success for “Gentlemen of Yorkshire” teams as late as 1883.|$|R
50|$|The Flight of Fear rides at Kings Island and Kings Dominion {{were the}} world's first linear {{induction}} <b>motor</b> <b>roller</b> coasters, both holding press/media days on June 17, 1996, and {{opening to the}} public on June 18, 1996. The highest peak of each ride is 74 ft; and the total length is 2705 ft. The maximum speed, which is attained {{in less than four}} seconds during the launch, is 54 mi/h km/h. The launch requires 3 megawatts of electric power. When the rides opened, both had the fastest acceleration of any roller coaster in the world. Flight of Fear won awards at the November 1996 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions trade show for the best new Major Theme/Amusement Park Ride/Attraction and Technology Applied to Amusements.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 June: W. G. Grace {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut playing for Gentlemen of the South v. Players of the South. This was a two-day match which his team won by an innings and 58 runs. Amazingly, {{he began his}} career with a duck: st HH Stephenson b G Bennett. However, he made up for this disappointment by taking 5-44 and 8-40 when aged just 16! Grace played in five matches during his debut season but he was still not attached to a first-class county (Gloucestershire did not become a first-class team until 1870). His other games in 1865 were for Gentlemen v. Players (twice), England v. Surrey and Gentlemen of England v. Gentlemen of Middlesex. Grace played till 1908, and remains peerless as a player and became known to history as [...] "The Great Cricketer". A massive personality who was the sport’s supreme all-rounder, but best remembered as a master batsman who conquered the uncertain pitch conditions of his early years before the heavy <b>roller</b> and <b>motor</b> mower eliminated deadly shooters and [...] "bumping" [...] or [...] "flying" [...] balls on the head. His superiority over his contemporaries is astounding and only Don Bradman has a similar stature in the game's history.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{patented}} {{technical features}} that allowed effective cleaning {{of all kinds}} of carpets and bare floors, plus the ability to clean in the tightest corners, the 350, which indicated that the brush vibrator bar was 35 cm, was sold and used in hotels, hospitals and offices. With the addition of features like a clutch-protected brush <b>roller,</b> a by-pass <b>motor</b> and hospital-grade filtration, the first SEBO found acceptance in the market by 1979. Commercial cleaning manufacturers such as Windsor Kärcher and Jeyes Hygiene re-branded SEBO uprights under their own name during the early 1980s. In 1986, the SEBO 360 was launched to replace the 350. The 360 had a simple, electronic surface height adjustment feature that would automatically raise or lower the suction nozzle based on different cleaning surfaces. It would also notify if there was a brush obstruction or if the disposable filter bag was full.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{traffic noise}} {{continues}} to grow and it is accompanied by {{an increasing number of}} complaints from people exposed to the noise. The historical dimension of noise pollution in urbanized society identified ‘noise’ as being unwanted or undesirable sound created by construction vehicles that are considered harmful to human health and quality of life. The most important issue is sleep disturbance. However, the assessment of construction traffic noise is highly complex. Objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of noise induced by construction traffic and normal traffic. Sound levels were measured by using Sound level meter (SVAN 971) and four channel seismograph at different locations near roads where heavy construction vehicles such as ABC truck, empty truck, <b>roller</b> and <b>motor</b> grader passing through. In order to compare with ambient condition, noise induced by normal vehicles (i. e., car, three-wheeler, van, bus.) was also measured. Most of the construction vehicles induced noise, which are higher than the noise induced by the normal vehicles. Among the normal traffic, three-wheelers produce noise greater than other normal vehicles. It was found that construction traffic induced noise as high as 109 dB (L(A) max), 79. 2 dB (L(A) eq). Construction traffic produces noise at relatively low frequencies with high amplitude. Low frequency noise can be easily transmitted through structures and it can cause windows and other elements to rattle. The noise with tonal or impulsive characteristics is likely to be more annoying than noise without such characteristics...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{intelligent}} {{fault diagnosis}} method for <b>motor</b> <b>roller</b> bearings which operate under unsteady rotating speed and load is proposed in this paper. The pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD) {{and the relative}} crossing information (RCI) methods are used for extracting the feature spectra from the non-stationary vibration signal measured for condition diagnosis. The RCI is used to automatically extract the feature spectrum from the time-frequency distribution of the vibration signal. The extracted feature spectrum is instantaneous, and not correlated with the rotation speed and load. By using the ant colony optimization (ACO) clustering algorithm, the synthesizing symptom parameters (SSP) for condition diagnosis are obtained. The experimental results shows that the diagnostic sensitivity of the SSP is higher than original symptom parameter (SP), and the SSP can sensitively reflect {{the characteristics of the}} feature spectrum for precise condition diagnosis. Finally, a fuzzy diagnosis method based on sequential inference and possibility theory is also proposed, by which the conditions of the machine can be identified sequentially as well...|$|R
40|$|Electrically driven rollers {{are used}} {{in many areas of}} industry, for {{applications}} ranging from the transportation of heavy objects to high accuracy printing. Frequently, a number of rollers are driven from a simple electro-mechanical source. However, there has been a trend towards the use of individual <b>roller</b> drives, the <b>motor</b> being mounted either {{at the side of the}} machine, which still increases the space requirement, or inside the machine, and coupled to the surrounding roller through gears, which makes maintenance more complex. In addition, a high proportion of current rollers have a high mass, which leads to a significant energy requirement for acceleration. Urenco (Capenhurst) Ltd has developed highly advanced carbon fibre composite technology. This technology has been advanced by imparting magnetic properties to the composite, to facilitate the realisation of self-powered rollers, having mechanical properties superior to those of steel rollers, but for only a fraction of the mass. This paper outlines developments to date of these compact low inertia roller...|$|R

5000|$|The Sentra finally {{crossed over}} into the [...] "compact" [...] class when the {{redesigned}} model launched in February 2000 as a 2000 model. When new, this redesign was considered a substantial upgrade, compared to the [...] "cheap" [...] economy car it replaced. Previously, the compact class had been occupied by the Altima, which moved to the mid-size class in 2001, and its wheelbase remained unchanged from the previous generation. Also to be noted is that while earlier Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series Nissan Sunny twins, the B15 Sentra diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny (Nissan Super Sunny). Production shifted from Smyrna, Tennessee to Aguascalientes, Mexico, and the Smyrna production line was retooled to build the Nissan Xterra.

Numerous upgrades were made over the previous generation. The new model featured a new interior with higher quality plastics and more comfortable seats. The exterior was also substantially updated and now featured body-side moldings and clear headlights. The curb weight on the QG18DE-engined Sentra is 2513 lb. With the introduction of the B15 in year 2000, Nissan also introduced a CA 'Clean Air' trim only available in California. The CA trim boasts a double walled exhaust, 3 catalytic converters, quick catalyst warm up, and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone (smog) into oxygen. The Sentra CA model is the only gasoline-fueled vehicle in the world to receive California Air Resources Board (CARB) super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) certification and obtain zero-emission credits.|$|R

40|$|This project used {{a systems}} {{approach}} to improve slim-hole drilling performance. A high power mud motor, having a double-length power section, and hybrid PDC/TSP drill bit {{were developed to}} deliver maximum horsepower to the rock while providing a long life down hole. This high-power slim-hole drilling system drills much faster than conventional slim-hole motor and bit combinations and holds significant potential to reduce slim-hole drilling costs. The oil and gas industries have been faced with downward price pressures since the 1980 s. These pressures {{are not expected to}} be relieved in the near future. To maintain profitability, companies have had to find ways to reduce the costs of producing oil and gas. Drilling {{is one of the more}} costly operations in the production process. One method to reduce costs of drilling is to use smaller more mobile equipment. Slim holes have been drilled in the past using this principle. These wells can save money not only from the use of smaller drilling equipment, but also from reduced tubular costs. Stepping down even one casing size results in significant savings. However, slim holes have not found wide spread use for three reasons. First, until recently, the price of oil has been high so there were no forces to move the industry in this direction. Second, small <b>roller</b> bits and <b>motors</b> were not very reliable and they drilled slowly, removing much of the economic benefit. The third and final reason was the misconception that large holes were needed everywhere to deliver the desired production. Several factors have changed that will encourage the use of slim holes. The industry now favors any method of reducing the costs of producing oil and gas. In addition, the industry now understands that large holes are not always needed. Gas, in particular, can have high production rates in smaller holes. New materials now make it possible to manufacture improved bits and motors that drill for long periods at high rates. All that remains is to gather all the elements together and demonstrate the savings of slim hole drilling...|$|R
