5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick. To close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was blocked by the Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> field to tear down the goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5|$|As they {{attempted}} to continue up the hill, several Chinese soldiers from a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, Bleak <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> trench and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E

5|$|In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the Tar Heel {{fans that}} watched {{the game on}} the {{television}} flooded Franklin Street after the victory over the Jayhawks. Over two thousand people <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> street, which prevented cars from passing for over an hour. Police were required to help maintain the crowds. This has since turned into a tradition where people overrun Franklin Street following a win over the Duke Blue Devils or whenever the Tar Heels have won a National Championship.|$|E
5|$|Iowa State got {{the ball}} to start the game. Their first drive was {{highlighted}} by a 26–yard pass from Sam Richardson to Josh Lenz. The drive totaled 9 plays and 56 yards and culminated with a 33–yard field goal by Edwin Arceo. Tulsa and Iowa State exchanged punts on their next two drives. When Tulsa {{got the ball}} back again, Trey Watts <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball for four yards on the first play of the drive, and then Cody Green threw a short pass that was intercepted by defensive back Jeremy Reeves and returned 31 {{yards for a touchdown}} that put Tulsa up 10–0. Tulsa then put together a 9–play, 75–yard drive during which all three running backs: Alex Singleton, Ja'Terian Douglas, and Trey Watts <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball. It was Singleton who rushed for a two-yard touchdown that made the score 10-7. Iowa State's next drive lasted only two plays, but the second was a 69–yard pass from Richardson to tight end Ernst Brun Jr. for a touchdown. The final two drives of the quarter both went three-and-out.|$|E
5|$|Kansas {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} give themselves another chance at offense by calling timeouts after Kansas <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball. The timeouts stopped the clock, but Kansas managed {{to earn a}} first down and run out the clock after Tech used its allotted threetimeouts. Heading into halftime, Kansas still had the lead and the momentum, but a Virginia Tech touchdown had cut the Jayhawks' lead to just 10points, 177.|$|E

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed <b>rushed.</b> <b>The</b> writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15yards before going out of bounds.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, two {{different}} Tech players were predicted to share time running the ball. Senior running back Cedric Humes was predicted {{to get the}} bulk of the carries in the game, but redshirt freshman Branden Ore was also predicted to see some plays at times. Humes <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball 140times for 639yards and ten touchdowns during the regular season. Ore, meanwhile, ran the ball for 591yards and six touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to entertain the crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles.

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} {{slightly}} more balanced, featuring two running backs who had success throughout the regular season.

Through the air, Tech quarterback Erik Chapman passed for 1,627yards and 10touchdowns during the season prior to the Peach Bowl, making him the most prolific Virginia Tech passer in the nine-year tenure of Tech head Coach Bill Dooley.|$|E

5|$|While Roddenberry, Kelley and Nimoy {{gave their}} {{approval}} to the revised script, Paramount {{was concerned that}} the film would go over-budget as written and ordered cuts. Shatner's envisioned angels and demons at the film's climax were converted to rock monsters that the false god would animate from the earth. Shatner wanted six of the creatures, but was forced to accept just one. Concerned that the franchise's momentum following The Voyage Home had disappeared, Paramount <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> film into production in late 1988 despite the writers' strike cutting into pre-production.|$|E
5|$|Alabama's sole {{success on}} offense {{came from the}} hands of quarterback Andrew Zow, who {{completed}} 19 of 35 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown but also threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball once. Zow's favorite receiver was running back Shaun Alexander, who caught eight passes for 87 yards. Alexander also was Alabama's leading rusher. He finished the game with 21 carries for 55 yards. Zow <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball eight times, but finished with -8 rushing yards. Alexander's eight receptions tied him for third place in receptions during an Alabama bowl game.

5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|Born in Idaho, Bleak {{dropped out}} of school to become a combat medic, and was {{deployed}} to Korea with the 40th Infantry Division. During a mission north into Chinese territory, Bleak's patrol came under heavy attack by fortified Chinese positions.

Bleak is credited with saving the patrol's wounded and ensuring that all of its members returned to allied lines. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return.

Arrington and Vincent Strang <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown.

Then some Americans <b>rushed</b> <b>the</b> front door, and broke it down.
