60|$|It {{happened}} {{that one day}} soon after this I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> a prospectus of a company to execute some extensive engineering works in Australia, and Lord Holmeskirk's name was among the directors.|$|E
60|$|One {{evening the}} boys {{came in with}} a great piece of news. Their tutor had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> that Admiral Penrose was {{appointed}} to the Ramilies, to take command in the Mediterranean. He was a great friend of their father, and, said the boys, was most likely to make him his flag-captain.|$|E

[...] "When I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> this morning that you and your father were here, things seemed {{suddenly}} different. I came at once. I didn't know what I wanted until I saw you, but I know now, and it isn't any good." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'd {{bound up}} {{my hand in}} my {{handkerchief}} by that time, and held it tight under my cloak. I went back by train unnoticed, and returned to my friends' house. I hadn't even told them I was going to Woodbury at all. I pretended I'd been spending the day at Whittingham. Next morning, I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> of your father's murder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good God! You {{must believe}} me. Listen! {{it was all}} a mistake--a printer's error. I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> that the stock for the First Extension mine had gone up, when it should have been the Second. I had some old stock of the First, which I had kept for years, and only thought of when I read the {{announcement}} in the paper this morning. I swear to you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I used to {{know him}} quite well," [...] Penelope answered, [...] "and {{naturally}} I am very much upset. When I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> an account of your interview with the reporter, I could see at once {{that you were not}} telling him everything. Why should you, indeed? A man does not want every detail of his life set out in the newspapers just because he has become connected with a terrible tragedy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Explanation simple enough," [...] {{returned}} Jackman; [...] "are we not constantly <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> {{of ships}} being run down in fogs? Where there is risk {{there is always}} in some minds anxiety--in your case you call it depression of spirits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} how father loves his scarabs. Since {{he retired from}} business, he has been simply wrapped up in them. You know collectors are like that. You <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> about men giving all sorts of money for funny things." ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. [Wisely] Ah! A lot o' {{people thought}} {{when the war}} was over there'd be no more o' that. [He sniggers] Used to amuse me to <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> about <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} unity that was comin'. I could ha' told 'em different.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are making too much of all this, you know. I mean to say, it's quite likely he's found some mug... what I mean is, it's just {{possible}} that your brother isn't standing the entire racket himself. Perhaps some rich Johnnie has breezed along with a pot of money. It often happens like that, you know. You <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> that some manager or other is putting on some show or other, when really the chap who's actually supplying the pieces of eight is some anonymous lad in the background." ...|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{it would}} have been a very dismal abode for poor Laura, who was not too happy either in Dr. Portman's household, and in the town where too many things {{reminded}} her of the dear parent whom she had lost. But old Lady Rockminster, who adored her young friend Laura, as soon as she <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> of her loss, and of her presence in the country, rushed over from Baymouth, where the old lady was staying, and insisted that Laura should remain six months, twelve months, all her life with her; and to her ladyship's house, Martha from Fairoaks, as femme de chambre, accompanied her young mistress.|$|E
60|$|Well! {{and what}} of that? Who am I that I should object to being in prison, when {{so many of the}} royal personages and illustrious {{characters}} of history have been there before me? Can I not carry on my vocation in greater comfort here than I could in my father's house? Have I any anxieties outside these walls? No: for my beloved sister is married--the family net has landed Mr. Batterbury at last. No: for I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> the other day, that Doctor Softly (doubtless through the interest of Lady Malkinshaw) has been appointed the King's-Barber-Surgeon's-Deputy-Consulting Physician. My relatives are comfortable in their sphere--let me proceed forthwith to make myself comfortable in mine. Pen, ink, and paper, if you please, Mr. Jailer: I wish to write to my esteemed publisher.|$|E

His father--you have heard of him, of course--Dwight Partridge." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} Mr. Warrington, arrayed in his brocade bedgown, took his breakfast, read the newspaper, and enjoyed his ease in his inn. He <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> news {{from his own}} country. And {{when he saw the}} words, Williamsburg, Virginia, June 7th, his eyes grew dim somehow. He had just had letters by that packet of June 7th, but his mother did not tell how--"A great number of the {{principal}} gentry of the colony have associated themselves under the command of the Honourable Peyton Randolph, Esquire, to march to the relief of their distressed fellow-subjects, and revenge the cruelties of the French and their barbarous allies. They are in a uniform: viz., a plain blue frock, nanquin or brown waistcoats and breeches, and plain hats. They are armed each with a light firelock, a brace of pistols, and a cutting sword." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the old English and Scotch ballads the fairies are {{regarded}} {{very much in}} the way that I feel inclined to regard Japs and cats. They are not specially spoken of as evil; they are enjoyed as witching and wonderful; but they are not trusted as good. You do not say the wrong words or give the wrong gifts to them; and there is a curious silence about what would happen to you if you did. Now to me, Japan, the Japan of Art, was always a fairyland. What trees as gay as flowers and peaks as white as wedding cakes; what lanterns as large as houses and houses as frail as lanterns!&hellip; but... but... the missionary explained (I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper)</b> that the assertion and denial about the Japanese use of torture was a mere matter of verbal translation. [...] "The Japanese would not call twisting the thumbs back 'torture.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Granville Kelmscott, of course, {{took a very}} {{different}} view of Guy Waring's position. He had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> he bought at Plymouth that Guy was the murderer of Montague Nevitt. Regarding him, therefore, as a criminal of the deepest dye now flying from justice, he wasn't at all surprised at Guy's shrinking and shunning him; what astonished him rather was the man's occasional and incredible fits of effrontery. How that fellow could ever laugh and talk at all among the ladies on deck--with the hangman at his back--simply appalled and horrified the proud soul of a Kelmscott. Granville had hard work to keep from expressing his horror openly at times. But still, with an effort, he kept his peace. With the picture {{of his father and}} Lady Emily now strong before his mind, he couldn't find it in his heart to bring his own half-brother, however guilty and criminal the man might be, {{to the foot of the}} gallows.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{you speak of}} this affair," [...] the Prince continued, [...] "and before now I {{expected}} to <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> that you had put your hand upon the guilty one. If you have not done so, I am very {{sure that there is}} some explanation." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Crawford, who had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> of her guest's {{relationship}} to the Earl of Carbury, then sent for her carriage, and dressed herself handsomely. When they had gone some distance, they entered a wide street, crossed half way along by an avenue and an elevated railway.|$|R
40|$|Editors {{have long}} {{believed}} {{in their hearts}} that the economic success of newspapers depends on their credibility. We find evidence to support this belief by examining 21 counties where newspaper credibility has been measured. The more people believe what they <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers,</b> <b>the</b> greater the robustness of circulation penetration over a recent 5 -year period. Unfortunately, both credibility and readership are falling in {{what appears to be}} a classic reinforcing process. Philip Meyer is Knight Professor o...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Marilla, I'll {{just tell}} you plain that I think you're doing a mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that's what. You don't know what you're getting. You're {{bringing}} a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he's likely to turn out. Why, it was only last week I <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> how {{a man and his}} wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night--set it ON PURPOSE, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs--they couldn't break him of it. If you had asked my advice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what." ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot {{supply the}} information. And, before you condemn me, let me hastily {{add that the}} fault is not mine but that of Mrs. Hignett herself. The fact is, she never went to Buffalo. Schenectady saw nothing of her. She did not get within a {{thousand}} miles of Chicago, nor did she penetrate to St. Louis. For the very morning after her son Eustace sailed for England in the liner [...] "Atlantic," [...] she happened to <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> one of those abridged passenger-lists which the journals of New York are {{in the habit of}} printing, and got a nasty shock when she saw that, among those whose society Eustace would enjoy during the voyage, was [...] "Miss Wilhelmina Bennett, daughter of J. Rufus Bennett of Bennett, Mandelbaum and Co.". And within five minutes of digesting this information, she was at her desk writing out telegrams cancelling all her engagements. Iron-souled as this woman was, her fingers trembled as she wrote. She had a vision of Eustace and the daughter of J. Rufus Bennett strolling together on moonlit decks, leaning over rails damp with sea-spray and, in short, generally starting the whole trouble all over again.|$|E
6000|$|Pages of [...] "nonsense" [...] followed, {{and very}} {{delightful}} nonsense it was, for Cyrilla possessed the happy gift of bright and easy letter-writing. She commented wittily {{on all the}} amusing episodes of the boarding-house life for the past month; she described a cat-fight she had witnessed from her window that morning and illustrated it by a pen-and-ink sketch of the belligerent felines; she described a lovely new dress her mother had sent her from home and told all about the class party to which she had worn it; she gave an account of her vacation camping trip to the mountains and pasted on one page {{a number of small}} snapshots taken during the outing; she copied a joke she had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> that morning and discussed the serial story in the boarding-house magazine which all the boarders were reading; she wrote out the directions for a new crocheted tidy her sister had made--Miss Marshall had a mania for crocheting; and she finally wound up with [...] "all the good will and good wishes that Nora Jane will consent to carry from your friend, Cyrilla Blair." ...|$|E
