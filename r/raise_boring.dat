5000|$|The {{raise borer}} {{is set up}} on the upper level of the two levels to be connected, on an evenly laid {{platform}} (typically a concrete pad). A small-diameter hole (pilot hole) is drilled to the level required; the diameter of this hole is typically 230mm - 445mm (9" [...] - 17.5"), large enough to accommodate the drill string. Once the drill has broken into the opening on the target level, the bit is removed and a reamer head, of the required diameter of the excavation, is attached to the drill string and raised back towards the machine. The drill cuttings from the reamer head fall {{to the floor of the}} lower level. The finished raise has smooth walls and may not require rock bolting or other forms of ground support. The one of impressive use of <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> is a 7.1 m diameter shafts for Sasol's Middelbult and Bosjesspruit Mines in South Africa.

50|$|In {{traditional}} <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> operations, {{mining companies}} use a drilling technique known as ‘up-reaming’. Normally, {{this type of}} rig first drills a small pilot hole downward, then large machine cutters {{are attached to the}} drill which is sticking out the bottom of the pilot hole. The massive cutters are pulled up as they grind through thick rock, boring along the pilot hole. In this case however, since the space below was blocked and the raise bore bit could not be attached from underground, the rig was modified to widen the hole from above.|$|E

50|$|Instead, {{the station}} {{platforms}} consist of two chambers linked by cross tunnels, each having two platforms {{on top of}} each other. The side of each chamber was made up of two drift tunnels, one at the top and one at the bottom. These were then linked together by 228 vertically <b>raise</b> <b>bored</b> shafts, 1 metre in diameter and 3 metres apart. The shafts and drifts were then filled with concrete, and formed the side skeleton of the station chambers. The arch of each chamber was then constructed underground {{across the top of the}} two side walls, the material below the arch excavated down to the bottom of the side walls, and temporary cross struts added between the <b>raise</b> <b>bored</b> columns until the permanent elements were added. This innovative method resulted in a $1 million saving in construction costs (in 1975 dollars).|$|R
50|$|Shallow shafts, {{typically}} sunk {{for civil}} engineering projects differ greatly in execution method from deep shafts, typically sunk for mining projects. When {{the top of}} the excavation is the ground surface, it is referred to as a shaft; when {{the top of the}} excavation is underground, it is called a winze or a sub-shaft. Small shafts may be excavated upwards from within an existing mine {{as long as there is}} access at the bottom, in which case they are called Raises. A shaft may be either vertical or inclined (between 45 and 90 degrees to the horizontal), although most modern mine shafts are vertical. If access exists at the bottom of the proposed shaft and ground conditions allow then <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> may be used to excavate the shaft from the bottom up, such shafts are called borehole shafts. Shaft sinking is one of the most difficult of all development methods: restricted space, gravity, groundwater and specialized procedures make the task quite formidable.|$|E
50|$|The Skyway Monte Bianco was {{designed}} by architect, Carlo Rossi, took four years to construct, and involved complete rebuilding of the Point Helbronner terminus {{at a cost of}} 110 million euros. The cable cars were manufactured by Doppelmayr Cable Car and the top station was engineered so as to minimise energy consumption, and includes solar panels and highly efficient insulation in order to bring it close to a zero-energy building. The horizontal tunnel and vertical well which now give access to Pointe Helbronner, the Torino Hut and the Vallee Blanche, also serve to anchor the cable car station into the rock. The vertical lift shaft is a 5 metre wide well, approximately 70 m in depth. To avoid damage to the structural integrity of the mountain, explosives were not used during the tunnel's construction. Instead, a series of small holes were drilled, each 40 cm diameter, using a technique known as <b>raise</b> <b>boring.</b> The tunnel and vertical shaft together provide firm anchorage to the cable car equipment, each cable of which has to be capable of carrying loads of over 100 tons. The base of the vertical shaft also houses water tanks for fire-fighting purposes.|$|E

60|$|Another {{important}} point is prepotency. Gartner has shown that when a species is fertilised with pollen from another species, if it be afterwards fertilised with its own pollen, or {{with that of the}} same species, this is so prepotent over the foreign pollen that the effect of the latter, though placed on the stigma some time previously, is entirely destroyed. Exactly the same thing occurs with the two forms of a heterostyled species. Thus several long-styled flowers of Primula veris were fertilised illegitimately with pollen from another plant of the same form, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately with pollen from a short- styled dark-red polyanthus which is a variety of P. veris; and the result was that every one of the thirty seedlings thus <b>raised</b> <b>bore</b> flowers more or less red, showing plainly how prepotent the legitimate pollen from a short-styled plant was over the illegitimate pollen from a long-styled plant.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the two non-blasting methods, <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> and wire sawing, {{have been studied}} for the making of {{vertical}} shafts in rock. The methods have been compared to each other to see which similarities and differences there are. The comparison is directed towards shafts made in an urban environment when drilling and blasting can’t be used because of impact restrictions on the surrounding buildings. The {{purpose of the study}} is to clarify under which specific conditions a particular method is most suitable for use. A third method, thermal spallation, has also been studied to see if the method, which today is used in quarrying operations only, can be used for making vertical shafts in an urban environment.       The report includes detailed descriptions of the three methods based on a literature review and has been completed with relevant information from an interview study, adding personal experiences of people who have worked with the methods. Case studies of shafts which have been executed by wire sawing or <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> have also been done. Information about the time and cost have been collected from the respondents and analyzed. The focus of the work has been to create a understanding of how the two techniques differ on the following points; time, cost, length and inclination of the shaft, dimensions of the cross section, working area and establishment, impacts on the surrounding, rock quality/geology and support and sealing. A survey of the companies who work with the methods in Sweden has also been made. The result shows that the methods are similar in many ways, but the areas were they differ the most are time, cost, shaft length, inclination, and dimension of the cross section. <b>Raise</b> <b>boring</b> is more suitable for longer shafts and is a reliable method, especially if the shaft is inclined. Wire sawing is a flexible method were the shape of the cross section can have many different forms and only the rock that is cut loose sets the limitations. The case studies and the time analysis shows that <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> is a faster method than wire sawing for the making of shafts, mainly because the rock that was cut loose with the wire got stuck in the shafts in many of the cases. The general cost analysis that was done shows that wire sawing is the cheapest alternative when the length of the shaft is shorter than 40 – 50 m. The reason for this is mainly that the cost of the establishment is 10 times higher for <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> than for wire sawing. Based on the results and conclusions from this study a table has been made with guidelines for choosing which method to use in future projects. Thermal spallation as it is today is a technique which can‘t be used in an urban environment. With modifications to the required equipment, the method could compete with wire sawing and <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{direction}} of mining development over the last 30 years has been toward the use of larger and more powerful equipment. This direction is, to a degree, controlled {{by the need to}} penetrate and extract rock over as wide a range of compressive strengths as possible. An illustration of the success of this approach has, for example, recently been given by the raising of the ventilation shaft at the Kloof Gold Mine (Ref. 1). In that bore, which exceeded 1, 100 m in length, the drilling and <b>raise</b> <b>boring</b> heads had to penetrate rock of up to 550 MPa uniaxial compressive strength, and were able to do this, for the pilot bore at a rate of 1 m. /hour, and with the main bore at an average rate of 54 m/month. However, to achieve this rate, loads of up to 20 tons/cutter had to be applied to the tool, and the wear rate of these tools was a significant cost item. The problems with this approach, are twofold. Firstly, the equipment to exert these forces must be correspondingly la...|$|E
60|$|The {{original}} mother-plant, {{from which}} the five successive self-fertilised generations were <b>raised,</b> <b>bore</b> dingy purple flowers. At no time was any selection practised, and the plants were subjected in each generation to extremely uniform conditions. The result was, as in some previous cases, that the flowers on all the self-fertilised plants, both in the pots and open ground, were absolutely uniform in tint; this being a dull, rather peculiar flesh colour. This uniformity was very striking in the long row of plants growing in the open ground, and these first attracted my attention. I did not notice in which generation the original colour began to change and to become uniform, but I {{have every reason to}} believe that the change was gradual. The flowers on the intercrossed plants were mostly of the same tint, but not nearly so uniform as those on the self-fertilised plants, and many of them were pale, approaching almost to white. The flowers on the plants from the cross with the purple-flowered Westerham stock were, as might have been expected, much more purple and not nearly so uniform in tint. The self-fertilised plants were also remarkably uniform in height, as judged by the eye; the intercrossed less so, whilst the Westerham-crossed plants varied much in height.|$|R
40|$|In This Chapter [Ventilation and methane {{sampling}} {{guidelines for}} conventional shafts Dealing with restricted spaces where methane can accumulate Ventilation and methane sampling at <b>raise</b> <b>bore</b> drills and Filling shafts at closed coal mines] It {{is not unusual}} to encounter methane gas during shaft excavation or shaft-filling operations. Shafts into coalbeds usually produce the most methane, so the information in this chapter applies primarily to shafts at coal mines.

METHANE IN SHAFTS EXCAVATED BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS (DRILL, BLAST, MUCK) [] Ventilation. Shafts excavated by conventional means are ventilated with a fan on the surface connected to ductwork that extends down into the shaft (Figure 9 - 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Shafts play an {{essential}} part in the construction, operation and maintenance of tunnels and deep underground structures but are rarely given exclusive prominence in technical publications. The aim {{of this paper is}} to summarise the experiences gained in Hong Kong SAR during the construction of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme Stage 1 where seventeen shafts were constructed. Their excavated diameters range between 2. 5 m to 50 m and at a maximum depth over 150 m these are the deepest shafts below sea level in Hong Kong. All shafts were located in reclaimed land and in close proximity to the sea. The upper shafts in soils and weak rock were constructed by diaphragm walling method and the lower shafts in rock by mainly drilling and blasting. <b>Raise</b> <b>boring</b> and blind shaft drilling methods were also employed. The upper shafts and permanent shaft linings were designed using conventional methods and the primary support selection for the lower shaft was based on Barton’s (1974) ‘Q ’ system. Settlement monitoring and inclinometer measurements were undertaken during excavation to confirm the design assumptions. During construction several difficulties were met that had to be overcome. All shafts with the exception of one were successfully excavated and completed. This paper addresses the key design and construction issues and the difficulties that were encountered which may be common for deep shafts constructed in an urban setting near a coastline...|$|E

It is used in all stages of the mining process, from site characterization to production operations. The goal of the International Workshop on Rock Mass Classification in Underground Mining {{was to provide a}} forum for leading practitioners of rock mass classification to come together and share their methods and experiences with the technique. The workshop was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on May 31, 2007. It was co-chaired by Christopher Mark, Ph. D., P. E., National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh, PA, and Rimas Pakalnis, P. Eng., University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. The proceedings of the workshop contain 16 invited papers from 9 countries, reflecting the international depth and breadth of current practice. Applications in both hard-rock and coal mining are well represented. Some of the topics that were addressed at the workshop include: 1. Major rock mass classification systems used in mining and their variants; 2. Collection of input data through observation, rock testing, and geophysics; 3. Design of mine layouts and rock support systems using classification; 4. Estimation of rock mass strength and other input parameters for numerical models from classification; 5.

The 30 " pipeline begins in El Encino, {{in the state of}} Chihuahua, and terminates in Topolobampo, in the state of Sinaloa. It runs in a West-South West direction perpendicularly crossing the "Sierra Madre Occidental", a mountain range characterized by uneven morphology with deep and narrow valleys and steep slopes. Near the village of Santa Matilde, before reaching the Chinipas River, the pipeline route has to overcome a 150 meters high steep slope {{on the left side of}} the valley of Chinipas. This slope features a sub vertical rocky cliff with a 55 meters drop in the upper section. A trenchless crossing of the slope was designed and executed to safely cross the steep slope by means of raise borer and tunnel.

40|$|Longwall mining has {{historically}} been considered an application for only deep reserves. This {{has changed in the}} recent past as longwall has become competitive with surface mining. Many resources marked for stripping now lie in the domain of longwall. Today, the best longwall mines compete with strip mines operating in even the lowest stripping ratios. Longwall mining has become more widely applicable than it ever {{has been in the past}} and it is now generally considered the method of choice in situations where high levels of coal production are required. But the best way to use longwall mining has become less certain with the opportunities that highwall access provides. Wall-to-wall mining is the use of retreating longwall developed from and retreating toward a highwall. As a surface mine reaches its ultimate highwall, the opportunity for longwall punch mining or wall-to-wall mining is obvious. There are several clear operating advantages to operating a longwall in this way and where highwalls are available, the best economic decision will generally favor planning a direct approach. Yet wall-to-wall is not applicable in every situation even when highwalls are available. Moreover, the advantages of wall-to-wall mining do not always justify the cost of trenching or box cuts to access coal. However, many tactical advantages of operating from the highwall can be realized with the use of specially equipped blind drilled or <b>raised</b> <b>bored</b> shafts. This paper discusses novel techniques for a shaft assisted mining system which permits the addition of conveyor structure and mine systems from the surface to the face for advance and retreat mining with longwall, shortwall or room and pillar panels...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{drilling}} technologies use MWD (Measuring While Drilling) and LWD (Logging While Drilling) systems {{near the}} drill bit {{in order to}} gather large amounts of directional and geological information. The data are mostly processed downhole. To transmit the main results to the surface in nearly real time a high speed data communication system with more than 100 bit/s is highly advantageous. The most commonly usedprocessfor data transmission in boreholes is the so called mud pulse telemetry. However, mud pulse telemetry systems cannot transmit such high data rates. A significant improvement is expected {{through the use of}} acoustic waves along the drill string for data transmission. In the 1980 s and 1990 s there were some attempts to transmit the downhole data by means of acoustic signals along the metallic drill string to the surface. However, these trials were not much of a success, because the acoustic transmission channel of a real drill string was too complex for the applied modulation schemes. In details, a drill string channel configuration consisting {{of a large number of}} drill pipes and tooljoints with different diameters causes multiple signal reflections and depending on the superimposing of all reflections with the original signal, pass- and stop bands will be created. This limits the achievable data rate, because only thepassbands are suitable for use by data transmission. Moreover, the characteristics of the pass- and stop bands vary with each change in the drill string configuration. Because of such challenging issues, the acoustic transmission process is significantly complex. However, the deployment of new actuators in combination with latest state of the art techniques from mobile communications can overcome the mentioned difficulties. Such techniques enable for instance an adaptive bi-directional communication to be applied, whereby the data transmission can continuously be adapted to the changing channel characteristics. As a first step for the application of the acoustic communication system on a real drill string a prototype systemfor unidirectional communication (uplink transmission) was developed and built up. Due to their relatively large sizes (outer diameter: 11 1 / 4 "), the current prototype components cannot be used in standard deep bottom hole assemblies. However, suitable drill strings for such prototype sizes are found in mining drilling operations, for example with <b>raise</b> <b>bore</b> drilling. Thus, the initial prototype components were designed to be integrated into a <b>raise</b> <b>bore</b> drill string. The highly robust communication concept was developed to allow initial data rates of up to 30 bit/s. The prototype transmitting system consists of two units. The first one is located downhole. It includes a generator, a battery and a transmitter-sub. Furthermore there is the surface unit, which includes a receiver module, a WLAN access point and a terminal computer. The downhole batteiy can be recharged by a downhole alternator, which is driven by the drilling mud. The receiver module is attached to the uppermost drill string element and connected via a WiFi module to the terminal computer. At the surface unit the received data will be decoded and evaluated. The communication system is ready to be tested on a real well to transmit different types of data to the surface and to decode them there. The data to be transmitted during the initial field test will include information about the battery status, the temperature of the downhole unit in addition to dynamic and directional drilling data. In order to test the application limits as well as the robustness of the novel acoustic data transmission system, the influence of different interferences and noise sources on the data transmission quality were to he investigated. Unfortunately, the field trial was delaved several times and in the end cancelled in the scope of this project. But results from laboratory tests are available. During these investigations with the new acoustic communication telemetry system several interfering signals were generated to simulate real operation. Water waspumped through the system and the mechanical interaction between the drill string and the borehole wall was reproduced by rubbing on the drill string with sandpaper and applying hammer scales as well as combinations thereof Although the induced interferences reduced the quality of the data stream, the data transmission along the drill string was still possible in the presence of any kind of interference. The next development step would be the implementation of an adaptive, bi-directional communication system. This already has been built up and tested in the laboratory setup. The bi-directional communication system will significantly increase the transmission rate...|$|R

60|$|We {{now come}} to a far more general and {{therefore}} more important {{means by which the}} mutual fertilisation of distinct plants is effected, namely, the fertilising power of pollen from another variety or individual being greater than that of a plant's own pollen. The simplest and best known case of prepotent action in pollen, though it does not bear directly on our present subject, is that of a plant's own pollen over that from a distinct species. If pollen from a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a castrated flower, and then after the interval of several hours, pollen from the same species be placed on the stigma, the effects of the former are wholly obliterated, excepting in some rare cases. If two varieties are treated in the same manner, the result is analogous, though of directly opposite nature; for pollen from any other variety is often or generally prepotent over that from the same flower. I will give some instances: the pollen of Mimulus luteus regularly falls on the stigma of its own flower, for the plant is highly fertile when insects are excluded. Now several flowers on a remarkably constant whitish variety were fertilised without being castrated with pollen from a yellowish variety; and of the twenty-eight seedlings thus <b>raised,</b> every one <b>bore</b> yellowish flowers, so that the pollen of the yellow variety completely overwhelmed that of the mother-plant. Again, Iberis umbellata is spontaneously self-fertile, and I saw an abundance of pollen from their own flowers on the stigmas; nevertheless, of thirty seedlings raised from non-castrated fflowers of a crimson variety crossed with pollen from a pink variety, twenty-four bore pink flowers, like those of the male or pollen-bearing parent.|$|R
5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist pin <b>bore</b> <b>raised</b> five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle bearing in the clutch pressure plate, for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3.
