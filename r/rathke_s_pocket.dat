Comparisons among these structures and of each with native, uncomplexed SGPB reveal that each complex features a unique solvent structure in the <b>S</b> 1 binding <b>pocket.</b> The number and relative positions of water molecules bound in the <b>S</b> 1 binding <b>pocket</b> {{vary according to the}} size of the side chain of the P 1 residue.

Proteolytic assays further revealed that it cleaved behind various P 1 residue types. The crystal structure of EFEa was determined using the MIR method and refined to 2. 3 A ̊ resolution. The enzyme, showing the overall polypeptide fold of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, possesses essential S 1 specificity determinants character-istic of elastase. However, the b strand at the west rim of the <b>S</b> 1 specificity <b>pocket</b> is significantly elongated by a unique four-residue insertion (Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu) after Val 217, which not only provides additional substrate hydrogen binding sites for distal P residues, but also causes extension of the <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket</b> at the south rim. The S 2 subsite of the enzyme was partially occluded by the bulky side-chain of residue Tyr 99. Structure-based inhibitor modeling demonstrated that EFEa’s <b>S</b> 1 specificity <b>pocket</b> was preferable for elastase-specific small hydrophobic P 1 residues, while its accommodation of long and/or bulky P 1 residues was also feasible if enhanced binding of the substrate and induced fit of the <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket</b> were achieved.

Therefore, structural insights about the substrate recognition of caspase- 3 are needed for the future development of caspase- 3 based inhibitors and drugs. In this study, crystal structures of recombinant caspase- 3 in complex with seven substrate analog inhibitors, including acetyl (Ac) -DEVD-aldehyde (Cho), Ac-DMQD-Cho, Ac-IEPD-Cho, Ac-YVAD-Cho, Ac-WEHD-Cho, Ac-VDVAD-Cho, and tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) -D-fluoromethylketone (Fmk), have been analyzed in combination with enzyme kinetic data and computational models. Seven crystal structures were determined at resolutions of 1. 7 - 2. 6 Å. The binding conformation of each inhibitor residue at P 1 -P 4 position was analyzed. The negative P 1 aspartic acid side chain is exclusively required by the positive <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket</b> of caspase- 3. Small hydrophobic P 2 residues are preferred by the nonpolar <b>S</b> 2 <b>pocket</b> formed by Y 204, W 206, and F 256. Although hydrophilic residues at P 3 position tend to fit better, hydrophobic residues also can be accommodated by the plastic <b>S</b> 3 <b>pocket.</b> Two substrate binding sites were found in the <b>S</b> 4 <b>pocket,</b> one formed by main chain atoms of F 250 and side chain atoms of N 208 and the other formed by aromatic side chains of W 206 and W 214.

While the cathepsin L-like cathepsin K (Tyr 67 Leu/Leu 205 Ala) mutant has a marked preference for Phe, the Leu 67 Tyr/Ala 205 Leu cathepsin L variant shows an effective cathepsin K-like preference for Leu and Pro. A similar turnaround of inhibition was observed by using specific inhibitors of cathepsin K [1 -(N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl) - 5 -(N-Boc-phenylalanyl-leucyl) carbohydrazid e] and cathepsin L [N-(4 -biphenylacetyl) -S-methylcysteine-(D) -Arg-Phe-beta-phenethylamide]. Molecular modeling studies indicated that mutations alter the character of both S 2 and S 3 subsites, while docking calculations were consistent with kinetics data. The cathepsin K-like cathepsin L was unable to mimic the collagen-degrading activity of cathepsin K against collagens I and II, DQ-collagens I and IV, and elastin-Congo Red. In summary, double mutations of the <b>S</b> 2 <b>pocket</b> of cathepsins K (Y 67 L/L 205 A) and L (L 67 Y/A 205 L) induce a switch of their enzymatic specificity toward small selective inhibitors and peptidyl substrates, confirming the key role of residues 67 and 205.

Comprehensive structure-activity relationships clarified the binding preferences of the individual pockets of the active site. The <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket</b> tolerates various substituents with a preference for flexible and basic side chains. Variation of the S 2 substituent led to high-affinity ligands with inhibition constants down to 2 nM for compounds bearing cyclohexyl substituents. Systematic investigations on the <b>S</b> 3 <b>pocket</b> revealed its potential to achieve high activities with aromatic vectors that undergo stacking interactions with the planar peptide backbone forming part of the pocket. X-ray crystal structure analysis with the structurally related enzyme human cathepsin L confirmed the binding mode of the triazine ligand series as proposed by molecular modeling. Sub-micromolar inhibition of the proliferation of cultured parasites was achieved for ligands decorated with the best substituents identified through the optimization cycles. In cell-based assays, the introduction of a basic side chain on the inhibitors resulted in a 35 -fold increase in antitrypanosomal activity. Finally, bioisosteric imidazopyridine nitriles were studied in order to prevent off-target effects with unselective nucleophiles by decreasing the inherent electrophilicity of the triazine nitrile headgroup. Using this ligand, the stabilization by intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the thioimidate intermediate, formed upon attack of the catalytic cysteine residue, compensates for the lower reactivity of the headgroup.

Despite the high amino acid sequence identities and structural similarities between cathepsins K and L, only cathepsin K is capable of cleaving interstitial collagens in their triple helical domains. To investigate this specificity, we have engineered the <b>S</b> 2 <b>pocket</b> of human cathepsin K into a cathepsin L-like subsite. Using combinatorial fluorogenic substrate libraries, the P 1 -P 4 substrate {{specificity of}} the cathepsin K variant, Tyr 67 Leu/Leu 205 Ala, was determined and {{compared with those of}} cathepsins K and L. The introduction of the double mutation into the S 2 subsite of cathepsin K rendered the unique S 2 binding preference of the protease for proline and leucine residues into a cathepsin L-like preference for bulky aromatic residues. Homology modeling and docking calculations supported the experimental findings. The cathepsin L-like S 2 specificity of the mutant protein and the integrity of its catalytic site were confirmed by kinetic analysis of synthetic di- and tripeptide substrates as well as pH stability and pH activity profile studies. The loss of the ability to accept proline in the <b>S</b> 2 binding <b>pocket</b> by the mutant protease completely abolished the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K whereas its overall gelatinolytic activity remained unaffected.

A site-saturation library of the M 213 position yielded two variants with a significantly broadened substrate profile, i. e., M 213 G and M 213 P. Next, examination of two libraries with M 213 G+L 208 X and M 213 P+L 208 X (with X being any proteinogenic amino acid) resulted in a toolbox of enzymes which can accommodate any proteinogenic amino acid in the <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket,</b> except proline. The applicability of a particular enzyme variant in chemoenzymatic peptide synthesis was demonstrated by coupling at the gram scale of two peptide segments to yield exenatide, a 39 -mer therapeutic peptide used in the treatment of diabetes type II. The overall yield of 43 % is at least 2 -fold higher than yields reported for conventional syntheses of exenatide by full solid-phase peptide synthesis; large-scale production costs are expected to be significantly reduced if the enzymatic coupling process is employed to manufacture this peptide...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cysteine}} proteases, GP 2 and GP 3, {{have been}} isolated from ginger rhizomes (Zingiber officinale). GP 2 is virtually identical to a previously identified ginger protease GPII [K. H. Choi, and R. A. Laursen, Amino-acid sequence and glycan structures of cysteine proteases with proline specificity from ginger rhizome Zingiber officinale, Eur J Biochem. 267 (2000) 1516 - 1526. ], and cleaves native type I collagen at multiple discrete sites, {{which are in}} the interior of the triple helical region of this molecule. In reaction with proline-containing peptides GP 2 shows preference for Pro in the P 2 position, and at least 10 -fold higher efficiency of hydrolysis than papain. Comparison of models of GP 2 and GP 3 with the crystal structure of papain shows that the three enzymes have different <b>S</b> 2 <b>pocket</b> structures. The <b>S</b> 2 <b>pocket</b> in GP 2 and GP 3 is half the size of that of papain. GP 2 is the only reported plant cysteine protease with a demonstrated ability to hydrolyse native collagen. The results support a role for ginger proteases as an alternative to papain, in commercial applications such as meat tenderization, where collagen is the target substrate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (u-PA) promotes fibrinolysis by catalyzing {{the conversion}} of plasminogen to the active protease plasmin via the cleavage of a peptide bond. When localized to the external cell surface it contributes to tissue remodelling and cellular migration; inhibition of its activity impedes the spread of cancer. u-PA has three domains: an N-terminal receptor-binding growth factor domain, a central kringle domain and a C-terminal catalytic protease domain. The biological roles of the fibrinolytic enzymes render them therapeutic targets, however, until now no structure of the protease domain has been available. Solution {{of the structure of}} the u-PA serine protease was undertaken to provide such data. RESULTS: The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of recombinant, non-glycosylated human u-PA, complexed with the inhibitor Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (EGRcmk), has been determined at a nominal resolution of 2. 5 A and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 22. 4 % on all data (20. 4 % on data > 3 sigma). The enzyme has the expected topology of a trypsin-like serine protease. CONCLUSIONS: The enzyme has an <b>S</b> 1 specificity <b>pocket</b> similar to that of trypsin, a restricted, less accessible, hydrophobic <b>S</b> 2 <b>pocket</b> and a solvent-accessible <b>S</b> 3 <b>pocket</b> which is capable of accommodating a wide range of residues. The EGRcmk inhibitor binds covalently at the active site to form a tetrahedral hemiketal structure. Although the overall structure is similar to that of homologous serine proteases, at six positions insertions of extra residues in loop regions create unique surface areas. One of these loop regions is highly mobile despite being anchored by the disulphide bridge which is characteristic of a small subset of serine proteases namely tissuetype plasminogen activator, Factor XII and Complement Factor I...|$|R
40|$|Turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY 3) is a {{canonical}} inhibitor of serine proteinases. Upon complex formation, the inhibitors fully exposed P 1 residue becomes fully {{buried in}} the preformed cavity of the enzyme. All 20 P 1 variants of OMTKY 3 have been obtained by recombinant DNA technology and their equilibrium association constants have been measured with six serine proteinases. To rationalize the trends observed in this data set, high resolution crystal structures have been determined for OMTKY 3 P 1 variants in complex with the bacterial serine proteinase, Streptomyces griseus proteinase B (SGPB). Four high resolution complex structures are being reported in this paper; the three beta-branched variants, Ile 18 I, Val 18 I, and Thr 18 I, determined to 2. 1, 1. 6, and 1. 7 A resolution, respectively, {{and the structure of}} the Ser 18 I variant complex, determined to 1. 9 A resolution. Models of the Cys 18 I, Hse 18 I, and Ape 18 I variant complexes are also discussed. The beta-branched side chains are not complementary to the shape of the <b>S</b> 1 binding <b>pocket</b> in SGPB, in contrast to that of the wild-type gamma-branched P 1 residue for OMTKY 3, Leu 18 I. Chi 1 angles of approximately 40 degrees are imposed on the side chains of Ile 18 I, Val 18 I, and Thr 18 I within the <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket.</b> Dihedral angles of + 60 degrees, - 60 degrees, or 180 degrees are more commonly observed but 40 degrees is not unfavorable for the beta-branched side chains. Thr 18 I Ogamma 1 also forms a hydrogen bond with Ser 195 Ogamma in this orientation. The Ser 18 I side chain adopts two alternate conformations within the <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket</b> of SGPB, suggesting that the side chain is not stable in either conformation...|$|R
30|$|Increased {{affinity}} of PSMA inhibitors {{was reported}} by interaction with the 20 -Å-deep amphipathic funnel-shaped tunnel leading from the enzyme surface to the <b>S</b> 1 <b>pocket</b> in the active center of PSMA [32]. The bulky substituent biphenylalanine in 4 showed the lowest affinity in this series, most likely due to steric repulsion in this narrow tunnel and suboptimal fit into the arene-binding site [13, 33]. Yet, in a recent investigation, a PSMA inhibitor with a similar biphenyl residue demonstrated the highest Ki among the tested set of ligands [34].|$|R
