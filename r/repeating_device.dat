This {{information can be}} of value to law enforcement agencies, intelligence organizations, and industry. Despite {{the introduction of the}} Bluetooth Low Energy standard that incorporates anonymity preservation mechanisms, the presence of devices that support Classic Bluetooth that uses unique and persistent device identifiers is expected to remain significant for a number of years. The common approach to finding discoverable Classic Bluetooth devices relies on a standard inquiry process that is not truly passive.

Ubertooth One, a low-cost open source Bluetooth development platform, can assist with overcoming this limitation in a truly passive manner, making it an attractive digital forensic instrument. Using vehicle-based sensors and parallel multi-method device discovery, we conduct a practical evaluation of Ubertooth One for passive discovery and contrast its discovery rate to the standard method. Based on 83 comparative field experiments, we show that Ubertooth One can produce forensically sound observations while able to discover up to ten times as many devices.

Among seed cells, the mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly (hUCMSCs) represent a promising candidate and hold potential for bone tissue engineering due to the the lack of ethical controversies, accessibility, sourced by non-invasive procedures for donors, a reduced risk of contamination, osteogenic differentiation capacities, and higher immunomodulatory capacity. However, the current culture methods are somewhat complicated and inefficient and often fail to make the best use of the umbilical cord (UC) tissues. Moreover, these culture processes cannot be performed on a large scale and under strict quality control. As a result, only a small quantity of cells can be harvested using the current culture methods. To solve these problems, we designed and evaluated an UC Wharton’s jelly <b>repeated</b> culture <b>device.</b> Using this device, hUCMSCs were obtained from the repeated cultures and their quantities and biological characteristics were compared.

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Subsection 1.5. 3, {{the density of}} M 2 M devices per cell {{is expected to be}} enormous. Therefore, when these devices will try to access the network concurrently, this will lead to a low RA success rate and high network congestion in the PRACH. Consequently, this may cause unexpected delays, increasing packet loss, inefficient radio resource utilization, extra energy consumption as well as service intervention. Moreover, the random access channel can be further overloaded when these <b>devices</b> <b>repeat</b> their attempts to access the network after collisions. Thus, efficient access methods and overload control mechanisms are required to perform efficient RA procedures. Additionally, the initial access procedure in LTE-A networks consists of numerous steps which cause a significant amount of overhead and latency. Authors in [17] further stated that the state-of-the-art access procedures are not appropriate for M 2 M traffic. Either evolutionary (simpler) access schemes should be standardized for M 2 M communications or a revolutionary approach, i.e., fully separated standard LTE- and M 2 M-based data and control channels are required.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Super-infection {{in adult}} {{bacterial}} meningitis (ABM) {{is a condition}} wherein the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) grows new pathogen(s) during the therapeutic course of meningitis. It is an uncommon but clinically important condition rarely examined in literature. Methods Twenty-seven episodes of super-infection states in 21 ABM patients collected in a 9. 5 -year study period (January 2001 to June 2010) were evaluated. The clinical characteristics, implicated pathogens, results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and therapeutic outcomes were analyzed. Results Twenty-one patients (13 men, 8 women) aged 25 - 73 years (median, 45 years) had post-neurosurgical state as the preceding event and nosocomial infection. The post-neurosurgical states included spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with craniectomy or craniotomy with extra-ventricular drainage (EVD) or ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS) in 10 patients, traumatic ICH with craniectomy or craniotomy with EVD or VPS in 6 patients, hydrocephalus s/p VPS in 2 patients, and one patient each with cerebral infarct s/p craniectomy with EVD, meningeal metastasis s/p Omaya implant, and head injury. All 21 patients had EVD and/or VP shunt and/or Omaya implant during the whole course of ABM. Recurrent fever {{was the most common}} presentation and the implicated bacterial pathogens were protean, many of which were antibiotic resistant. Most patients required adjustment of antibiotics after the pathogens were identified but even with antimicrobial therapy, 33. 3 % (7 / 21) died. Morbidity was also high among survivors.

The EO interdevice comparisons showed mean differences and limits of agreement within established thresholds, thus indicating fair accuracy when comparing <b>devices.</b> <b>Repeats</b> with the same spirometer did not result in statistically significant differences. Conclusions: This study suggests fair agreement between the handheld and the conventional spirometer. Differences slightly exceeding limits for FEV 1 in 2 EO devices might be considered mostly irrelevant for clinical practice. However, the systematically lower FVC and FEV 1 observed with EO may be significant for epidemiological studies, thus justifying inspection before replacing devices...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the initial {{development of an}} artificial phonological loop (APL), a new technology to assist individuals with impairment of the working memory system. The phonological loop, along with the visuospatial sketchpad, {{is one of the}} two slave short-term memory subsystems that comprise working memory, a cognitive function closely associated with the control of attention. In the phonological loop, phonological (speech) information lasting for 1 – 2 second is maintained active by repetitive, subvocal (silent speech) rehearsal. Deficits in working memory, specifically in the phonological loop, occur in many disorders, including attention-deficit disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. In these disorders, it appears that the ability for phonological rehearsal is intact, but the regulation or triggering of the rehearsal process is inadequate, thus causing the contents of working memory to be lost. The purpose, then, of the APL is to facilitate the phonological loop by artificially extending the duration of phonological rehearsals. The APL mimics the natural phonological loop by providing audible vocal echoes {{to take the place of}} subvocal rehearsals. In this system, the user talks to him/herself in short (1 – 2 second) phrases; the device records these phrases, stores them in electronic memory, and then repeats— i. e., echoes—the phrases multiple times over an extended period. Two versions of this device have been developed: the Echo-APL and the Rearticulation-APL. In the Echo-APL, only echoing is involved. In the Rearticulation-APL, however, the user re-vocalizes (rearticulates) the phrase in response to an audible cue. The <b>device</b> <b>repeats</b> the cue until it detects (hears) the re-vocalization. Future research and development of the APL will require extensive testing and careful evaluation of possible echo-schedules: the predefined program controlling inter-echo time intervals and echo-amplitude (echo loudness). The APL essentially exteriorizes the silent phonological loop and makes it audible. It is a system that helps the user to “talk to him/herself” to keep ideas in mind...|$|R
6000|$|In {{comparison}} with this perversion of facts, the attempt of Pope {{to improve his}} letters, regarded as literary productions, would be of trifling moment, {{if it did not}} present another example of the audacious falsehoods he imposed upon the world. Speaking in the preface to the quarto of 1737 of the correspondence he reprinted from what he calls the surreptitious editions, he says [...] "for the chasms in it, we had not the means to supply them, the author having destroyed too many letters to preserve a series." [...] He intends us to infer that the selection was not his own, though the passage is virtually an admission that the collection of P. T. was the collection deposited with Lord Oxford, or there could not have been such an identity between them as that none of the gaps in the P. T. volume could be filled up from the bound book in the Oxford library. [...] "Nor," [...] he continues, [...] "would he go about to amend them, except by the omission of some passages improper, or at least impertinent to be divulged to the public, or of such entire letters as were either not his, or not approved of by him." [...] He would have us believe that they had been dragged before the world in their first crude state, without a single subsequent touch from his pen, though he had previously amended them with studious care--had culled the best passages, blended extracts from two or three letters into one, and constantly corrected composition which had been originally laboured. Some of his ambitious epistles, like his letter to Arbuthnot of July 26, 1734, were no doubt mere essays, which were only written when they were committed to the press. In the quarto of 1741, he <b>repeated</b> the <b>device</b> he had employed in the quarto of 1737. He pretended in both cases that the correspondence he printed himself had been printed by others without his knowledge, and in defiance of his wish. He next adopted and republished the letters he affected to repudiate, and having already revised them to the uttermost, asserted that he could not be induced to revise them at all. So completely had truth with him been swallowed up in vanity. [...] "Had he," [...] he tells us in the preface to the quarto of 1737, [...] "sat down with a design to draw his own picture, he could not have done it so truly, for whoever sits for it, whether to himself or another, will inevitably find his features more composed than his appear in these letters; but if an author's hand, like a painter's, be more distinguishable in a slight sketch than a finished picture, this very carelessness will make them the better known from such counterfeits as have been, and may be, imputed to him." [...] He did everything he professed to have left undone. The careless sketch was a studied portrait got up for exhibition, and the minutest details had been disposed with a view to flatter the likeness and increase the effect.|$|R
