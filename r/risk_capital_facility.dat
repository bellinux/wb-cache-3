40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis thesis {{sets out}} to {{evaluate}} whether innovative aid modalities have the ability provide more value for money than traditional aid modalities, and if so where? The {{aim of the research}} is to contribute to the literature on aid effectiveness and collective action which to date has largely ignored the emergence of innovative aid modalities. Making use of a case study evaluation the thesis demonstrates that innovative blending mechanisms have the ability to enhance the value for money of development assistance at various points, from initial mobilization to actual absorption. Here the thesis employed a reconstructed program theory to establish to what extent an innovative <b>Risk</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Facility</b> funded by the European Union in South Africa provided more value than traditional aid delivery modalities. This involved testing both the process of channelling aid, as well as the results achieved. Although not a panacea to all problems of traditional aid, the results indicate that innovative aid modalities have the ability to translate into higher equilibrium allocations for the donor in terms of aid delivery. Hence from a political economy point of view, the ability of innovative blending to demonstrate value for money may help overcome some of the collective action problems with the traditional aid architecture. This primarily concerned insights into the ability of this innovative aid modality to address issues surrounding institutional turf fights, vested interests, and legitimacy concerns of aid...|$|E

40|$|Purpose : The {{potential}} of diversified portfolio {{leads to the}} <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problem. There are many kinds of methods or rules to allocate <b>risk</b> <b>capital.</b>  However, they have flaws, such as non-continuity, unfairness. In {{order to get a}} better method, we propose a new risk measure to be the base of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation rule. Design/methodology/approach : We proposed two kinds of allocation methods: one is marginal risk contribution based on iso-entropic coherent risk measure(IE), the other one is to combine the minimal excess allocation(EBA) principle and IE into <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. The iso-entropic coherent risk measure has many advantages over others; it is continuous and more powerful in distinguishing risks, consistent with higher-order stochastic dominances than other risk measures. And EBA is consistent with the amount of risk, which means fairness for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. Findings : Through cases, simulations and empirical application, it shows that these two allocation rules satisfy some good properties, can be more efficient, more precise and fairer. And the EBA based on IE may be the better one. Research limitations/implications : However, there are some problems still open. One is how to treat the negative value of allocation. Second is that the consistence between the allocated <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> and the amount of the risk needs to be studied further. Originality/value: A good risk measure is very important for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation.

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> and of how tax and other costs of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> should be {{allocated}} in a financial firm. <b>Risk</b> <b>capital</b> is equity investment that backs obligations to creditors and other liability holders and maintains the firm’s credit quality.

40|$|A {{standard}} for industry-wide quality metrics, similar to safety metrics, for the <b>capital</b> <b>facilities</b> delivery industry is investigated and developed {{with the goal}} to motivate industry-wide adoption of this new quality metric program. A survey of the literature found key differences between <b>capital</b> <b>facilities</b> and other industries, mainly that other industries focus {{on the quality of}} the product while <b>capital</b> <b>facilities</b> focus on maintaining the cost and schedule of a project. Creating a framework that can be used across the industry can potentially lead to uniform improvement of quality for the entire industry. Quality is defined for the <b>capital</b> <b>facilities</b> delivery industry and a quality pyramid that categorizes both leading and lagging indicators and can be used across the project lifecycle is presented. Lagging indicators are developed as set of quality events that were used to create a quality metric. A group of subject matter experts (SME), from various sectors of the industry, were assembled to aid in the research effort and validate results. Pilot data was collected via SME companies to test hypotheses and to better understand the industries’ quality performance. Data is normalized and a quality performance rate (QPR) metric is developed. Statistical analysis of this pilot data shows differences amongst respondents.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problems. For <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problems, {{the aim is}} {{to allocate}} the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> of a firm to its divisions. <b>Risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation is of central importance in risk-based performance measurement. We consider a case in which the aggregate <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> is determined via a coherent risk measure. The academic literature advocates an allocation rule that, in game-theoretic terms, is equivalent to using the Aumann-Shapley value as solution concept. This value is however not well-defined in case a differentiability condition is not satisfied. As an alternative, we introduce an allocation rule inspired by the Shapley value in a fuzzy setting. We take a grid on a fuzzy participation set, define paths on this grid and construct an allocation rule based on a path. Then, we define a rule as the limit of the average over these allocations, when the grid size converges to zero. We introduce this rule for a broad class of coherent risk measures. We show that if the Aumann-Shapley value is well-defined, the allocation rule coincides with it. If the Aumann-Shapley value is not defined, which is due to non-differentiability problems, the allocation rule specifies an explicit allocation. It corresponds with the Mertens value, which is originally characterized in an axiomatic way (Mertens, 1988), whereas we provide an asymptotic argument. ...|$|R
