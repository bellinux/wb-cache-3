25|$|An amateur radio {{repeater}} is a specialty amateur radio station that extends {{the range of}} communications for other stations. A repeater uses a receiver tuned to one radio frequency and a transmitter tuned to another radio frequency. Other stations using a <b>repeater</b> <b>station</b> transmit on one frequency but listen for signals on the other frequency. If a <b>repeater</b> <b>station</b> is in a favorable location, such as on a tall tower, {{the top of a}} tall building, or on a mountaintop, stations that otherwise {{would not be able to}} communicate with each other can each use the repeater and establish two-way communications.|$|E
