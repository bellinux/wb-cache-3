50|$|The {{study of}} {{sedimentary}} provenance involves several geological disciplines, including mineralogy, geochemistry, geochronology, sedimentology, igneous and metamorphic petrology. The development of provenance methods are {{heavily dependent on}} the development of these mainstream geological disciplines. The earliest provenance studies were primarily based on paleocurrent analysis and petrographic analysis (composition and texture of sandstone and conglomerate). Since the 1970s, provenance studies shifted to interpret tectonic settings (i.e. magmatic arcs, collision orogens and continental blocks) using sandstone composition. Similarly, bulk <b>rock</b> <b>geochemistry</b> techniques are applied to interpret provenance linking geochemical signatures to source rocks and tectonic settings. Later, with the development of chemical and isotopic micro-analysis methods and geochronological techniques(e.g. ICP-MS, SHRIMP), provenance researches shifted to analyze single mineral grains. The following table has examples of where provenance study samples are collected.|$|E

However a comprehensive understanding of the source <b>rock</b> <b>geochemistry</b> is currently {{needed in order to}} identify key factors in resource shale hydrocarbon assessment and production forecasting. Previous works indicated that significant amount of methane is stored in kerogen in adsorbed state. Adsorption is controlled by surface area and surface properties of the kerogen nanopore walls.

The results show excess amount of methane due to nanopore confinement effect is found to be most pronounced under the subsurface conditions when the reservoir pore pressure is in the range of 1, 000 - 5, 000 psi. Among the investigated surface heterogeneities, nitrogen-doped graphene surfaces are the most influential on methane storage. Doping affects strongly the Langmuir parameters related to the adsorption capacity.

40|$|The Qinling orogenic belt {{in central}} China is the northernmost orogenic collage within the Tethyan domain, which records the {{evolution}} of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. A suite of volcano-sedimentary rocks containing rare fossils and several VHMS deposits is exposed along the North Qinling belt. These units are separated into the Caotangou, Xieyuguan and Erlangping groups from west to east. Systematic studies on the facies and geochemistry demonstrate that the Caotangou Group represents a bimodal volcanic sequence formed in a backarc setting with massive sulfide horizons closely associated with a siliciclastic-felsic volcanic sequence. SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb data from rhyolite and tuff of the Caotangou Group indicate that the volcanism took place between ca. 440 ¿ 406 Ma, which is similar to the dacite and andesitic basalt of the Xieyuguan Group.

Silicate <b>rock</b> <b>geochemistry</b> exhibits clear latitudinal trends that are mirrored by changes in bacterial community composition. α-proteobacteria, ε-proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes are most common on a silicate collected from Kilo Moana and their proportions decrease linearly on silicates collected further south.

Epidote and chlorite are dominant alteration minerals in both rocks. However, calcite is characteristically developed in the cataclastic part only. Decrease in oxygen isotope ratio and existence of epidote and chlorite, even in weakly deformed granodiorite, is evidence of water-rock interaction. The water/rock ratio is interpreted to be relatively small and fluid chemistry is buffered by host rock chemistry in the mylonite. The occurrence of calcite in brittle structures is explained by changes in water chemistry during shear zone evolution. CO 2 -rich fluid was probably introduced during cataclastic deformation and increased CO 2 concentration resulted in precipitation of calcite.|$|R

Although {{there is considerable}} debate on the definition of Group I kimberlite, there is agreement on certain characteristics. These include that Group I kimberlites are ultramafic rocks (MgO > 15 wt%), have near primitive mantle nickel (∼ 1400 ppm) and chromium (∼ 1600 ppm) contents, have close to bulk silicate earth radiogenic isotopic signatures, are volatile rich (predominantly CO 2) and have stable isotopic signatures typical of mantle sources. The debate, however, centers on petrogenetic models and parental magmatic compositions of Group I kimberlites. Petrogenetic models include both low degree (< 1 %) partial melting of metasomatized asthenospheric mantle (Dalton and Presnall, 1998 a; 1998 b; Becker and Le Roex, 2006) and, conversely, high degree partial melting (10 < 20 %) of metasomatized veined asthenospheric mantle (Mitchell, 1995, 2004). Inferred kimberlite parental magma compositions have been suggested to be low silica (< 5 wt%) and high CO 2 (< 44 wt%) melts, as suggested by high-pressure melt experiments conducted on synthetic carbonatized mantle (Dalton & Presnall, 1998 a, 1998 b), or much higher silica (< 30 wt%) and lower CO 2 (< 12 wt%) melts as suggested by geochemical analysis of aphanitic kimberlite (Price et al., 2000; Kopylova et al., 2007).

A clear correlation exists between whole rock chemistry, mantle source, and diamond grade of the three Group I kimberlites in the Foxtrot Kimberlite Field. Two phases, olivine and carbonate, dominant theserocks and thus control the kimberlites geochemistry. Electron microprobe analysis of over 800 olivines in the Foxtrot kimberlite indicate that it is predominantly xenocrystic (Mg# (Mg/(Mg+Fe)) of 91. 5), largely derived from harzburgite mantle, but the absence of harzburgitic orthopyroxene in the Foxtrot kimberlites suggests that it has been assimilated. Whole <b>rock</b> <b>geochemistry</b> (major and trace elements) of the Foxtrot hypabyssal kimberlite dykes indicate they have chemical characteristics similar to Group I kimberlite from the Slave Province.

This association is collectively described as the Median Tectonic Zone (MTZ) by Bradshaw (1993), and Kimbrough et al (1993). The rocks encompassed by the term Rotoroa Complex range from rare hornblendite through gabbro to diorite and quartz diorite, all typically rich in hornblende. The complex has been metamorphosed in part by the Early Cretaceous emplacement of the Separation Point Batholith, resulting in widespread felsic sheets and dikes of Separation Point Suite affinity being present throughout the Rotoroa Complex. Lamprophyre camptonite dikes of unknown age are also intruded throughout the complex, which has been subjected to brittle deformation due to movements on the Alpine Fault since Late Oligocene - Early Miocene times. The Rotoroa Complex is broadly metaluminous, calc-alkaline, medium to high K in nature, and has island-arc subduction-related geochemical characteristics. The geochemical variation reflects primary igneous fractionation processes. The Rotoroa Complex probably correlates with the Darran Complex of Fiordland, based on similarities in <b>rock</b> type, <b>geochemistry,</b> structural position and magnetic anomalies. The geochemical trends obtained from analyses of the Rotoroa Complex are sufficiently similar to those described in the Darran Complex to support this notion...|$|R
40|$|Supergene enriched, low-grade {{oxidized}} porphyry copper deposits are {{of great}} economic value. Oxidized porphyry sections are economic targets because even low-grade prospects {{have the potential}} to produce low-cost copper in an environmentally friendly fashion due to easy leachability and high recovery rates of the oxide mineralization. The MacArthur Mine, in the historic Yerington mining district of Nevada, is the focus of this study. The MacArthur is a tilted oxidized porphyry deposit, partially mined by open pit methods, hosted in the Jurassic Bear Quartz Monzonite of the Yerington batholith. The objective of the study is to define controls of copper oxide mineralization within the open-pit mine. The objective is investigated through a multi-data study including <b>rock</b> descriptions, <b>geochemistry,</b> spectral radiometry, and fracture density. Multivariate factor score analysis of geochemical data defined potassic and sodic-calcic alteration as well as multiple elements (Co, Ni, Zn, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, U) absorbed in the mineral neotocite (Mn, Cu, Fe) SiO 2 x H 2 O. Finally, high geochemical associations where found in two groups 1 - Cu, Fe, Co, Mo, Ni, U, and 2 - Al, K, Rb, Na, Mn. The high correlations found in the groups represent the hydrothermal event at the MacArthur. Chlorite and epidote identified in spectra using Spectral Analyst tool in ENVI ® demonstrate a propylitic alteration signature. Spectral Analysts identified several secondary iron and copper minerals produced in oxide zone geology. Fracture density studies defined 98. 3 % of all fractures in the MacArthur pit are associated with oxide zone produced copper and iron at a close to even distribution amongst fracture families. ...|$|R
