40|$|Calmodulin (CaM) mediates Ca-dependent {{regulation}} of numerous pathways in the heart, including CaM-dependent kinase (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN), yet the local Ca 2 + signals {{responsible for their}} selective activation are unclear. To assess when and where CaM, CaMKII, and CaN may be activated in the cardiac myocyte, we integrated new mechanistic computational models of CaM, CaMKII, and CaN with the Shannon-Bers model of excitation-contraction coupling in the rabbit ventricular myocyte. These models are validated with independent in vitro data. In the intact myocyte, model simulations predict that CaM is highly activated in the dyadic cleft during each beat, but not appreciably in the cytosol. CaMKII-δC was almost insensitive to cytosolic Ca due to relatively low CaM affinity. Dyadic cleft CaMKII exhibits dynamic frequency-dependent responses to Ca, yet autophosphorylates only when local phosphatases are suppressed. In contrast, dyadic cleft CaN in beating myocytes is predicted to be constitutively active, whereas the extremely high affinity of CaN for CaM allows gradual integration of small cytosolic CaM signals. <b>Reversing</b> <b>CaM</b> affinities for CaMKII and CaN also reverses their characteristic local responses. Deactivation of both CaMKII and CaN seems dominated by Ca dissociation from the complex (versus Ca-CaM dissociation from the target). In summary, the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII and CaN determine their sensitivity to local Ca signals in cardiac myocytes...|$|E
50|$|All engines were {{equipped}} {{to be run}} in either direction, as is not uncommon with marine engines; there was no reverse gear. To run in reverse, the engine had to be stopped, the camshaft shifted by the motorman to the <b>reverse</b> <b>cam</b> set, and the engine restarted in reverse.|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{a reverse}} gear also caused problems. The engine had to be stopped, the {{camshaft}} shifted {{to a set of}} <b>reverse</b> <b>cams,</b> and then started in the opposite direction. This was acceptable shipboard, perhaps, but deeply disliked by railroad operators. Accounts exist of engineers' elaborate schemes for avoiding the necessity to reverse.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the free}} running that was {{achieved}} with the Classes 15E, 16E and 19C which all entered service in 1935 and were all equipped with rotary cam poppet valve gear, Watson decided to adopt this type of valve gear for all his future designs. Most valve gear components of the Class 15E were interchangeable with similar parts of the Class 16E. Like the other classes with poppet valve gear, the Class 15E was fast, but some trouble was initially experienced with the valve gear in the reverse position. This was corrected by modifying the <b>reversing</b> <b>cams</b> and these, {{as well as new}} forward cams, were manufactured at the Salt River shops in Cape Town.|$|R

The only difference between the engines from the two manufacturers was the location of the feed pump. On the Kessler variant this was on the outside and driven by crank pins; on the Maffei version they were suspended from the <b>reverse</b> eccentric <b>cam</b> (Rückwärtsexzenter).|$|R

50|$|Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) {{struggle}} {{to deal with}} their <b>reversed</b> roles as <b>Cam</b> takes on his new job as a music teacher. Now that Cam is teaching again, Mitch has to do everything at the house, including taking care of Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons). But he is not very successful, so he calls Claire to help him out. Meanwhile, the kids at school does not seem as excited as Cam is with teaching. Both Mitch and Cam seem to have a horrible day and they both agree that they just need time to adjust to the new reality.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{gasoline}} two-stroke engines {{will run}} backwards {{for short periods}} and under light load with little problem, {{and this has been}} used to provide a reversing facility in microcars, such as the Messerschmitt KR200, that lacked reverse gearing. Where the vehicle has electric starting, the motor will be turned off and restarted backwards by turning the key in the opposite direction. Two-stroke golf carts have used a similar kind of system. Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no external coil) worked equally well in <b>reverse</b> because the <b>cam</b> controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact before top dead center (TDC) equally well whether running forwards or backwards. Reed-valve engines will run backwards just as well as piston-controlled porting, though rotary valve engines have asymmetrical inlet timing and will not run very well.|$|R
50|$|In service, {{some trouble}} was {{experienced}} with transmission shaft joints and with worn cams and rollers. If the valves were set {{with the engine}} cold, {{there appeared to be}} some distortion under working conditions due to the high temperature of superheated steam which caused deterioration of the valve events. Drivers also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to <b>reverse</b> since the <b>cam</b> rollers were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the cam boxes where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the cam boxes. This was overcome by serrating the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the cam boxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{developments}} of maritime sector in Indonesia shows increasing demand for ships. Especially ships with size of 30 GT has problem with low {{availability of the}} ship engine, {{which most of the}} ships still use non marine diesel engine as its main propulsion. The problem gives interest to make a step to improve by design marine diesel engine using <b>reverse</b> engineering method. <b>Cam</b> system of marine diesel engine design was needed to be calculate to select the material and the motion. The design of cam system needs study about the stress analysis in cam system to make sure the distribution of force and moment. The result of stress analysis was used to select material of components in cam system. The motion analysis result was used to be input data of stress analysis. The condition to obtain the stress of components was on maximum condition, its contain pressure, torque, rotation, and force. All component that calculated are camshaft, lifter (flat-tappet), push rod, rocker arm, spring, and valve. Each component was given two different materials and material selection was based on safety factor of each component. Material for camshaft and lifter were malleable cast iron, for push rod and rocker arm were mild steel, for spring was ASTM A 231, for intake valve was steel JIS SUH 3, and for exhaust valve was steel JIS SUH 35. The result of motion analysis were angular velocity of camshaft with value was 2400 deg/sec, friction force between camshaft and lifter with maximum value was 125. 393 N, and contact force between camshaft and lifter with maximum value was 845. 307 N, and linear velocity of intake valve with maximum value was 696. 573 mm/s, and linear velocity of exhaust valve was 463. 734 mm/s. </p...|$|R
