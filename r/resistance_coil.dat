50|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} in London {{at the house of}} William Crookes in February 1875, Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Crookes had Fay hold two electrodes in an electrical circuit connected with a galvanometer in an adjoining room. Movement of objects occurred in the room and a music instrument was played. Crookes was convinced that the electrical control had not been broken. Psychical researchers pointed out that Fay could have used other parts of her body or a <b>resistance</b> <b>coil</b> to maintain the electric current intact whilst her hands could be free to produce the phenomena during the experiment. Frank Podmore described the experiment in detail.|$|E
40|$|Large {{accelerator}} main magnet system {{consists of}} hundreds, even thousands, of dipole magnets. They are linked together under selected configurations to provide highly uniform dipole fields when powered. Distributed capacitance, insulation <b>resistance,</b> <b>coil</b> resistance, magnet inductance, and coupling inductance of {{upper and lower}} pancakes make each magnet a complex network. When all dipole magnets are chained together in a circle, they become a coupled pair of very high order complex ladder networks. In this study, a network of more than thousand inductive, capacitive or resistive elements are used to model an actual system. The circuit is a large-scale network. Its equivalent polynomial form has several hundred degrees. Analysis of this high order circuit and simulation of the response of any or all components is often computationally infeasible. We present methods to use frequency decomposition approach to effectively simulate and analyze magnet configuration and power supply topologies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new design of an electromagnetic microgenerator. The desgin {{aspects of the}} microgenerator comprises spring, coil and rear earth magnet have been addressed. The theoretical analyses of the electromagnetic microgenerator are established. Firstly, steady state analysis has been undertaken to determine the practical performance of the device. It is found that the generator will produce more power in applications with high frequency of vibration. Secondly, electromagnetic analysis is established to calculate the generated power on the load. It is found that the output power can be maximized when the impedance of the coil {{is less than the}} load impedance and when using a magnet with high magnetic field. Mechanical parameters like (damping factor, resonant frequency, proof mass and maximum displacement) and magnetic parameters like (load <b>resistance,</b> <b>coil</b> resistance, and the magnetic field) have been adjusted to optimize the output power through a comprehensive theoretical study. A range of microgenerator output power values are obtained in accordance with the consideration of the design parameters...|$|E

Various <b>resistance</b> <b>coils</b> were constructed by the British Association and others, to serve as physical artifact standards for the unit of resistance. The long-term stability and reproducibility of these artifacts was an ongoing field of research, as the effects of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and time on the standards were detected and analyzed.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{batteries}} {{are limited by}} low gravimetric &amp; volumetric energy density (ED) and not suitable for scaling. Studies of MEMS micro-engine coupled generator power supplies for portable applications are undertaken by many research institutes to develop an alternative to electrochemical batteries. Micro systems that {{have been reported in}} the current literature produce output power in the range of 100 µW to 1 mW at rotor speeds of 30, 000 to 100, 000 rpm, but challenges and issues still remain in the area of engine and generator development to overcome low system efficiency and low energy density. The main contributions of the thesis are in the areas of thin micro generator development suitable for planar MEMS technologies which can be integrated with micro combustion engines. The development of a thin MEMS axial generator topology to achieve high power density is presented in the thesis. A customized lumped parameter analysis methodology using parametric equations is developed to select suitable parameters for the MEMS Micro generator. The methodology takes inputs from magnetic circuit and planar coil analysis used in the thesis. The magnetic circuit analysis is done using a Permeance coefficient method to determine air gap flux density (Bg), force and torque. The planar coil analysis is performed using an original analytical method to determine winding parameters like <b>resistance,</b> <b>coil</b> length, and no of coils to operate the system within practical current density and current loading level. ANSYS FEA analysis is used to validate the theoretical method prediction of air gap flux density for the 5 mm rotor radius micro generator model which showed accuracies of 93 % to FEA prediction. Equivalent circuit model of the micro generator with the selected parameters is developed for characterisation. The equivalent resistance and reactance of the equivalent circuit model is found to be 573 KΩ and 489 Ω respectively. Characterisation for no load, full load and variable load is performed and an estimated useful power output of 1. 6 mW is achievable at 15000 rpm. The micro generator when operated at an increasing temperature of 100 oC would see reduction in O/P power from 1. 6. mW to 1. 3 mW due to temperature effect on both flux density at air gap and winding resistance. Generalised equations for the engine are derived and linked to the micro generator lumped parameter equations to form the analysis model for integrated engine-generator system. The model was analysed for attainable energy density for a system volume of 40 e- 3 * 70 e- 3 * 5 e- 3 mm. The estimated energy density from the analysis was 42. 3 WH/Kg. This estimated energy density is three times the energy density that could be achievable from existing micro generators for the same volume. A small improvement in engine efficiency of 3 - 5 % is believed to increase the energy density of the module closer or higher than existing batteries. The capacity of the micro engine –generator system to be able to operate for 3. 9 hours at 1. 6 mW output power would still make this system a significant alternative source of power for portable applications with a huge scope for further improvemen...|$|E

50|$|Electric heaters {{are usually}} {{part of a}} fan oil {{which is part of}} a central air conditioner.

Blowers in electric furnaces move air over one to five <b>resistance</b> <b>coils</b> or elements which are usually rated at five kilowatts. The heating elements activate one at a time to avoid overloading the electrical system. Overheating is prevented by a safety switch called a limit controller or limit switch.

The microfabrication technology developed for these probes {{consists of three}} electroplated copper levels for low <b>resistance</b> <b>coils</b> and three SU- 8 layers for the integration of microchannels. This technology allows fabricating solenoids, Helmholtz and planar coils on the same wafer. The coils have inner diameters {{in the range of}} 160 to 400 microm and detection volumes of 5 to 22 nL. The solenoid and Helmholtz coils show improved RF-field characteristics compared to a planar coil fabricated with the same process. The fabricated solenoid has a particularly low resistance of only 0. 46 Omega at 300 MHz. Moreover, it is very sensitive and has a very uniform RF-field, but shows large line width. The Helmholtz coils are slightly less sensitive, but display a far narrower line width, and are therefore a good compromise. With a Helmholtz coil, a SNR of 620 has been measured after one scan on 9 nL pure water.
