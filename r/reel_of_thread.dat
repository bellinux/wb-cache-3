60|$|The ottoman whence, as Gavinia said, Miss Ailie {{produced}} the presents she gave to Mr. McLean, {{stood near the}} door of the blue-and-white room, with a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> between, to keep them apart forever. Except on washing days it was of a genteel appearance, for though but a wooden kist, it had a gay outer garment with frills, which Gavinia starched, and beneath this was apparel of a private character that tied with tapes. When Miss Ailie, pins in her mouth, was on her knees arraying the ottoman, it might almost have been mistaken for a female child.|$|E

6000|$|Perhaps a {{human voice}} frightened the little house, {{or maybe it}} now knew that its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking, yet she soon knew {{that it could not}} contain her now. It always {{remained}} as complete as ever, but it became smaller and smaller, and the garden dwindled at the same time, and the snow crept closer, lapping house and garden up. Now the house {{was the size of a}} little dog's kennel, and now of a Noah's Ark, but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall, every one complete. The glow-worm fight was waning too, but it was still there. [...] "Darling, loveliest, don't go!" [...] Maimie cried, falling on her knees, for the little house was now the size of a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> but still quite complete. But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself, and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow.|$|E
60|$|From the {{beginning}} I noticed that Lady Georgina went peering about {{all over the}} place, {{as if she were}} hunting for something she had lost, with her long-handled tortoise-shell glasses perpetually in evidence--the 'aristocratic outrage' I called them--and that she eyed all the men with peculiar attention. But I took no open notice of her little weakness. On our second day at the Spa, I was sauntering with her down the chief street--'a beastly little hole, my dear; not a decent shop where one can buy a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> or a yard of tape in the place!'--when I observed a tall and handsome young man {{on the opposite side of}} the road cast a hasty glance at us, and then sneak round the corner hurriedly. He was a loose-limbed, languid-looking young man, with large, dreamy eyes, and a peculiarly beautiful and gentle expression; but what I noted about him most was an odd superficial air of superciliousness. He seemed always to be looking down with scorn on that foolish jumble, the universe. He darted away so rapidly, however, that I hardly discovered all this just then. I piece it out from subsequent observations.|$|E
60|$|The King {{had already}} been married once, and had by his first wife seven children, six boys and one girl, whom he loved more than {{anything}} in the world. And now, because he was afraid that their stepmother might not treat them well and might do them harm, he put them in a lonely castle that stood in the middle of a wood. It lay so hidden, and the way to it was so hard to find, that he himself could not have found it out had not a wise-woman given him a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> which possessed a marvellous property: when he threw it before him it unwound itself and showed him the way. But the King went so often to his dear children that the Queen was offended at his absence. She grew curious, and wanted to know what he had to do quite alone in the wood. She gave his servants a great deal of money, and they betrayed the secret to her, and also told her of the reel which alone could point out the way. She had no rest now till she had found out where the King guarded the reel, and then she made some little white shirts, and, as she had learnt from her witch-mother, sewed an enchantment in each of them.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Amelius proceeded, [...] "now let us get on. Suppose we take {{a glance}} (we {{have no time to}} do more) at the present state of our {{religious}} system, first. What is the public aspect of the thing called Christianity, in the England of our day? A hundred different sects all at variance with each other. An established church, rent in every direction by incessant wrangling--disputes about black gowns or white; about having candlesticks on tables, or off tables; about bowing to the east or bowing to the west; about which doctrine collects the most respectable support and possesses the largest sum of money, the doctrine in my church, or the doctrine in your church, or the doctrine in the church over the way. Look up, if you like, from this multitudinous and incessant squabbling among the rank and file, to the high regions in which the right reverend representatives of state religion sit apart. Are they Christians? If they are, show me the Bishop who dare assert his Christianity in the House of Lords, when the ministry of the day happens to see its advantage in engaging in a war! Where is that Bishop, and how many supporters does he count among his own order? Do you blame me for using intemperate language--language which I cannot justify? Take a fair test, and try me by that. The result of the Christianity of the New Testament is to make men true, humane, gentle, modest, strictly scrupulous and strictly considerate in their dealings with their neighbours. Does the Christianity of the churches and the sects produce these results among us? Look at the staple of the country, at the occupation which employs the largest number of Englishmen of all degrees--Look at our Commerce. What is its social aspect, judged by the morality which is in this book in my hand? Let those organised systems of imposture, masquerading under the disguise of banks and companies, answer the question--there is no need for me to answer it. You know what respectable names are associated, year after year, with the shameless falsification of accounts, and the merciless ruin of thousands on thousands of victims. You know how our poor Indian customer finds his cotton-print dress a sham that falls to pieces; how the savage who deals honestly with us for his weapon finds his gun a delusion that bursts; how the half-starved needlewoman who buys her <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> finds printed on the label a false statement of the number of yards that she buys; you know that, in the markets of Europe, foreign goods are fast taking the place of English goods, because the foreigner is the most honest manufacturer of the two--and, lastly, you know, what is worse than all, that these cruel and wicked deceptions, and many more like them, are regarded, on the highest commercial authority, as 'forms of competition' and justifiable proceedings in trade. Do you believe in the honourable accumulation of wealth by men who hold such opinions and perpetrate such impostures as these? I don't! Do you find any brighter and purer prospect when you look down from the man who deceives you and me on the great scale, to the man who deceives us on the small? I don't! Everything we eat, drink, and wear is a more or less adulterated commodity; and that very adulteration is sold to us by the tradesmen at such outrageous prices, that we are obliged to protect ourselves on the Socialist principle, by setting up cooperative shops of our own. Wait! and hear me out, before you applaud. Don't mistake the plain purpose of what I am saying to you; and don't suppose that I am blind to the brighter side of the dark picture that I have drawn. Look within the limits of private life, and you will find true Christians, thank God, among clergymen and laymen alike; you will find men and women who deserve to be called, in the highest sense of the word, disciples of Christ. But my business is not with private life--my business is with the present public aspect of the religion, morals, and politics of this country; and again I say it, that aspect presents one wide field of corruption and abuse, and reveals a callous and shocking insensibility {{on the part of the}} nation at large to the spectacle of its own demoralisation and disgrace." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{said that}} Daida's mother was visited each night by her lover. One night, she pinned a needle {{attached}} to a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> on his kimono. The next day, she followed the thread to a cave. She heard mighty roars from within and called out to her lover, but he replied that his appearance was too frightening for her to behold. She remained persistent. Then, a great snake appeared with the needle attached to its throat. As soon as she laid {{her eyes on the}} snake, she and her companions scattered in terror. The following night, she gave birth to a son, Daida, who was raised by her grandfather in Bungo province (now Oita prefecture).|$|E
5000|$|Tilbrook {{was able}} to adapt well to {{situations}} requiring innovative ideas to create his photographs. Not only was he an early adaptor of artificial lighting, {{but he also had}} a clever approach to including himself in his photos. Using a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> he attached one end to the shutter and ran the other end through a series of metal pegs to wherever he was standing in the photograph. Once tightened, the thread would activate the shutter mechanism. To avoid camera shake, he used a bullet shell which would fall to the ground after setting off the shutter. [...] It is by using this method, Tilbrook {{was able to}} be in most of his well-known photographs, as well as including himself in many group photos from his trips. It is something he was to be known for after his self-portrait works began to be used on passenger trains around Adelaide. In his diary he recalls hearing a story of a lady who, after travelling on the train, remarked [...] "I came up in a carriage with Mr Henry Tilbrook.". When asked where he was going, the lady replied that she did not know, and that she [...] "left him in the train. He was sitting on a rock - in a picture" ...|$|E
