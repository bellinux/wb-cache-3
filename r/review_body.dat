5|$|Clark was {{appointed}} {{chief executive officer}} of the Hill Samuel holding group in 1976 and was chairman from 1980 to 1988. Clark refused a takeover by Merrill Lynch, but after deregulation in 1986 he was convinced that Hill Samuel was not large enough to compete and, facing hostile takeovers from Kerry Packer and FAI Insurances, arranged takeover talks first with UBS and then with TSB. TSB acquired Hill Samuel in 1988, and Clark became a director in 1987 and then deputy chairman in 1989 for two years. He was on the boards of many other companies, holding directorships at Eagle Star (1976 to 1987) Royal Dutch Shell (1982 to 1994), Vodafone (1988 to 1998), IMI (1981 to 1989) and Marley (1985 to 1989) – he later became the first non-family chairman of the latter. He served on the <b>Review</b> <b>Body</b> on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration from 1979 to 1986 and was a trustee of the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School from 1981 to 1995. In 1982 he received an honorary Doctorate of Science from the Cranfield Institute of Technology. Clark {{was appointed}} vice-chairman of pharmaceutical firm SmithKline Beecham in 1987, a post he held for eight years.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the opportunities and challenges of a curricular review process in an entry-level doctor of physical therapy geriatric curriculum. The curricular review process utilized an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body,</b> in conjunction with an established internal curricular <b>reviewing</b> <b>body,</b> to determine inclusion of Essential Competencies in order to prepare students for best clinical practice in the care of the older adult. Method: The methodology of our curricular review process included both internal and external <b>reviewing</b> <b>bodies</b> but the intent of this article is to highlight how the review process was implemented including an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body.</b> The internal <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> involved two faculty members with expertise in geriatrics, the Program Curriculum Committee members, and the faculty members within the entry-level doctor of physical therapy program. The external <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> was comprised of the 2012 - 2014 members of the Faculty Development Collaborative Program in Geriatrics (FDCPG), a national interprofessional learning community representing multiple disciplines involved in the care of older adults. Results: The outcomes of including an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> in the geriatric curricular review process were: the FDCPG justified the need for the review of the Essential Competencies, deemed their role as important in healthcare education, and reported a greater understanding of the role of physical therapists as part of an interprofessional healthcare team. The Program Curriculum Committee created a policy for consideration of other published competencies, including a recommendation for “other necessary consultation” based on our use of an external <b>reviewing</b> <b>body,</b> noting its value. The outcomes of the overall curricular review process included: 53 / 61 Essential Competencies were identified as already in the curriculum and the remaining 8 / 61 Essential Competencies were added. Conclusions and Recommendations: The addition of an external interprofessional <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> to an already established internal <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> within the geriatric curricular review process in an entry-level doctor of physical therapy program produced a curriculum that will hopefully prepare students for best clinical practice in the care of the older adult. This comprehensive curricular review process involved opportunities and challenges yet still can be used across multiple disciplines, across multiple curricular structures, and is in line with the current state of healthcare practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Pay <b>Review</b> <b>Bodies</b> (PRBs) on the public sector pay of their remit groups. We compare the real weekly earnings of groups of workers in occupations covered by PRBs, in the remainder of the public sector and in the private sector using LFS data from 1993 to 2006 for 10 occupational sub-groups. We describe how the pattern of relative occupational pay varies over time and by gender and can be interpreted as compensating pay differentials. In several public sector occupations, men incur a much larger earnings penalty than women. Our difference- in-difference impact estimation method relies on comparison of the difference between any specific PRB group and other (non-PRB) public sector workers over time. For the most part we find that the PRBs have had little or no practical impact on earnings over and above that of comparable public sector workers not covered by the PRBs.
