25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical <b>refractivity.</b> Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E
500|$|Diamonds can be {{identified}} by their high thermal conductivity. Their high refractive index is also indicative, but other materials have similar <b>refractivity.</b> Diamonds cut glass, {{but this does not}} positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the Mohs scale and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature. The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly, using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones; these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion. Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a loupe (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds [...] "by eye".|$|E

A two-wavelength interferometric technique has been developed to discriminate the electron from the ion and neutral densities as the <b>refractivities</b> of the latters are almost independent of, but that of the former strongly dependent on, the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave. This system allows the measurement of the densities in the arc channel and the shock front regions by a single shot.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the development of two new tropospheric mapping functions for GNSS data processing, based on a high resolution mesoscale numerical weather model (NWM). NWMs have proven to be beneficiary in the processing of GNSS and VLBI data, both for deriving mapping functions and for providing a priori information such as zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD). The mapping functions derived here make a greater use of the NWM information than the mapping functions currently recommended by the International GNSS Service. In addition to using a single vertical pro¯le at the site in order to derive mapping functions under the assumption of an azimuthally symmetric atmosphere, the NWM was also ray traced every thirty degrees in azimuth. This way, a complete volume of the atmosphere is sensed, and better modelling is expected if the NWM does indeed provide an accurate representation of the atmosphere, by accounting for azimuthal variations. An emphasis was put in this thesis on assessing the mathematical models used to vertically interpolate meteorological information, as they {{play a key role in}} computing the <b>refractivities</b> in the ray tracing algorithm. Error sources were identified and quantified. As expected, water vapour is the major source of error. However, the results showed that the model used for the total pressure induced a systematic bias. To derive an azimuth dependent mapping function, the Marini model traditionally used had to be left in favor of a cubic spline interpolation (CSI). This new approach was validated by comparing the performance of the new azimuthally symmetric mapping functions against the updated Vienna mapping functions (VMF 1), the best mapping functions currently available. Similar positioning performances were obtained, therefore validating the CSI based approach. The performance of new azimuth dependent mapping functions (AMF) in handling the troposphere asymmetry were compared to those obtained when estimating horizontal tropospheric gradients with an azimuthally symmetric mapping function. Results show a good agreement in the modelling of the asymmetry, and that estimating gradients is justified. The gradient solution performed better overall, although it failed for some sites, and better inter-station consistency was obtained with the AMF. This thesis also investigated the role of the tropospheric modelling in the retrieval of the atmospheric pressure loading (APL) in GNSS data processing, which is now part of the IGS 2008 recommendations. The results show that differential height time series obtained with different tropospheric modelling can correlate with the APL signal to a level up to 0. 7. In other words, the choice of tropospheric modelling strategy does greatly influence the retrieval of the APL. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
