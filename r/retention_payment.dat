5000|$|In November 2005, the Times Educational Supplement {{reported}} that lecturers who rebelled, [...] "against new contracts, were defeated after they faced losing their jobs." [...] Following cuts {{by the coalition}} government, the college reorganised its curriculum structure leading to 200-equivalent full-time job losses, with 188 new jobs created in 2011. The restructure lead to the grade, and therefore salary, reduction of many teaching staff. Shortly after redundancies were announced, The Guardian {{reported that}} NCG's chief executive, Dame Jackie Fisher, [...] "enjoyed a pay rise, including bonus and <b>retention</b> <b>payment,</b> of almost £73,000." [...] However, the report mentions a spokeswoman's defence of the pay rise, pointing out [...] "that Fisher is responsible for three divisions with an annual turnover of £152m in 2009-10." [...] Also in 2011, allegations of workplace bullying were publicly made against college management and reported on the BBC's regional Inside Out programme in January 2012. NCG vehemently refuted these allegations stating that “it takes any allegation of bullying extremely seriously and has a clear and transparent process for dealing with staff concerns. All reported allegations are always thoroughly investigated and dealt with appropriately.|$|E

40|$|Many {{governments have}} {{implemented}} incentive programs {{to improve the}} retention of doctors in rural areas {{despite a lack of}} evidence of their effectiveness. This study examines rural general practitioners' (GPs') preferences for different types of retention incentive policies using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). In 2009, the DCE was administered to a group of 1720 rural GPs as part of the "Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) " study. We estimate both a mixed logit model and a generalized multinomial logit model to account for different types of unobserved differences in GPs' preferences. Our results indicate that increased level of locum relief incentive, <b>retention</b> <b>payments</b> and rural skills loading leads to an increase in the probability of attracting GPs to stay in rural practice. The locum relief incentive is ranked as the most effective, followed by the <b>retention</b> <b>payments</b> and rural skills loading payments. These findings are important in helping to tailor retention policies to those that are most effective. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

50|$|Amid the restructuring, Sears Canada {{was criticized}} for its {{treatment}} of the laid off employees, including that the company planned to issue a total of $7.6 million in retention bonuses to 43 executives and senior managers, and $1.6 million to senior employees at stores that are closing, but did not plan to offer severance pay to the laid off employees. These concerns resulted in calls over social media to boycott the company. Sears Canada defended the decisions, stating that the <b>retention</b> <b>payments</b> were {{necessary in order to}} maintain its senior staff going forward.|$|R

5000|$|In November 2009 MEMC {{acquired}} the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider. Founded by Jigar Shah, SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003. The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar {{power purchase agreement}} (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing. With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider. CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that [...] "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."

5000|$|Compensation and rewards- Pay {{levels and}} {{satisfaction}} are only modest predictors of an employee’s {{decision to leave}} the organization; however organizations can lead the market with a strong compensation and reward package as 53% of employees often look elsewhere because of poor compensation and benefits. Organizations can explicitly link rewards to retention (i.e. vacation hours to seniority, offer <b>retention</b> Bonus <b>payments</b> or Employee stock options, or define benefit plan payouts to years of services) [...] Research has shown that defined compensation and rewards as associated with longer tenure. Additionally, organizations can also look to intrinsic rewards such as increased decision-making autonomy.|$|R
40|$|The Alliance welcomed {{confirmation}} in the Federal Budget (13 May) of more undergraduate medical {{places and}} GP Registrar positions for rural areas, but reiterated {{its opposition to}} the Government’s proposed changes to Medicare and bulk-billing. The changes currently proposed will not fix the immediate indemnity or morale problems, and will not help directly to build the combined rural health workforce team. The universality of Medicare should be retained and the scheme boosted to provide direct support to people in more remote areas and to the rural health workforce overall. There should be further discussion of a meaningful increase in the Medicare rebate {{and the possibility of}} differential rural rebates. In the longer term the scheme could be made more cost-effective overall by covering such things as the work of psychiatric nurses for mental illness and physiotherapists for musculoskeletal illness. The Alliance supported the Federal Budget’s renewed focus on prevention in the health system. Prevention of illness and early intervention in its management are most effective and cost-effective actions for good health. The Alliance will follow the Federal Government’s lead on prevention and encourage it to build on its rural initiatives for nursing, pharmacy, and allied health – and to work with the States on oral health. These would be valuable for health promotion. The Alliance will keep pressing the role of the inter-disciplinary team in primary care and illness prevention. The Budget delivered ongoing funds for some of the four-year programs initially announced in 1999, such as <b>retention</b> <b>payments</b> for rural GPs, the Rural Women’s GP Service, and RAMUS. Medical indemnity support for rural obstetricians is also very welcome. The Budget also confirmed another $ 200 million for the Regional Health Strateg...|$|R
30|$|The TJRD {{transitional}} jobs {{programs in}} the four Midwestern sites were all structured somewhat differently, {{but there were some}} basic elements that all programs adopted. All provided participants with temporary, minimum wage jobs that offered 30 to 40 hours of paid work each week. As in the CEO study, the transitional jobs provided to participants were not focused on building skills in any particular occupation, but all aimed to identify and address behavior or performance issues that emerged at the work sites. All provided a range of ancillary services and supports to participants, and all helped participants look for non-program jobs to follow the transitional jobs, often with the help of job developers who approached employers to identify job openings for participants. The Milwaukee program and, during part of the study period, the Minneapolis-St. Paul program also offered participants <b>retention</b> bonus <b>payments</b> for getting and holding non-program jobs. The payments could total up to $ 1500 or so over six to nine months.|$|R

40|$|Factors that {{influence}} contractors „cash flow are {{the frequency of}} payment, delay, profit margin, <b>retention</b> fund, <b>payment</b> term to the supplier and subcontractor, advanced payment and others. L ate payment from the client has become a habit {{in the construction industry}} and this practice had cause d many implications such as bankruptcy, the higher contract sum due to higher risk, uncomfortable relationship between the payer and payee, disturbance of supply chain and others. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the late payment practices in the Malaysi an construction industry. Thirty seven (37) sets of questionnaire had been collected among the Grade G 7 contractors and subcontractors in the state of Selangor based on convenience sampling. The collected data were analysed by using frequency distribution and relative important index (RII). The Data then was tabulated and illustrated in the form of charts. The results of the study show that the late payment is one of the most critical proble ms in the Malaysian construction industry. The majority of the contractor experienced late payment quite frequently and even beyon d the stipulated contract term. The top three impacts of the late payment problems are the negative chain effe ct on other part ies, delay in project completion and lead to bankruptcy or liquidation...|$|R
