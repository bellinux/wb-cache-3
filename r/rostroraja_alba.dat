50|$|The {{bottlenose}} skate, spearnose skate, {{or white}} skate, <b>Rostroraja</b> <b>alba,</b> is {{a species of}} skate in the family Rajidae, and the sole member of its genus. It is a benthic fish native to the coastal eastern Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the length distribution, sex ratio, length-weight relationship, age {{and growth of}} <b>Rostroraja</b> <b>alba</b> in the Gulf of Gabes. Methods: This study estimated age and growth of the white skate, <b>Rostroraja</b> <b>alba</b> by counting vertebral band pairs from 112 specimens taken by commercial fisheries during 2006 - 2009 from the Gulf of Gabes (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea). Results: This is {{the first and only}} known information in regards to the age and growth of this species in Tunisia. Vertebra diameter was strongly correlated with total length and age, which were expressed by linear or cubic regression equations. The oldest female in this study was 35 years and 160 cm, whereas the oldest male was 32 years and 150 cm. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were TL∞=(202. 26 ± 3. 40) cm, K=(0. 040 ± 0. 038) /year and t 0 =(1. 84 ± 0. 01) 10 - 1 /year for females and TL∞=(198. 60 ± 3. 61) cm, K=(0. 060 ± 0. 076) /year and t 0 =(1. 28 ± 0. 04) /year for males. Conclusions: This study would be an effective tool for fishery biologists, managers and conservationists to initiate management strategies and regulations for the sustainable conservation of the remaining stocks of this species in the Gulf of Gabes (Southern Tunisia) ecosyste...|$|E

40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species. Using DNA barcode 15 species of sharks (Alopias vulpinus, Centrophorus granulosus, Cetorhinus maximus, Dalatias licha, Etmopterus spinax, Galeorhinus galeus, Galeus melastomus, Heptranchias perlo, Hexanchus griseus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus, Oxynotus centrina, Scyliorhinus canicula Squalus acanthias, Squalus blainville), 1 species of chimaera (Chimaera monstrosa) and 21 species of rays/skayes (Dasyatis centroura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis sp., Dipturus nidarosiensis, Dipturus oxyrinchus, Leucoraja circularis, Leucoraja melitensis, Myliobatis aquila, Pteromylaeus bovinus, Pteroplatytrygon violacea, Raja asterias, Raja brachyura, Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, Raja montagui, Raja radula, Raja polystigma, Raja undulata, <b>Rostroraja</b> <b>alba,</b> Torpedo marmorata, Torpedo nobiliana, Torpedo torpedo) was identified...|$|E
40|$|The Age, growth, mortality, {{longevity}} and reproductive parameters were studied for <b>Rostroraja</b> <b>alba</b> from the Gulf of Gabes (Southern Tunisia, central Mediterranean Sea), collected monthly during 2007 from commercial fisheries. 43. 75 % {{of the composition}} was females and 56. 25 % males. A total of 140 females (44. 5 - 160 cm TL) and 180 males (39. 5 - 150 cm TL) were examined to study the reproductive cycle. A subsample of 115 specimens (65 females and 50 males, ranging from 39. 5 to 160 cm TL) was used for age and growth estimation derived from vertebral centra. The oldest female was 35 years and 160 cm TL, whereas the oldest male was 32 years and 150 cm TL. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L infinity= 177. 6 +/- 3. 61 cm, k= 0. 06 +/- 3. 08 year(- 1) and t(0) = - 1. 28 +/- 1. 97 10 (- 1) year for females and L infinity= 199. 6 +/- 3. 66 cm, k= 0. 04 +/- 1. 9610 (- 3) year(- 1) and t(0) = - 1. 47 +/- 0. 35 10 (- 1) year for males. Growth was not significantly different between sexes. The maturity size (TL 50 %) was 119. 3 cm (94. 20 cm DW) for males and 129. 4 cm (95. 77 cm DW) for females. The maturity age (A 50 %) was estimated to 19. 69 and 23. 47 years respectively for males and females. Size and age maturity {{were not significantly different}} between sexes...|$|E
