40|$|AbstractSafety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> {{tubes are}} {{important}} components of fast reactor cores for ensuring safe reactor operation. Their failure or considerable changes of their size {{may lead to}} safety rod wedging that is unacceptable. Two guide tubes, one each from BN- 350 and BOR- 60, were examined post-irradiation to determine {{the reasons for their}} deformation and loss of functionality. These tubes were constructed from high-nickel alloy EP- 150 and austenitic 18 Cr 9 Ni, respectively. It is found that various forms of deformation of safety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tubes occur due to non-uniform swelling along the tube height, perimeter and across-wall thickness. The swelling gradients can lead to bowing and ovality, and can be accompanied by significant internal stresses within the tube material. The latter can lead to size reduction of guide tube dimension in some directions due to irradiation creep. High levels of swelling-induced residual stresses, in combination with a swelling-induced embrittlement of the tube material, can lead to the tube failure {{even in the absence of}} any external loading...|$|R

30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston <b>rod,</b> <b>guide</b> sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston <b>rod</b> and <b>guide</b> sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R

40|$|Augmented Reality (AR), {{the ability}} to present the real-world, overlayed with digital information, is quickly gaining {{popularity}} {{for a number of}} applications ranging from entertainment to manufacturing. Improved hardware and miniaturization along with robust sensor processing techniques have made AR a viable technology on a variety of high-end and commodity devices. The intention of any AR system is to “augment” a user’s reality, with digital content, in order to aid him/her in a particular task. This task can vary from analyzing a factory layout in its intended physical space to following directions on your windshield while driving. Surgeons use AR technology to locate tumors on the fly during operations. The entertainment industry has used AR from hand-held games to major attractions. It has been used in all forms of product development from design to assembly to maintenance to guide users through complex processes. Particularly in manufacturing, these AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> viewers have been developed and found to benefit end-users considerably. It has reduced the cognitive load on the user, reduced assembly times, increased quality, and reduced training time. AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> viewers have also, in some cases, removed the advantage that experts have over non-experts. However, authoring the content within an AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> viewer is the biggest obstacle to its widespread adoption. Issues hindering authoring include: 1) inadequate software skillset of the person responsible for authoring, 2) complex hardware and software systems, and 3) the process being time and resource consuming. To mitigate the various issues in authoring AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> content, researchers have proposed a number of solutions without much success. Solutions include: 1) using markers placed in the real environment as reference for AR systems to reflect the necessary content, 2) creating content solely in a virtual environment, 3) performing gestures that facilitate content creation, and 4) using sensors (e. g., GPS) to locate the view of the user and overlay content. Based on a literature review conducted of the numerous solutions available, various gaps were identified in the context of AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> and formed into three research issues. They are: 1) establishing automatic registration of parts during an expert demonstration, 2) ensuring sufficient domain level expertise is incorporated into AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> instructions, and 3) evaluating the instructions generated by an authoring tool for accuracy and quality. To direct the creation of new AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> authoring methods that address the aforementioned research issues a classification technique, established by Hampshire et. al. was used (also known as Hampshire classification). Along with the Hampshire classification, the various factors necessary to successfully author AR content are categorized according to their specific environment, interaction metaphors, and author’s domain knowledge. All of these were used to support the design choices made in the proposed authoring technique known as expert demonstration. This technique automatically generates the various assembly steps and part movements by analyzing 3 D point cloud data generated from an expert who performs the assembly (i. e. “demonstrates” it). Through this demonstration, a corresponding skin model is generated and used to detect and remove the expert’s hands in the captured frames. Image analysis is also performed to remove the scene background as well as identify and track each part in the assembly. The analysis results in the detection of each individual assembly step, each part location, and each assembly path. This information is used to generate AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> work instructions. Skin detection is a critical component of the expert demonstration authoring technique, as without filtering out the hands detecting, identifying and tracking the parts becomes more difficult. Current skin detection techniques like Gaussian mixture models require clean data and are unable to handle noisy data without overfitting the model. This {{led to the development of}} a novel algorithm called particle swarm optimized Gaussian mixture model (PSOGMM). PSOGMM was designed to take only a single input variable describing the amount of noise in the system. It was compared to traditional GMM with two independent datasets. To illustrate the authoring of AR <b>guided</b> <b>assembly</b> work instructions, AREDA (Augmented Reality via Expert Demonstration Authoring), an AR authoring tool was developed. It was divided into two phases known as the demonstration phase and the refinement phase. The demonstration phase consisted of determining the various calibration parameters (background, area, and skin) as well as recording and processing the assembly demonstration. The refinement phase consisted of taking these automatically generated AR work instructions and fixing mistakes during the demonstration phase, refining orientation and positions of the 3 D models, and adding other forms of information like textual instructions or images. AREDA was tested on three assemblies of increasing complexity, namely DUPLO blocks, a 3 D printed grip vise, and a laptop...|$|R
