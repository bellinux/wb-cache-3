The study {{was carried out}} by enumerating the total colony counts of bristles-adhered microbes after three weeks of normal oral hygiene followed by <b>rinsing</b> the toothbrushes <b>with</b> CHX, HX, tap water and deionized water independently following a strict planned schedule. <b>Rinsing</b> toothbrush <b>with</b> tap water was included in the study as a control due to the normal way of cleaning toothbrush after use in every home. Whereas, sterilized deionized water do not contain any ions, minerals and is microbes-free. The total colony counts of microbes obtained from the toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> <b>with</b> tap water, deionized water, CHX and HX were 62. 6 × 106 CFU mL- 1, 74. 4 × 106 CFU mL- 1, 2. 4 × 106 CFU mL- 1 and 7. 6 × 106 CFU mL- 1, respectively.

Although toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> <b>with</b> mouth <b>rinses</b> containing antimicrobial agent such as CHX and HX still harbour microorganisms, but the microbial load has been very much lowered compared to the control toothbrush.

Scientific evidence to support this assumption is, however, lacking. This study aims to investigate the effect and clarify underlying mechanisms of short-term <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> NaCl on human gingival fibroblast (hGFs) wound healing. Isolated primary hGFs and human normal oral keratinocytes (hNOKs) were <b>rinsed</b> <b>with</b> 0 - 7. 2 % NaCl for 2 min, 3 times a day. Scratch-tests, trans-well migration assays and MTT activity were performed. mRNA expression was assessed of type-I collagen, fibronectin and FAK. Changes in FAK and F-actin were detected by immunofluorescence. KCl, NaH 2 PO 4, KH 2 PO 4 were used to clarify the molecules involved. <b>Rinsing</b> <b>with</b> 0. 9 - 1. 8 % NaCl significantly promoted hGFs cell migration but not proliferation. However, it {{had no effect on}} hNOKs. <b>Rinsing</b> <b>with</b> 1. 8 % NaCl significantly up-regulated the expression of type-I collagen and fibronectin. FAK and F-actin, molecules responsible for cytoskeleton re-organization and cell migration, were also up-regulated. Cl- seemed to be essential since <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> KCl resulted in a similar effect as noted with NaCl. In conclusion, short-term <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> NaCl promoted hGFs migration, and increased the expression of extracellular matrix as well as cytoskeletal proteins.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a rinse solution for prevention of ischemiareperfusion {{injury in the}} lung preserved for 24 hours was evaluated by using the canine isolated lung perfusion model. The heart and the lungs were harvested and preserved for 24 hours at 4 - 6 ℃ in modified:Euro-Collins(EC) solution. Prostaglandin El (100 p g) was adiministered into the pulmonary trunk prior to flushing canine lungs with preservation solution. The next day, left lungs were isolated with a perfluorochemical (FC- 43) or Carolina rinse II solution. Immediately after rinsing, the lung was reperfused with homologous venous blood (400 ml) for 120 min. in the experimental pump circulation system. The lungs were classified into the following six groups: Group 1 (n = 5), without rinsing (control group), Group 2 (n = 6), <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> oxygenated FC- 43 solution (250 ml), Group 3 (n = 4), <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> non-oxygenated FC- 43 solution (250 ml), Group 4 (n = 5), <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> pluronic F 68 solution (250 ml), Group 5 (n = 4), <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> the Carolina <b>Rinse</b> Solution a (250 ml) and Group 6 (n = 4). <b>rinsing</b> <b>with</b> the Carolina <b>Rinse</b> Solution 11 (250 ml) in addition with hydroxyethyl starch (50 g/l). Pulmonary vascular resistance and lung water volume (wet-dry/wet ratio) were lower and dynamic lung compliance was higher in Group 2 than in other groups.
