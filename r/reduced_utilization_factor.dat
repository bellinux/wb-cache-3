40|$|High {{temperature}} {{fuel cells}} are electricity producers that guarantee relevant energetic and environmental performances. They feature high electricity to input chemical energy ratios {{and availability of}} high temperature heat. Notwithstanding, {{the search for a}} further increase in electric efficiency, especially when applying a CHP solution is not feasible, has brought to plant integration with gas turbines (GTs) in several studies and some pilot installations. While for pressurized fuel cells the choice of internal combustion gas turbines seem to be the only one feasible, in ambient pressure fuel cells it seems useful to analyze the combination with indirect heated GT. This choice allows to optimize turbine pressure ratio and cell size. In this work, a parametric performance evaluation of a hybrid molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) indirect heated gas turbine has been performed by varying the fuel cell section size and the fuel utilization coefficient. The analysis of performance variation with the latter parameter shows how a cell that is optimized for stand alone operation is not necessarily optimized for the integration in a hybrid cycle. Working with <b>reduced</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>factors,</b> in fact can reduce irreversible losses and does not necessarily yield to less electricity production since the heat produced in the post combustor is recovered by the gas turbine section. This aspect has not been taken into sufficient consideration in literature.

Fuel cells are an environmentally friendly renewable energy source {{that can be used}} in a wide range of applications and are ideal for distributed power applications. A Fuel Cell is a device that electrochemically converts fuel into electricity. The fuel cell uses an electrochemical process which converts the fuel directly into electricity with little energy loss in the form of heat.

Standard lightning impulse of 1. 2 / 50 is used in this study, along with three difference electrode configurations (rod-rod electrode, rod-sphere electrode and sphere-sphere electrode) with variable gap lengths. In addition, the lightning impulse breakdown level considering <b>utilization</b> <b>factors</b> are studied for the establishment of insulation design criteria of high voltage power equipment. The <b>utilization</b> <b>factors</b> are represented as the ratio of minimum electric field (Emin) to maximum electric filed (Emax). COMSOL software is used to develop electrode model in order to analyses the electric field. It was found that higher gap lengths provide higher U 50 for a given electrode configuration, although the rise in U 50 is more clearly in sphere-sphere electrode configuration. Where, sphere-sphere electrode configuration require higher U 50 to breakdown it is 40 % than rod-sphere electrode configuration (30 %) and rod-rod electrode configuration (28 %), respectively. A difference in Emax values where the higher gap length provide lower Emax for sphere-sphere electrode configuration, while the higher gap length provide higher Emax for rod-rod and rod-sphere electrode configurations. Considering the effects of field <b>utilization</b> <b>factor,</b> which was based on difference electrode configurations, it was found that sphere-sphere electrode more uniformity at gap length 0. 5 cm (0. 9968) than rod-rod electrode at gap length 1 cm (0. 2057) and rod-sphere electrode at gap length 1 cm (0. 1546).

40|$|Various capacity-enhancing {{diversity}} {{techniques are}} considered in DS-CDMA systems. Problems are defined from three perspectives. The first thrust aims {{to exploit the}} multiple-input, multiple-output techniques in the asynchronous DS-CDMA reverse link. The Alamouti code, spatial multiplexing, and full-rate, full-diversity space-time code are considered at the transmitter. The receiver exploits both the chip-level oversampling and sphere decoder to. Analysis shows that the performance {{is determined by the}} product measure of space-time codes and the effective SINR. Furthermore, three expurgated union bounds are proposed to approximate the BER for different space-time schemes and SNRs. Based on the link-level performance, single-cell spectral efficiency is also analyzed for both the ideal and noisy channel state information at the receiver. ^ The second thrust seeks to investigate the performance variation of MC-DS-CDMA systems over fast fading channels. A receiver structure, which features both Doppler diversity and frequency diversity, is proposed to counteract the effect of large Doppler spreads. The second-order statistics of received signals are derived that lead to a closed-form expression of BER. Under a constant power constraint, it is shown that the Doppler diversity outperforms the frequency diversity as long as the Doppler spread is larger than certain threshold. Numerical results are also provided to show that the multiple-access interference tends to degenerate into a wide-sense stationary process as Doppler spreads become large. ^ Finally, the throughput of a multiple-input, single-output downlink system is examined with noisy channel information feedback. A cross-layer approach is employed to optimize the physical layer precoding matrix with a throughput metric. The optimal precoding matrix reduces to beamforming when the received SNR and SNR of channel feedback both become large. The rate allocation, even with a fairly good channel feedback, needs to be <b>reduced</b> to a <b>utilization</b> <b>factor</b> around 0. 8. For low SNR and large transmission delay, we propose a two-mode transmission scheme, switching between beamforming and spatial diversity, such that the throughput is very close to the optimal precoding scheme. ...|$|R
