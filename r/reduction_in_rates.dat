These contracts were amended to correct the issues the OIG identified. The OIG found that in some cases the 20% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> was later amended for a subset of consultants back to their original rates.

5000|$|University of Manitoba {{economist}} Evelyn Forget (...) {{conducted an}} quasi-experimental analysis that compared health outcomes of Dauphin residents with other Manitoba residents. This research {{did not use}} the Mincome data directly, but under the assumption that if a high proportion of Dauphin residents participated in Mincome, one should be able to discern differences in social, economic and health outcomes for that group, compared to the general population. She found that only new mothers and teenagers worked substantially less. Mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren't under as much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating. In addition, those who continued to work were given more opportunities to choose what type of work they did. Forget found that in the period that Mincome was administered, hospital visits dropped 8.5 percent, with fewer incidents of work-related injuries, and fewer emergency room visits from accidents and injuries. Additionally, the period saw a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> of psychiatric hospitalization, and in the number of mental illness-related consultations with health professionals.|$|E
5000|$|It {{had been}} the {{unanimous}} decision of the board in May 1856 that the company secretary/manager (John Dodds) should be 'allowed to resign' [...] (Dodds worked out his notice, but responsibility for engines and rolling stock was immediately assumed by George Tosh, who had (and retained) the same responsibility on the Maryport and Carlisle). The company half-yearly meeting in February 1857 was the first after Mr Dodds' departure, and the report to shareholders contained multiple criticisms of his regime. Accounts had been defectively kept; expenditure had not been booked as it was incurred, {{and there had been}} 'inaccuracy and confusion' in the stores accounts. Mr Tosh had found the engines to need much remedial work, they being 'in a most dilapidated state from long neglect'. A new tank engine built to Dodds' specification had proved wholly unsuited for the traffic. Dodds defended himself by attacking the competence of Mr Tosh (who could not reply, because not a shareholder) and alleging that the stores accounts for the last half-year had been wilfully falsified. [...] "Under the existing management the property of the company was being wasted, four-fifths of the money expended during the last half-year was altogether unnecessary, and the directors were not deserving the confidence of the shareholders." [...] Acceptance of the half-yearly report and accounts was opposed by Dodds, supported both by the 'anti-coal interest' faction and by Mr Harris (who had been denied any <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> to match that given the Fletchers), and only carried on the casting vote of the chairman (Mr Fletcher).|$|E
5000|$|As head of Ways and Means, Morrison {{worked hard}} for tariff reform, without {{conspicuous}} success. His bill met with so much Democratic obstruction that it never reached a final vote in 1884, and {{the same was true}} in 1886. The opposition was led by Congressman Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania on the Democratic side, and there had been bad blood between the two men for almost a decade. In 1875, Morrison had favored Michael Kerr of Indiana for Speaker over Randall, and Randall, coming to the Speakership a year later, saw to it that Morrison was shut out of the Ways and Means Committee chairmanship henceforth. In 1883, when Randall sought re-election to the Speakership, Morrison organized the forces that elected John G. Carlisle of Kentucky instead. But their personal dislike was rooted in sharply different views of how protective the tariff ought to be, and Randall's ability, as Appropriations Committee chairman, to wield the influence among members against any <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> was still considerable through 1886. One high-tariff Democrat described Morrison as [...] "afflicted with economic flatulence and fiscal hydrophobia," [...] firing off [...] "putrid tariff phosphorescence from one end and finance and currency froth from the other." [...] The tariff bill that Morrison wanted never even made it unscathed through the Ways and Means Committee. [...] "Apparently there are many doctors attending the coming Tariff bill at the leader's bedside," [...] the Secretary of the Treasury Daniel Manning wrote an old associate. [...] "I am afraid of many deformities, and feel almost certain that it will not live long enough to grow out of the arms of its nurses." [...] Nor did it. In June 1886, the House voted by 157 to 140 not to discuss the bill. Thirty-five Democrats voted with the protectionist majority, among them congressmen from the wool-growing and sugar-raising districts of Ohio and Louisiana; Alabama's members voted on behalf of the coal and iron interests of Birmingham.|$|E

5000|$|A wider {{regional}} {{market will be}} available to business enterprises {{on both sides of the}} Sound, thereby creating more favorable conditions for establishment of new businesses and expansion of older ones. This applies particularly to specialized enterprises serving areas broader than individual localities.Employment opportunities will be broader for residents on both sides of the Sound. Individuals with special skills will have a wider field in which to locate, and there will be more opportunity to match skills with jobs. As a result, income levels will often rise as people will be more able to utilize their maximum abilities. The need to relocate families in order to gain better access to employment will be diminished.Because the bridge will contribute to a healthy economic development of the region, it will have a favorable general effect on property values and therefore on the tax base. Consequently, it will tend to hold down tax rates. These favorable impacts may have been the experience of many transportation improvements.Movement of goods will be an important function of the new bridge. For the first time, highway access will be available for freight movements to and from Long Island without the need to overcome New York City congestion. Freight shipments to Long Island are now charged at a premium rate. Construction of the bridge could result in a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> for Long Island shippers and receivers, with a possible favorable effect on the cost of living as well as on the costs of doing business.Construction of a major project of the magnitude of the proposed bridge and its approach highways will provide a substantial number of jobs during the period it is under construction. Approximately 55 percent of the total cost of construction will be for labor, of which the major element will be on-site. It is estimated that approximately 6,400 man-hours of work will be required, spaced over a three-year period. This means an average of about 2,100 men working on the project, with a peak force of perhaps 3,000 workers. In addition to the labor employed directly on contract work, both on-site and off-site, there will also be employment created in the furnishing of materials, supplies and services required for the project. Secondary economic benefits also will be realized from expenditures by workers employed on the project, both in the vicinity of the bridge site and elsewhere in the region. All of this economic activity will produce substantial additional income for the region, most of it without requiring additional permanent community services. Robert Moses, NYSDOT and MTA ...|$|E

The study included 3 rates of herbicides, growth retardant and fungicides (100 %, 75 % and 50 %) as well as different types of adjuvant (oil, surface-active, mineral). Plots without adjuvant were the control treatment.  A hypothesis was made that the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> of crop protection agents by 25 – 50 %, with the simultaneous addition of adjuvants, would allow spring barley productivity to be maintained at a level similar to that obtained under the conditions when recommended rates are applied without adjuvant. It was also assumed that particular types of adjuvant would show different interactions with specific groups of crop protection agents.  It has been proved that a rational <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> of crop protection agents is up to a limit of 25 %, especially when an adjuvant is added to such reduced rates. This allows spring barley productivity to be maintained at the level obtained after the application of full rates (without adjuvant). But a further <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rates</b> of crop protection agents by 50 %, in spite of the interaction of adjuvants, results in a significant deterioration of all spring barley yield components, since such conditions lead to increased occurrence of agricultural pests (weeds, fungal diseases) as well as increased crop lodging.
