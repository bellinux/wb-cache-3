50|$|The {{outsourcing}} of asylum {{is a type}} {{of migration}} policy pursued by the countries of the European Union, it consists of relocating the <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> of asylum seekers and the processing of their asylum applications, in places near the borders of the EU or in countries outside the EU, from which asylum seekers originate or through which they pass. After an attempted relocation of asylum procedures in centres on the boundaries of the EU, in 2003 these policies have resulted in a proliferation of exile camps in and around the European Union, a pressure on neighbouring countries to develop systems that consider applications for asylum in their territories, and a radicalisation of antimigratory policies in neighbouring countries and within the border of the European Union.|$|E

30|$|In EU member states, {{large-scale}} accommodation {{has become}} the dominant response to forced migration {{and the arrival of}} refugees 1 (European Migration Network, 2014). Since the 1980 s, several states have introduced this into their legal frameworks as the obligatory form of housing migrants with uncertain residence status for the first months–and sometimes years–after their arrival (AIDA, 2016). The concentration of large numbers of refugees in one place {{is a result of the}} increasing attempts of the EU and nation states to regulate and reduce the number of refugees arriving (Kreichauf, 2016). In the aftermath of Europe’s refugee crises in 2015, EU regulations and national asylum laws, especially those concerning <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation,</b> have been tightened.|$|E
30|$|In the {{aftermath}} of large refugee arrivals in 2015, EU regulations and national asylum laws were tightened, especially those regarding <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The current contribution introduces the concept of “campization” to explain the impact of law and policy changes on the socio-spatial configuration and functions of refugee accommodation in European capital regions. Based on qualitative research concerning case studies for Athens, Berlin, and Copenhagen, I argue that refugee accommodation has increasingly been transformed into large, camp-like structures with lowered living standards and a closed character. This is shown by the structural, functional, and socio-spatial characteristics of the accommodation in the three case studies, {{as well as the}} political and administrative objectives that determine the campization of accommodation. The contribution lastly highlights changing notions and forms of containment, exclusion, and temporality as part of campization, and links this process to current trends in asylum and urban development.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{requirements}} expressed by travelers with disabilities {{in relation to their}} safety and comfort with <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> services offered by hospitality organizations, including hotels, motels and guest houses. These findings should open a clearer panorama to hospitality business managers by allowing them to develop better strategies for providing desired levels of friendly assistance and practical facilities. The approach selected is based on statistical methods. The compiled information was obtained via (a) feedback forms given to potential travelers with disabilities, (b) questionnaires given to hospitality business managers, and (c) interviews with hospitality business managers and organizations dealing with people with disabilities in North America, the European Union, Oriental Europe, and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. However, the results can be easily adapted to other regions in the world. The conclusions are intended to be useful to people with disabilities and, in addition, to provide valuable information for hospitality business organizations {{that will allow them to}} improve their management criteria to retain these important guests while gaining new ones...|$|E

40|$|In an interview, Gianfranco Schiavone, President of the Italian Solidarity Consortium ICS (Consorzio Italiano di Solidarietà – Ufficio Rifugiati Onlus) in Trieste, {{presents}} a decentralized model of <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> of asylum seekers {{which is considered}} “good practice” in Italy {{as well as in}} Europe. The model is {{based on the idea that}} it is necessary to integrate asylum seekers into the local environment from the beginning and provide them with as much autonomy as possible in their everyday life. Experience in Trieste shows that, compared with the centralized model of accommodation (reception centres for asylum seekers), the dispersed forms of accommodation (apartments and other community-based living arrangements) offer a better quality of life for asylum seekers. At the same time, this approach results in less tension within the local community and is better in terms of costs. In addition, Schiavone talks about changes in future European policies. He considers whether Slovenia will continue to implement the current centralized model, and proposes the introduction of diversified forms of accommodation, which could have similar benefits to those seen in the Trieste model...|$|E
40|$|The dual-process {{model of}} {{development}} regulation (Brandtstädter & Rothermund, 2002 a) proposes that accommodation (flexible goal adjustment) contributes to well-being and successful development. A cognitive mindset {{characterized by a}} divergent thinking mode should facilitate accommodative processes. Two studies were conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between accommodative mechanisms and music reception. Study 1 (training study; N = 79) investigates whether such a mindset can be induced by attentive-analytical music reception (simultaneously focusing various musical parameters). Two groups of students were trained to listen to music or view art in a complex way. Results showed group differences in the preferences for the stimuli presented. These preferences were correlated with accommodation. The findings from Study 2 (cross-sectional; N = 470) showed a significant relationship between attentive-analytical music <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Furthermore, the interplay between analytical and affective music reception seemed to play an important role in this process. Further studies are needed to examine how the training could be implemented into fields of practice in which developmental regulation processes are relevant (e. g., support groups, psycho-therapy, adult education settings, and lifelong learning) ...|$|E
40|$|The SYRIZA-led {{coalition}} government attempted {{to perform a}} 180 -degree turn from the rather restrictive migration and asylum policies of the previous governments. • Very few of the SYRIZA/ANEL {{coalition government}}’s pledges actually materialised.

Designing and delivering measures for the integration of international protection beneficiaries and applicants appears to be particularly challenging in the current state of play. • Three pressing issues will have to be addressed sooner or later in 2017 by the Greek State: improvement of first <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> conditions; acceleration of the examination of the international protection, relocation, and family reunification applications; integration of international protection beneficiaries and applicants in the labour market. • The extent to which these issues will be effectively addressed depends on the ability of the Greek government and the EU to surpass certain well-known structural obstacles...|$|E
30|$|Functionally, campization {{results in}} {{blurring}} the differentiation {{of the classic}} functions of European refugee accommodation: <b>Reception,</b> <b>accommodation,</b> <b>and</b> detention. Centre Sandholm and Centre Kongelunden, and some facilities in Berlin and Athens show a concentration of these functions in one place. Thus, an official registration <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> site {{may also be a}} place where long-term <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> deportation is conducted. An accommodation center that is set up to house asylum seekers during the application procedure may easily become a place of deportation. The concentration of multiple functions, however, is reflected in the functional segregation of the camps. In Centre Sandholm and Ellinko, for example, there are various sectors and zones that constitute spaces of first <b>reception,</b> long-term <b>accommodation,</b> <b>and</b> deportation within one camp. Furthermore, campizated accommodation tends to consist of its own infrastructures and the facilities for daily needs (such as schools, clinics, playgrounds, canteens, and wash houses). The cases of Berlin’s Motardstraße, Hovestaden’s Sandholm and Kongelunden, as well as the camps in Attica illustrate that different usages of space and daily routines are functionally segregated into various zones.|$|R

30|$|The {{terminology}} {{applied to}} define current mass accommodation for refugees in Europe reveals some conceptual slippage. After the Second World War, this accommodation in Europe was commonly termed refugee camps. Even {{with the introduction}} of accommodation into the legal asylum frameworks of some European states in the 1980 s, it was initially referred to as camps. With the institutionalization of accommodation as part of asylum laws, legal and administrative terms such as (<b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation)</b> centers, (asylum) shelters, and homes have emerged. By signing up to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights–as well as due to EU directives–EU member states have been obliged to introduce regulations and provisions governing standards of living into their legal frameworks. In studies on institutionalized collective accommodation in and around European cities, researchers thus often refer to “European Accommodation Centres for Asylum Seekers” (Szczepanikova, 2013), “camp-like collective accommodations” (Pieper, 2008), and “asylum centres” (Morville & Erlandsson, 2013). The term “refugee camp” is mostly used to refer to first, camps in the global south, second, discourses on informal encampments, makeshift camps, and tent cities for transiting refugees (such as Calais in France and Idomeni in Greece), and third, hotspots, and detention and transit centers in border areas. This distinction is made to highlight differences in socio-spatial structures, living conditions, the accommodation’s nature, and questions of institutional responsibilities, governing, and labeling spaces and people. In these contexts, camps are referenced as large spaces with an insecure, temporary, or exceptional legal status (for example regarding construction laws), which accommodate masses of people, have low standards of living, and consist of tents, containers, and/or improvised shelters.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} state {{apartment}} in the Jacobean country house – its status, function, use, planning, decoration and furnishing. It does so against various different backgrounds. Firstly, that of the royal progress, during which Tudor and early Stuart monarchs – in particular, James I – would visit private residences around the country. The nature of such visits are explored, using {{a large amount of}} primary evidence and drawing upon a full itinerary of James I’s reign, compiled {{for the first time as}} part of this thesis. A different context, that of royal palaces, is then considered, particular focus being given to the use and accessibility of state apartments. This subject is further explored within the context of the noble household. The use of state rooms beyond and during royal visits is investigated, again using much primary evidence that has been largely neglected before now. It is shown that state apartments in country houses were the focus for elaborate ceremonial, and that they were used for the <b>reception</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> of various honoured guests, not just members of the royal family. In the last two chapters of the thesis, the planning, decoration and furnishing of the country house state apartment is considered. It is argued that arrangements developed significantly between the Henrician and Jacobean periods, the state suite evolving from a comparatively simple (and sometimes haphazard) collection of spaces to a cohesively planned and integrated suite – a true apartment. This argument is based on the detailed analysis of 29 sixteenth-century houses (including Thornbury Castle, Theobalds and Hardwick Hall) and 9 houses of the Jacobean period (including Audley End, Hatfield House and Bramshill). Such a study clearly demonstrates that state apartments were undoubtedly the best rooms in a country house, and were used to reflect and further an owner’s status and prestige...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. Previous research, often {{using the}} symptom-sign inventory, had {{demonstrated}} a high prevalence of psychiatric disorder among homeless people. The delusions-symptoms-states inventory detects {{the presence or}} absence of four classes of psychiatric illness [...] delusions of disintegration, integrated delusions, neurotic symptoms and dysthymic states. AIM. A study was undertaken to determine the utility of the delusions-symptoms-states inventory in a sample of homeless men, and the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in this group. METHOD. The inventory was administered to 55 homeless men in a reception centre in Sheffield. RESULTS. Nearly half of the men obtained scores on the inventory suggesting that they had psychiatric symptoms. There was an overlap of syndromes, particularly among those with severe psychiatric illness. For example, seven men had all four classes of psychiatric illness. CONCLUSION. Use of the questionnaire proved satisfactory. The findings support the contention that <b>reception</b> centres <b>and</b> similar <b>accommodation</b> are repositories for homeless mentally ill people...|$|R

5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work.
