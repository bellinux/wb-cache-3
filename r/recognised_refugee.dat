5000|$|An {{asylum seeker}} (also rarely called an asylee) {{is a person}} who flees his or her home country, 'spontaneously' enters another country and applies for asylum, i.e. the right to {{international}} protection, in this other country. An asylum seeker may be a refugee, a displaced person or a migrant, such as an economic migrant. A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded. The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and becomes an officially <b>recognised</b> <b>refugee</b> or whether asylum is refused and the person becomes an illegal immigrant who has to leave the country again and may even be deported. The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given refugee status if the person's circumstances fall into the definition of [...] "refugee" [...] according to the 1951 Refugee Convention or other refugee laws, such as the European Convention on Human Rights - if asylum is claimed within the European Union. However signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are rejected varies from country to country and year to year.|$|E
30|$|Unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) are {{a diverse}} group with loss and {{vulnerability}} as common denominators. URM is defined as any child {{under the age of}} 18 who is physically separated from both parents and is an asylum seeker, <b>recognised</b> <b>refugee</b> or other displaced person (Bean et al. 2007). Compared to accompanied refugee children and non-immigrants, URMs have more traumatic stress reactions (Bean et al. 2007; Hodes et al. 2008).

A third of 222 male Afghan asylum-seeking URMs aged 13 – 18 years in the UK reported above threshold for anxiety, emotional and behavioural problems and PTSD, and 23 % for depression (Bronstein et al. 2012; Bronstein et al. 2013). In a Norwegian study structured diagnostic interviews with 160 male asylum-seeking URMs aged 14 – 20 years showed that 41.9 % had a psychiatric disorder, PTSD being the most prevalent (30.6 %), followed by depression (9.4 %), agoraphobia (4.4 %) and GAD (3, 8 %) (Jakobsen et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{representation}} of refugees living in Malaysia from two perspectives. Firstly, this study analysed representations of refugees in Malaysian media discourse by the significant Other in Malaysia, namely elite political voices and the Malaysian press. Secondly, {{the perspective of the}} refugee or the Self was explored through narrative analysis of refugee in-depth interviews. The analysis of the media texts revealed representations of the refugee along two binaries. First, the refugee as either an illegal immigrant or a <b>recognised</b> <b>refugee.</b> Second, the refugee as a social, political and security threat or a victim. The government voices frequently represented refugees negatively to legitimise keeping them out or managed as illegals. The alternative voices represented refugees as victims to foreground the government’s violation of international law and human rights. Three common identity themes emerged from the thematic analysis of refugee narratives: the refugee as homo sacer (the bare life), victim and the idealised Self. The refugee narratives were filled with stories that highlighted their victimisation and helplessness as they embraced, resisted or re-represented the existing representations assigned to them by the elite voices. Positioning analysis on the narratives of long-term refugees revealed that representations of refugees in wider discourse often left them with little room to negotiate a sense of Self despite living in Malaysia like a Malaysian. Despite feeling a sense of belonging to Malaysia, they struggled to manage problematic situations involving the local people and authorities because of particular identity claims they had to take up either by choice or out of necessity. This study hopes to provide insight into the complexity in representing refugees as well as to give refugees a space for actively responding to representations that involve them. Through iv future work from this study, it is hoped that a wider audience will come to understand how disempowering discourses and simplistic representations of refugees can often have damaging and long-lasting effects on the daily lives of this vulnerable group...|$|E
40|$|Amanda Vanstone’s new visa is a {{very small}} step forward, {{according}} to William Maley THE ANNOUNCEMENT by the immigration minister, Amanda Vanstone, that the government will introduce new regulations to establish a Removal Pending Bridging Visa has been welcomed as a first step, albeit a small one, away from the rigid regime of mandatory, non-reviewable detention of asylum seekers who arrive without visas. In practice, however, the step may prove to be very small indeed. When one examines the details of the proposal, it is clear that significant obstacles will still need to be overcome before many detainees can enjoy a taste of freedom. One provision is of particular concern, namely the limitation of eligibility to those detainees who in the belief of the minister ‘have done everything possible to facilitate their removal from Australia’. This formulation is ostensibly straightforward, but it masks a host of troubling complexities which arise when a detainee’s nationality is contested. For in a number of cases, often on the most flimsy of grounds, applicants have been denied refugee status on the basis that they were not citizens of the country from which they claimed to have fled. To see how this conundrum can arise, it is useful to examine a specific case, that of Applicant ‘M’. Mr M, a young man of about 19, arrived in Australia in early 2000, claiming to be a citizen of Afghanistan. He applied for a protection visa. The application was refused, and was then reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal, which affirmed the department’s decision. The tribunal accepted that Mr M {{was a member of the}} Hazara ethnic group (which has long been a victimised minority in Afghanistan), but that was as far as it would go: ‘On the basis of the applicant’s lack of familiarity with the part of Afghanistan from which he claims to have come, his lack of knowledge of recent events in Afghan history and his inability to nominate significant national days or to fix any date within the Afghan calendar, the tribunal finds that the applicant is not from Afghanistan and has not lived there all his life until he came to Australia’. Superficially this might have seemed a plausible conclusion, but on closer scrutiny it was extremely shaky. Residents of remote districts in war-torn countries often have only the haziest knowledge of what is going on elsewhere, and may be discouraged from travelling by the threat of banditry on the roads. In the region of Afghanistan from which Mr M claimed to come, there were at least three calendars which people might use (the Arabic lunar calendar, the Hisab-e burj based on the signs of the zodiac, and the traditional Hazara animal calendar), and no reasons to think that what the tribunal called ‘the Afghan calendar’ was the prevalent one in Mr M’s district. Most seriously of all, the tribunal drew adverse conclusions from the fact that when asked about the situation in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Mr M denied that he had been born at that time. Almost as if it were playing a trump card, the Tribunal set out evidence that the Soviet forces had withdrawn in 1989 when he was eight or nine years old. It somehow escaped the Tribunal’s attention that it was in 1982, around the time of Mr M’s birth, that Soviet troops had withdrawn from the region from which Mr M claimed to come. These flaws in the tribunal’s reasoning did not, of course, establish that Mr M was an Afghan, but they severely weakened the case for suspecting that he was not. What good would a Removal Pending Bridging Visa have done Mr M? If someone in his position stuck to his guns and maintained that he was an Afghan, his rejection of the tribunal’s shaky conclusions could be treated as evidence that he had not ‘done everything possible’ to facilitate his removal from Australia. The lesson here is relatively clear: the decision as to whether or not to release long-term detainees should not be in the hands of the government, which could have an interest in blaming refugees for mistakes which may have led to their prolonged detention, but rather in the hands of an independent actor such as the Federal Magistrates Court. And what of Mr M? Here the story as I heard it became even more interesting. Rejected by the tribunal, he sought judicial review in the Federal Court, but failed because he could not prove that the tribunal had made an ‘error of law’ in the technical sense. He requested that the then minister, Philip Ruddock, exercise his discretion to grant a humanitarian visa, but the minister would not shift an inch. Finally, when all else failed, he turned to the new Embassy of Afghanistan, established only after Mr M had made his fruitless journey through the tribunal and the courts. After making its own inquiries, it discovered he really was an Afghan, and its conclusion to that effect forced the Australian government’s hand. Mr M is now a <b>recognised</b> <b>refugee</b> with a Temporary Protection Visa. But the delay caused by the mistakes over his identity not only cost Mr M years of his life, but also the opportunity ever to receive a permanent visa. It’s no fun being a refugee. • William Maley is director of the Asia-Pacific College of Diplomacy at the Australian National University. This article first appeared in the Canberra Times.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} persons <b>recognised</b> as <b>refugees</b> {{based on}} the criteria set by Article 1 A(2) of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (CSR 1951) and residing in a Contracting State. It appraises the exclusion of CSR 1951 refugees from participation in elections of their countries of asylum pursuant to a citizenship voting qualification, which most countries set. It is emphasised that, since neither the CSR 1951 refugees nor their country of asylum know when or indeed whether cessation of CSR 1951 refugee status may occur, their exclusion may last for an indeterminate period of time. CSR 1951 confers on <b>recognised</b> <b>refugees</b> a host of civil, social and economic rights in their country of asylum; voting rights are absent. Concomitantly, while the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (and regional human rights treaties) pronounce that all persons are entitled to have their rights respected, protected and promoted, Contracting States are permitted to reserve two rights for their (full) members: the right to enter and remain in their country, {{and the right to}} vote in its elections. The central claim of this thesis is that <b>recognised</b> CSR 1951 <b>refugees</b> are a special category of non-citizen residents, due to their unique political predicament. They are unable to participate in elections of their country of origin, do not enjoy its diplomatic protection and consular assistance abroad, and – most fundamentally – are unable or unwilling, owing to a well-founded fear of persecution, to return to it for an indeterminate (and potentially protracted) period. It is submitted that <b>recognised</b> CSR 1951 <b>refugees</b> should be entitled to vote in elections of their countries of asylum, notwithstanding general citizenship qualifications imposed by these countries. At present, treaty law does not require countries of asylum to enfranchise their <b>recognised</b> CSR 1951 <b>refugees.</b> Hence, this thesis explores a gap in international refugee law and international human rights law between de lege lata and de lege ferenda; it is an exercise in ‘progressive development of the law’. Its inquiry is located in the international domain, and concerns, in principle, any Contracting State which admits and recognises CSR 1951 refugees.

40|$|This article {{examines}} Australia’s security assessment and related detention of {{refugees in the}} light of international human rights law.

Following theories on governmentality, it emphasizes the centrality of the concept of de-politicisation when examining the narratives and practices implemented to establish an extraterritorial asylum system of humanitarian containment, detached from any ideals of inclusion and rehabilitation. At the same time, we recall diverse empirical evidence in order to stress the importance of considering the divergent effects of depoliticisation in geographically and culturally distant contexts. The survey in Ca-labria, Italy, presents in fact the political attempt by its inner areas to foster autonomous practices of in-clusion that contrast the securitarian shift of the global asylum system, as well as its national implications, <b>recognising</b> <b>refugees</b> as a strategic factor of economic growth and social innovation. In particular, we re-veal the mechanisms through which new forms of local citizenship have emerged here, along with institu-tional solutions specifically connoted by a bilateral and place-based approach to forced migration. These efforts persist despite the breakup of the current European refugee crisis which, however, now opens new dilemmas by diminishing the viability of refugee relocation within the internal areas as a truly sustainable process. <br /...|$|R

Design: Cross-sectional study. Method: Asylum seekers were approached in 14 reception centres and refugees were interviewed in 3 municipalities (Arnhem, Leiden and Zaanstad). Respondents were interviewed in their own language and asked questions pertaining to: general health, chronic complaints, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), symptoms of depressions/anxiety, the use of healthcare services (general practitioner, medical specialists, hospitalisation, mental-health services, medication) and background variables. Results: A total of 232 asylum seekers and 178 refugees participated (response rates of 89 % and 59 % respectively). Of these, 142 (61 %) and 99 (56 %), respectively were males and the average age was 34. 4 (SD: 11. 0) and 40. 3 (SD: 13. 3) years respectively. Compared to refugees, asylum seekers more often considered their health to be poor (42 % and 59 % respectively), had more symptoms of depression/anxiety (39 % and 68 % respectively), and had more symptoms of PTSD (11 % and 28 %, respectively). No differences were found between refugees and asylum seekers in self-reported use of healthcare services. Conclusion: This study showed that asylum seekers have more health problems than refugees, but that there are no differences in the selfreported use of healthcare services. More research is needed to answer the question if asylum seekers have sufficient access to the healthcare system. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{systematically}} {{considers the}} law and policy on refugee status in the People’s Republic of China. It considers relevant Chinese legal provisions, applicable bilateral and multinational treaties, as well as China’s refugee policy and practice. It also presents and analyses first-hand information collected through interviews with refugees and aid workers. China is an emerging destination of refugees and other displaced foreigners. Although China is {{a party to the}} 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, Chinese law contains no provisions governing the definition of a refugee or the determination of refugee status. Further, there is a gap between the criteria for asylum in the 1982 Chinese Constitution and the criteria for refugee status in the 1951 Convention. In practice, although the Chinese government has generally allowed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to process individual applications for refugee status, the Chinese government has practically performed the function of refugee status determination in large-scale influx situations through policy decisions. In these situations, the security, political, and strategic interests of China have often overshadowed China’s commitment under the 1951 Convention. China has been cautious about <b>recognising</b> <b>refugees</b> on its territory. However, the Chinese government has clearly demonstrated a growing interest in addressing the issue of refugee recognition within a more formalised framework.
