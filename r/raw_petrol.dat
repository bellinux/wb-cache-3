40|$|Trace {{analysis}} on capillary columns becomes feasible provided appropriate injection techniques without stream splitting are used. To demonstrate potentialities {{and limitations of}} the methods, we investigated practical applications, the conditions of which were as dissimilar as possible. Insecticides in dairy products can be estimated by direct analysis of the <b>raw</b> <b>petrol</b> ether extract, without previous purification by column chromatography. 2 - 4 µl of extract are injected without splitting on a short inlet capillary fitted in a separate injection bloc. The inlet capillary is then connected to the capillary column mounted in the column oven with electron capture detector. Analysis is started by rapid heating to a constant temperature or by temperature programming resp. Head space analysis is another case in which trace components are important. Whereas several workers reported trapping of head space vapors in capillaries at low temperatures, we emphasize avoiding candensation, e. g. of water vapor, in the capillary. All sampling is done, therefore, near the original temperature of the head space material, i. e. at room temperature. In the case of coqnac aroma analysis in {{which most of the}} water and ethanol vapor are vented through the inlet capillary, the influences of most sampling variables—gas volume, length of inlet capillary—are studied. In the analysis of auto exhaust gas, again, bypassing of water is an important detail. In addition to hydrocarbons originating directly from the fuel as investigated by several authors, we found many combustion and conversion products, primarily naphthaline derivatives and phenol...|$|E
5000|$|Many more {{tourists}} {{were said to}} have been trapped in Thailand as rail and air transport services were suspended. Several attempts were made to rescue the stranded people in Thailand. The Samui airport was closed temporarily due to heavy downpours and poor visibility. About 100 foreign {{tourists were}} reported to be stranded on Angthong Island because of high waves. Thailand's prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has called the flooding in the south that has displaced thousands of people as [...] "one of the worst natural calamities" [...] to hit the country. Many districts are under as much as three metres of water. One resident has been electrocuted during the flooding. Officials said a woman was forced to give birth in her room in an apartment block as the high flood waters prevented her from being taken to hospital. Exports of electronic goods and automotive parts to Malaysia have been partially suspended as the Sadao border checkpoint has been closed because Hat Yai has been hard hit by flooding as the logistics operators explained. The shipments of consumer goods, <b>raw</b> materials, and <b>petrol</b> between Bangkok and the South have been delayed by many hours, raising concerns that shortages may occur if a new storm hits the region in the next few days. Prakit Chinamourphong, president of the Thai Hotels Association (THA), stated that it was too early to evaluate tourism damage from the floods as many areas of the town could not be reached or contacted. Suchart Sirankanokkul, the president of the THA Southern Chapter, explained that many people were stranded as water levels had reached the roofs of some properties. The flooding this year is the most severe since November 2000, when inundation of Hat Yai and its 16 neighbouring districts resulted in 20 deaths. Businesses and individuals who help with the donations or who have mobilised funding support for flood relief operations will also be entitled to the tax cut. Revenue Department director-general Satit Rungkasiri explains that the tax cut would apply to donations and flood damage between September and December.|$|R
