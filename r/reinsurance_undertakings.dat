50|$|Insurance Europe (known as Comité Européen des Assurances until March 2012) is the European {{insurance}} and reinsurance federation. Through its 34 member bodies — the national insurance associations — it represents all types of {{insurance and}} <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> e.g. pan-European companies, monoliners, mutuals and SMEs. Insurance Europe {{which is based in}} Brussels, Belgium, represents undertakings that account for around 95% of total European premium income. Insurance makes a major contribution to Europe's economic growth and development. European insurers generate premium income of more than €1,100bn, employ almost one million people and invest almost €8,400bn in the economy.|$|E

Expert contributions discuss the changes that have taken place in the supervision of insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> through an economic risk-based approach.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked life insurance market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the legal aspects of aviation {{insurance and reinsurance}} regarding passenger liability, in particular in Europe. The paper identifies and describes four main trends currently affecting the aviation insurance industry: the globalization of aviation insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> increased competition in aviation insurance sector, the liberalization of the European insurance market, {{and the evolution of}} the international and European air carriers liability regime. The implications of these trends for premium rates, and for insurance and reinsurance activities in general, are then assessed. This analysis indicates that the liberalization of the European insurance and reinsurance markets remains incomplete, given that certain essential aspects linked to the activities of insurance undertakings are not harmonized. This lack of consistency within the European regulatory regime is found {{to be a source of}} invisible barriers which hamper the effective application of the European freedoms of establishment and of providing services as established in the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore, the author identifies a potential for growing friction between the different international regulatory regimes governing air carriers liability. Looking to the future, the expected effects of the single European currency and the expansion of the WTO services disciplines is also examined. The author concludes that the effectiveness of traditional structures and organizations of insurance and reinsurance markets are being challenged by profound structural changes in the industry. In this context, the European liberalization could serve as a model for adapting to this changing environment on a regional level so as to benefit from the opportunities provided by competition and globalization...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} selected competencies of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), namely the power to resolve disputes between national supervisory authorities i n the framework of a binding mediation and to issue non-binding guidelines, and the impact which exercising those powers by the EIOPA has on the competences of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), a public authority responsible for {{the supervision of the}} Polish ﬁ nancial market. In the ﬁ rst part of the article the powers of the EIOPA to resolve disputes in a binding mediation process are described, and the limited possibilities that the EIOPA has to initiate this procedure are emphasized, since as a consequence of that the current mediation procedure encourages national supervisory authorities to resolve their disputes themselves. Next the principles of taking decisions by the EIOPA Board of Supervisors in the mediation process are described and attention is drawn to the discriminatory nature of those rules where the dispute relates to decisions of the group supervisor. The article also highlights potential consequences of decisions taken by the EIOPA within the binding mediation and their impact on administrative decisions taken by national supervisory authorities. The second part of the article provides an analysis of EIOPA’s powers to issue guidelines. The non-binding nature of the guidelines, which are described as soft law, has been reviewed. It is pointed that the European Union law provides for certain mechanisms which enable the EIOPA to enforce implementation of the guidelines by national competent authorities. As a next step, EIOPA guidelines on preparing for the implementation of Solvency II and the powers of the KNF to apply those guidelines have been reviewed. In addition to that, justiﬁ cation for vesting the KNF with the power to issue recommendations or guidelines addressed to insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertakings,</b> in the context of analogous competences possessed by the EIOPA have been discussed. 191251525 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E
