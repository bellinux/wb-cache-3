According to Athenaeus, [...] the idea of Aphrodite <b>Rising</b> <b>from</b> the Sea was inspired by Phryne who {{during the time of the}} festivals of the Eleusinia and Poseidonia had no problem swimming nude in the sea.|$|R
5|$|The benediction being concluded, the {{sovereign}} <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> the Coronation Chair and is borne into a throne. Once the monarch is {{seated on the}} throne, the formula Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth…– a translation of the Latin formula Sta et retine…, historically used for the enthronement of other Christian sovereigns – is recited.|$|E
5|$|The conical hill of {{clay and}} Blue Lias <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> the Somerset Levels. It was formed when {{surrounding}} softer deposits were eroded, leaving the hard cap of sandstone exposed. The {{slopes of the}} hill are terraced, but the method by which they were formed remains unexplained. Artefacts from human visitation have been found, dating from the Iron Age to Roman eras.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward section}} lies on its port side, with the {{amidships}} section keel up. The stern section <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> the seabed at an angle.

5|$|After being anointed, {{the monarch}} <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> the Coronation Chair and kneels {{down at a}} faldstool {{placed in front of}} it. The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away the canopy.|$|E

(If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E

5000|$|Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 14-15 January 2014: Following a {{very hot}} day, {{decaying}} thunderstorms produced a heat burst centered over the western suburbs of the city, but affecting most of the urban area. At 10:50 pm [...] recorded a wind gust of 102 km/h, followed by a <b>rise</b> in temperature <b>from</b> 29.9 to 38.9 C in just over an hour, while Cerberus station recorded a <b>rise</b> <b>from</b> 24.2 to 32.5 C in 30 minutes and later recorded a second <b>rise</b> <b>from</b> 26.6 to 33.6 C in 46 minutes.

5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> the ocean with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|January Jones became {{pregnant}} {{in between the}} fourth and fifth season of the series. Instead of writing in a pregnancy for the Betty Francis character, the writers opted to write in a weight gain. January Jones wore a fat suit during the filming of this episode, the same technique used by Elizabeth Moss during the first season when her character encountered a similar weight gain (though in that instance, the character was actually pregnant). Make-up tricks and clever camera angles were also used to create the dramatic impression of Betty's weight gain. A body double was used for the scene in which Betty <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> the bathtub.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} lunatic beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> Chen's stomach to her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} Charles Holden {{designed for the}} extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, {{glass and reinforced concrete}} and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line.|$|E
5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> Independence Lake west of the pass. Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of the North Fork of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the headwaters of the Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the volcano}} has been dormant, {{although}} some steam still <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> small vents in its summit {{and on its}} flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington).|$|E

After Vali is presumed dead in a battle with a demon, his brother Sugriva becomes king and appropriates Tara; however, Vali returns and regains Tara and exiles his brother, accusing him of treachery.|$|E
5|$|That night, Nicholas–now on {{the verge}} of insanity–hears Elizabeth calling him. He follows her ghostly voice down to her tomb. Elizabeth <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> her coffin and pursues Nicholas into the torture chamber, where he falls down a flight of stairs. As Elizabeth gloats over her husband's {{unconscious}} body, she is met by her lover and accomplice, Dr. Leon. They had plotted to drive Nicholas mad so that she could inherit his fortune and the castle.|$|E
5|$|The River Hull is a {{navigable river}} in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. It <b>rises</b> <b>from</b> a series of springs {{to the west of}} Driffield, and enters the Humber estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following a period when the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E
