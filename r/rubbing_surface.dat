5000|$|While {{energy is}} always lost during a brake event, a {{secondary}} factor that influences efficiency is [...] "off-brake drag", or drag {{that occurs when}} the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a braking event, hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the brake caliper pistons to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the brake system will drag until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surface.</b> During this time, there can be significant brake drag. This brake drag can lead to significant parasitic power loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.|$|E

In this study, the effect WSe 2 nanorods as lubrication additive could be attribute to the molecule bearing mechanism of rolling friction and sliding friction of the WSe 2 nanorods between the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In addition, rotating speed was very important in the experimental process. Under low rotating speed, the stability of liquid lubricant reduced, the load almost acted on protruding part of <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> When the load was increased, the lubricant film became unstable and easily splintered, the friction coefficient became high, as shown in Fig. 5 b. But {{with the increase of}} rotating speed, the oil film became more and more stable, which could not only bear the load of the steel balls but also prevented any direct contact between the two <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Moreover, when the shape of nonmaterial was destroyed at high load and high rotating speed, exfoliation of nonmaterial layer filled the rough contact surface and formed a stable thin film with base oil, which could decrease friction and wear happening on the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R

For real machine parts such as gears, roller bearings and cam mechanism the operating conditions such as speed, load and radius of curvature of <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are vary during the working cycle. Change in operating conditions may pose {{an increased risk of}} the lubricating film breakdown. Direct contact of <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{at the time of the}} lubricating film breakdown causes an increase in friction and wear. The high-speed CMOS camera was used to record the dynamic changes in lubricating film thickness during the experiment. The optical interferometry method has been used for reverse reconstruction of lubricating film thickness of the recorded interferograms. It was confirmed that the operating parameters have a major impact on the formation of lubricant film and its thickness and a certain combination of boundary conditions can cause lubricating film rupture.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in the automotive industry to reduce {{the weight of a}} vehicle and improve fuel consumption which in turn leads to a reduction in engine emissions. The main aim of the current study is to replace the conventional cast iron rotor material with a lightweight alternative such as coated aluminium alloy. The main challenge has been to meet both the cost and functional demands of modern mass-produced automotive braking systems. A sensitivity analysis based on the Taguchi approach was carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the thermal performance of a typical candidate disc brake. Wrought aluminium disc brake rotors coated with alumina on the rubbing surfaces were determined to have the best potential for replacing the conventional cast iron rotor at reasonable cost. Optimisation of the structure was subsequently carried out using a genetic algorithm on the selected coated aluminium disc brake rotor. This determines the optimum thickness of the coating and the composition of the substrate based on selected criteria. Prototype aluminium disc brake rotors were coated with alumina using the Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) technique and the thermal performance of these lightweight rotors was investigated experimentally using a brake dynamometer. A high speed thermal imaging system was used to evaluate and measure the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surface</b> temperature of the coated brake rotors. The experimental results showed generally good agreement with the numerical predictions. The coated wrought aluminium disc brake rotor was demonstrated to give good thermal and friction performance up to relatively high <b>rubbing</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures of the order of 500 °C...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, wear {{processes}} and mechanisms for wear transitions with sliding {{time and temperature}} during sliding of a nickel-based alloy, N 80 A, in oxygen at temperatures to 250 °C are discussed. Transitions in wear from high rates to low rates with sliding time were always observed at all the temperatures investigated. The transitions in wear were usually accompanied by transitions in contact resistance between the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> from nearly zero to positive high values. It was found that wear debris particles were heavily involved in the wear processes. The transitions in wear and contact resistance with sliding time mainly resulted from the development of wear-protective layers following the compaction of wear debris particles on the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The adhesion of triboparticulates {{to each other and}} to the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> played an important role in the rapid decrease in wear rate with sliding time and with increase in temperature.

40|$|Wear {{caused by}} {{abrasive}} particles {{is far more}} extensive, when compared with adhesive or normal wear. The effect of a mating surface on the abrasive wear was rarely observed. In practice, however, the wear caused by particles introduced between <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> is very important. Combining various materials as <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the author investigated {{the effect of the}} difference in hardness on wear caused by abrasive particles between them. Bearing steel, stainless steel, high-chromium steel, heat resisting steel castings, Ni-hard and several hard facing alloys were used as the material for the cylindrical testpiece of 8 mm diameter. The mating surface was a disc of bearing steel, carbon steel, phospher bronze or cast iron. Carborundum, alundum, quartz and garnet were experimented with as the abrasive particles. Test results showed clearly the presence of steep peak in the plot of the product of the hardness and the specific wear, i. e. the abraded volume/(load×rubbed distance), against the hardness, when the hardness of both surfaces became nearly equal. This tendency was always observed irrespective {{of the nature of the}} abrasive material, and deviated considerably from the empirical law stating the constancy of the product. The author attempted to explain this fact by observing traces of free particles and embedded particles on the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> by means of an electron microscope. The difference in the embedability of the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces</b> was found to cause the wide deviation of the value of the product. When the hardness of the cylindrical test piece related to its embedability closely approaches to that of the disk, the abrasive action of embedded particles becomes remarkable...|$|R

50|$|There are {{number of}} {{instances}} where {{this picture of}} a critical crack is modified by corrosion. Thus, fretting corrosion occurs when a corrosive medium is present at the interface between two <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Fretting (in the absence of corrosion) results from the disruption of very small areas that bond and break as the surfaces undergo friction, often under vibrating conditions. The bonding contact areas deform under the localised pressure and the two surfaces gradually wear away. Fracture mechanics dictates that each minute localised fracture has to satisfy the general rule that the elastic energy released as the bond fractures has to exceed the work done in plastically deforming it and in creating the (very tiny) fracture surfaces. This process is enhanced when corrosion is present, not least because the corrosion products act as an abrasive between the <b>rubbing</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
40|$|Polyphosphate {{inorganic}} polymer is evaluated as {{a high-performance}} lubricant for steel/steel contacts at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C.

The lubricated steel/steel pair shows desirable tribological performance that correlates closely with the temperature-dependent hierarchical structure of the tribo-interface under the combination of pressure, shear, and temperature. Morphological observation of worn surfaces and interfaces of steel discs is achieved using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
