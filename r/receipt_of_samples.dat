Resistance to clinically important antimicrobial agents, particularly fluoroquinolones and mac-rolides, is increasing among Campylobacter isolates, but {{few studies have}} explored the human health consequences of such resistance. Methods. In a registry-based cohort study, we determined the risk of invasive illness and death associated with infection with quinolone- and erythromycin-resistant Campylobacter strains, while adjusting for comorbidity. We linked data from the Danish Surveillance Registry for Enteric Pathogens with data from the Civil Registration System and National Health Registries. Results. Of 3471 patients with Campylobacter infection, 22 (0. 63 %) had an adverse event, defined as invasive illness or death, within 90 days of the date of <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> Patients infected with quinolone-resistant Campylobacter strains had a 6 -fold increased risk of an adverse event within 30 days of the date of <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> compared with patients infected with quinolone- and erythromycin-susceptible Campylobacter strains (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6. 17 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 1. 62 – 23. 47]).

Therefore, in this study, one laboratory synthesized all three samples of ZnO nanofluids using one-step pulsed wire evaporation (PWE) process to be described in [...] "Synthesis of ZnO nanofluids" [...] section. The round-robin exercise involved five test-laboratories that have extensive experience in the thermal conductivity measurement of nanofluids. Each participant received identical samples of ZnO nanofluids and was asked to conduct the test within 2 weeks of <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> The five participating laboratories measured the thermal conductivity of the samples of ZnO nanofluids over a temperature range from 20 to 90 °C using the THWM.

40|$|A molecular-based {{detection}} method {{was developed to}} detect Escherichia coli O 26, O 111 and O 157 in minced (ground) beef samples. This method consists of an initial overnight enrichment in modified tryptone soya broth (mTSB) and novobiocin prior to DNA extraction and subsequent serogrouping using a triplex PCR. This method has a low limit of detection and results are available within 24 hours of <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> Once optimized, this rapid method was utilized to determine the prevalence of these E. coli serogroups in six hundred minced beef samples {{all of which were}} previously examined by immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and selective plating for E. coli O 26 and O 111. Using IMS, two E. coli O 26 isolates were detected. No E. coli O 111 were recovered. The multiplex PCR technique described here did not detect E. coli O 111 nor O 157 in any of the samples, however six minced beef samples were positive for E. coli O 26 using our method, only two of these were previously detected by IMS and culture. Application of molecular methods are useful to support culture-based approaches thereby further contributing to risk reduction along the food chain...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: increasingly, {{a correct}} {{clinical}} diagnosis in Veterinary Medicine presupposes an accomplishment of complementary diagnostic exams, including those from Pathological Anatomy specialty {{and the potential}} risks of jeopardizing the quality and reliability of the laboratory diagnosis should be appropriately identified to adopt procedures, aiming their minimization. Objetives: the objectives of this work include the categorization of errors related to the diagnostic technique {{that takes place in}} the Laboratory of Pathological Anatomy Veterinary and enumeration of strategies for minimizing frequent errors. Material and Methods: monitoring the routine histological technique, from the moment of entry and <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> to identify and record the most frequently observed errors. Results: the most frequently identified errors in this work included the incomplete filling or illegibility of the analysis request, followed by incorrect packaging of the sample, the inadequate amount of formaldehyde for fixation and transport of the sample, and the absence of indications to the correct orientation of the surgical specimen. Conclusion: the adoption of simple strategies, detailed in the present work, solves most of the detected pre-analytical errors and the adoption of an identification system for the samples can guarantee the analytical and post-analytical quality in the histopathological diagnosis, minimizing the errors...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{performance}} of several recently developed assays for the detection of multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) in a large, multinational field trial. Samples from 1, 128 M/XDR-TB suspects were examined by Line Probe Assay (LPA), Pyrosequencing (PSQ), and Microscopic Observation of Drug Susceptibility (MODS) and compared to the BACTEC MGIT 960 reference standard to detect M/XDR-TB directly from patient sputum samples collected at TB clinics in India, Moldova, and South Africa. Specificity for all three assays was excellent: 97 - 100 % for isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), moxifloxacin (MOX) and ofloxacin (OFX) and 99 - 100 % for amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CAP) and kanamycin (KAN) resistance. Sensitivities were lower, but still very good: 94 - 100 % for INH, RIF, MOX and OFX, and 84 - 90 % for AMK and CAP, but only 48 - 62 % for KAN. In terms of agreement, statistically significant differences were only found for detection of RIF (MODS outperformed PSQ) and KAN (MODS outperformed LPA and PSQ) resistance. Mean time-to-result was 1. 1 days for LPA and PSQ, 14. 3 days for MODS, and 24. 7 days for MGIT. All three rapid assays evaluated provide clinicians with timely detection of resistance to the drugs tested; with molecular results available one day following laboratory <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> In particular, the very high specificity seen for detection of drug resistance means that clinicians can use the results of these rapid tests to avoid the use of toxic drugs to which the infecting organism is resistant and develop treatment regiments that have a higher likelihood of yielding a successful outcome...|$|E
40|$|CHARGE association, or {{syndrome}} {{as it is}} now known, is {{a condition}} where a number of congenital malformations are non-randomly associated in a recognizable pattern. There are two sets of diagnostic criteria for CHARGE syndrome which are in common usage at present (Blake et al., 1998; Verloes, 2005). The etiology of CHARGE syndrome was unknown. We identified twin girls with CHARGE syndrome and a de novo apparently balanced chromosome translocation 46,XX,t(8; 13) (q 11. 2;q 22). By mapping the chromosome translocation breakpoints we found that the gene chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD 7) located at 8 q 12 was disrupted in these girls. CHD 7 has a genomic length of 188 kb with 9000 coding bases over 37 exons. It has a putative function as a transcription factor which makes it a good candidate gene for a condition which affects multiple body systems. Concurrently with this study Vissers et al (2004) identified CHD 7 as a cause of CHARGE syndrome. They found two individuals with CHARGE syndrome with overlapping microdeletions detected by array CGH. By sequencing the 9 genes in this region in a cohort of 17 cases they identified a mutation in CHD 7 in 10 cases. We ascertained a cohort of 45 patients with a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome or possible CHARGE syndrome by scrutinizing the clinical genetics databases in Glasgow and Sheffield. Part of the cohort was accessed by <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> from clinical genetics departments elsewhere in the U. K. and in Lisbon. Clinical information was acquired on this cohort either by examination and review of the clinical notes by the author or by completion of a proforma by the referring clinician. Sequencing in this cohort of 45 patients was successful in 43 individuals. We identified 28 mutations; 16 nonsense, 10 frameshift and 2 splice site mutations. 20 of the mutations were novel, 8 had been reported in other studies. The mutations were found throughout the gene with no particular hotspots. No genotype/phenotype correlations were found either in relationship to the position of the mutation within the gene or with regards to the type of mutation. I have analyzed the phenotype in our cohort and compared it with the cases of CHARGE association reported prior to the availability of mutation analysis. I have also compared the phenotype in our mutation positive cases with those reported in other studies which were mutation-positive. We report two individuals with rare findings in CHARGE syndrome; one with a palsy of the twelfth cranial nerve reported anecdotally only once before (Blake et al., 2008), and another child with a limb reduction defect which has been reported in five other cases (Aramaki et al., 2006; Asamoah et al., 2004; Van de Laar et al., 2007).

40|$|The identification, {{characterization}} {{and handling}} of viruses and other pathogens that can present problems in plant disease diagnosis, such as mycoplasma-like organisms and fastidious bacteria, requires more trained personnel and specialised equipment than is usually available in tropical countries. The Tropical Virus Unit (TVU) at the Institute of Arable Crops Research, Rothamsted Experimental Station, in the UK offers {{help with the}} diagnosis of such infective agents. This facility complements other diagnostic services for fungi and bacteria such as those offered by CAB International's International Mycological Institute. The TVU {{is supported by the}} Natural Resources and Environment Division of Britain's Overseas Development Administration. When potentially diseased plant samples are received they are examined by electron microscopy and, where possible, serological methods are used to help identify the causal agent(s). Other methods, such as nucleic acid hybridization and DNA amplification, are also increasingly used. Once the agent is identified guidance on its method of transmission and spread can be given which may assist the study of its epidemiology and control. Whilst the TVU receives, and welcomes, unsolicited samples, the unit prefers users of the service to write first and appraise them of their problem. TVU can then advise on the best method of sending samples and provide permits to allow passage through UK Plant Health and Quarantine barriers. Some contacts are brief and can take a day or two from <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> to despatch of answer. Most are more prolonged, with several samples being sent, and there may be correspondence about the problem. Sometimes the scope and importance of the problem indicates the need for a more comprehensive project. Funding can then be jointly sought from suitable donor agencies. The following example illustrates the work of the TVU. Many years ago the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) was asked to produce seed of West Indian hot peppers that would be of high quality and free of virus contamination. After an initial market survey to determine which varietal characteristics were required, CARDI chose a red lantern type and the yellow Scotch Bonnet. Plots were grown at Betty's Hope Field Station, Antigua, which was isolated from other pepper crops. In spite of precautions, virus symptoms increased and seed production was halted in 1970. The TVU subsequently became involved and was able to identify two viruses, one of which (pepper mild mottle tobamovirus) was transmitted through the seed. Antiserum to the virus was produced and a simple serological test devised for both plants and seed. Because the virus is carried on the seed coat, seed is now treated before distribution to destroy the virus. Training and technology transfer also play a significant part in the activities of the unit. Courses in basic plant virology have been given overseas and postgraduate students working with the TVU can pursue higher degrees through Rothamsted's associated links with UK universities.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) for genome-wide imbalance provides a substantial increase in diagnostic yield for patients traditionally referred for karyotyping by G-banded chromosome analysis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate the feasibility of and strategies for, the use of array CGH in place of karyotyping for genome imbalance, and to report on the results of the implementation of this approach. Results Following a validation period, an oligoarray platform was chosen. In order to minimise costs and increase efficiency, a patient/patient hybridisation strategy was used, and analysis criteria were set to optimise detection of pathogenic imbalance. A customised database application with direct links to a number of online resources was developed to allow efficient management and tracking <b>of</b> patient <b>samples</b> and facilitate interpretation of results. Following introduction into our routine diagnostic service for patients with suspected genome imbalance, array CGH as a follow-on test for patients with normal karyotypes (n = 1245) and as a first-line test (n = 1169) gave imbalance detection rates of 26 % and 22 % respectively (excluding common, benign variants). At least 89 % of the abnormalities detected by first line testing would not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. The average reporting time for first-line tests was 25 days from <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample.</b> Conclusions Array CGH can be used in a diagnostic service setting in place of G-banded chromosome analysis, providing a more comprehensive and objective test for patients with suspected genome imbalance. The increase in consumable costs can be minimised by employing appropriate hybridisation strategies; the use of robotics and a customised database application to process multiple samples reduces staffing costs and streamlines analysis, interpretation and reporting of results. Array CGH provides a substantially higher diagnostic yield than G-banded chromosome analysis, thereby alleviating the burden of further clinical investigations. </p...|$|R

The Plutonium is separated by solvent extraction in centrifuge tubes using an extractive scintillator with P,P’- di(2 -ethylhexyl) methanediphosphonic acid (DIPEX) as the extractant. The organic phase is counted on a PERALS spectrometer. For a 100 mL urine <b>sample,</b> recoveries <b>of</b> the isotopes of Plutonium are> 85 % and the recovery for each individual sample may be traced using a 236 Pu tracer solution. The lower limit of detection (LLD) for a two hour count is 0. 04 Bq/L. For a person exposed to ICRP Class S airborne 239 Pu with an Activity Median Aerodynamic Diameter (AMAD) of approximately 5 microns {{two hours before the}} sample was taken, this LLD corresponds to an intake of 0. 012 MBq, and a committed effective dose equivalent of 200 mSv...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Free {{prescription}} drug samples are used widely in the United States. We sought to examine characteristics <b>of</b> free drug <b>sample</b> recipients nationwide. Methods. We analyzed data on 32681 US residents from the 2003 Medical Ex-penditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey. Results. In 2003, 12 % of Americans {{received at least}} 1 free sample. A higher pro-portion of persons who had continuous health insurance received a free sample (12. 9 %) than did persons who were uninsured for part {{or all of the}} year (9. 9 %; P<. 001). The poorest third of respondents were less likely to receive free samples than were those with incomes at 400 % of the federal poverty level or higher. After we con-trolled for demographic factors, we found that neither insurance status nor income were predictors <b>of</b> the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> drug <b>samples.</b> Persons who were uninsured {{all or part of the}} year were no more likely to receive free samples (odds ratio [OR]= 0. 98; 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 0. 087, 1. 11) than those who were continuously insured. Conclusions. Poor and uninsured Americans are less likely than wealthy or in-sured Americans to receive free drug samples. Our findings suggest that free drug samples serve as a marketing tool, not as a safety net. (Am J Public Health...|$|R
40|$|This {{automated}} enzymatic {{method for}} analysis of lac-tate in blood, adapted from a manual method, is de-signed for use with an AutoAnalyzer. Start-up time is 5 mm. After a time delay of 4 mm, 99 samples may be analyzed per hour. Recovery averaged 100. 7 % (range, 99. 6 - 101. 8 %). Reproducibility was within 1 SD (equiva-lent to 70 jmol/liter). Reagents are stable at room tem-perature for one month. The procedure has been in continuous use as an emergency test in support of emergency and critical care for three years, during which time we have done more than 10 000 determina-tions. AdditIonal Keyphrases: monitoring the severely ill #{ 149 }acute circulatory failure Expeditious availability of laboratory data for ob-jective assessment of pulmonary, circulatory, and metabolic status is now regarded as essential for com-petent management of critically ill patients in acute care units. In the USC Center for the Critically Ill, which {{has served as a}} pilot facility, 23 items of labo-ratory information are presented to the clinician within 11 mm <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> arterial blood. Routine measurements include blood pH, p C 02, P 02, hemoglobin, hematocrit, oxygen saturation, plasma osmolality, and plasma electrolytes. In addition, blood lactate is routinely measured as part of the panel in response to medical demands for this infor-mation, which indicates the adequacy of blood circu-lation (1) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method for the {{determination}} of trace amounts of simazine and atrazine in water is described. A 250 -ml volume of water is pre-concentrated by passage at a flow-rate of about 30 ml/min through a small trap containing 50 mg of graphitized carbon black (Carbopack B). After washing with 150 μl of methanol, the two herbicides are desorbed with 700 μl of dichloromethane-methanol (60 : 40, v/v). After removal, of the solvent, the extracted sample is fractionated and analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection at 220 nm. A single assay can be completed within 40 min from the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> the water <b>sample.</b> Recoveries <b>of</b> simazine and atrazine added to 250 ml of water {{at the level of}} 50 ng/l were 97. 2 and 95. 8 % and the limits of detection were 0. 07 and 0. 15 ng, respectively. At the 50 ng/l level in water, the coefficients of variation for simazine and atrazine were 3. 7 and 4. 0 % (n = 7), respectively. © 1987...|$|R
40|$|This {{procedure}} {{is to provide}} clear guidelines for disinfecting water piping. This procedure covers new domestic water pipe installations and maintenance on existing piping. II. GENERAL Heavy particulates generally contain bacteria and prevent even very high chlorine concentrations from contacting and killing such organisms. It is, therefore, essential that the procedures of this section be observed to assure that a water main and its appurtenances are thoroughly clean for the final disinfection by chlorination. Also, any connection of a new water main to the active distribution system prior to <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> satisfactory bacteriological <b>samples</b> may constitute a cross-connection. Therefore, the new main must be isolated until a bacteriological test is satisfactorily completed. The United States Environmental Protection Agency sets national standards for drinking water. To insure our compliance with these standards all work done on domestic water piping will be disinfected according to the following processes. Disinfection activities must be coordinated with {{and approved by the}} Utilities Division’s Master Water Technician. The six main steps of disinfection are; 1. Preventing contamination materials from entering the water main during storage...|$|R
