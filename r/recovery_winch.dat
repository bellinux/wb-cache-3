5000|$|The M984 wrecker is {{the only}} HEMTT variant to have been {{produced}} in A1 configuration, and this resulting in the change of recovery crane and retrieval system between A0 and A1 configurations. The current model is the M984A4. Standard equipment includes a [...] capacity two-speed <b>recovery</b> <b>winch,</b> a rear-mounted 11,340 kg capacity vehicle retrieval system, and a [...] at [...] capacity Grove materials handling crane. A [...] bare drum capacity self-recovery winch is fitted as standard on the M984.|$|E
5000|$|TPC 2007 - The {{concept of}} Special Stages Driving and Technical SS like Tyre Changing without a jack or lifting device, Vehicle <b>Recovery</b> without a <b>winch</b> was tested in TPC 2007.|$|R
50|$|A few {{transporters}} {{have been}} fitted with winches for loading, but this is uncommon. More usually a disabled vehicle is loaded {{with the assistance of}} a <b>recovery</b> tractor, either <b>winching</b> or pushing it on board.|$|R
5000|$|RTV (Road Taxed Vehicle) {{trialing}} is {{the most}} common form of trialing. As the name suggests, it is for vehicles that are road-legal (and thus required to pay vehicle excise duty). This excludes vehicles that are highly modified or specially built. RTV-class vehicles can carry a wide range of suspension modifications, as well as off-road tires (provided they are road-legal), <b>recovery</b> <b>winches,</b> raised air intakes etc. Vehicles on RTV trials are usually best described as [...] "modified from standard"—they use the standard chassis, drive-train and body that the vehicle was built with. Whilst modification is not necessarily required for an RTV trial, at the very least the vehicle would be expected to have some under-body protection such as a sump guard, differential guard and solid sills. RTV courses are intended to be non-damaging and driven at little more than a walking pace and a course properly laid out would be drivable without damage. However, the terrain usually includes steep slopes, water, side-slopes, deep ruts and other obstacles that could potentially damage a vehicle if mistakes are made or poor driving technique is used, and vehicle modifications increase the chance of success.|$|R
5000|$|At {{its most}} basic a winch {{challenge}} vehicle will be a CCV-spec machine with a front-mounted <b>recovery</b> <b>winch.</b> However, a distinct breed of vehicles adapted for Winch Challenges has evolved. The small, open-topped CCV vehicles are not well suited to carrying the often large range of equipment needed for winch recovery in difficult terrain. A larger vehicle with some form of protection from the elements is desired (the short-wheelbase Land Rover Defender, especially in [...] "Hard Top" [...] guise, is a typical and common basis for a Winch Challenge vehicle).|$|E
5000|$|BREM-D (BREM-D {{stands for}} bronirovannaya remonto-evakuatsionnaya mashina desanta - {{armoured}} maintenance-recovery vehicle of the airborne) (Ob'yekt 932) - BTR-D converted into an airborne ARV. It carries specialized {{equipment for the}} repair and recovery of BMD-1 type vehicles. This equipment includes a light collapsible crane stored {{on the roof of}} the personnel compartment, which can be traversed through 180°, a <b>recovery</b> <b>winch,</b> a combination spade and dozer blade, a generator, towing equipment, electric welding system, tools and ready use spares. One of the 7.62 mm bow PKT tank machine guns was eliminated. This entered service in 1989 in very small numbers.|$|E
50|$|Battery {{isolators}} {{are commonly}} used on recreational vehicles, boats, utility vehicles, airplanes, and large trucks where one battery is dedicated to starting and running the engine and another battery or batteries run accessory loads (e.g., winches, radar, instruments, etc.). A battery isolator helps {{to ensure that the}} starting battery has sufficient power to start the engine and recharge the batteries if, for example, loads on the auxiliary battery (e.g., refrigerator or navigation lights) cause it to be drained, or if an auxiliary battery fails. Isolators are also used in vehicles with large, high-power car stereos and off road vehicles to accommodate high current loads such as a <b>recovery</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The M4 Sherman's basic chassis {{was used}} for all the sundry roles of a modern {{mechanized}} force: roughly 50,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included M32 and M74 [...] "tow truck"-style <b>recovery</b> tanks with <b>winches,</b> booms, and an 81 mm mortar for smoke screens; M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) artillery prime movers; M7B1, M12, M40, and M43 self-propelled artillery; and the M10 and M36 tank destroyers.|$|R

50|$|The British Army intends {{upgrading}} its Warriors {{to extend}} their service life to 2025. The Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (WCSP) will involve upgrading 380 of its Warriors with the Warrior Modular Protection System (WMPS) and Warrior Enhanced Electronic Architecture (WEEA). Within that group, 245 vehicles will also be fitted with a new turret and weapon system under the Warrior Fightability Lethality Improvement Program (WFLIP). The remainder, which will be designated as Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicles (ABSV), will lack turrets and carry out field repair and <b>recovery</b> roles using <b>winch</b> and crane attachments.|$|R
5000|$|This {{refers to}} the {{military}} practice. For the civilian practice, see Vehicle recovery Vehicle recovery {{is a type of}} military operation conducted to extricate both wheeled and track vehicles that have become immobile due to condition of the soil, nature of terrain in general, loss of traction due to an attempt to negotiate an obstacle, having broken down, or from sustaining non-combat or combat damage. Recovery can be performed using manual or assisted methods of recovery, using ground or vehicle-mounted <b>recovery</b> equipment (mostly <b>winches</b> and cranes), with the recovery of heavier vehicles conducted using wheel and track recovery vehicles, including recovery {{with the use of the}} Fifth Wheel Towing Device or with Allied Kinetic Energy Recovery Rope (AKERR). Vehicle recovery can be performed by the vehicle itself, or by another like vehicle, and many field expedients for both recovery and repairs have been used by different armed forces since the wide introduction of vehicles into armed forces during the First World War. Special hand and arm signals are used during the vehicle recovery to guide the participants where field of view or [...] are restricted.|$|R
