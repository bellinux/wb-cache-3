50|$|A train wheel or {{rail wheel}} {{is a type}} of wheel {{specially}} designed for use on rail tracks. A rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie (UK), also called a truck (North America). Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat-treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued, using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to ensure proper wheel-rail interface. Improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre) around the outside. A rail tire is usually made from steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools. Monobloc wheels do not have encircling tires, while <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> wheels have a resilient material, such as rubber, between the wheel and tire.|$|E
40|$|The complex {{stiffness}} of resilient elements {{is an important}} parameter {{required in order to}} model vibration isolation for many applications. Measurement methods are being standardized which allow such a stiffness to be measured as a function of excitation frequency for known loading conditions. This paper describes one such method, the direct method, in which the resilient element is placed between two large blocks, the vibrations of which are measured. A number of refinements to this method are proposed here. These aspects of the method are then illustrated by using example results of measurements on a <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> pad for use in railway track. It is shown how the frequency range of the measurements can be extended and how rotational and lateral components can be separated reliably...|$|E
40|$|In {{ballasted}} railway track, {{the deterioration}} of a sleeper and ballast support usually occurs due to both regular and irregular wheel/rail interactions. The repeated impact of train wheels over sleepers can reduce the lifetime of a sleeper and degrade ballast. To attenuate {{the effect of the}} impact loads on concrete sleepers, the <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> seat pads are used. After a certain time in service conditions, the worn rail pads have to be replaced. Assessment of the condition of rail pads is of great importance to track engineers and {{plays an important role in}} the overall track maintenance cost. A non-destructive methodology for evaluating and monitoring the dynamic properties of the rail pads has been developed based on an instrumented hammer impact technique and an equivalent single degree-of-freedom system approximation. In this study, the sample rail pads were collected during track maintenance work on a rail network in New South Wales, Australia. The measurements were performed using an instrumented hammer in a frequency range between 0 and 1, 000 Hz. The effective mass, dynamic stiffness, and dynamic damping ratio were extracted in order to assess the current condition of the worn rail pads, thus assisting track engineers to optimise track maintenance operations...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} load {{transfer}} mechanism {{and the subsequent}} accumulation of deformation in ballast and subballast layers under repeated wheel loading is essential to design <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> tracks. Large-scale cyclic tests have been conducted on railroad ballast instrumented with optical based fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, LVDTs, pressure plates and the settlement pegs to explore the role of geogrid and its interaction with ballast in improving the track performance. Latite basalt and geogrids with different aperture sizes {{were used for the}} investigations. The laboratory experimental results indicate that the geogrid inclusions enhance track performance by arresting the lateral spreading of ballast and thereby significantly reducing the extent of its vertical settlement. In contrast, the reinforcement of ballast with geogrid has only a marginal effect on reducing the settlement in the subballast layer. The results also show that geogrid minimises the amount of particle breakage, the effectiveness of which is governed by its placement position, with lowest breakage occurring when the geogrid is placed at a location 130 mm above the subballast. In addition, geogrids also reduce the extent of vertical stress in the subgrade soil. The laboratory test results establish beyond doubt the effectiveness of FBG sensing system in capturing the ballast movement under cyclic loading...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on track}} {{stiffness}} and wheel–rail contact forces measured in a demonstrator turnout (switch & crossing, S&C), a viscously damped track model for simulation of vehicle dynamics is developed and validated. Track stiffness at nominal wheel loads, {{in the frequency}} range up to 20 Hz, was measured using a rolling stiffness measurement vehicle (RSMV). Vertical and lateral contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheelset mounted in a freight car featuring Y 25 bogies. The measurements were performed for traffic both in the through and diverging routes, and in the facing and trailing moves. The full set of test runs was repeated with different types of rail pad to investigate the influence of track stiffness on contact forces. It is concluded that wheel–rail impact loads at the crossing can be reduced by using more <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> pads. The track model is a mass-spring-damper model that is moving with each wheelset in the vehicle model. Reasonable agreement between simulated and measured vertical contact forces at the crossing can be obtained when using a track model with one vertical degree of freedom (dof) per rail, each with neglected inertia, coupled to one track mass with one vertical and one rotational dof. This model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay in dynamic track stiffness at low frequencies, {{as measured by the}} RSMV, and remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{repeated}} {{impact of}} train wheels over sleepers {{can reduce the}} lifetime of a sleeper and degrade ballast. In more extreme cases {{it can lead to}} the breakdown of the concrete sleeper. Concrete sleepers are rigid compared to steel and wooden sleepers and therefore it is necessary to provide impact attenuation to prevent premature breakdown of the concrete. One of the measures employed to attenuate the effect of the impact loads on concrete sleepers has been the use of the <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> seat pads. Numerous analytical and numerical models have been formulated to investigate the dynamic behaviour of railway track substructures. All models require careful selection of the track component properties to satisfactorily represent track vibration response. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic properties of the rail pads. At the University of Wollongong, an instrumented hammer was used to excite an equivalent single degree-of-freedom system (SDOF), incorporating a rail pad as a resilient element, to determine the dynamic properties using methods of modal analysis. The analytical SDOF dynamic model was applied to best fit the experimental modal measurements that were performed in a frequency range of 0 - 500 Hz. The curve fitting gives such dynamic parameters as the effective mass, dynamic stiffness, and dynamic damping constant, all of which are required for numerical modelling of a railway track...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulation}} of dynamic interaction between a railway vehicle and a turnout (switch and crossing, S&C) is validated versus field measurements. In particular, the implementation {{and accuracy of}} viscously damped track models with different complexities are assessed. The validation data come from full-scale field measurements of dynamic track stiffness and wheel-rail contact forces in a demonstrator turnout that was installed {{as part of the}} INNOTRACK project with funding from the European Union Sixth Framework Programme. Vertical track stiffness at nominal wheel loads, in the frequency range up to 20 Hz, was measured using a rolling stiffness measurement vehicle (RSMV). Vertical and lateral wheel-rail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheel set mounted in a freight car featuring Y 25 bogies. The measurements were performed for traffic in both the through and diverging routes, and in the facing and trailing moves. The full set of test runs was repeated with different types of rail pad to investigate the influence of rail pad stiffness on track stiffness and contact forces. It is concluded that impact loads on the crossing can be reduced by using more <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> pads. To allow for vehicle dynamics simulations at low computational cost, the track models are discretised space-variant mass-spring-damper models that are moving with each wheel set of the vehicle model. Acceptable agreement between simulated and measured vertical contact forces at the crossing can be obtained when the standard GENSYS track model is extended with one ballast/subgrade mass under each rail. This model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay in dynamic track stiffness at low frequencies, as measured by the RSMV, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{noise level}} as trains travel over bridges is, in many situations, {{a source of}} disturbance for nearby residents. As well as the rolling noise radiated by the wheel and track, the vibration generated at the wheel-rail interface also propagates into the bridge structure and the vibration response {{of the components of}} the bridge is an important extra source of noise compared with tracks at-grade. Vibration isolation of the bridge structure from the rail is therefore used to reduce noise. This often takes the form of <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners. Two different elastic rail fastenings were therefore tested on a twin track bridge by the Swiss Railways (SBB). The bridge over the river Emme at Burgdorf, is a ballastless steel bridge with timbers between the rail fastener and the bridge. Hanging steel sleepers have been added between the wooden sleepers on which the track is supported to form a continuous deck under the track. To find the best elasticity for the rail fasteners, predictions of the bridge noise were made using the Norbert model. Measurements were made on the bridge with the track in its original state to provide parameters for the model. These included rail and sleeper vibration as well as pass-by noise from service passenger and freight trains at different speeds. For the two tracks, elastic rail fasteners from two suppliers were installed. The measurement after installation showed a clear noise reduction for the frequency range from 80 to 400 Hz of about 10 dB. However the reduction in A-weighted overall noise level is in the range of 2 to 4 dB, as indicated by the model. The results show similar reduction for both systems...|$|E
40|$|The turnout (Switch & Crossing) {{is a vital}} {{component}} in railway networks as it provides flexibility to traffic operation by allowing trains to switch between tracks. The flexibility comes at a cost as the common lack of a transition curve in the diverging route together with the variation and discontinuities in rail profiles result in higher rail degradation rates than in regular track. In this thesis, dynamic interaction between vehicle and turnout is studied using numerical tools for multibody dynamics with focus on laying a foundation for robust optimization of turnout geometry. Considering a stochastic spread in traffic parameters, quantitative and qualitative estimates of rail profile degradation are computed. The influence of wheel profile wear on wheel–rail interaction in a turnout is studied, and it is concluded that equivalent conicity is the wheel profile characterization parameter with the best correlation to rail damage of the investigated parameters. In addition, the influence of hollow worn wheels on rail damage is investigated and {{it is found that}} such wheel profiles display a significantly different and potentially more harmful running behaviour at the crossing. The influence of wheel–rail friction coefficient is studied and it is shown that friction correlates strongly to lateral contact forces and wear in the diverging route. Wheelset steering, considering the turnout specific configuration of rail profiles and the presence of check rails, is discussed. One of the track models studied is a discretized mass-spring-damper model with nine degrees-of-freedom. This track model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay at low frequencies found in measurements of dynamic track stiffness, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies. Good agreement between the simulation model and field measurement data has been observed. It is concluded that the use of more <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> pads can reduce wheel–rail impact loads during the crossing transition...|$|E
40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A smooth wheel transition between wing rail and crossing nose is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of crossing nose and wing rails) and the use of more <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> pads. Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, rail material, resilient layers) are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing panel maintenance can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Elastomers are {{viscoelastic}} polymers {{with low}} Young's modulus and high failure strain {{that are used}} in many c ivil e ngineering applications, including bridge bearings, seismic isolators for buil dings and <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> wheels. Their constitutive behaviour i s characterized by a nonlinear stress - strain relation with an extensibility limit. This contrasts with materials that have instead a limit on the tensile stresses, such as mild steel. This MSc thesis is concerned with the numerical modeling of elastomers. T his involves dealing with a medium with two phases: a constrained region, wher e the particles have reached their maxi mum allowable deformation, and a free region, where the inextensibility constraint is still inactive. Moreover, one can think of an interf ace splitting the two phases of the medium. If the focus is put in obtaining methods to locate and evolve such interface, then a two phase medium with a moving interface is considered. From the mathematical point of view, this is a constrained minimization problem. One of the strategies to solve it is to turn the minimization problem into a shape equilibrium one. This approach has b een successfully employed for an interface location problem in small strains and serves as the starting point of this work. T hu s, t he main purpose of this thesis is to extend this formulation to a large strains interface locating and evolving scenario. A first analysis of the problem reveals two sources of nonlinearity : the inextensibility constraint and the kinematics in large st rains. A simple but thorough one - dimensional study of the problem is then developed to find methods to sort out both nonlinearities. Following this, explicit iterative schemes to locate and evolve one or multiple interfaces are straightforwardly obtained i n 1 D linear elasticity. However, the same ideas applied to a simple St. Venant - Kirchhoff hyperelasticity model, evidences that even very simple 1 D problems become rather complex and cannot be solved as directly and explicit as before. Numerical examples are provided throughout this analysis and they are also useful to conclude that both locating and evolving the interface can be essentially seen as the same problem, but with different driving effects. After that, an extension of the one - dimensional schemes t o two or more dimensions is explored. Although the same ideas can be applied, more sophisticated modeling tools are required, namely, the X - FEM and Level set methods, the shape sensitivity analysis and the Arbitrary Lagrangian - Eulerian methods. A complemen tary numerical implementation of the pr oposed strategy is to show its computational benefits. In particular, a combination of the three previous techniques shall make unnecessary a stepwise update of the Level set. T he work presented here may not be limite d to this particular case and be r elevant to other engineering problems involving moving interfaces and boundaries, such as plasticity analysis or the saturation of a porous medium...|$|E
40|$|Pandrol Rail Fastenings Limited are a {{designer}} and manufacturer of railway rail-fastening systems. As an organisation {{they have the}} capability to reduce the noise impact of bridges using resilient track components. They also have a commercial interest in providing such technology. Knowledge of the processes behind bridge noise is important to Pandrol in two ways; to aid the engineers within the organisation in the design of fastening systems and to demonstrate a state-of-the-art understanding of the problem of railway bridge noise to customers, as this will aid in the sale of Pandrol products. The fitting of new rail components to an existing track form, or failure to meet noise regulations with a new track form, can be costly. It is important to be able to predict accurately the effectiveness of noise reduction techniques. Currently, Pandrol’s knowledge of the problem consists almost entirely of experience gained and data gathered while working on existing bridge projects. To expand their knowledge base, Pandrol perform noise and vibration measurements on railway bridges and viaducts and then use the measured data to predict the performance of their systems on other bridges. This completely empirical approach to predicting bridge noise is both costly and situation specific results cannot be provided before the installation of the fastening system. ii Another approach to predicting bridge noise is through the application of analytical models. Limited analytical modelling in the context of bridge noise is currently conducted within the organisation. For these reasons, Pandrol are sponsoring research into bridge noise in the form of this EngD project. Here an existing rapid calculation approach is identified that relies less on the exact geometry of the bridge and more on its general characteristics. In this approach an analytical model of the track is coupled to a statistical energy analysis (SEA) model of the bridge. This approach forms a suitable basis from which to develop a better model here by concentrating on its weaknesses. A mid-frequency calculation for the power input to the bridge via a resilient track system has been developed by modelling the track-bridge system as two finite Timoshenko beams continuously connected by a resilient layer. This has resulted in a power input calculation which includes the important effects of coupling between the rail and bridge and the resonance effects of the finite length of a bridge. In addition, a detailed study of the frequency characteristics of deep I-section beams has been performed using Finite Element, Boundary Element and Dynamic stiffness models. It is shown that, at high frequencies, the behaviour of the beam is characterised by in-plane motion of the beam web and bending motion in the flange. This knowledge has resulted in an improved calculation for the mobility of a bridge at high frequencies. The above improvements are included in an improved model for use by Pandrol in their general activities. Data from real bridges is compared to predictions from the improved model in order to validate different aspects of the model. The model is then used to study the effect on noise of varying many bridge design parameters. It is shown that the parameter that has most influence on the noise performance of a bridge is the dynamic stiffness of the <b>resilient</b> <b>rail</b> fastening system. Additionally it is demonstrated that for a given bridge and noise receiver location, an optimum fastener stiffness exists where the noise radiated by the bridge and track is at a minimum.
