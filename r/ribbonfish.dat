40|$|The <b>ribbonfishes,</b> {{also known}} as hair-tail or cutlass, form a major and {{abundant}} fishery resource among the marine pelagic finfishes of the Indian seas. They belong to the family Trichiuridae and are characterised by elongate, compressed and ribbon-like body; prominent canine-like teeth; lack of caudal fin and the silvery colouration. They are essentially marine, but occur in the estuaries too. They have a distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions and in India they are distributed all along the coast with abundance in the northwest and central east coasts. In India, three decades ago, they were low priced fishes and hence were preferred by the poor. Large fishes were consumed fresh and transported even to the interior markets, but the smaller ones, {{in excess of the}} local requirements, were usually sun-dried on the beach. Later the marketing scenario of <b>ribbonfishes</b> underwent a drastic change when it gained a position in the export market. Currently large quantities of <b>ribbonfishes</b> are exported in the frozen form to China, Japan and other southeast Asian countries. During the year 1999 - 2000 (April-March), frozen <b>ribbonfishes</b> contributed up to 18...|$|R

50|$|Trachipterus arcticus is {{a species}} of <b>ribbonfish</b> found {{predominantly}} in the North Atlantic Ocean, with one report from the Mediterranean Sea.

50|$|Lampriformes is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. Members are collectively called lamprids (which is more {{properly}} used for the Lampridae) or lampriforms, and unite such open-ocean and partially deep-sea Teleostei as the crestfishes, oarfish, opahs, and <b>ribbonfishes.</b> A synonym for this order is Allotriognathi, while an often-seen, but apparently incorrect, spelling variant is Lampridiformes. They contain seven extant families which are generally small but highly distinct, and a mere 12 lampriform genera with some 20 species altogether are recognized.|$|R

40|$|The <b>ribbonfishes</b> {{belonging}} to the family Trichiuridae is a major fishery resource of India. Three species under the genus Trichiurus namely T. lepturus, T. auriga and T. gangeticus are reported from India. Of these, the largehead hairtail T. lepturus commonly grows to 100 cm in size and has high market demand. T. auriga (Pearly hairtail) is a small sized species (maximum size < 40 cm) and reported to occur in huge shoals in the upper slope regions. With little market demand for consumption due to its small size, whenever caught they {{are most likely to}} be diverted to fish meal plants. There is wide spread concern on the large scale capture of juvenile fishes which adversely affects the resources...|$|R

50|$|Squid and euphausiids (krill) make up {{the bulk}} of the opah diet; small fish are also taken. Pop-up archival {{transmitting}} tagging operations have indicated, aside from humans, large pelagic sharks, such as great white sharks and mako sharks, are primary predators of opah. The tetraphyllidean tapeworm Pelichnibothrium speciosum has been found in L. guttatus, which may be an intermediate or paratenic host.The planktonic opah larvae initially resemble those of certain <b>ribbonfishes</b> (Trachipteridae), but are distinguished by the former's lack of dorsal and pelvic fin ornamentation. The slender hatchlings later undergo a marked and rapid transformation from a slender to deep-bodied form; this transformation is complete by 10.6 mm standard length in L. guttatus. Opahs are believed to have a low population resilience.|$|R
40|$|Trichiurus lepturus samples landed by trawl boats at Mangalore Fishing Harbour were {{collected}} regularly from January, 2008 to December, 2012. Stomach of 4, 581 <b>ribbonfishes</b> {{ranging in size}} from 40 to 110 cm total length (TL) were analysed to study their feeding habits.

Acetes sp., Stolephorous devisi, Loligo sp., Saurida tumbil, Sardinella longiceps and Decapterus russelli were the major food items. Juveniles of T. lepturus and unidentified fish as well as shrimp remains were found occasionally in the gut indicating cannibalistic behaviour. Higher feeding intensity in terms of stomach fullness index (SFI) was observed during April, June and October and lower values during November and December.

40|$|Maharashtra with a {{coast line}} of 720 km ranks second among the {{maritime}} states of India {{in respect of}} marine fish landings. There are 153 landing centres situated in the five coastal districts namely, Thane, Greater Bombay, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The state, which has a continental shelf of 89, 096 square kilometers, offers rich potential for marine fisheries. The areas of potential fishing grounds in 0 - 50 m depth and 50 - 200 m depth are 2. 55 and 10. 48 million hectares respectively. Fishing takes places almost throughout the year except during the monsoon period. Several types of boats, mechanised and nonmechanised, using different gears land their catches. The exploited marine fish landings in the state are estimated by a well-planned multi-stage startified sampling design followed by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Bombay duck, non-penaeid prawns, penaeid prawns, croakers, pomfrets, elasmobranchs, perches and <b>ribbonfishes</b> {{are some of the}} commercially important groups which form the bulk of landings. From the early sixties the marine fish landings in the state have been steadily progressing mainly owing to the increase in the mechanised fishing. This increase continued up to midseventies and thereafter the landings have more or less stabilised...|$|R

50|$|The <b>ribbonfish</b> are any lampriform fishes in {{the family}} Trachipteridae. These pelagic fish are named for their slim, ribbon-like appearance. They are rarely seen alive, as they {{typically}} live in deep waters, though are not bottom feeders.|$|E

40|$|Marine fish {{production}} from capture fisheries in India {{has increased by}} about six fold during the past six decades. Export earnings from the marine sector crossed 12, 000 crores in 2010 - 11 and gross revenue through marine fish landings {{at the point of}} first sales was about 20, 000 crores. Marine products are now exported from India to nearly 100 countries. Monitoring the harvest of different marine fishery resources is very much essential for planning and implementing policies for sustained {{production from}} the sea. The dynamic changes in the landings of marine fishery resources over the last six decades were examined after classifying them into 26 different resource groups. Decadal averages of landings of different resource groups were compared using Student’s t test and coefficient of variation was worked out for each decade. Present status of each resource group was examined separately based on a simple criterion. Out of the 26 groups examined, 18 were found to be under the ‘abundant class, 5 under ‘less abundant’ class and one each under ‘declining’, ‘depleted’ and ‘collapsed’ classes. Elasmobranchs, threadfins, <b>ribbonfishes,</b> mullets and flatfishes are the five resource groups falling under ‘less abundant’ class. White fish falls under ‘declining’ class, flying fishes under ‘depleted’ class and unicorn cod under ‘collapsed’ class. All the other groups fall under the ‘abundant’ class indicating that most of the resources (73...|$|R
50|$|They {{are readily}} {{recognized}} by their anatomy — a long, compressed, tape-like body, short head, narrow mouth and feeble teeth. A high dorsal fin occupies the whole {{length of the}} back; an anal fin is absent, and the caudal fin, if present, consists of two fascicles of rays of which the upper is prolonged and directed upwards. The pectoral fins are small, the pelvic fins composed of several rays, or of one long ray only. They have heavy spines along their lateral lines, and numerous lumps in the skin. <b>Ribbonfish</b> possess all the characteristics of fish living at very great depths. Their fins especially, and the membrane connecting them, are of a very delicate and brittle structure. In young <b>ribbonfish,</b> some of the fin-rays are prolonged to an extraordinary degree, and sometimes provided with appendages.|$|E
