50|$|The {{original}} Latrobe Football Club {{was one of}} {{the most}} successful and influential clubs in the Brisbane football competitions, winning nine first grade premierships between the 1920s and 1970, behind only Lions FC (11 premierships between the 1950s and the 2000s) and Dinmore Bush Rats (10 premierships between the 1890s and 1960s), as well as numerous cup competitions (see History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland). The club is most likely named for the nearby Paddington <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>subdivision,</b> the 'Latrobe Estate', carried out in the late 1870s. This subdivision occurred after the closure of the Paddington Cemetery (now the site of Suncorp Stadium) in 1875, and the creation of Given/Latrobe Terraces through that site. The estate was, presumably, named for the former Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria Charles La Trobe, who died in 1875.|$|E

The Boston, Massachusetts architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns designed the building. Motor Square Garden soon failed as a retail space, but in 1915 the new Pittsburgh Automobile Association bought it as a site for its auto shows. In the 1920s, it came into use as a sports venue, especially for boxing, and was used intermittently as the home court of the University of Pittsburgh's basketball team until the opening of Pitt Pavilion inside Pitt Stadium in 1925.

These Upper Miocene shales have been variously mapped as belonging wholly or in part to the Pico, Fernando, Puente, Monterey, and Modelo formations, and it was with the hope of aiding in the clarification of this complex that the present investigation was undertaken. The Upper Miocene is well exposed in many places in Southern California, but seldom are the relations to the underlying formations so well shown as along the North flank of the Santa Monica Mountains in the vicinity of Girard, near the western border of Los Angeles County.
