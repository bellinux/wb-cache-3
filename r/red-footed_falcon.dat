500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon,</b> American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

50|$|The <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco vespertinus), {{formerly}} western <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon,</b> is a bird of prey. It {{belongs to}} the family Falconidae, the falcons. This bird is found in eastern Europe and Asia although its numbers are dwindling rapidly due to habitat loss and hunting. It is migratory, wintering in Africa.

40|$|We studied hunting {{success of}} 13 male <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> by radio-telemetry {{in the second}} phase of chick rearing. We coded 484 hunting events, and the success {{measured}} in captured prey biomass/minute was exceedingly high in corn fields. This is mainly caused {{by the fact that the}} effectiveness of hunting for vertebrate prey was high on the harvested stubble fields. Moreover the observed falcons hunted for insects in these stubble field and alfalfa fields most successfully. In the studied habitat the chick feeding period of <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> coincide with the harvest of cereal fields, and the suddenly created lower vegetation cover increases temporarily the accessibility of prey items...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the louse species harboured by <b>Red-footed</b> and Amur <b>Falcons</b> despite the fact that various life-history traits of these hosts make them good model species to study host-parasite interactions. We {{collected}} lice samples from fully grown Amur (n= 20) and <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> (n= 59), and from nestlings of <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> (n= 179) in four countries: Hungary, India, Italy and South Africa. We identified 3 louse species on both host species, namely Degeeriella rufa, Colpocephalum subzerafae and Laembothrion tinnunculi. The latter species has never been found on these hosts. Comparing population parameters of lice between hosts we found significantly higher prevalence levels of D. rufa and C. subzerafae on Amur <b>Falcons.</b> Adult <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> had higher D. rufa prevalence compared to C. subzerafae. For the first time we also show inter-annual shift in prevalence and intensity levels of these species on Red-footed Falcons; in 2012 on adult hosts C. subzerafae had higher intensity levels than D. rufa, however in 2014 D. rufa had significantly higher intensity compared to C. subzerafae. In case of nestlings both louse species had significantly higher preva lence levels than in 2014. The exact causes of such inter-annual shifts are yet to be understood...|$|R

40|$|Selecting a {{suitable}} breeding habitats and a nest-site within are crucial decisions birds have to make. Free ranging solitary Kestrels may use public information derived from leftover pellets and prey remnants from previous conspecific breeding attempts to assess location quality. However, this information may also indicate potentially higher nestling ectoparasite load. In colonies where habitat quality is similar for all available nests, the only information of previous nest usage may reflect expected future parasite pressure. In {{this study we}} explored whether Kestrels, <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> and Jackdaws rely on nest-material consisting of pellets and prey remnants when choosing a nest in a multi species artificial colony system. We also assessed potential effects of these decisions on reproductive success. We randomly selected and cleaned half (n= 102) of all available nest-boxes {{in each of the}} studied 4 colonies before the breeding season. We then monitored occupancy, egg-laying date, hatching and fledging success. In case of <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons,</b> we also acquired adult age and nestling condition data. Our results show that Kestrels were more likely to breed in uncleaned nest-boxes, however, eggs laid in cleaned nest-boxes were more likely to develop into fledged nestlings. There was a weak indication that lower hatching rate was responsible for this effect, rather than increased parasite load. Nest box cleaning had no effect on measured variables in case of <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> and Jackdaws. Colonial breeding of Kestrels, the only species to react to nest-box cleaning, is rare and is probably a consequence of extreme nest-site shortage in our study site. We conclude that Kestrels are not adapted to interpret the information carried by pellets and prey-remnants in colony nest-boxes...|$|R
50|$|Future {{conservation}} efforts proposed include continuing to conduct regular surveys throughout the area. Figuring out additional {{ways to help}} the species is crucial. <b>Red-footed</b> <b>falcons</b> are known to use artificial colonies, therefore, {{they can be a}} useful mid-term conservation tool to prevent their population from fragmenting. Also, there may be ways to help out the species by changing farming and land-use practices in Central Europe. Surveys in Bulgaria indicated that there is a decline in available breeding sites for the birds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> {{tends to}} reside in typical steppe type {{habitats}} ranging from Eastern Europe to Lake Baikal in Central Asia. This is a diurnal bird of open country with some trees, often near water. They tend to migrate far south for the winter, including in areas of Africa. The <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> tends not {{to make their own}} nests, but tend to use abandoned nests made by other birds such as the hooded crow, rook, and magpie. The nests that are chosen tend to be higher than the majority of the other nests; the nests tend to be 13 - 20 m above the ground and within 3 - 4 m of the tree top. Most of these nests tend to be near the edge of woods, avoiding nesting on solitary trees. Breeding takes place in these abandoned nests; usually breeding occurs colonially in rookeries because these birds tend to stay together in groups. This is also important because fledging success tends to be higher when these birds are in colonies and are not solitary. The <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> relies on the nests built by rooks, and with a decline in population of rooks, the number of suitable rookeries for colonial nesting has also decreased, leading humans to ideas of conservation.|$|E
50|$|Females {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to identify as they share a pattern common to many falcons, but are distinctive in having an orange eye-ring, a red cere and reddish orange feet. Juveniles can be confused only with those of the <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon,</b> but lack the buffy underwing coverts.|$|E
50|$|The Amur falcon (Falco amurensis) {{is a small}} raptor of the falcon family. It breeds in {{south-eastern}} Siberia and Northern China before migrating {{in large}} flocks across India and over the Arabian Sea to winter in Southern Africa. It was earlier treated as a subspecies of the <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco vespertinus) and known as the eastern <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon.</b> Males are dark grey with reddish brown thighs and undertail coverts; reddish orange eye-ring, cere, and feet. Females are duller above, with dark scaly markings on white underparts, an orange eye ring, cere, and legs. Only a pale wash of rufous is visible on their thighs and undertail coverts. Their diet consists mainly of insects, such as termites; during migration over the sea, they are thought to feed on migrating dragonflies. The route that they take from Africa back to their breeding grounds is as yet unclear.|$|E
50|$|The Atanasovo Lake {{is one of}} two salt-water {{lakes in}} the Black Sea region and {{contains}} rare and representative examples of wetland habitats. It is a hot spot for biodiversity, with many Red-Listed species of plants and animals. It is a well-known bottleneck site for migratory birds, with around 60,000 raptors and 240,000 storks, pelicans and cranes passing over the site and often landing in large numbers for staging. The highest numbers in Europe of migrating White Pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus) and <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons</b> (Falco vespertinus) have been recorded here.|$|R
40|$|Active {{conservation}} measures often entail supplementing scarce resources, {{such as food}} or nesting site to high conservation value species. We hypothesized that adequate nest material in reasonable distance is a scarce resource for Rooks breeding in open grassland habitats of Hungary. Here we show that Rooks willingly utilize large quantities of provided excess nesting material, and that this procedure may alter nest composition, and {{increase the number of}} successful pairs. Our results show that while nest height remains constant, twig diameter is significantly larger, the number of twigs used per nest is presumably smaller, and that the ratio of nests with fledglings is higher in a rookery where supplementary twigs were present. Providing twigs and branches in the vicinity of rookeries may serve as an active conservation measure {{to increase the number of}} nests in a rookery, and thus the potential number of nesting possibilities for <b>Red-footed</b> <b>Falcons...</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of this plan's effectiveness and also little evidence on recent population trends and distribution, from Northern Serbia, where 5-10% of the total European Union population is thought to breed. The researchers' main focus was on understanding the relationship between landscape scale habitat variables and <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> presence. The researchers found that the increase of natural grasslands had {{a positive effect on}} nest site presence while the increase of broad-leaved forests negatively influenced the probability of nest site presence. Their modelling approach proved successful in describing the landscape scale habitat composition of <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> breeding sites in the modelling area. Natural grasslands have a considerable impact on the probability of nest site presence. Therefore, locating their breeding sites or creating breeding sites by providing artificial colonies with the aid of our results has additional conservation and socio-economic benefits for wildlife and human population.|$|E

Their relationship to the peregrine falcon group and the kestrels is not well resolved, however; taxa such as the <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> appear in some respects intermediate between the kestrels and the typical hobbies.|$|E
50|$|Males are {{characteristically}} dark sooty grey above with rufous {{thighs and}} vent. In flight, the wing lining is white, contrasting {{with the dark}} wing feathers. Adult males of the closely related <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> have a dark grey wing lining. In Africa, males can be confused with melanistic Gabar goshawks, but the chestnut on the vent is distinctive. Also, {{there may be some}} superficial resemblance to the sooty falcon and the grey kestrel, but those two species both have yellow feet and cere. The wings are long as in most falcons (with a span of 63-71 cm) and at rest the wing tip reaches or extends just beyond the tail-tip.|$|E
50|$|The global {{population}} of <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> {{is estimated to}} be between 300,000-800,000 individuals, with 26,000 to 39,000 pairs in Europe. Most of the population breeds in the steppe grasslands of Russia and central Asia, although a significant amount also breeds in the Ukraine, Romania and Hungary. In 2005, the population in Hungary was estimated to be between 700 to 800, showing a steady decline. Red-footed falcons can be considered as a classic umbrella species because they affect other species living in the community. They play a popular role in the Natura 2000 designation process. Therefore, locating their breeding sites or creating breeding sites by providing artificial colonies has additional conservation and socio-economic benefits for both wildlife and the local human population.|$|E
50|$|The falcons and {{caracaras}} {{are generally}} solitary breeders, although around 10% of species are colonial, {{for example the}} <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon.</b> They are monogamous, although some caracaras may also employ alloparenting strategies, where younger birds help adults (usually their parents) in raising the next brood of chicks. Nests are generally not built (except by the caracaras), but are co opted from other birds, for example pygmy falcons nest in the nests of weavers, or on the ledges on cliffs. Around 2-4 eggs are laid, and mostly incubated by the female. Incubation times vary from species to species and are correlated with body size, lasting 28 days in smaller species and up to 35 days in larger species. Chicks fledge after 28-49 days, again varying with size.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the village}} Melenci (Voivodina, {{northern}} Serbia) there were 22 <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> nests in 1991 in which offspring had been successfully brought up. The contents of four nests were checked daily {{from the start}} of incubation until the fledglings left the nests. Breeding success did not differ between the group of four nests disturbed by inspections and the remaining 18. Despite the fact that the ratio of parent bird presence (both, only female, only male) and absence differed in the comparison of the four nests, <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> parents were usually found in the close surroundings, i.e. they attended their nest. The attendance of the birds to the nests differed between the sexes during incubation as well as hatching and the nestling period, which fact can be interpreted as a difference between the roles of females and males. In 59% of the cases it was the female, while in 41% it was the male bird that was sitting on the eggs. At the time of hatching it was mostly the female (female 86%, male 14%) that was present in the nest, while after hatching it was only the female. Later on the adult birds usually took off from the branch supporting the nest, from neighbouring trees, or from abandoned rook (Corvus frugilegus) nests, rather than from the nest itself. Females participated more times in the defence of the nest than males, yet the ratios of the studied types of behaviour (alarm, repellence, attack) did not differ between the sexes. However, significant difference appeared to be present between four nests when the distribution frequency of the three behaviour types was looked at. The distribution of the reaction types of the parent birds to disturbance was significantly different in the periods of incubation, hatching and nestling, respectively. As nesting proceeded and parental investment grew, the number of repellences and attacks increased proportionally.|$|E
50|$|Researchers used {{a species}} {{distribution}} model for red-footed falcons. This model {{can play a}} crucial role in identifying key nesting sites for endangered species. According to the researchers, the <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> is officially listed as near-threatened, due to the drastic breeding population decline of the past decades. Red-footed falcons breed in colonies and in solitary pairs. They do not build a nest. In Hungary, the landscape scale distribution of rookeries remained stable, while the density and size of rookeries decreased and their location shifted to human settlements. Similar patterns were reported from other European countries. The reasons of rookery declines can be attributed to a large-scale persecution in the mid-80s resulting in a 90% population crash. Because of this, most potential breeding colonies for red-footed falcons disappeared, causing a decline in the number of breeding pairs. Conservation projects have established artificial nest box colonies to rectify this problem.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> is a {{bird of prey}} with a diet {{consisting}} {{of a variety of}} insects, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds, such as great green bush-crickets, spadefoot toads, sand lizards, the common vole and bird nestlings, respectively. This bird's distinctive method of hunting is shared by the common kestrel. It regularly hovers, searching the ground below, then makes a short steep dive towards the target. When feeding their nestlings, the youngest nestlings receive the most food more frequently and more regularly. Chicks that are between 0 and 3 weeks old will get fed bigger prey like toads, lizards, bird nestlings, and great green bush-crickets, while nestlings over that age will get fed less frequently and with less variety. Young nestlings's diet consists mostly of Orthoptera and beetles with a some vertebrates, while older nestlings' diet mostly consists of Orthoptera and almost never receives vertebrates.|$|E

50|$|The {{survey of}} {{population}} size {{and distribution of}} red-footed falcons proceeded in June-July 2000 and 2001 respectively, {{ten years after the}} first census (1990 and 1991). Data of only those nests were processed in which there was breeding. Breeding Success was calculated from the number of offspring per reproductive female. During the survey in Voivodina in 1990-1991 there were 308 and 124 pairs, respectively, whereas ten years later, in the year 2000 there were 116, and in 2001 only 61 pairs of red-footed falcons. Even if the marked fluctuations observed are not considered, the <b>red-footed</b> <b>falcon</b> population breeding in Voivodina shows a declining tendency. The south-western margin of the distribution area has moved towards the northeast by about 50-70 kilometres. More than 90% of the nesting sites, including the larger nesting colonies, are found in the Banat region, i.e. east of the Tisa River. More than 90% of the red-footed falcons continue to nest in rook colonies. No significant change has occurred in their breeding success.|$|E
