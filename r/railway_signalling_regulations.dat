Signal device {{management}} {{is an important}} mission to ensure the safe operation of the railway, {{and it is a}} definite orientation for the future development to apply the Internet of Things technology in <b>railway</b> <b>signal</b> device management. This article introduces the relevant concepts of the Internet of Things, and analyzes the current information construction level of China's <b>railway</b> <b>signal</b> device management. Based on actual requirements on <b>railway</b> <b>signal</b> device management, it gives the implementation plans of management platform based on the Internet of Things technology and as well analyzes the key technology.

40|$|As {{existing}} {{electrical and}} mechanical <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> systems are replaced with systems using computer technologies, system capability has improved {{in such a}} way that the system is intellectualised. The <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> system is a vital system that is directly connected to massive life damage or economical loss due to its features. Therefore strict safety activity and assessment methodology are be required. There are several international standards for <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> system safety activity requirements, which are required to demonstrate those safety activities. Signalling system safety assessment is performed by analysing and evaluating the system safety activity process and its results. In this paper, we suggest <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> system safety activity techniques for the <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> system safety assessment and its specific execution techniques at each activity phase. We also analyse safety assessment tasks based on suggested safety activity techniques and identify the necessary case study required to ensure the safety of assessment techniques...|$|R

40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>signaling</b> {{systems on}} {{conventional}} lines of Malaysian railway {{companies have been}} damaged from lightning, especially in 2010. Therefore, effective and economical lightning protection measures are necessary for <b>railway</b> <b>signaling</b> systems because suspended operation or train delays due to lightning damage may cause social disruption. For analyzing lightning risk and making study for countermeasures against lightning damage, must measure the lightning overvoltage on <b>railway</b> <b>signaling</b> cables, which were laid at the ground surface and overhead, and rails {{in the field to}} enable quantitative analysis of the frequency of lightning overvoltage occurrence. Moreover, we investigated the correlation of lightning overvoltage (V) on signaling cables and rails with lightning conditions, such as the strike current (I) and the strike position (distance from the measuring position). From this we deduced the correlation between the lightning overvoltage (V) and (I), expressed as a linear expression. From this correlation, the lightning risk for <b>railway</b> <b>signaling</b> systems against lightning conditions can be estimated. In addition, it is possible to calculate the possibility of lightning damage to <b>railway</b> <b>signaling</b> equipment...|$|R
