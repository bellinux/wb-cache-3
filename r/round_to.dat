5000|$|... where [...] = German grade, [...] = best {{possible}} score in foreign country's grading system, [...] = lowest passing score in foreign grading system and [...] = obtained foreign grade (to {{be converted into}} German grade). The resulting value is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the next German grade (e.g. 1.6 is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the German grade 1.7 and 2.4 is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 2.3). For resulting values between two German grades, the score is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the better grade (e.g. 2.5 is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the German grade 2.3 and 1.15 is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 1.0).|$|R

5000|$|Prices are <b>rounded</b> down <b>to</b> {{the nearest}} {{multiple}} of 5 cents for sales ending in: 1¢ & 2¢ (<b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 0¢); and, 6¢ & 7¢ (<b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 5¢).|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{competed in}} the UEFA Cup in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons and {{departed}} {{in the first and}} second <b>round</b> <b>to</b> FC Winterslag and Spartak Moscow respectively. The Heysel Stadium disaster of May 1985, during the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus resulted in UEFA, and later FIFA, imposing a 'worldwide' ban on English teams from participating in European club competitions, initially for an indefinite period. Under George Graham, Arsenal returned to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, having won the league championship a season earlier. They went out in the second <b>round</b> <b>to</b> Portuguese team Benfica in November 1991. The ban arising from the Heysel disaster had prevented Arsenal from competing in the European Cup when they won the league title two years previously, as well as preventing them from competing in the UEFA Cup on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of her grass court season, Robson played an ITF $100,000 in Surbiton, but lost in the first <b>round</b> <b>to</b> Marina Erakovic. She then played at the Nottingham WTA International, but fell to Julia Boserup in the first round. She reached {{the second round of the}} Ilkley ITF $100,000 before falling to Anna Blinkova in three sets.

5|$|Del Potro {{qualified}} {{for his first}} US Open in 2006, after being seeded ninth in the qualifying stages, where he beat Brian Vahaly, Wayne Arthurs, and Daniel Köllerer in straight sets.

He went on to qualify for his first ATP Masters Series tournament in Spain, the Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open, where he lost in the first <b>round</b> <b>to</b> Joachim Johansson. After receiving a wild card thanks to Roger Federer, he reached {{the quarterfinals of the}} 2006 Davidoff Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland; defeating lucky loser Tobias Clemens in the first round and George Bastl in the second round, before losing to the eventual runner-up Fernando González in three sets. Del Potro finished 2006 as the youngest player in the top 100 at 18 years, 2 months.|$|E
25|$|This type of rounding, {{which is}} also named <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> a {{logarithmic}} scale, is a variant of <b>Rounding</b> <b>to</b> a specified increment.

50|$|When used today, {{the units}} are often <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the nearest square meter. Thus, jutro is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 5,755 square meters and lanac is <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 7,192 square meters. When more {{precision}} is needed, katastarsko jutro (meaning cadastral jutro) is used, that equals exactly 0.5754642 hectares (5,754.642 square meters).|$|R

25|$|Rounding {{a number}} twice in {{succession}} to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as <b>rounding</b> once <b>to</b> the final precision except {{in the case of}} directed rounding. For instance <b>rounding</b> 9.46 <b>to</b> one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> integer using <b>rounding</b> half <b>to</b> even, but would give 9 when <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> integer directly. Borman and Chatfield discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.|$|R
50|$|So while <b>rounding</b> 42.605 <b>to</b> 42.61 or 42.6 is correct, <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> 43 is not.|$|R

5|$|Python {{provides}} a round function for rounding a float {{to the nearest}} integer. For tie-breaking, versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0. Python 3 uses <b>round</b> <b>to</b> even: round(1.5) is 2, round(2.5) is 2.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} then <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the nearest {{positive}} integer; a calculation less than 0.5 is <b>rounded</b> up <b>to</b> 1.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the league}} {{shortening}} the 2012 MLS SuperDraft from three <b>rounds</b> <b>to</b> two <b>rounds,</b> the Supplemental Draft was increased from three <b>rounds</b> <b>to</b> four <b>rounds.</b> Previously traded SuperDraft Round 3 picks became Supplemental Draft Round 1 picks.|$|R
50|$|In a base 10 {{logarithm}} of a normalized number, {{the result}} should be <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> the number of significant figures in the normalized number. For example, log10(3.000×104) = log10(104) + log10(3.000) ≈ 4 + 0.47712125472, should be <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> 4.4771.|$|R
