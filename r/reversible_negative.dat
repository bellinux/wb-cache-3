40|$|SummaryIn {{developing}} B cells, {{expression of}} surface immunoglobulin {{is an important}} signal to terminate recombinase activator gene (RAG) expression and V(D) J recombination. However, autoreactive antigen receptors instead promote continued gene rearrangement and receptor editing. The regulation by B cell receptor (BCR) signaling of RAG expression and editing is poorly understood. We report that in editing-competent cells BCR ligand-induced RAG mRNA expression is regulated {{at the level of}} RAG transcription, rather than mRNA stability. In immature B cells carrying innocuous receptors, RAG expression appears to be under rapidly <b>reversible</b> <b>negative</b> regulation. Studies involving transduction of a superrepressive (sr) IκBα protein indicate that NF-κB/Rel proteins promote RAG transcription. Interestingly, NFκB 1 -deficient cells overexpress RAG and undergo an exaggerated receptor editing response. Our data implicate NFκB transcription factors in the BCR-mediated regulation of RAG locus transcription. Rapidly activated NFκB pathways may facilitate prompt antigen receptor-regulated changes in RAG expression important for editing and haplotype exclusion...|$|E

The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of their thermal equilibrium between the ring-closed (spiro) and ring-opened (merocyanine) isomeric forms have been determined using UV-Vis absorption and 1 H NMR spectroscopies. By adding Co(II) and Ni(II) ions in acetonitrile solution, 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 metal:merocyanine complexes are formed simultaneously. Using appropriate numerical methods, the kinetic analysis of the complexation allowed us to determine accurately key thermodynamic and spectroscopic parameters of the metal complexes. Results showed that the complexation strength is very sensitive {{to the size of the}} indoline nitrogen substituent. Complexation can be reversed by shining white light on the coloured complexes which regenerates the inactive spiropyran form, and releases the metallic ion; hence, these systems display fully <b>reversible</b> <b>negative</b> photochromism.

The present study was undertaken to investigate whether CNTF transiently inhibits rod differentiation or induces irreversible changes in the developmental fate of rod precursors. METHODS. The effects of CNTF on rod differentiation were monitored in organotypic slice cultures from early postnatal rat retinas by quantification of opsin-immunoreactive cells. The in vitro formation of the photoreceptor layer was analyzed by light and electron microscopy. The developmental expression of the CNTF receptor in photoreceptors was determined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS. CNTF did not interfere with the generation of rod precursors, their morphologic differentiation, or the formation of the outer nuclear layer. Inhibition of rod differentiation was reversible. In the continuous presence of CNTF the number of opsin-positive cells increased at a normal rate but with a delay of 3 to 4 days. Developing rods became resistant to CNTF, both in vivo and in vitro, and this correlated temporally with the downregulation of CNTF receptor expression. Receptor downregulation was inhibited by CNTF in a dose-dependent manner. At higher CNTF concentrations with sustained receptor expression, the CNTF-induced decrease in opsin expression was accompanied by an increase in the expression of a bipolar cell marker in rod precursors located in the photoreceptor layer. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that, although rod precursors exhibit some phenotypic plasticity in the presence of CNTF, the factor does not induce a switch in the developmental fate of rod precursors but plays a role as a transient and <b>reversible</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of rod differentiation.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to ascertain whether cardiodepressive mediators released after ischemia originate from coronary endothelial cells. Background. Endothelial cells modulate myocardial contractility under physiologic conditions. Few data are available describing the role of coronary endothelial cells on myocardial function after ischemia. Methods. Using a model of sequential perfusion of two isolated rat hearts, the effect of the reoxygenated coronary effluent of heart I was investigated on myocardial contractility of heart II. After 40 min of separate perfusion at constant flow (10 ml/min), the two hearts were perfused sequentially with (group I) or without (control group) preceding ischemia (10 min) of heart I. In groups II and III, the coronary endothelium of heart I was functionally removed by Triton X- 100 or hyperkalemic infusion before global ischemia. Endothelial damage was confirmed by functional tests and electron microscopy. Results. Under control conditions no changes were observed in heart II during sequential perfusion. In contrast, after 10 min of ischemia in heart I, a marked reversible decrease in left ventricular pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmaxand left ventricular dP/dtmin(− 55 %, − 66 % and − 70 %, respectively) was observed in heart II. Heart rate and coronary perfusion pressure did not change significantly. Selective endothelial damage of heart I before ischemia did not modify the negative inotropic effect observed in heart II. Conclusions. Cardiodepressive mediators are released after ischemia during reperfusion from an isolated heart and induce a <b>reversible</b> <b>negative</b> inotropic effect in a sequentially perfused heart.

40|$|TOPIC: This study {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} chronic endocardial parasympathetic neural stimulation for dynamic ventricular rate control during atrial fibrillation {{and the development of}} an implantable neurostimulator with transvenuous intracardiac lead fixation and evaluation of its long-term efficacy. BACKGROUND: Efficient pharmacological ventricular rate control in patients with chronic permanent atrial fibrillation is not always easy to achieve and limited by potential side effects such as hypotension or bradycardia. Previous studys have shown, that the inferior interatrial ganglionated plexus (IAGP) selectively innervates the AV node. Temporary electrical stimulation of this plexus elicits a reduction of ventricular heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: In 10 mongrel dogs, the small endocardial area in the right atrium overlying the IAGP was identified by neuromapping with probatory high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) by using a custom-made positioning catheter with a distal pair of electrodes. After identification of the stimulation area, an active-fixation pacemaker lead was advanced through the inner lumen of the positioning catheter while leaving the catheter in the target area. After transvenuous lead fixation, the positioning catheter was slit and removed and the lead was connected with an implantable neurostimulator. An additional conventional DDD-pacemaker was implanted for initial induction of atrial fibrillation by high-frequency atrial stimulation (600 ppm) and for measurement of ventricular heart rate. In the first study group (n= 5) long-term lead stability was examined by weekly-intermittent neurostimulation. In the second study group (n= 4) continuous neurostimulation was performed during a period of 1 – 2 years for reduction of ventricular rate in a range of 100 – 140 bpm. RESULTS: Implantation of the neurostimulation lead was achieved in 37 ± 12 min. Neurostimulation resulted in a <b>reversible</b> <b>negative</b> dromotropic effect. The on-/offset of the negative dromotropic effect was sudden within 1 second after the initiation or termination of parasympathetic neurostimulation. The major determinants of neurostimulation efficacy were stimulation frequency, voltage and impulse duration. The required voltage for a reduction of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation of about 40 % was less than 5 V with a chronaxie time of 0. 07 ± 0, 02 ms for a 50 % reduction in ventricular rate. In the first study group (n = 5) weekly-intermittent neurostimulation was effective and well tolerated by the animals during a 6 month follow-up. In the second study group (n = 4) continuous neurostimulation adjusted to achieve a mean ventricular rate decrease during atrial fibrillation of about 40 % was effective during a 1 - 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Continuous parasympathetic stimulation via a cardiac neurostimulator implanted by transvenuous lead fixation and without the need of thoracotomy is possible and provides effective ventricular heart rate control during long-term follow-up. AV node selectivity and the possibility of a dynamic adjustment of the negative dromotropic effect within seconds may be an advantage over pharmacological rate control...|$|E

In this study, the incorporation of tin during copper damascene plating was investigated at conditions that allow void-free filling. The study focused on the effects of the additive package used, the current density, and the feature size on the tin incorporation. The Sn concentration in Cu was found to increase with the non-metallic impurity levels. Because the plating chemistry and plating current have strong impacts on the incorporation of the non-metallic impurities, they were also found to change the Sn incorporation. For example, Cu films plated at a lower current density, which showed higher non-metallic impurity levels, were also found to incorporate more Sn, opposite to the expectation from the more <b>negative</b> <b>reversible</b> potential of Sn.

Participants gained 7 [5 · 1 - 7 · 6]% of their initial body weight on the hypercaloric diet. Compared to baseline, insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance decreased, while glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was higher. The GLP- 1 response to oral glucose did not change. The dynamic β-cell responsivity index increased but the basal and static responsivity indexes did not change. Total and static disposition indexes (DIs) in the hypercaloric state showed a trend towards a decrease.

T 1 AM is an endogenous compound with chemical features similar to thyroid hormone. That is mainly due to its structure, {{which is based on}} the same carbon skeleton of thyroxine. In principle, T 1 AM could be produced from T 4 by enzymatic decarboxylation and deiodination. At the molecular level it is a potent agonist of the TAAR 1, and an agonist ligand against the &alpha- 2 A adrenergic receptor. When administered pharmacologically it induced hypometabolic state opposite to that induced by excess of thyroid hormone. In isolated working rat heart and rat cardiomyocytes, T 1 AM produced a <b>reversible</b> dose-dependent <b>negative</b> inotropic effect. In the present study we investigate the catabolism and uptake of exogenous T 1 AM in rat cardiac tissues, biological fluids and cardiomyoblast cells, using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS. Ex vivo assay: isolated working rat hearts were subjected to perfusion with T 1 AM alone or in presence of different monoamine oxidase (MAO) and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) inhibitors; circulating buffer and tissue homogenates were also analyzed. In vivo assay: after administration of T 1 AM, rat biological fluids were investigated. In vitro assay: cultured rat cardiomyoblasts (H 9 C 2) were treated with T 1 AM alone or in presence of different MAO and SSAO inhibitors, using perfusion buffer as medium for the assay. At different incubation time, medium and cell lysate were collected and submitted to analysis. Analytical method: reverse phase HPLC coupled to ESI-MS-MS was performed, in positive and negative MRM ion mode, acquiring 3 - 4 transitions for T 1 AM and some of its catabolites. T 1 AM and its oxidative deamination product, 3 -iodothyroacetic acid (TA 1), were evaluated in cell lysate, in cell growth medium, and in circulating perfusion buffer. Similar studies involving also heart tissue homogenates and biological fluids upon treatment are in progress. Preliminary data indicated that T 1 AM is metabolized to TA 1 both in working rat heart and in H 9 C 2 cells. In particular TA 1 showed a significant increase in cell lysate reaching its maximum in 40 min and only a moderate increment in cell medium. The pretreatment of H 9 C 2 cells with different amounts of iproniazide significantly inhibited T 1 AM conversion to TA 1. The same mechanism was found in circulating perfusion buffer and iproniazide acted as an inhibitor as well. The reduction of T 1 AM cellular uptake in presence of MAO and SSAO inhibitors constitutes the evidence for the involvement of these enzymes in T 1 AM catabolism.

40|$|Hydrogen {{is a very}} {{important}} feedstock in the chemical industry and a promising energy carrier with main application in internal combustion engines and fuel cell technology {{as an alternative to the}} massive consumption of fossil fuels. H 2 presents a high gravimetric energy density and can be considered as a clean synthetic fuel depending on the sustainability of the energy and raw material employed for its production. Hydrogen is currently obtained mainly via methane steam reforming. However, the use of liquid hydrogen carriers such as methanol is acquiring increasing interest. H 2 production from methanol is typically carried out through its decomposition (MD, CH 3 OH ¿ 2 H 2 + CO), steam reforming (SRM, CH 3 OH + H 2 O ¿ 3 H 2 + CO 2) or partial oxidation (POM, CH 3 OH + 1 / 2 O 2 ¿ 2 H 2 + CO 2), by using catalysts based on Cu or Group VIII metals (Pt, Pd, Ni). A high catalytic activity, a low CO selectivity and a good durability of the catalyst are the main targets. Other valuable byproducts such as formaldehyde or methyl formate can also be obtained from these processes. On the other hand, the low volumetric energy density of gaseous H 2 makes the development of efficient hydrogen storage systems to be of paramount importance. The coupling of catalysis and electrochemistry has been widely investigated for the last years for H 2 production through electrolysis processes. In this thesis, the electrochemistry has been used to activate and tune different catalysts for H 2 production from methanol through the Electrochemical Promotion Of Catalysis (EPOC). This phenomenon is based on the modification of the chemisorption properties of a metal catalyst by the electrochemical migration of promoter ions from a solid electrolyte support (via application of an electric current or potential). Hence, while in classical chemical promotion a specific amount of a promoter is added during the preparation step of the catalyst, in the case of the electrochemical promotion, promoter ions are electrochemically pumped between the metal catalyst and the solid electrolyte in a controlled way during the reaction step. Then, the electrochemical promotion presents several additional advantages, such as the possibility of optimizing the promoter coverage on the catalyst surface at different reaction conditions and the in-situ enhancement of the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this sense, previous studies have reported the interest of the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion on the methanol decomposition and partial oxidation reactions over Pt and Ag catalysts, by using yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the solid electrolyte, which is an O 2 - conductor. However, these works were only focused on formaldehyde production (not H 2) and were carried out at relatively high reaction temperatures. With respect to the application of the EPOC phenomenon to the trapping and storage of surface compounds, previous works have demonstrated the interest of using cationic electrochemical catalysts for NOx storage-reduction process (NSR) and CO 2 capture. On the other hand, although a large number of studies have demonstrated the electrochemical promotion mechanism and this has been applied in a wide variety of catalytic reactions of industrial and environmental interest, a further technological progress is necessary for its practical application. Nowadays, some of the main challenges of EPOC are the development of compact and efficient reactors, and more competitive catalysts with a higher dispersion (composed of metal nanoparticles) or based in non noble metals such as Ni or Cu. Hence, in view of the mentioned above, this doctoral thesis aims to the study of the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC) in H 2 production processes from methanol by using alkaline conductors. Furthermore, the possibility of applying the EPOC in the field of H 2 storage was also investigated. For these purposes, novel catalyst films were developed by means of different preparation techniques in collaboration with other research groups specialized in the deposition of thin metallic films. Firstly, the effect of electrochemical promotion was studied in the H 2 production via steam reforming and partial oxidation of methanol, being formaldehyde simultaneously obtained in the latter case. Two kinds of Pt catalyst films were deposited on K-ßAl 2 O 3 (K+-conductor material) by two different techniques: impregnation and cathodic arc deposition (CAD). Both electrochemical catalysts were compared under electrochemical promotion conditions for the methanol partial oxidation reaction. It was found that in alkali-based solid electrolyte cells, an excess of electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst-working electrode (the case of the impregnated Pt film) can be detrimental for the electropromotional effect due to the excessive formation of promoter-derived surface compounds, which may block catalytic active sites. On the other hand, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the thin Pt film of low metal loading prepared by cathodic arc deposition were strongly enhanced by EPOC, i. e., by the electrochemical transfer of K+ ions to the catalyst under negative potentials. In this way, the Pt catalyst film prepared by this technique allowed to produce both H 2 and H 2 CO at mild reaction conditions in a single reaction step. This electrochemical catalyst presented much less catalytic activity in the steam reforming of methanol, although it was also electrochemically promoted under these reaction conditions. The K+ promotional effect was attributed to the decrease in the catalyst work function and, hence, the strengthening of the Pt chemical bond with the electron acceptor (O 2 or H 2 O) against that with the electron donor (CH 3 OH). Furthermore, the Pt catalyst film showed to be stable for long working times and the EPOC effect was found to be fully reversible in all the experiments, given the good reproducibility observed in the catalytic activity under every positive polarization (unpromoted or reference state). On the basis of the obtained results, the catalyst films used in the following studies were prepared by cathodic arc deposition or by other kind of physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, such as sputtering or oblique angle deposition (OAD). Then, in other study, the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion (EPOC) was applied on a catalyst film composed of Pt nanoparticles (of around 3 nm) dispersed in a diamond-like carbon (DLC) matrix which was prepared by the cathodic arc deposition technique. In first place, a temperature-programmed pretreatment was carried out in order to achieve a suitable electrical conductivity for the electrochemical promotion experiments. The decrease in the surface electrical resistance was due to the transition of the sp 3 -hybridized carbon form into a more graphitic structure (sp 2 -hybridized) as confirmed by EELS. Moreover, the stability of the Pt nanoparticles was verified by STEM. The catalytic performance of the Pt-DLC film in the methanol partial oxidation (POM) and steam reforming (SRM) reactions for H 2 production was promoted by K+ ions electrochemically transferred from a K-ßAl 2 O 3 solid electrolyte. Hence, it was demonstrated that the EPOC phenomenon may be applied to catalysts based on metal nanoparticles dispersed in an electronic non-ionic conductor support. Moreover, two different electropromotional effects were found under POM conditions depending on the applied potential, which were attributed to the formation of different kinds of promoter phases on this catalyst. The higher catalytic activity of Pt-DLC, compared to that of the pure Pt film, demonstrated the practical interest of this kind of dispersed catalyst films with lower metal loading. Other novel electrochemical catalyst based on Au nanoparticles dispersed in a Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) matrix was deposited by reactive co-sputtering of Zirconium-Yttrium and Au targets on a K-ßAl 2 O 3 solid electrolyte. The Au-YSZ film was electrically non-conductive and a silver current collector was used to polarize the catalyst film that would be used in the electrochemical promotion experiments. The Au nanoparticles showed to be active in the partial oxidation of methanol with a high selectivity toward methyl formate production. This configuration allowed to decrease the amount of metal used in the solid electrolyte cell, and to activate a highly dispersed Au catalyst via electrochemical promotion (EPOC), by in-situ controlling and optimizing the supplied amount of K+ ions. A number of experiments confirmed that the observed electropromotional effect did depend on neither the rate of K+ supply nor the operation mode (galvanostatic or potentiostatic). It only depended on the achieved final promoter coverage. The stability of the Au nanoparticles under the explored conditions was also confirmed under EPOC reaction conditions. Then, a novel Cu catalyst film was prepared by oblique angle physical vapour deposition (OAPVD) on a K-ßAl 2 O 3 solid electrolyte. This technique allowed to obtain a highly porous and electrically conductive Cu catalyst electrode composed of metal nanocolumns, which was electrochemically promoted in the partial oxidation of methanol (POM). The production rates of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methyl formate were in-situ enhanced in a reversible and reproducible way, by means of the controlled migration of electropositive potassium ions. Moreover, the enhancement ratios were comparable to those obtained with the Pt-DLC catalyst. Under the studied reaction conditions, these promoter ions also formed potassium-derived surface compounds as demonstrated by post-reaction characterization analysis. Some nitrogen functional groups and carbonaceous compounds were also detected. The obtained results demonstrate the interest of the used catalyst-electrode preparation technique for the electrochemical activation of non-noble metal catalyst films with high gas-exposed surface area. Then, three possible applications of the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC) were demonstrated with a Ni catalyst for methanol conversion processes: activation of the catalyst, modification of the catalytic selectivity and partial oxidation of the catalyst. The Ni catalyst film was prepared by cathodic arc deposition and electrochemically promoted by K+, upon negative polarization, in the methanol decomposition (MD) and steam reforming (SRM) reactions, showing an electrophilic EPOC behavior in both cases. In the presence of water, the K+ ions promotional effect also attenuated the Ni deactivation by carbon deposition. On the other hand, under methanol partial oxidation conditions (POM), the K+ ions caused a sharp decrease in the catalytic selectivity toward H 2 and CO while the production rates of CO 2 and H 2 CO slightly enhanced, due to an increase in the Ni oxidation state by the alkali-induced O 2 activation. All the potassium-derived effects were fully <b>reversible</b> between the <b>negative</b> and positive polarizations, which showed different interesting possibilities of the EPOC phenomena in heterogeneous catalysis. Finally, the possibility of applying the EPOC phenomenon with alkaline conductors in the fields of H 2 production and storage was also explored. In this case, a porous Ni catalyst film was deposited on K-ßAl 2 O 3 by the oblique angle deposition technique. Under steam reforming conditions and negative polarization, this electrocatalytic system allowed to produce and store H 2 with a very high yield per amount of metal (up to 19 g H 2 x 100 g Ni- 1) due to the promotional effect of K+ ions. Moreover, it was possible to release the stored, highly pure, H 2 in a controlled way under positive polarization and mild (constant) reaction conditions (280 ºC, 1 atm), which represents a new application of the EPOC phenomenon of great interest. The influence of the catalyst microstructure, the applied negative current and the reaction atmosphere was studied. A H 2 storage mechanism was proposed on the basis of the obtained results. Although some K+-derived surface compounds such as bicarbonates were detected by post-reaction characterization of the Ni catalyst surface, the very high observed H 2 storage capacity was mainly attributed to the chemisorption of H atoms on Ni active sites and their spillover onto carbonaceous surface compounds. These carbonaceous species were simultaneously formed under K+-promoted reaction conditions and showed to be mainly composed of graphene oxide...|$|R
