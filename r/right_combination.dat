5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the <b>right</b> <b>combination</b> of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E

25|$|In the 1780s, Wells and a {{few others}} had the idea that dew and frost {{occurred}} when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of water vapor in the air caused by just the <b>right</b> <b>combination</b> of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and heat conductivity of materials.|$|E

500|$|On 9April the French {{flotilla}} {{was able}} to leave the Orne River and anchor in the harbour of Bernières-sur-Mer, but {{the arrival of the}} fourth rate HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham persuaded Muskein to return to the more sheltered anchorage {{at the mouth of the}} Orne. As he returned eastward, he again came under fire from Diamond and Hydra. The French flotilla then sheltered under the batteries at Sallenelles until the damage was repaired. Over the next two weeks, however, the situation changed – Rear-Admiral Jean Lacrosse at Cherbourg had been informed of Muskein's difficulties and sent reinforcements of 40barges and armed fishing ships to Sallenelles. [...] Late in April, Muskein had an opportunity to escape without interception by the British force offshore and sailed as far as Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, to the west of the islands.

500|$|For casting Vanaja and Lacchi, he {{said that}} they met {{approximately}} 2500 children, interviewed about 260, and finally selected two from a shortlist of five to play the roles of Vanaja and Lacchi. Parents of these children were distrustful of them because their wards would have to frequently commute to Domalpalli's house for acting lessons for at least a year. Domalpalli felt that [...] "to convince people to devote so much of their children's time and energy was hard enough, but to find the <b>right</b> <b>combination</b> of intelligence, commitment and talent as well was probably the steepest cliff they had to climb." [...] While visiting schools for identifying the child cast, Mamatha Bhukya at first was not selected because her hair was short. But after she sang a song on Mahatma Gandhi, she was selected for the role. Srinivas Devarakonda, a disciple of well-known Kuchipudi guru Vempati Chinna Satyam, taught Mamatha the classical dance form for a year in the basement of Domalpalli's house. Due to this sustained effort, she altered her ambitions from becoming a doctor to an actress and a Kuchipudi dancer. Bhavani Renukunta was chosen for Lacchi's role after an interview at the Hyderabad office of Varija Films, the company that handled the publicity.|$|E
500|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode [...] "was full of laughs {{but had a}} bit of a {{bittersweet}} aftertaste" [...] and had [...] "one hell of a cliffhanger" [...] ending. Rabin praised the Jim and Dwight teaming in the first episode, but said the plot line of Michael's lectures were predictable and [...] "promised more than it delivered". Rabin said the second episode [...] "wrapped up everything up nicely [...] delivered larfs aplenty"; he particularly enjoyed the subplot involving Angela's cats, {{and the fact that it}} [...] "left the door open for Holly's return". Will Leitch of New York magazine praised the cliffhanger ending of the first episode and said he was pleased the Holly character was still in the show's equation. Leitch also praised Ed Helms, who [...] "is nailing the <b>right</b> <b>combination</b> of ridiculous and sad-sack pathos", although he said he [...] " [...] nearly as inspired" [...] by the Jim and Dwight subplot. Leitch also enjoyed the second episode, particularly the [...] "legitimately sweet moment" [...] when Pam tells Michael that Holly still has feelings for him. Leitch was less praiseworthy of the Angela subplot involving her cats, and said the character [...] "appears to have officially gone batshit insane." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN criticized the first episode and said, [...] "I'm starting to wonder if the show is showing signs of winding down." [...] Fickett said the idea of Michael giving awkward lecture tours felt old and familiar, so much so that [...] "I was convinced it was a repeat". He also said the Jim and Dwight idea was funny, but [...] "nothing the show hasn't tapped before".

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the <b>right</b> <b>combination</b> of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

Identification of the <b>right</b> <b>combinations</b> is often accomplished through trial and error, a labor and resource intensive process whose scale quickly escalates as more drugs can be combined.

When applied to mutant BRAF melanoma, we found that our approach exhibited significant predictive power. Additionally, we validated previously untested synergy predictions involving anticancer molecules. As additional large combinatorial screens become available, this methodology could prove to be impactful for identification of drug synergy in context of other types of cancers...|$|R
