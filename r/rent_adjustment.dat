40|$|This {{study has}} {{analyzed}} the <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{mechanism for the}} multifamily rental housing in the US during the period 1993 - 2003 for twenty-four US metropolitan areas. The <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> model employed incorporates the principal argument of search theory that vacancy ultimately determines rent levels. Various time lags on the vacancy rate are tested for each metropolitan area {{in order to better}} understand the timing of the effect of the vacancy rate on market rents and to find the best fitting model for each metropolitan area. Two kinds of rents are analyzed : the CPI (Consumer Price Index), 'sitting tenant rent' actually paid by the tenants, and MPF (Market Product Fact), the 'asking rent' for the vacant unit. The results of this study clearly indicate that the <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> models under study explain the MPF <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism better than the CPI <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> model. Chaning the vacancy lag does not improve the CPI <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism. The {{results of this study suggest}} further studies to explore the behaviors of lessors and lessees to explain why CPI rents behaves as they do. The findings identified through this research provide a helpful basis for advancing an improved theoretical and empirical formulation that highlights the complexities of the <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> process. From a practical point of view, the results can help real estate investment analysts to better model and forecast rent changes in residential real estate market. by Lee-Young Yun. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|We take {{advantage}} of a panel data of housing rents for the period of 1986 to 2006 which we have compiled from 720, 000 listings in the widely-circulated housing advertisement magazine. First, we find that the probability of <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> does not depend on the deviation of actual rent from its target level. We also find a flat hazard function at least for durations less than 400 weeks. These results suggest that the <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> obeys a Poisson process. Second, the Calvo pa-rameter is estimated to be 0. 97, indicating that the probability of the <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> occurs is 3 percent per quarter, much lower than the estimate for other goods and services.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s over 200 {{cities in the}} United States of America have enacted rent control. Currently 10 % of the nation's renters are covered by some form of rent regulation, yet {{little is known about}} the {{economic}} consequences of rent control. Most evidence suggests that modern rent controls have little or no impact on the amount of investment in rental housing. Such a finding is primarily because of the nonrestrictive nature of most current rent control ordinances, which typically exempt newly constructed housing, guarantee a fair and reasonable return on investment, and allow for annual <b>rent</b> <b>adjustments</b> to cover increases in operating costs. Although this relatively mild type of rent control succeeds in limiting extreme rent increases, it does not result in significant relief from high rents in most regulated cities. Only with strong rent control ordinances will rents be significantly impacted. ...|$|R

40|$|Rent plays a {{vital role}} in {{property}} valuation because any positive or negative influence on rent will in turn affect a property's value. This paper examines the effect of mass transportation on apartment rent. Specifically, this study investigates the impact on rent and value for residential income properties located in close proximity to Washington, D. C. Metrorail stations. After reviewing the empirical research which has focused on the effect of mass transportation availability on property values, this paper examines the benefits on apartment rent of Washington, D. C. apartment buildings from location near Metrorail stations. Our empirical results show that distance from a metro station has an adverse impact on apartment rent, i. e., each one-tenth mile increase in distance from the station results in a decrease in rent per apartment unit of about 2. 50 %. This analysis should be of interest to a host of domestic and international market participants including academics who study real estate markets, tax assessors who determine market value, appraisers who make market-derived <b>rent</b> <b>adjustments,</b> and property managers who set apartment rents. ...|$|R

The steady state to which the simulation evolves shows price dispersion, nonzero search times and vacancies. We further assess the effects of altering the level of information for landlords.

K., South Africa, China, Thailand, and many other countries have suffered office oversupply cycles. Illiquid untenanted office buildings impair investors capital and cash flows, with adverse effects on macroeconomics, financial institutions, and individuals. This study aims to develop improved methods for medium term forecasting of office market adjustments to inform individual project development decisions and thereby to mitigate office oversupply cycles. Methods combine qualitative research, econometric estimation, system dynamics simulation, and institutional economics. This research operationalises a problem solving research paradigm concept advocated by Ken Lusht. The research is also indebted to the late James Graaskamp, who was successful in linking industry and academic research through time and space specific feasibility studies to inform individual property development decisions. Qualitative research and literature provided a list of contributing causes of office oversupply including random shocks, faulty forecasting methods, fee driven deals, prisoners dilemma game, system dynamics (lags and adjustment times), land use regulation, and capital market issues. Rather than choosing among these, they are all considered to be causal to varying degrees. Moreover, there is synergy between combinations of these market imperfections. Office markets are complex evolving human designed systems (not time invariant) so each cycle has unique historical features. Data on Australian office markets were used to estimate office <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> equations. Simulation models in spreadsheet and system dynamics software then integrate additional information with the statistical results to produce demand, supply, and rent forecasts. Results include ++models for rent forecasting and models for analysis related to policy and system redesign.

The projects have several aims: these are to identify the fundamental drivers of the pricing of different lease terms in the UK property sector; to identify current and best market practice and uncover the main variations in lease terms; to identify key issues in pricing lease terms; and to develop a model for the pricing of rent under a variety of lease variations. From the landlord’s perspective, the main factors driving the required ‘compensation’ for a lease term amendment include expected rental volatility, expected probability of tenant vacation, and the expected costs of tenant vacation. These data are used in conjunction with simulation technology to reflect the options inherent in certain lease types to explore the required <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The resulting cash flows have interesting qualities which illustrate the potential importance of option pricing in a non-complex and practical way. ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{models of}} the rental housing market assume a close linkage between the level of {{residential}} rents and the after-tax user cost of rental housing capital. However, little empirical evidence exists to establish {{the strength of this}} linkage or the speed with which rents adjust to changes in user cost or tax policy. This paper develops and estimates an econometric model of the rental housing market in order to shed light on both of these issues. United States annual data for 1964 through 1993 are used to generate two-stage least squares estimates of a four equation structural model. Although the results are generally consistent with expectations and reveal several interesting relationships among the system variables, the estimates fail to identify a strong relationship between rent and user cost. About half of an increase in user cost is ultimately passed along as higher <b>rent.</b> The <b>adjustment</b> process also takes a long time, with only {{about a third of the}} long-run effect realized within ten years of a user cost shock. The fundamental reason for this result is that our estimate of the user cost series, based upon widely accepted procedures, is much more volatile than the residential rent series. ...|$|R
40|$|Why was the Japanese {{consumer}} price index for rents so stable even {{during the period of}} housing bubble in the 1980 s? In addressing this question, we start from the analysis of microeconomic rigidity and then investigate its implications about aggregate price dynamics. We find that ninety percent of the units in our dataset had no change in rents per year, indicating that rent stickiness is three times as high as in the US. We also find that the probability of <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> depends little on the deviation of the actual rent from its target level, suggesting that rent adjustments are not state dependent but time dependent. These two results indicate that both intensive and extensive margins of rent adjustments are very small, thus yielding a slow reponse of the CPI to aggregate shocks. We show that the CPI inflation rate would have been higher by one percentage point during the bubble period, and lower by more than one percentage point during the period of bubble bursting, if the Japanese housing rents were as flexible as in the US.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} rent and vacancy rate adjustment in the Seoul office market under information asymmetry conditions. There are two sources of information asymmetry: structure information asymmetry and tenant information asymmetry. The former arises from the landlord having {{more information about the}} quality of the building structure than the tenant, and the latter stems from the landlord knowing less {{about the quality of the}} tenant than the tenant himself/herself. This study conjectures that both types of information asymmetry would lead to slower rental adjustment and/or faster vacancy rate "adjustment" under external shocks. Following Chau and Wong (2015), structure information asymmetry can be measured by the value of the structure as a percentage of the property. Assuming that construction costs (value of the structure) are similar in different locations in Seoul, land leverage (i. e. average rent) is a good indicator of structure information asymmetry. A higher land leverage implies lower information asymmetry. The office rental market in South Korea is characterized by a special form of contractual arrangement – the Chonsei rental contract. Under the Chonsei contract, the tenant pays a large lump sum “deposit,” known as Chonsei, in lieu of monthly rental payment. The Chonsei is to be returned to the tenant upon expiry of the rental contract. This study makes use of this contractual arrangement to rank the tenant information asymmetry in different industries. Based on the major types of tenants in Seoul office market, this study finds finance companies with higher information asymmetry are riskier and are thus required to pay higher rent for the same Chonsei. Therefore, the Chonsei conversion rate is higher for tenants with higher information asymmetry (riskier tenants), other things being equal. In contrast, manufacturing companies with lower information asymmetry are more credible and landlords ask them to pay lower rent for the same Chonsei, as a result, the Chonsei conversion rate is lower for tenants with lower information asymmetry (more credible tenants), other things being equal. Incidentally, we also find that the Chonsei conversion rate increases with adjusted market capitalization rate and expected future appreciation of office price but decreases with market interest rate. Empirical evidence from this study suggests that the coefficient of <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> is similar for different degrees of structure and tenant information asymmetry in the Seoul office market. However, both types of information asymmetry have a significant impact on the vacancy rate adjustment because higher structure or tenant information asymmetry result in much higher coefficients of vacancy rate adjustments. On the other hand, low tenant information asymmetry leads to a higher coefficient of <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment,</b> compared to low structure information asymmetry, therefore the impact of tenant information asymmetry on the speed of <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment</b> is stronger than that of structure information asymmetry. However, low tenant information asymmetry indicates a very similar vacancy rate adjustment compared to low structure information asymmetry, hence the impact of tenant information asymmetry on the speed of vacancy rate adjustment is similar to that of structure information asymmetry. The contributions of this study are fivefold. First, we have conducted the first study on the impact of tenant information asymmetry on the rent and vacancy rate adjustment process in the Seoul office market. Second, this is the first research that has developed an innovative method of ranking (measuring) tenant information asymmetry based on the special Chonsei rental arrangement in the Seoul office market. Third, this study has contributed to the body of knowledge on the determinants of the Chonsei conversion rate, which has received much attention from many researchers and practitioners. Fourth, there have been very few empirical studies on the Seoul office market due to lack of reliable data. This study has built a Seoul office market database from various sources for empirical analysis. This database can be updated for future analysis of the Seoul office market. Fifth, the results of the study not only shed light on the long debated research question of the determinants of the speed of the rent and vacancy rate adjustment process but should also be useful for practitioners and policy makers. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Simkhovitch believed that imaginative programs could replace slums with decent housing and revive the creative spirit of a community. In 1934, NHC pushed hard to get the Federal Home Loan Bank Board set up, and helped engineer the passage of the National Housing Act of 1934, which created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). NHC’s efforts in the 1950s and 1960s helped secure the expansion of the Housing Act of 1949 in 1954, which included authorization of slum clearance and permitted <b>rent</b> <b>adjustments</b> based on income. Part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society” included the creation of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965, a cabinet level department with decent housing as its only goal. In 1973, Clara Fox, executive director of the Settlement Housing Fund, organized developers, lenders, builders, property managers, residents and others interested in affordable housing into a powerful coalition to fight President Richard Nixon’s actions to limit federal housing programs. The following year, this coalition, the New York Housing Conference (NYHC), affiliated with NHC. Fox served as co-chair of NYHC until her death in December 2007. After Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter authorized record high budgets for HUD in the 1970s, the election of Ronald Reagan in 1982 led to drastic housing budget cuts. Despite the reluctance of the Reagan Administration, NHC successfully lobbied for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit legislation, which gave private investors a 10-year tax incentive to invest in affordable housing by providing equity for multi-family housing with a designated number of units for low-income tenants. This remains the most important incentive for financing low-income housing. In 1992, President Bill Clinton’s new HUD administration approached NHC for help in determining how best to preserve the 940,000 Section 8 program units facing defaults. NHC convened a special task force numbering over 110 industry leaders from all different sectors of the housing industry. The coalition drafted a proposal that resulted in “Mark to Market” legislation, helping to preserve hundreds of thousands of rental units. Also in 1992, NHC created the Center for Housing Policy, an affiliated housing research organization dedicated to conducting practical and relevant research for housing practitioners and policymakers. Jeffrey Lubell serves {{as executive director of the}} Center. In the late 1990s, a group of California NHC members decided that the time was long overdue for California to become a more significant player in the affordable housing policy arena. In 1997 they formed an affiliate organization of NHC, the California Housing Consortium (CHC). Since 1997, CHC has become a major affordable housing player in California. Its efforts have resulted in major state housing bonds focused on ensuring affordable housing. [...] In December 2000, Congress established the bipartisan Millennial Housing Commission. The Commission was charged with examining, analyzing and exploring: 1) The importance of affordable housing; 2) Possible methods for increasing the role of the private sector in providing affordable housing; and 3) Whether exiting HUD programs work. NHC's then-policy director, Conrad Egan, was the executive director of the Commission. Egan served as president and CEO of NHC until February 2010, when he was succeeded by Maureen Friar.|$|R
40|$|Between 1999 and 2006, {{there were}} two episodes during which {{inflation}} in the Rent index in the CPI diverged markedly from inflation in the index for Owner’s Equivalent Rent (OER); early in 2007, these series began to diverge again. Such divergence often prompts many to question CPI methods. A key {{difference between these two}} series is that OER indexes are based upon rents which have received a utilities adjustment – an adjustment which is necessary because the OER index is intended to track pure rent-of-shelter, not shelter-plus-utilities. Critics have claimed that the Rent-OER inflation divergences stem from an inappropriate utilities adjustment. This claim is false. In this paper, we decompose the Rent-OER inflation differential into its various determinants, and explore the multiple causes of this divergence over time. There is only one divergence episode – of only six months duration – which is primarily attributable to the utilities adjustment procedure. Indeed, the utilities adjustment sometimes reduced potential divergence between the two series. Instead, the main culprit is rental market segmentation; that is, different rent inflation rates were experienced by different parts of the rental market. Before 2003, the Rent-OER inflation divergence mainly resulted from divergent rental inflation rates within metropolitan areas: areas with a higher proportion of renters experienced higher rental inflation. After 2004, similar divergent inflation across metropolitan areas resulted in higher Rent inflation. Compared to other units, rent control units experienced higher inflation in 2004 (and, to a lesser extent, before mid- 2001 and in 2006), which increased Rent inflation but not OER inflation. Finally, in early 2007, there was a sizable divergence between OER and Rent inflation, driven mostly by divergent rental inflation rates within metropolitan areas; the extent of the divergence only becomes evident once the effect of the utilities adjustment is accounted for.

40|$|Efforts {{to limit}} {{cumulative}} emissions {{over the next}} century may be offset by emissions leakage, not only between countries but over time. Current price-cost margins for major reserves are ample, leaving scope for significant price reductions if climate policies alter demand for fossil fuels. This resource owner response to maintain extraction over time has been labelled the “green paradox, ” which has a “strong” form that implies intertemporal leakage may reach 100 %, and a “weak ” form that notes policies like a faster transition to clean energy may accelerate emissions, shortening the time to adapt and increasing damages. We contribute to this literature by isolating the effects of intertemporal leakage, using a model of multiple pools of different extraction costs. We compare the effects of five policy options: accelerating cost reductions in the clean backstop, taxing emissions, improving energy efficiency, a clean fuel blend mandate, and mandating carbon capture and sequestration. A stylized one-pool model identifies two types of equilibria that extend to multiple pools: full exhaustion of the last pool, and partial exhaustion of the last pool. All policies can reduce cumulative emissions, but the backstop policy accelerates extraction while conservation policies delay emissions. However, when comparing to {{what would happen in}} the absence of resource <b>rent</b> <b>adjustment,</b> we find that conservation policies have higher intertemporal leakage rates, and backstop policies can have lower leakage than an emissions tax. Leakage rates generally decline as targets become more stringent. We calibrate an extension of this model to five major categories of oil...|$|E
50|$|In 2002, it {{expanded}} to 1,147 units, which included stores in San Leandro, Fremont, and Hayward, California, and sales reached $37.4 billion. In 2003, Target reached 1,225 units and $42.0 billion in sales. Despite {{the growth of}} the discount retailer, neither Marshall Field's nor Mervyn's were adding to its store count, and their earnings were consistently declining. Marshall Field's sold two of its stores in Columbus, Ohio, this year. On June 9, 2004, Target Corporation announced its sale of the Marshall Field's chain to St. Louis-based May Department Stores, which would become effective July 31, 2004. As well, on July 21, 2004, Target Corporation announced the sale of Mervyn's to an investment consortium including Sun Capital Partners, Cerberus Capital Management, and Lubert-Adler/Klaff and Partners, L.P., which was finalized September 2. Target Stores {{expanded to}} 1,308 units and reached $46.8 billion USD in sales. In 2005, Target began operation in Bangalore, India. It reached 1,397 units and $52.6 billion in sales. In February 2005, Target Corporation took a $65 million charge to change the way it accounted for leases, which would reconcile the way Target depreciated its buildings and calculated <b>rent</b> expense. The <b>adjustment</b> included $10 million for 2004 and $55 million for prior years.|$|R
40|$|In East Asia, {{services}} trade integration, both in market and policy, lags far behind goods trade integration. In {{spite of a}} proliferation of ASEAN plus one type FTAs in the Region since the early 2000 s, policy-led services integration has not happened in East Asia. The aim of this research project is to investigate {{the reasons why the}} Japan-ASEAN bilateral FTAs, which were concluded in the 2000 s, resulted in the shallow GATS-plus FTAs. Since barriers in {{services trade}} lie in domestic regulations, we examine how domestic determinants, namely interests and institutions in domestic decision-making, shaped the negotiating positions of Japan and ASEAN. From our empirical work, we found the following: (i) The services trade policy-making structure, which involves a wide participation of domestic regulatory authorities in the decision-making process, constituted horizontal fragmentation of power. Because of horizontal fragmentation of power, the domestic regulatory authorities with strong regulatory autonomy and regulatory concerns were able to exercise a veto power against changes in the status-quo and pushed backward the lead ministry’s negotiating positions. (ii) In terms of interests, no strong proliberalisation interests existed either on the policy demand or supply sides. On the policy demand side, while there existed very limited exporting interests, the import-competing services suppliers were afraid of the erosion of <b>rents</b> and <b>adjustment</b> costs caused by preferential market liberalisation. On the policy supply side, there was few incentives to lock in domestic services reforms by using the Japan-ASEAN bilateral FTAs. In addition, (a) pressure for speedy conclusion of an FTA to win the political competition of creating FTAs in the Region and (b) the strong economic and political motivation of FTAs to enhance regional supply chains in the manufacturing sector undermined the countries’ negotiating positions on services trade. From the findings above, we conclude that services trade integration in East Asia lags far behind goods trade because of the double layered political economy impediments. The first layer of impediment, which is the horizontally fragmented domestic decision-making structure, reflects the heterogeneity of services. The second layer of impediment, which is interests, mostly reflects the distinctive characteristics of East Asi...|$|R
40|$|Farmers face many {{business}} risks relating to production, prices, technological change, legal and social issues, and human resources. A tenant can share production and price risks with the landlord through a crop-share lease. This enables the landlord {{to share in}} higher or lower-than-expected yields and/or prices. However, the typical crop-share lease also requires the landlord to share the cost of fertilizer, seed, and chemicals and pay to have {{his share of the}} crop harvested. Income from such a share lease is usually considered as self-employment income for the landlord, which some landlords would prefer to avoid. A subsequent fact sheet in this series will address farm-rental tax issues. In contrast, a flexible-cash lease will allow landowners to share some of these risks without becoming subject to selfemployment taxes. And, like a fixed-cash lease, the tenant doesn’t have {{to keep track of the}} landowner’s share of expenses. Nor does the landowner have to make grain marketing decisions. Flexible-cash rent usually pertains only to cropland, with fixed rents for buildings, farmstead facilities, and relatively minor acreages of pasture, hay, or woodland. Both parties need to agree on the amount of these “non-flexible ” rents prior to start of the lease period. In addition, the flexible-cash rent keeps the landowner eligible for potential “windfall profits” should they happen. Some disadvantages include the requirement of more records and a written lease agreement compared to a possible fixed-cash rent. In addition, the tenant should expect less income over time because he is transferring more of the risk to the landowner. An Ohio 1999 research project revealed that at least 8 percent of cash leases had some flexibility provisions. A 1996 Ohio study revealed few flexible cash leases. Types of Flexible Rents There are a number of ways to create a flexible-cash <b>rent</b> arrangement including <b>adjustments</b> for crop price only, yield only, or based on both price and yield changes. Flexing Rents for Price At least four methods can be used to flex for price only...|$|R
