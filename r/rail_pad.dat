40|$|The {{effect of}} the frequency-dependent {{stiffness}} of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> on the environment vibrations induced by subway train running in tunnel Kai Wei 1, 2, Ping Wang 1, 2, Fan Yang 1, 2 and Junhua Xiao 3 The influence of the frequency-dependent stiffness of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> on the frequency distribution of vibrations created by a subway train running in tunnel is investigated using a frequency-domain algorithm. The theoretical approach combines vehicle–track coupling dynamics and spectrum analysis using the finite element method. The proposed approach is validated by a comparison with measured data. The comparison further shows that the theoretical approach and the selection of calculation parameters are reasonable and they create high calculation accuracies in the considered fre-quency range. Compared with a constant stiffness pad, the frequency-dependent stiffness of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> has little effect on vibrations below the one-third octave center frequency of 25 Hz; however, it significantly changes the vibrations observed above that center frequency. It is also found that simply increasing the constant stiffness of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> can lead to predictions of the vibration that have only a small error in either the low-frequency or high-frequency domains...|$|E

40|$|Wheel/track impact due to {{rail joints}} or wheel flats {{has been studied}} over many years. The railway track is usually assumed to be linear {{in order to simplify}} the track model, {{although}} the <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> and ballast are actually non-linear. This may cause incorrect results to some extent in some circumstances, as the pad and ballast stiffness varies with load. In this paper wheel/track impact is studied using a non-linear track model. The rail is represented by a finite element (FE) model and is supported by a non-linear track foundation. Wheel/track impacts are simulated at different train speeds and three types of <b>rail</b> <b>pad,</b> soft, medium and stiff, are used in the simulations. It is shown that the impact forces rise dramatically when the stiff rail pads are used. On the other hand, using soft pads can reduce impact forces significantly. Compared with the results from the linear track model, both the impact force and the track vibration level are shown to be noticeably higher from the nonlinear track than those from the linear track. It is therefore concluded that linear track models are not appropriate for wheel/track impact because the track foundation stiffness varies dramatically under the impact force...|$|E
40|$|Abstract‘Big data’ {{obtained}} from wayside detection systems and sensors installed {{on board a}} train show that actual loading history for a railway track is rather dynamic and transient. The dynamic loadings due to train and track interactions redistribute from the rails to the <b>rail</b> <b>pad,</b> from the <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> to the railway sleeper, and from the railway sleeper to the underlying ground. Dynamic content redistributed onto each layer of track is also filtered by energy dissipation characteristic of materials and structures. As a critical infrastructure, railway turnout is a structural grillage system used to divert a train to other directions or other tracks. The wheel–rail contact over the crossing transfer zone often causes detrimental impact loads that rapidly deteriorate the turnout and its components. The dynamic responses of wheel–rail interaction depend largely on the non-smooth trajectory or wearing condition of crossing geometry. In reality, a railway line spreads over a large distance and monitoring such rail infrastructure {{is one of the}} challenges in rail industry.

40|$|Impact loads {{applied to}} {{concrete}} sleepers, either {{due to the}} wheel flats of a train or rail abnormalities, may cause the sleepers to crack. The rail pads {{have been used to}} attenuate the effect of these impact loads on concrete sleepers and on the substructures in ballasted railway tracks. The rail pads experience high intensity loads due to wheel impacts and, as a result, the pad properties deteriorate during the service life. The consequences can be significant for the dynamic behaviour of railway tracks, interaction of vehicle and track, and impact forces on track components. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the pads. In this paper, the degradation of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> properties as a function of their in-service life is studied with a view of developing a technique for predicting the optimum period of track maintenance with regard to pad replacement. Identification of structural properties using methods of experimental modal analysis provides a means for investigation of the deterioration of dynamic pad characteristics. A technique using an instrumented impact hammer is employed in this study. The pad samples were collected from the railway lines in Sydney Electrified Network, Australia, which are operated by Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp). Through testing of pads in a recently developed <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> testing machine, the vibration responses were measured in the frequency range from 0 to 1000 Hz using the Bruel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer PULSE Vibration Analyser system. The analytical solution was derived to estimate the dynamic stiffness and damping constants of the worn pads from the obtained experimental data. The rates of deterioration based on limited data are proposed to predict the useful lifetime of pads and the period of pad replacement. In this study, the type of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> used was the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pad with 5. 5 mm thickness. All worn pads were sourced from RailCorp tracks with approximately 22 MGT (million gross tons) annual tonnage.

In particular, the implementation {{and accuracy of}} viscously damped track models with different complexities are assessed. The validation data come from full-scale field measurements of dynamic track stiffness and wheel-rail contact forces in a demonstrator turnout that was installed {{as part of the}} INNOTRACK project with funding from the European Union Sixth Framework Programme. Vertical track stiffness at nominal wheel loads, in the frequency range up to 20 Hz, was measured using a rolling stiffness measurement vehicle (RSMV). Vertical and lateral wheel-rail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheel set mounted in a freight car featuring Y 25 bogies. The measurements were performed for traffic in both the through and diverging routes, and in the facing and trailing moves. The full set of test runs was repeated with different types of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> to investigate the influence of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> stiffness on track stiffness and contact forces. It is concluded that impact loads on the crossing can be reduced by using more resilient rail pads. To allow for vehicle dynamics simulations at low computational cost, the track models are discretised space-variant mass-spring-damper models that are moving with each wheel set of the vehicle model. Acceptable agreement between simulated and measured vertical contact forces at the crossing can be obtained when the standard GENSYS track model is extended with one ballast/subgrade mass under each rail. This model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay in dynamic track stiffness at low frequencies, as measured by the RSMV, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} loading {{conditions}} on railway tracks is mostly of regular loading patterns due to passage of wheels of rolling stock. Dynamic forces on a railway track caused by abnormal impacts due to wheel flats, rail dips, etc. are usually highly impulsive with short durations and high frequency contents. There {{have been a}} number of investigations on the wheel/rail impacts due to wheel and rail imperfections and track abnormalities. However, the effect of railway track environments including ballast and <b>rail</b> <b>pads</b> has yet been addressed. Intensive studies on the impact resistance of railway concrete sleepers have been conducted at the University of Wollongong, Australia. In order to understand more clearly the manner in which track components respond to those forces, and to clarify the processes whereby concrete sleepers in particular carry those actions, it is vital to ascertain the spectrum and amplitudes of forces applied to tracks. In addition, artificial impacts replicating the generic actual wheel/rail interaction must be identified, prior to investigating the shock responses of the railway concrete sleepers. This paper presents the experimental studies into the effects on dynamic loading conditions of track environments including the ballast support condition and <b>rail</b> <b>pads.</b> An assembled in-situ concrete sleeper has been constructed and subjected to artificial shock loading using a large capacity drop-weight hammer. The attempts to simulate the repeated impacts due to general wheel flats or engine burns are demonstrated so as to investigate of probabilistic impact failure of the concrete sleepers.

Its main function is to attenuate track loads, preventing underneath railway sleepers from excessive stress waves. Generally, the dynamic design of tracks relies on the available data that are mostly focused on the condition at a specific toe load.
