40|$|Many {{hectares}} of field culture changed not only ownership, {{but also the}} manner in which it was farmed in the last decade in Poland. This refers also to polders with compound soil profiles and complex water conditions. Alluvial soils and relatively high water tables occur often in such areas. These conditions are more suitable for grassland than for arable land farming. These rules are very often forgotten by new farmers. This causes conflicts between farmers and the holder of the melioration system or the water reservoir in the vicinity. An example of such a situation is a small polder where soil water conditions are influenced by the reservoir with <b>retained</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> between about 0 - 1. 5 m above the surface of the surrounding land. The paper presents the results of measurements and mathematical simulation for such a polder in the depression. It is concluded that if the beginning of the vegetation season (April) is wet, the moisture conditions are unfavourable for crop production. But if April is dry, then even if the rest of the season is wet, the moisture conditions will still be satisfactory. This conclusion was derived from presented results of simulation. It is true only if farmersÃ¢Â€Â™ activities are responsible and rational for such soil and water conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to ascertain residual <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in polylactide and polylactide-co-glycolide microspheres prepared using the solvent evaporation technique and to investigate the effects of that water on the glass transitional behaviour of the microspheres. Microspheres were prepared from polylactic acid (PLA) and polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) 50 : 50 and 75 : 25 using a standard solvent evaporation technique. The glass transition was measured as a function of drying conditions using modulated temperature DSC. The microspheres were found to contain very low levels of dichloromethane, while residual <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> of up to circa 3 % w/w were noted after freeze or oven drying, these levels being higher for microspheres containing higher glycolic acid <b>levels.</b> The residual <b>water</b> was found to lower the Tg following the Gordon–Taylor relationship.

50|$|The {{cutting of}} turf {{has led to}} damage in the area. Extensive {{drainage}} {{in parts of the}} bog has damaged the bog's ability to <b>retain</b> <b>water,</b> resulting in flooding and abnormally high <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in the caves downstream. This has impeded tourist activity in the past, notably in 1989 when the impact of such damage influencing cave <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> first became evident. As a protective measure, turf cutting has been banned within the wider Geopark. In addition more than 1200 small dams have been put in place across the bogland to slow water flow and encourage the growth of new bog.|$|R

500|$|Although {{official}} attitudes did {{not place}} much {{value on the}} moors, William Bunting moved to Thorne after the Second World War and became an advocate for moor preservation. Thought to be rude and irascible, he began a campaign to recognise the ecological importance of the moors. He asserted that the enclosures of the 1800s, when common rights were replaced by private ownership, had been illegal, as was much of the commercial exploitation of his time. He {{seemed to have a}} good deal of evidence to support his claims, and took several major utilities to court over acts which he felt were illegal. He won a series of high-profile cases, which he used as publicity to advance the case for conserving the moors. In 1972, Bunting began direct action, aided by local residents, local naturalists, and students. During the week, the peat extraction company Fisons would cut drains {{to begin the process of}} lowering the water table. During the weekends, Bunting's Beavers, as his team became known, would walk onto the moors and construct dams across the new ditches, to <b>retain</b> the <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> By the summer, the Beavers appeared to be winning the battle, and their activities were featured on BBC television. Fisons dynamited eighteen of the dams, but the activists were undeterred and began rebuilding them. Finally, Fisons conceded defeat, and negotiated with the Nature Conservancy Council on the future management of the moors in 1974. The government granted some [...] Site of Special Scientific Interest status in 1981. Although this had little immediate effect, it has contributed to subsequent appreciation of the area and its importance as an ecological resource.|$|R

30|$|Tracks {{provide a}} linear, limited {{additional}} habitat {{on the landscape}} that wading birds select for {{more than any other}} habitat. Through repeated use by airboats, vegetation growth is limited and tracks become deeper, thereby <b>retaining</b> <b>water</b> in any given area longer than most of the surrounding marsh. White ibises heavily used tracks when <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> dropped initially in 2010, likely when leg length no longer limited their use of this habitat. Conversely, when <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> rose, great egrets used this habitat preferentially over other areas until prescribed burns were conducted. Wading birds may be responding to availability of prey such as fish. Fish density is often higher in areas adjacent to deep water habitats such as alligator holes and canals than in shallow marsh areas, particularly when <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> decrease as the dry season progresses (Loftus and Kushlan 1987, Rehage and Trexler 2006). Airboat tracks, which are typically deeper than the surrounding sloughs, may function similarly to increase density and, potentially, size class of fish. These tracks may also be a conduit for fish movement to recolonize the marsh after a drydown. Rehage and Trexler (2006) found that when small fish density differed between airboat tracks and the adjacent marsh, densities were greater in the tracks. Similarly, macroinvertebrate density was greater in airboat tracks than in adjacent marshes. Airboat tracks may serve as important hotspots of food resources for wading birds.|$|R

Prior to weir construction, groundwater seepage to the ditch drain was the main hydrological pathway for acid flux. High hydraulic conductivity (3 ̆e 120 m per day) in the sulphuric horizons due to extensive macropores, combined with tidal modulation of drain <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> encouraged rapid seepage of acid groundwater. Most seepage occurred while the backswamp groundwater table was in a narrow elevation range, referred to as an ‘acid export window’. The acidity of drainage water was highly sensitive to the hydraulic gradient between the groundwater table and the adjacent drain <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Acid flux rates from groundwater seepage were strongly positively correlated to effluent groundwater hydraulic gradients.

40|$|A {{committee}} of Civieltechnisch Centrum Uitvoering Research en Regelgeving (CUR) is currently (2012) {{working on the}} update of the handbook Quay Walls (CUR 211). In the past the partial safety factors in this book were derived using a spring model, but new developments enable to use Finite Element Methods (FEM) to model sheet-pile structures and quay walls with relieving floor. The main objective is to use FEM (in this case PLAXIS) to calibrate the partial safety factors. To fulfil this objective, level II probabilistic calculations (FORM) are performed using Prob 2 B (a toolbox from TNO) to define influence coefficients for the different parameters and reliability indices for the different failure mechanisms. This is done for two benchmark quay walls: an anchored sheet-pile and a quay wall with relieving floor. Both are designed according to the FEM design guidelines in CUR 166, the handbook on sheet-pile structures. Furthermore, the calculations require coefficients of variation for each stochastic parameter, correlation coefficients and definitions of Limit State Functions. These are all derived and presented in the report. With {{the output of the}} level II calculations, a level I method is used to define the partial safety factors and besides the design procedure of CUR 166 with FEM is evaluated and suggestions for adaptation for quay walls with relieving floor are presented. The main consequences according to the output of the probabilistic FEM calculations are: 1) Higher partial safety factors on the internal angle of friction and stiffness parameters of the soil 2) Lower partial safety factors on the geometrical parameters (<b>retaining</b> height, <b>water</b> <b>levels)</b> 3) Mean values for cohesion, sheet-pile parameters and anchor diameter 4) Changes in fault tree for quay walls with relieving floor 5) Adaptation of the in the handbook sheet-pile structures (CUR 166) prescribed calculation method using FEM for quay walls with relieving floor (CUR 211) 6) Additional effort in the research and calculations of other quay walls 7) Standardization of probabilistic calculations or sensitivity analysis in quay wall designHydraulic EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
