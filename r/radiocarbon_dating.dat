5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dating.</b> Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 {{using a combination of}} <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dating</b> and ceramic evidence.|$|E
25|$|Today the Blytt-Sernander {{sequence}} {{has been}} substantiated {{by a wide}} variety of scientific <b>dating</b> methods, mainly <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> obtained from peat. Earlier <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> were often left uncalibrated; that is, they were derived by assuming a constant concentration of atmospheric radiocarbon. In fact the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration has varied over time and thus <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> need to be calibrated.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Apparently {{aberrant}} <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> on a Thule culture antler artefact lead to {{the conclusion}} that this tool was made of material that was already ancient at the time of manufacture.

30|$|Fifty {{individuals}} were <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dated.</b> The {{distribution of the}} <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> {{is consistent with a}} more or less continuous use of the cemetery from the foundation in AD 1221 and until 1524, in fine accordance with the historical sources. One individual most likely pre-dated the foundation of the friary in AD 1221 – 1222. The stable isotope measurements indicate the absence of both freshwater and marine reservoir effects, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> can all be trusted to be accurate. The stable isotope measurements indicate a mixed agricultural/pastoral diet.|$|R

5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the water line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using <b>Radiocarbon</b> <b>dating.</b> Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dating</b> {{techniques}} date {{an object}} of popular interest, for example the Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E

Each of them were explosive, central vent eruptions with similar characteristics, but the 590-890 AD eruption caused no pyroclastic flows.|$|E

Earlier paleographic dating of 1QpHab indicated a date range of 30-1 BCE.|$|E

5000|$|Numerous <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> {{have been}} {{collected}} from the sediments, which fill the basins of Carolina bays. The majority of these samples, from which these dates were obtained, were collected from cores of undisturbed sediments that filled Carolina bays in North and South Carolina. These cores were collected to reconstruct region paleoenvironmental records using pollen, diatoms, and other fossils found in the distinctly and conformably layered sediments that fill the Carolina bays. Additional <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> have been obtained from organic matter collected from the undisturbed sediments filling Carolina bays by Bliley and Burney, Mixon and Pilkey, Thom, and Kaczorowski. Many <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates,</b> which were obtained from organic matter preserved within undisturbed sediments are greater than 14,000 BP radiocarbon in age. The finite <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> {{range in age from}} 440 ± 50 to 27,700 ±2,600 BP radiocarbon in age. Some samples are so old, they contained insufficient <b>radiocarbon</b> for <b>dating,</b> which results in [...] "greater than" [...] dates. For example, samples from sediments filling Carolina bays have been dated at greater than 38,000 to 49,550 BP radiocarbon years.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of t his {{paper is to}} present the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> that came available at {{the occasion of the}} systematic mapping of the Holocene deposits in the western coastal plain of Belgium. The mapping was undertaken by means of hand- and power-driven boreholes, the latter yielding suitable and sufficient material for age determinations on peatlayers. The power-driven boreholes are not regularly spread as they only form a complement t o the hand-augerholes. Hence the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> do not cover the entire plain, neighter all the significant changes in processes and sea-level tendencies. Therefore the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> will not be treated statistically. They serve a basis for reconstruction of coastal environments in space and time, which is a first essential step to be carried out before the evaluation of sea-level index points and the construction of a time-altitude graph. The <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> discussed in this paper are not calibrated. It never has been a common practice to calibrate <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> in geological studies for two reasons. Geological phenomena are not always datable in the rigorous meaning of the word, because often the investigated material obtains its carbon from different reservoirs. In many cases the relation between the radiocarbon age and the real time is not so important, as long as the relative age is known. The second reason is a pure practical one. The calibration curve goes only back t o about 7200 y BC. However not calibrating the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> includes an error if conclusions are t o be drawn in terms of absolute time and in terms of duration. The possibility of clustering <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dates</b> on random peat growth, due to the wiggles in the calibration curve, is to be considered (Geyh, 1980, De Jong, 1981...|$|R

5|$|A Roman bath {{house and}} Edwardian folly {{in the village}} of Whitestaunton were {{excavated}} by the archaeological television programme Time Team. There is also evidence of iron workings in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dating</b> has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron until the Middle Ages.|$|E

In the late 1990s, Peruvian archaeologists, led by Ruth Shady, provided the first extensive documentation of the civilization with work at Caral. A 2001 paper in Science, providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in Nature, describing fieldwork and <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>dating</b> across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.|$|E
