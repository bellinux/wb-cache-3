His work attempts to treat the body not as an object but a common condition. Since 2000 he experiments with different materials and media, including film. He repeatedly refers in his work on whole social groups and integrates their participation into the working process, (as in:Rolandtransfer, Child's play, Lernen ist sich Oeffnen) relying on Joseph Beuys term Soziale Plastik. In 2003 and 2004, Ralf Sander became visiting Professor at Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland.The annual exhibition Aquamediale was curated and initiated together with Sieghard Auer in 2005.In the same year, he was also appointed Reader at University of Ulster in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

World Saving Machine 2 transforms carbon dioxide into oxygen.The project was continued in collaboration with KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) University, Daedeok, Korea. In 2010, he became member of the commission board for Expo 2012 in Yeosu, South Korea.One year later, Sander won the international art commission for the Busan Cinema Center.
