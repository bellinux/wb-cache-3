5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes are protein {{complexes}} which degrade unneeded {{or damaged}} proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Enzymes that help such <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> called proteases.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> {{more common in}} people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to occur}} with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} {{side chains}} of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> {{determined by the}} groups on these side chains and are, therefore, different between {{the various types of}} amino acid.|$|E
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E

50|$|Chemical chain <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> first {{proposed}} by German chemist Max Bodenstein in 1913, and were reasonably well understood before nuclear chain <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> proposed.

(B) For a pericyclic reaction, if {{the total}} number of antarafacial {{components}} of a (4n + 2)-electron <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> even or {{the total number}} of antarafacial components of a 4n-electron <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> odd then it is thermally allowed; otherwise the <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> thermally forbidden.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media. Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> entirely {{in proportion to}} the things that happen to him.|$|E
5|$|NHCs {{are often}} {{strongly}} basic (the pKa {{value of the}} conjugate acid of an imidazol-2-ylidene was measured at ca. 24) and react with oxygen. Clearly these <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> performed using air-free techniques, avoiding compounds of even moderate acidity. Although imidazolium salts are stable to nucleophilic addition, other non-aromatic salts are not (i.e. formamidinium salts).|$|E
50|$|In organic chemistry, the Fujiwara-Moritani <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} cross {{coupling}} reaction where an aromatic C-H bond is directly coupled to an olefinic C-H bond, generating a new C-C bond. This <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> performed {{in the presence of}} a transition metal, typically palladium. The <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> discovered by Yuzo Fujiwara and Ichiro Moritani in 1967. An external oxidant is required to this <b>reaction</b> to <b>be</b> run catalytically. Thus, this <b>reaction</b> can <b>be</b> classified as a C-H activation reaction, an oxidative Heck reaction, and a C-H olefination. Surprisingly, the Fujiwara-Moritani <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> discovered before the Heck reaction.|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{reactions}} {{caused by}} tuberculin, various tuberculin fractions and various non-specific stimuli were studied in tuberculous animals. The <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> then {{compared with those}} in the Arthus phenomenon caused by tuberculin in animals previously sensitized with tuberculin. At an early stage tuberculin <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> evidently leukocytic, later monocytic <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> dominant. Apparently this process of the cellular <b>reactions</b> <b>is</b> related to the quantity of tuberculin injected. In general the cellular response, in tuberculin <b>reactions</b> <b>was</b> of a monocytic type, while that in the Arthus phenomenon was leukocytic. The difference between them seemed to be {{due to the fact that}} the tuberculin showed a reaction of a delayed type. These monocytic <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> more intense when purified tuberculin was used. The histological changes in the intracutaneous tuberculin <b>reaction</b> <b>were</b> fundamentally due to the vascular <b>reaction,</b> and <b>were</b> somewhat similar to those in the Arthus phenomenon, but at least a part of the regressive changes of the epidermis and the cutis, which were simultaneously observed, seemed to he primary when considered from the findings on the intracorneal reactions...|$|R
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> {{particularly important in}} the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|Such <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to go via an imidoyl chloride; {{in certain cases}} where it is stable, the imidoyl chloride is the final product.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{emphasizes}} on {{implementation of the}} adverse drug reaction reporting and monitoring system, in the Dermatology department of Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, by a clinical pharmacist, using different promotional activities. Documented adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> assessed and analyzed for incidence, purpose of visit, types, drug classes, individual drug causing adverse drug reactions, type of cutaneous reaction, and various predisposing factors. Management and outcome of the adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> also studied. Adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> also assessed for causality, using Naranjo&#x 2032;s scale, severity, and preventability, using Hartwig et al. scale. Adverse drug reaction attributes to 77 &#x 0025; of the hospital visit. Incidence of reported cutaneous adverse drug <b>reactions,</b> <b>were</b> 2. 85 &#x 0025;. Majority of the adverse drug reactions (96 &#x 0025;) were of type B. Antibiotics (30 &#x 0025;), were the common class of drugs, causing a cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Maximum number of adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> due to Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin, antitubercular drugs, and Phenytoin. Most of the adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> managed by withdrawal of drug (81 &#x 0025;), and 58 &#x 0025; patients were recovered from the reaction. Naranjos scale classifies, 29 as probable, 21 as possible, and 3 as definite adverse drug reactions. Most of the adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> of moderate severity, however 13 adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> severe.

5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
50|$|If k {{is greater}} than 1, the chain <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> supercritical, and the neutron {{population}} will grow exponentially. If k is less than 1, the chain <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> subcritical, and the neutron population will exponentially decay. If k = 1, the chain <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> critical and the neutron population will remain constant.|$|R
40|$|The aldol <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} and versatile methods for the construction of C-C bonds. Traditionally, this <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> developed in a stoichiometric version; however, great efforts in the development of chiral catalysts for aldol <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> performed in recent years. Thus, in this review article, the development of metal-mediated chiral catalysts in Mukaiyama-type aldol reaction, reductive aldol reaction and direct aldol <b>reaction</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Moreover, the application of these catalysts in the total synthesis of complex molecules is discussed...|$|R
50|$|A single {{chemical}} <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> said to {{have undergone}} autocatalysis, or be autocatalytic, {{if one of the}} <b>reaction</b> products <b>is</b> also a reactant and therefore a catalyst in the same or a coupled <b>reaction.</b> The <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> called an autocatalytic reaction.|$|R
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox <b>reactions</b> <b>are</b> carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space.
