50|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} protein (pRb) {{is involved in}} the regulation of cyclin A through its interaction with E2F. It exists in two states: hypophosphorylated pRb and hyperphosphorylated pRb. Hypophosphorylated pRb binds E2F, which prevents transcription of cyclin A. The absence of cyclin A prior to the <b>R</b> <b>point</b> is due to the inhibition of E2F by hypophosphorylated pRb. After the cell passes through the <b>R</b> <b>point,</b> cyclin D/E- complexes phosphorylate pRb. Hyperphosphorylated pRb can no longer bind E2F, E2F is released and cyclin A genes, and other crucial genes for S phase, are transcribed.|$|E

40|$|Genome {{replication}} in eukaryotic cells necessitates the stringent coupling of histone biosynthesis {{with the}} onset of DNA replication at the G 1 /S phase transition. A fundamental question is the mechanism that links the restriction (<b>R)</b> <b>point</b> late in G 1 with histone gene expression at the onset of S phase. Here we demonstrate that HiNF-P, a transcriptional regulator of replication-dependent histone H 4 genes, interacts directly with p 220 (NPAT), a substrate of cyclin E/CDK 2, to coactivate histone genes during S phase. HiNF-P and p 220 are targeted to, and colocalize at, subnuclear foci (Cajal bodies) in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Genetic or biochemical disruption of the HiNF-P/p 220 interaction compromises histone H 4 gene activation at the G 1 /S phase transition and impedes cell cycle progression. Our results show that HiNF-P and p 220 form a critical regulatory module that directly links histone H 4 gene expression at the G 1 /S phase transition to the cyclin E/CDK 2 signaling pathway at the <b>R</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{has been proven}} that epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) significantly benefits advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR mutations in progression-free survival time with better tolerance. This study is undertaken to analyze efficacy and tolerance of advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations taking EGFR-TKI as a first-line therapy. Methods Tumor samples from 54 patients with advanced NSCLC were examined for EGFR activating mutations (deletion mutation in exon 19 and the L 858 <b>R</b> <b>point</b> mutation in exon 21) by direct sequencing. The patients were first-line treated with oral administration of EGFR-TKI until disease progression. The efficacy and adverse events were observed, and survival was followed up. Results Among the patients, 61 % (33 of 54) had EGFR exon 19 deletion, and 39 % (21 of 54) had EGFR L 858 <b>R</b> <b>point</b> mutation. All patients received first-line TKI therapy. The total response rate was 96 %, median progression free survival (PFS) was 8. 3 months and median survival was 19. 5 months. The patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion had significantly longer median PFS (9 versus 7 months, P= 0. 002) and longer median overall survival (OS) (25 versus 16 months, P= 0. 001) than patients with EGFR L 858 <b>R</b> <b>point</b> mutation. There is no significance in efficacy between gefitinib and erlotinib, and gefitinib is safer than erlotinib. The most common adverse events were rash and diarrhea. Two (4 %) grade 4 skin toxity effects, two (4 %) grade 3 aminotransferase level elevations, and one (1) grade 3 stomatitis were observed. Conclusion The first-line EGFR-TKI treatment in advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations is efficient and safe, which is more efficient in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion than those with EGFR L 858 R mutation...|$|E

40|$|It is {{becoming}} evident that defective cell cycle regulation {{is an important}} property of the cancer cell. The restriction point (R), a G 1 checkpoint after which cell cycle progression becomes independent of extracellular growth factors, is often aberrant in cancer cells. The molecular mechanism governing R is unknown, but hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the tumour suppressor retinoblastoma (pRb) has been suggested as a potential candidate. We examined the temporal relationship between R and pRb phosphorylation using methods for detailed single cell analysis. We found that that phosphorylation of pRb occurs after passage through R and therefore is not the mechanism regulating passage through R. Instead, phosphorylation of pRb seems to constitute a separate checkpoint in late G 1 which possibly regulates S phase entry. Cyclin D-cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) 4 / 6 phosphorylates pRb in response to growth factor stimulation and we studied the timing of cyclin D and pRb colocalisation {{in relation to the}} <b>R</b> <b>point</b> and pRb phosphorylation. We found that cyclin D and pRb only colocalise in late G 1, after passage through R, with kinetics similar to pRb phosphorylation. This strongly suggests that intra-nuclear translocation of cyclin D to pRb is involved in regulation of pRb phosphorylation and not in passage through R. This further supports our finding that pRb phosphorylation is not the mechanism behind the restriction point. R occurs at a set time after mitosis, implying that the <b>R</b> <b>point</b> mechanism might be related to events that occur during mitosis. In support of this notion, time-lapse videomicroscopy analysis revealed that early post mitotic cells, prior to passage through R, undergo a transient change in cell shape associated with cell cycle exit when subjected to serum starvation. However, addition of growth factors was shown to counteract both the change in cell shape and cell cycle exit induced by serum withdrawal. In conclusion, our data suggest that reorganisation of the cytoskeleton and/or cell adhesion to ECM after exit from mitosis is involved in <b>R</b> <b>point</b> passage. To study cell growth in relation to pRb phosphorylation we inhibited rRNA synthesis through treatment with actinomycin D. This induces cell cycle arrest in G 1 cells, but not in S phase cells. This G 1 arrest was shown to be associated with inhibited pRb phosphorylation. We also observed that protein synthesis was not inhibited in actinomycin D treated, G 1 arrested, cells. This indicates that ribosome biogenesis is involved in the regulation of a late G 1 checkpoint that is separate from the <b>R</b> <b>point</b> and involves pRb phosphorylation, but not mass accumulation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{cell cycle}} {{is a complex}} process that allows {{eukaryotic}} cells to replicate chromosomal DNA and partition it into two daughter cells. A relevant regulatory step is in the G 0 /G 1 phase, a point called the restriction (<b>R)</b> <b>point</b> where intracellular and extracellular signals are monitored and integrated. Subcellular localization of cell cycle proteins is increasingly recognized as a major factor that regulates cell cycle transitions. Nevertheless, current mathematical models of the G 1 /S networks of mammalian cells do not consider this aspect. Hence, {{there is a need}} for a computational model that incorporates this regulatory aspect that has a relevant role in cancer, since altered localization of key cell cycle players, notably of inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, has been reported to occur in neoplastic cells and to be linked to cancer aggressiveness. Results The network of the model components involved in the G 1 to S transition process was identified through a literature and web-based data mining and the corresponding wiring diagram of the G 1 to S transition drawn with Cell Designer notation. The model has been implemented in Mathematica using Ordinary Differential Equations. Time-courses of level and of sub-cellular localization of key cell cycle players in mouse fibroblasts re-entering the cell cycle after serum starvation/re-feeding have been used to constrain network design and parameter determination. The model allows to recapitulate events from growth factor stimulation to the onset of S phase. The <b>R</b> <b>point</b> estimated by simulation is consistent with the <b>R</b> <b>point</b> experimentally determined. Conclusion The major element of novelty of our model of the G 1 to S transition is the explicit modeling of cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, their inhibitor and complexes. Sensitivity analysis of the network performance newly reveals that the biological effect brought about by Cki overexpression is strictly dependent on whether the Cki is promoting nuclear translocation of cyclin/Cdk containing complexes. </p...|$|E
