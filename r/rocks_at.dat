5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry <b>Rocks</b> <b>at</b> Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E

5|$|Geochronology {{of several}} Archean rock units {{establishes}} {{a sequence of}} events, approximately 75 million years in duration, leading {{to the formation of}} a new crustal segment. The oldest <b>rocks,</b> <b>at</b> 2,650 million years old, are basic metavolcanics with largely calc-alkaline characteristics. Radiometric dating indicates ages of 2,640 to 2,620 million years are recorded for the syn-kinematic quartz diorite batholiths and 2,590 to 2,100 million years for the major late-kinematic bodies. Pegmatitic adamellites, at 2,575±25 million years, are the youngest plutonic units.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost of {{the beaches}} is Playa Las Terrazas or Playa Principal (The Terraces Beach or Main Beach), {{which is in}} front of Ross Park. It is popular for surfing. Near the beach and at Ross Park, there are balustrades and long stairs dating from the early 1900s. There is a balcony over the <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> the {{southern}} end of the beach. It is the busiest during the summer months. Several surf schools, such as La Ola Perfecta, and Lobos del Pacífico, are located nearby, as is the fish market at Fishermen Creek.|$|E
5|$|After {{being thrown}} out of the theater by the manager, the gang shoplift from the Kwik-E-Mart, throw <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> the Jebediah Springfield statue, and watch clouds. Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E

5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny lobster {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E
5|$|Ganoga Lake {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau, {{just north}} of the Allegheny Front, which is the {{boundary}} between the dissected plateau to the north and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. Kitchen Creek, which drains the lake, drops approximately 1,000feet (300m) in 2.25miles (3.62km) as it flows down the steep escarpment of the Allegheny Front. About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the Alleghenian orogeny. This happened long after the sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> the lake were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land around the lake today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour reached Nîmes, near the {{home town of}} Payan, whose fans were angry because of his disqualification. They threw <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> the riders, and barricaded the road. The cyclists had {{troubles}} passing through Nîmes, and several were injured. The most important event for the general classification was when César Garin's bicycle was broken by attackers; {{he had to find}} a new bicycle, which took him 15 minutes. Further on, nails and broken glass were spread along the road. Many riders punctured, but there were no serious falls. The cyclists passed this part walking. After Nîmes, a leading group of five cyclists was formed: Maurice Garin, Pothier, Aucouturier, Cornet and Beaugendre. Aucouturier and Cornet escaped, and Aucouturier won, beating Cornet in the sprint.|$|E

5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E
5|$|The oldest <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> Irruputuncu are lavas {{that have}} been dated by potassium-argon dating to 10.8 ± 0.6 mya. The oldest {{component}} clearly belonging to the volcano is the El Pozo ignimbrite that was erupted 258.2 ± 48.8 ka, forming a multi-layered ignimbrite that was probably generated by the injection of new, hot magma into older, cooler magma. A lava dome on the upper flank {{on the western side}} of the volcano is 0.14 ± 0.04 mya old. The block-and-ash flow between 55.9 ka and 140 ka old, but has not been pecisely dated. The Crater lavas are 55.9 ± 26.8 ka old. The block-and-ash flow on the southwestern flank was formed 1570 ± 900 years BP.|$|E

5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E
5|$|As Ethalion subdued Thetis the {{remainder}} of the British squadron continued southwards in pursuit of Santa Brigida. Pillon was an experienced officer with a good knowledge of the Northern Spanish coast and he intended to lose his pursuers in the rocky channels of Cape Finisterre. Early on 17 October he reached Spanish coastal waters, rounding Finisterre just beyond the Monte Lora rocks. Captain Gore on Triton, which was in full flow at seven knots, was unaware of the obstacle and at 05:00 crashed into them, coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship's hull. Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit, assisted by Digby on Alcmene who was able to block Pillon's route into Porte de Vidre. Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigida at 07:00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter in the <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> Commarurto close to the safe harbour at Muros, Pillon's movement hampered by the coastal rias that blocked the wind. After an hour of resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces. Santa Brigida had lost two men killed and eight wounded, Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded.|$|E
5|$|As the day progresses, Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) becomes {{restless and}} sneaks {{into the barn}} to observe Randall; Randall tries to {{convince}} Carl to release him. Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> it and then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of its legs and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before running back to camp, not telling anyone what happened. Meanwhile, Beth (Emily Kinney) has since recovered from her earlier suicide attempt. When Glenn (Steven Yeun) comes {{to check on her}} condition, Hershel (Scott Wilson) gives him a family heirloom representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan).|$|E

5|$|On 21 June 1908 500,000 activists rallied in Hyde Park {{to demand}} votes for women; Asquith and leading MPs responded with indifference. Angered by this intransigence and abusive police activity, some WSPU members {{increased}} {{the severity of}} their actions. Soon after the rally, twelve women gathered in Parliament Square and tried to deliver speeches for women's suffrage. Police officers seized several of the speakers and pushed them into a crowd of opponents who had gathered nearby. Frustrated, two WSPU members – Edith New and Mary Leigh – went to 10 Downing Street and hurled <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> {{the windows of the}} Prime Minister's home. They insisted their act was independent of WSPU command, but Pankhurst expressed her approval of the action. When a magistrate sentenced New and Leigh to two months' imprisonment, Pankhurst reminded the court of how various male political agitators had broken windows to win legal and civil rights throughout Britain's history.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E
5|$|The Moine Thrust in Assynt {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied {{geological}} features in the world. Its discovery in the 1880s was a milestone in the history of geology as it was one of the first thrust belts in the world to be identified. Investigations by John Horne and Benjamin Peach resolved a dispute between Murchison and Geikie on the one hand and James Nicol and Charles Lapworth on the other. The latter believed that older Moine rocks lay on top of younger Cambrian <b>rocks</b> <b>at</b> Knockan Crag, and Horne and Peach's work confirmed this in their classic paper The Geological Structure of the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, which was published in 1907. A statue to these two pioneers of fieldwork was erected at Inchnadamph near the hotel there which played a prominent part in the annals of early geology. This area is at the heart of the 'North West Highlands Geopark'.|$|E
