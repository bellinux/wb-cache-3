30|$|At this point, the editor’s role becomes important. The editor {{should not}} decide {{the fate of}} an article in {{accordance}} with the reviewers’ opinions. The publisher, Springer, provides some guidelines for poor reviews. If the review process is too immediate after an article is received, the reviewer may not read the article carefully. Illogical reviews may be caused by the improper selection of reviewers. The current level of science is highly segmented. Accordingly, the gross classification of science makes it difficult to select proper reviewers. Some reviewers request the inclusion of their own articles as references to improve their own citation records [3]. Although they were selected as reviewers because of their specialty, the forced inclusion of their own articles was not deemed to be ethical. If the reviewer added new critics in each <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>review,</b> the author may be required to perform endless corrections. If the reviewer did a careful review, all of the critics should be shown the first <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> Adding new critics in the second <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> means that the reviewer’s initial review was careless.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{analytical}} and numerical solutions of the formation and evolution of the localized plastic zone in a uniaxially loaded bar with variable cross-sectional area. An energy-based variational approach is employed and the governing equations with appropriate physical boundary conditions, jump conditions, and regularity conditions at evolving elasto-plastic interface are derived for a fourth-order explicit gradient plasticity model with linear isotropic softening. Four examples that differ by regularity of the yield stress and stress distributions are presented. Results for the load level, size of the plastic zone, distribution of plastic strain and its spatial derivatives, plastic elongation, and energy balance are constructed and compared to another, previously discussed non-variational gradient formulation.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and extended formulation of a rate-independent regularized damage model proposed by Mielke and Roubíček (2006). Localization properties are studied {{in the context of}} a simple one-dimensional problem, but the results reveal the fundamental features of the basic model and of its modified versions. The initial bifurcation from a uniform solution is described analytically while the complete failure process is studied numerically. Modifications of the regularizing term and of the dissipation distance are introduced and their effect on the global response is investigated. It is shown that, with a proper combination of model parameters, a realistic shape of the load-displacement diagram can be achieved and pathological effects such as extremely brittle response or expansion of the damage zone accompanied by stress locking can be eliminated.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} reliable communication over non-binary insertion/deletion channels where symbols are randomly deleted from or inserted in the transmitted sequence and all symbols are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. To this end, we utilize the inherent redundancy achievable in non-binary symbol sets by first expanding the symbol set and then allocating part of the bits associated with each symbol to watermark symbols. The watermark sequence, known at the receiver, is then used by a forward-backward algorithm to provide soft information for an outer code which decodes the transmitted sequence. Through numerical results and discussions, we evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed solution and show that it leads to significant system ability to detect and correct insertions/deletions. We also provide estimates of the maximum achievable information rates of the system, compare them with the available bounds, and construct practical codes capable of approaching these limits.

40|$|The distance- 3 cyclic lowest-density MDS array code (called the C-Code) {{is a good}} {{candidate}} for RAID 6 because of its optimal storage efficiency, optimal update complexity, optimal length, and cyclic symmetry. In this paper, the underlying connections between C-Codes (or quasi-C-Codes) and starters in group theory are revealed. It is shown that each C-Code (or quasi-C-Code) of length $ 2 n$ can be constructed using an even starter (or even multi-starter) in $(Z_{ 2 n},+) $. It is also shown that each C-Code (or quasi-C-Code) has a twin C-Code (or quasi-C-Code). Then, four infinite families (three of which are new) of C-Codes of length $p- 1 $ are constructed, where $p$ is a prime. Besides the family of length $p- 1 $, C-Codes for some sporadic even lengths are also presented. Even so, there are still some even lengths (such as 8) for which C-Codes do not exist. To cover this limitation, two infinite families (one of which is new) of quasi-C-Codes of length $ 2 (p- 1) $ are constructed for these even lengths.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a network communications problem in which multiple correlated sources must {{be delivered to}} a single data collector node, over a network of noisy independent point-to-point channels. We prove that perfect reconstruction of all the sources at the sink is possible if and only if, for all partitions of the network nodes into two subsets S and S^c such that the sink is always in S^c, we have that H(U_S|U_S^c) < ∑_i∈ S,j∈ S^c C_ij. Our main finding is that in this setup a general source/channel separation theorem holds, and that Shannon information behaves as a classical network flow, identical in nature to {{the flow of water}} in pipes. At first glance, it might seem surprising that separation holds in a fairly general network situation like the one we study. A closer look, however, reveals that {{the reason for this is}} that our model allows only for independent point-to-point channels between pairs of nodes, and not multiple-access and/or broadcast channels, for which separation is well known not to hold. This "information as flow" view provides an algorithmic interpretation for our results, among which perhaps the most important one is the optimality of implementing codes using a layered protocol stack.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{broadcasting}} layered video streams over heterogeneous single-hop wireless networks using feedback-free random linear network coding (RLNC). We combine RLNC with unequal error protection (UEP) and our main purpose is twofold. First, to systematically investigate the benefits of UEP+RLNC layered approach in servicing users with different reception capabilities. Second, to study the effect of not using feedback, by comparing feedback-free schemes with idealistic full-feedback schemes. To these ends, we study `expected percentage of decoded frames' as a key content-independent performance metric and propose a general framework for calculation of this metric, which can highlight the effect of key system, video and channel parameters. We study the effect of number of layers and propose a scheme that selects the optimum number of layers adaptively to achieve the highest performance. Assessing the proposed schemes with real H. 264 test streams, the trade-offs among the users' performances are discussed and the gain of adaptive selection of number of layers to improve the trade-offs is shown. Furthermore, {{it is observed that}} the performance gap between the proposed feedback-free scheme and the idealistic scheme is very small and the adaptive selection of number of video layers further closes the gap.

40|$|This thesis was {{commissioned}} by a large enterprise. The company requires a vulnerability management solution, which {{would enable them to}} manage vulnerabilities throughout the product life cycle. An analysis was required on whether such solution should be purchased or built as an internal project. This study was completed in two main phases. First, a make-or-buy decision was done based on the analysis. Second, a suitable VMS design and implementation was suggested. To collect input for the analysis, all potential users were identified and from them groups of volunteers were invited to interviews. The data from the focus group interviews was then processed and documented in the form of requirement specification for Vulnerability Management Service (VMS). Commercial off-the-shelf solutions were compared against the list of requirements. A second <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> was done with selected commercial products, which fulfilled majority of the requirements. As a result of the performed comparisons, this study concluded that building an own solution would deliver higher Return on Investment (ROI) in long term perspective.

The study goes on to provide guidelines for service design and implementation based on industry best practices.
