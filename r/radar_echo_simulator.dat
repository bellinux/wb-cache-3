Using an X-band vertically pointing radar data at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway and synoptic weather charts, the <b>radar</b> <b>echo</b> characteristics are investigated for one year between April 1994 and March 1995. <b>Radar</b> <b>echoes</b> have distinct seasonal variations with respect to height.
