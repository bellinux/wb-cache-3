40|$|A {{reinforced}} concrete column {{is composed of}} two main load bearing mechanisms; concrete and a steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage.</b> The concrete is the primary vertical load bearing mechanism with the steel cage providing some vertical load carrying capacity while serving mainly to confine the core concrete.

40|$|Abstract: Headed {{reinforcement}} is {{a relatively}} new product and has not been used in many applications. Headed reinforcing bars have been extensively used in the construction of offshore oil platforms where hooked bars have traditionally been used to anchor longitudinal reinforcement or bars bent for ties and transverse reinforcement. Hooks and bent-bar ties create a large amount of congestion in the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage</b> which leads to difficulties during construction. Using headed reinforcement removes the tail extensions of hooks and allows fewer larger bars to be used, greatly reducing the congestion of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage.</b> It has been found that the use of headed reinforcement can greatly decrease the time needed to erect the reinforcement resulting in large cost savings. Headed reinforcement has also been used in a few projects for strengthening and repairing footings of highway structures. A total 81 Pullout test were performed to the study of Bond behavior of Headed reinforcement bar in concrete with different Embedment length with various diameters of bars, various grade of concrete and various sizes of cubes.

The values of the bearing capacity of RIT piles identified on the basis of static field tests of specific construction facilities are provided. Nine RIT pile buildings, the height of which varied from 90 to 140 meters, were built before 2012. The total number of high-rise buildings that rest on RIT piles is equal to nine. They are made of fine concrete prepared according to State Standard 26633 - 91 *, B 30 class of compression strength, and W 10 grade of water permeability. The reinforcement of RIT piles was performed through the application of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage</b> composed of two sections. A 500 C steel was used for longitudinal (bearing) rods, the design compressive strength was equal to 435 MPa; dimensions of the bearing steel were based on the principle of perception of the whole design load.

On the basis of the analysis of the monitoring results, the technology and tests of PIT piles, a conclusion can be made that PIT piles, that have a diameter of 320 mm, assure the pre-set reliability of high-rise buildings in complex engineering and geological environments.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{has shown}} that the {{development}} of the instrumentation necessary to provide in-situ thermal imaging for the determination of homogeneity of concrete is theoretically sound. Drilled shafts are large diameter underground cast-in-place columns that necessarily rely on sound integrity to properly withstand imposed loadings. As a by-product of the most common construction techniques, the entire process is often completely blind whereby the excavation and concreting processes are conducted {{beneath the surface of the}} water table (or slurry level). This results in an inability to inspect the final product and in many cases allows anomalous inclusions (soil cave-ins, slurry pockets, etc) to go undetected especially when they are formed outside the steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage.</b> In an effort to gain verification of the as-built, below ground structure, numerous non-destructive test methods have been devised. Each of these methods have merits and drawbacks with regards to the full extent of the tested concrete volume. To further this cause, a new methodology was developed that uses the energy from hydrating concrete to assess the presence or absence of an intact concrete. Therein, the temperature generated by the curing concrete can be measured and correlated to the probable dimensions of the drilled shaft. This thesis outlines the development of the instrumentation capable of making in-situ temperature measurement of drilled shafts to assure the homogeneity of concrete is acceptable. To that end, several configurations of instrumentation approach were tested on varying scales from small lab specimens to full-size field constructed drilled shafts. The bulk of this work was conducted several years before the completion of the thesis and has the benefit of noting later developments. For instance, this study was used to seed future research and led to subsequent FDOT and WSDOT (Washington State DOT) funded research for the express purpose of identifying capabilities of thermal testing in those states. Likewise, present day practice and use of the approach has also been documented...|$|E
40|$|Rehabilitation and {{maintenance}} of the aging transportation infrastructure are of major concern in the Province of Ontario. A large portion of this work {{is related to the}} durability of highway bridges around the province. One of the weakest points in a bridge structure from a durability aspect is the expansion joints that can allow harmful elements, such as road salts and contaminants to leak down from the road surface and attack the supporting structure of the bridge. Although expansion joints can be eliminated in the design of a new bridge, such as in an integral abutment bridge, this requires major changes to the supports and structure of the bridge, making it impractical for retrofitting existing bridges. One effective alternative is the replacement of a traditional expansion joint with a link slab. A link slab is a concrete slab used in place of an expansion joint to make the bridge deck continuous while keeping the supporting girders simply supported [1]. Link slabs must be able to resist large force effects both in bending and direct tension while minimizing cracking [2], one solution is to use the high tensile and flexural strength properties of an ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) [3]. The UHPFRC mixtures are often proprietary and expensive. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the potential of using common fibre types with standard concrete ingredients in a fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) as an alternative to UHPFRC in a link slab. Using a selection of macro fibres commonly used in slab on grade applications for crack control, an optimized FRC mixture was developed following the principals established by Rossi and Harrouche [4]. This mixture was then used with a variety of fibre types to evaluate the structural and durability properties of the FRC. Testing was conducted for fresh mixture properties, compressive, tensile and flexural strength as well as freezing and thawing resistance, linear shrinkage, environmental and salt exposure along with other durability tests. Results showed that the concrete mixture used for an FRC link slab should consist of; an equal ratio of fine and coarse aggregate by weight and a higher than normal percentage of cement paste, for optimal workability and a dosage of 1. 5 % by volume of macro steel fibres. Hooked-end steel fibres resulted in the best performance increase to the FRC of the six fibre types tested. Results also showed that <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage</b> for an FRC link slab should be designed to ensure that fibres can evenly reach all areas of the link slab form to give homogeneous fibre distribution. Although the FRCs created did not perform to the high level of a UHPFRC, these results show a consistent and effective FRC can be created, for use in a link slab with common fibres and standard concrete materials to provide a less expensive and more widely available FRC link slab than UHPFRC...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Concrete filled {{double skin}} tube (CFDST) columns {{is a new}} method of column construction. CFDST columns {{consists}} of two steel hollow sections, one inside the other, concentrically aligned. The cross-sections of the two hollow sections {{does not have to}} be the same shape. Concrete is cast in between the two hollow sections resulting in a CFDST. This study only considers CFDST columns constructed with circular steel hollow sections. The advantages of CFDST construction include: ● The inner and outer steel hollow sections replaces the traditional steel reinforcement that would be used in a normal reinforced concrete column. This reduces the construction time since there is no need to construct a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cage.</b> ● The steel hollow sections acts as a stay in place formwork, eliminating the need for traditional formwork. This also reduces construction time. ● The steel hollow sections confine the concrete, making it more ductile and increasing its yield strength. The objective of this study is to identify methods that can predict the axial capacity of eccentrically loaded circular CFDST columns. Methods chosen for the investigation are: 1. Finite element model (FEM). A model was developed to predict the behaviour of eccentrically loaded CFDST columns. The FE model uses a concrete material model proposed in literature for stub columns. The aim was to determine whether the material model is suited for this application. 2. The failure load of CFDST columns under concentric loading was calculated using a model obtained in literature. These capacities were compared to the experimental test results of eccentrically loaded CFDST columns to establish a correlation. This study found that the concrete material model used does not adequately capture the behaviour resulting in the axial response of the column being too stiff. The difference between the eccentrically loaded experimental test results and the calculated concentrically loaded capacity showed a clear trend that could be used to predict the capacity of eccentrically loaded CFDST columns. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Beton-gevulde dubbel laag pyp (BGDLP) kolomme is ‘n nuwe metode van kolom konstruksie. BGDLP kolomme bestaan uit twee staal pyp snitte, die een binne die ander geplaas met hul middelpunte opgelyn, die dwarssnit van die twee pype hoef nie dieselfde vorm te wees nie. Beton word dan in die wand tussen die twee pyp snitte gegiet. Die resultaat is ‘n hol beton snit. Hierdie studie handel slegs oor BGDLP kolomme wat met ronde pyp snitte verwaardig is. Die volgende voordele kan aan BGDLP toegeken word: ● Die binne en buite staalpype vervang die tradisionele staal bewapening was in normale bewapende-beton gebruik sou word. Dus verminder dit die tyd wat dit sal neem om die kolom op te rig. ● Die staalpypsnitte is ook permanente vormwerk. Dit doen dus weg met die gebruik van normale bekisting, wat ook konstruksie tyd spaar. ● Die buite-staalpypsnit bekamp die uitsetting van die beton onder las. Hierdie bekamping veroorsaak dat die beton se gedrag meer daktiel is en ‘n hoër falings spanning kan bereik. Die doel van die studie is om metodes te identifiseer wat gebruik kan word om die aksiale kapasiteit onder eksentriese laste van BGDLP kolomme te bepaal. Twee metodes was gekies: 1. Eindige element model. ‘n Model was ontwikkel om die gedrag van BGDLP kolomme te voorspel. Die mikpunt was om te bepaal of ‘n beton materiaal gedrag model vanuit die literatuur gebruik kan word om BGDLP kolomme te modelleer. 2. Die swiglas van BGDLP kolomme onder konsentriese belasting was bereken vanaf vergelykings uit die literatuur. Hierdie swiglaste was vergelyk met die eksperimentele toets resultate vir eksentriese belaste BGDLP kolomme om ‘n korrelasie te vind. Hierdie studie het bewys dat die beton materiaal model uit die literatuur kan nie gebruik word om die swiglaste van BGDLP kolomme te bepaal nie. Die model het die gedrag te styf gemodelleer. Die verskil tussen die berekende konsentriese belaste swiglas en die eksperimentele resultate van eksentriese BGDLP kolomme was voorspelbaar en kan gebruik word om die swiglas van eksentriese belaste BGDLP kolomme te voorspel...|$|E

How does a company achieve a better production management for a more predictable manufacturing? A description was made of the current state by mapping the manufacturing processes of <b>reinforced</b> <b>cages</b> with help of observations and literature studies. A value stream map was made to analyze the processes, which affects the productions outcome the most. The authors used an efficiency analysis of one of the main processes. To ensure that they had the right amount of input the process was observed for five days, in which they timed the process to get substantial data of unplanned stops and cycle times. It was discovered that one of the main elements that affected the production was the failure rate of the drawings used to produce reinforcement cages. With input from the factory audit department the authors could calculate 17 % of all drawings needed correction. When a drawing is incomplete it can keep the production waiting in an unpredictable amount of time, until the necessary changes have been made by the constructor to correct the errors.

Four different GFRP cage typologies are analysed and applied as a reinforcement in full-scale tunnel segments. Both bending and point load tests are developed and the structural performances of the specimens are compared and discussed. Finally, the best solution, in terms of cost-benefit analysis is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{techniques}} in acetabular revision for bone loss {{are related to}} the size and localization of acetabular defects, as described by Paprosky and revised by Italian Group of Revision prosthesis (GIR). In larger defects there is a definite indication for massive allografts. The use of these allografts should depend from a strict selection of the graft, performed in cooperation with the tissue bank and using accurate radiological studies (CT); grafts should be <b>reinforced</b> with metal <b>cages</b> and cups with large head diameter to avoid dislocations. In our experience we prefer performing a pressurized cementing of the allograft before applying the metal cage. It is mandatory to obtain a good bone-to-bone contact between osteotomies, and the fixation must be reinforced on the posterior column. In addition to a large head diameter, a snap-fit cup may be used. Significant attention should also be paid to muscular reattachment for functional outcome and antibiotic prophylaxis must be performed due to the higher risk of infection in revision surgery. By following these instructions results of massive allografts for periacetabular reconstructions may be superior to custom-made metallic prostheses, as shown by many Authors. In the end, even if not free from major complications, massive allograft reconstruction still remain of primary interest and is the main option in hip revision surgery in cases of large bone defects...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of lateral confining reinforcement on the ductile behaviour of reinforced concrete columns. The contents of the chapters are summarized as follows. In Chapter one, the general problems in seismic design are discussed and earthquake design methods based on the ductile design approach are described. Japanese, New Zealand and United States design codes are compared. Finally, the scope of this research project is outlined. In Chapter two, after reviewing previous research on confined concrete, the factors which affect the effectiveness of lateral confinement are discussed. Especially the effects of the yield strength of transverse reinforcement, the compressive strength of plain concrete and the strain gradient in the column section due to bending are discussed based on tests which were conducted by the author et al at Kyoto University and Akashi Technological College, Japan. In the axial compression tests on spirally reinforced concrete cylinders (150 mm in diameter by 300 mm in height), the yield strength of transverse reinforcement and the compressive strength of plain concrete were varied from 161 MPa to 1352 MPa and from 17 MPa to 60 MPa, respectively, as experimental parameters. It is found that, when high strength spirals are used as confining reinforcement, the strength and ductility of the confined core concrete are remarkably enhanced but need to be estimated assuming several failure modes which could occur. These are based on the observations that concrete cylinders with high strength spirals suddenly failed at a concrete compressive strain of 2 to 3. 5 % due to explosive crushing of the core concrete between the spiral bars or due to bearing failure of the core concrete immediately beneath the spiral bars, while the concrete cylinders with ordinary strength spirals failed in a gentle manner normally observed. In addition, eccentric loading tests were conducted on concrete columns with 200 mm square section confined by square spirals. It is found that the effectiveness of confining reinforcement is reduced by the presence of the strain gradient along the transverse section of column. In Chapter three, the effectiveness of transverse reinforcement with various types of anchorage details which simplify the fabrication of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>cages</b> are investigated. Eight reinforced concrete columns, with either 400 mm or 550 mm square cross sections, were tested subjected to axial compression loading and cyclic lateral loading which simulated a severe earthquake. The transverse reinforcement consisted of arrangements of square perimeter hoops with 135 ° end hooks, cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° or 180 ° end hooks, and 'U' and 'J' shaped cross ties and perimeter hoops with tension splices. Conclusions are reached with regard to the effectiveness of the tested anchorage details in the plastic hinge regions of columns designed for earthquake resistance. In Chapter four, the effectiveness of interlocking spirals as transverse reinforcement is studied. Firstly, the general aspects and the related problems of interlocking spirals to provide adequate ductility in the potential plastic hinge region of columns are discussed, referring to the provisions in the New Zealand code,the CALTRANS (California Transportation Authority) code and other related codes. Secondly, based on those discussions, a design method to securely interlock the spirals is proposed. Thirdly, the effectiveness of interlocking spirals is assessed based on column tests conducted as part of this study. Three columns with interlocking spirals and, for comparison, one rectangular column with rectangular hoopsandcross ties, were tested under cyclic horizontal loading which simulated a severe earthquake. The sections of those columns were 400 mm by 600 mm. In Chapter five, analytical models to investigate the buckling behaviour of longitudinal reinforcement restrained by cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° end hooks and by peripheral hoops are proposed. The analyzed results using the proposed models compare well with the experimental observations described in Chapter three. Using those proposed models, a method to check the effectiveness of cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° end hooks is proposed for practical design purposes. In Chapter six, a theory for the prediction of the ultimate longitudinal compressive concrete strain at the stage of first hoop fracture referred to as the "Energy Balance Theory", which has been developed by Mander, Priestley and Park at University of Canterbury, is introduced. After discussing the problems in the "Energy Balance Theory", a modified theory for the prediction of the ultimate longitudinal compressive concrete strain at the stage of first hoop fracture is proposed. The predictions from the modified theory are found to compare well with previous experimental results...|$|R
