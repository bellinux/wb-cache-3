For diffusion-type processes, our main focus is on their transient regimes and specifically the crossover features, when initially infinite number of the pdf moments drops down to a few or none at all.

40|$|Fractional {{repetition}} (FR) codes is {{a family}} of codes for distributed storage systems that allow for uncoded repair having the minimum repair bandwidth. However, in contrast to minimum bandwidth regenerating codes, where a random set of certain size of available nodes is used for a node repair, the repairs with FR codes are table based. In this work we consider bounds on the fractional repetition capacity. Optimal FR codes which attain these bounds are presented. The constructions of optimal FR codes are based on combinatorial designs and on different families of regular and biregular graphs. Finding optimal codes raises some interesting questions in graph theory. We discuss these questions and their solutions. In addition, we analyze other properties of the constructed codes, allowing parallel independent reads of many subsets of the stored symbols, by showing a connection to combinatorial batch codes. We also define for each code a <b>rate</b> <b>hierarchy</b> which resembles to the well known generalized Hamming weight hierarchy. ...|$|R

One possible coexistence mechanism is partitioning of the highly variable and dynamic forest light environment, in which species that grow better in one light treatment grow worse in another. To test whether species respond differently to the light environment, we estimated growth rates of 21 Dipterocarpaceae species from Malaysian Borneo grown in shade houses for 2 yr in three light treatments (0. 3 %, 3 %, and 18 % full sunlight). We made regular measurements of height, diameter, and aboveground biomass, enabling us to calculate growth rates for each response. We estimated size-specific growth rates using nonlinear mixed-effects models, as average relative growth rate was strongly size dependent. For all species, the greatest diameter growth rate was achieved in 18 percent full sunlight, whereas for five of the twenty-one species, the greatest height growth rate was achieved in three percent full sunlight. We investigated correlations among growth rates in different light treatments, but no negative correlations were found, indicating that species growing well in one light treatment did not grow poorly in the others. There were substantial crossovers, however, in species ranks among the three light treatments, indicating that there was no single growth <b>rate</b> <b>hierarchy</b> common to all light treatments. The lack of a single consistent growth hierarchy across light treatments indicates that heterogeneity in the forest light environment could contribute to the maintenance of the diversity of Dipterocarpaceae found in lowland Bornean rain forests via light-based regeneration niches. © 2011 The Author(s).

Decision-making processes are thus significantly affected by communication, in which a dynamic performance of human intentions leads to unpredictable outcomes. In order to theorise the decision making processes including communication, it is argued here that the decision making processes resemble evolutionary dynamics {{in terms of both}} selection and mutation, which can be expressed by the replicator-mutator equation. To support this argument, a mathematical model of decision making has been made from an analogy with evolutionary dynamics, in which there are three variables: initial support <b>rate,</b> business <b>hierarchy,</b> and power of persuasion. On the other hand, a survey of patterns in decision making in construction projects has also been performed through self-administered mail questionnaire to construction practitioners.

It {{deals with the}} design of random access protocols for wireless systems and provides a mathematical framework for performance evaluation of multihop based heterogeneous wireless networks. This thesis is divided into three parts. In the first part, we propose new versions of slotted aloha incorporating power control, priority and hierarchy. Our simulations were important to understand the behaviour of such a system and the real impact of involved parameters (transmit power, transmit <b>rate,</b> arrival <b>rate,</b> <b>hierarchy</b> order). Both team problem (common objective function is maximized) and game problem (each user maximizes its own objective) were discussed. Introducing hierarchy seems to provide many promising improvement without/or with a low amount of external information. We also proposed two distributed algorithms to learn the desired throughput. Next, we developed in the second part an analytical Framework to evaluate performances of multihop based heterogeneous Wireless networks. We built a cross-layer model and derived expression of stability, end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. Furthermore, we provided an accurate approximation for the distribution of end-to-end delay in multihop ad hoc networks (operating with slotted aloha protocol). As a direct application, we highlighted how streaming and conversational flows could be supported in this class of ubiquitous networks. The third part of this thesis is devoted to understanding and modelling of IEEE 802. 11 e DCF/EDCF-operated multihop ad hoc networks. We indeed built a complete and simple APPLICATION/NETWORK/MAC/PHY cross-layered model with finite retries per packet per flow. We analyzed the stability of forwarding queues and derived expression of end-to-end throughput. We finally proposed a Fountain code-based MAC layer to improve the throughput/fairness over the network.

En particulier, nous nous focalisons sur la conception de nouveaux protocoles distribués pour une utilisation optimale/améliorée des ressources radio disponibles.

Here, data on diet-induced thermogenesis are reviewed in relation to measuring conditions and characteristics of the diet. METHODS: Measuring conditions include nutritional status of the subject, physical activity and duration of the observation. Diet characteristics are energy content and macronutrient composition. RESULTS: Most studies measure diet-induced thermogenesis as the increase in {{energy expenditure}} above basal metabolic <b>rate.</b> Generally, the <b>hierarchy</b> in macronutrient oxidation in the postprandial state is reflected similarly in diet-induced thermogenesis, with the sequence alcohol, protein, carbohydrate, and fat. A mixed diet consumed at energy balance results in a diet induced energy expenditure of 5 to 15 % of daily energy expenditure. Values are higher at a relatively high protein and alcohol consumption and lower at a high fat consumption. Protein induced thermogenesis has an important effect on satiety. In conclusion, the main determinants of diet-induced thermogenesis are the energy content and the protein- and alcohol fraction of the diet.

40|$|Placing cement in the annulus {{between a}} casing string and the {{borehole}} {{is essential to}} obtain compliant zonal isolation. Circumferentially bonded cement provide a hydraulic seal which prevents cross flow between permeable zones, flow to surface and sustained casing pressure during the lifetime of a wellbore. The 9 5 / 8 " production liner primary cement jobs across the depleted Valhall field are challenging. A very tight operating window between the collapse pressure and the fracture gradient is a limitation when designing the cement jobs. A trade-off between dynamic wellbore pressures and industry acknowledged cement guidelines such as high displacement <b>rates,</b> density <b>hierarchy</b> and rheology hierarchy is needed to stay within the pressure limits. Six case histories from the Valhall field are presented and evaluated to determine the most critical elements of a successful primary cement job. All wells have been acoustically logged to evaluate the annular cement bond quality. Lost circulation events in the deeper parts of the hole section have proven to be the greatest challenge when cementing the 9 5 / 8 " production liner. No common loss zone has been identified, but getting cement above the limestone stringer area in the Intra Late Eocene has proven difficult. ECD (equivalent circulating density) reducing measures such as low density pre-flushes, riser drainage, underreaming and low-rheology mud systems are discussed and quantified by the use of fundamental fluid mechanics. Underreaming the 12 1 / 4 " section to 13 " in combination with a carefully designed mud program have been identified as the main contributors to decrease the ECD. Gelled-up mud, eccentric casing strings and low annular velocities during the cement displacement process increase the risk of cement channeling. Liner rotation has been documented as the most influential parameter in terms of obtaining suffcient intervals of circumferentially bonded cement. Simulations have shown that the ECD effect from liner rotation at low rotational speeds is negligible. An evaluation of three different mud systems and their respective effect upon displacement effciency is presented.

Based upon the evaluation a recommendation aiming to maximize the probability of successful future 9 5 / 8 " liner primary cement jobs across Valhall is presented...|$|R

A notion of minimal networks and {{a notion of}} network equivalence under group action are defined. An efficient algorithm capable of directly listing single minimal canonical representatives from each network equivalence class is presented and utilized to list all minimal canonical networks with up to 5 sources and hyperedges. Computational tools are then applied to obtain the rate regions {{of all of these}} canonical networks, providing exact expressions for 744, 119 newly solved network coding rate regions corresponding to more than 2 trillion isomorphic network coding problems. In order to better understand and analyze the huge repository of <b>rate</b> regions through <b>hierarchy,</b> several embedding and combination operations are defined so that the rate region of the network after operation can be derived from the rate regions of networks involved in the operation. The embedding operations enable the definition and determination of a list of forbidden network minors for the sufficiency of classes of linear codes. The combination operations enable the rate regions of some larger networks to be obtained as the combination of the rate regions of smaller networks. The integration of both the combinations and embedding operators is then shown to enable the calculation of rate regions for many networks not reachable via combination operations alone.

To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6. 0 % of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mgP kg− 1) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differedmarkedly in biomass growth <b>rate,</b> but this <b>hierarchy</b> was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils, and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate, suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlatedwith both its physiological and morphological components, interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across awide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments...|$|R

It is principally comprised of sociolinguistic interviews conducted in Toronto with 40 speakers from each of six heritage languages (Cantonese, Faetar, Italian, Korean, Russian and Ukrainian). Participants are also asked about their ethnic identification, language use, and linguistic attitudes (Keefe 2 ̆ 6 Padilla 1987, Hoffman 2 ̆ 6 Walker 2010). Responses are translated into index scores to quantify each speakers 2 ̆ 7 orientation toward their heritage language/culture and their English/ 2 ̆ 2 Canadian 2 ̆ 2 culture. Here we examine the effects of a constellation of factors (linguistic, typological, demographic, social) on a single linguistic variable: (pro-drop). Our Cantonese, Italian and Russian data, 6, 000 tokens, is contrasted with a sample from the Toronto English Archive (Tagliamonte 2 ̆ 6 Denis 2010).

40|$|Abstract—The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} links between computational complexity theory and the theory and practice of constrained block coding. In particular, the complexities of several fundamental problems in constrained block coding are precisely classified in terms of the existing complexity-theoretic structure. One type of problem studied is that of designing encoder and decoder circuits using minimum or approximately minimum hardware; for our purposes, an “input ” to this problem is i) a deterministic, irreducible finite-state transition diagram (abbreviated DIF) defining a set of constrained binary sequences, and ii) a desired rate X. Several of these minimum-encoder and minimum-decoder problems are shown to be NP-hard, and more interestingly some are shown to be complete in the second and third levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Another fundamental problem is that of computing the maximum rate of a block code; that is, given a DIF and a codeword length, find the maximum such that a rate X block code exists for the constraint defined by the DIF. This problem is shown to be NP 5 €-complete. Although it is not known whether NP 5 € contains problems of super-polynomial complexity, it lies “higher” in the complexity-class structure than NP in the sense that it is possible, given current knowledge, that NP 5 € contains problems of super-polynomial complexity even if € a NP. Another question studied is whether maximum rate block codes can always be implemented by encoders and decoders of polynomial size. The answer to this question is shown to be closely related to whether the class 5 € lies “lower ” in the complexity-class structure than currently believed—a proof of either answer would have major implications in complexity theory.

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of motivational research {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, little has been undertaken within the New Zealand construction industry and internationally little evidence exists on the motivation factors that influence different occupational groups within the industry. As construction remains one of the most people-reliant sectors, employee motivation is a crucial element needed to increase productivity. This research aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by exploring the motivation of employees working on New Zealand’s largest construction project. The research regarded the employees firstly as a single group, and the factors considered as influential motivationally, and also investigated whether specific occupational groups were motivated by differing motivating factors. The four occupational groups included in the research were Project Managers, Construction Supervisors, Quantity Surveyor and Contract Administrators. A questionnaire was administered to 39 employees. 33 responded and partook in structured interviews. The findings revealed that the respondents as a group were motivated by intrinsic rewards such as co-worker relationships and completing challenging tasks which are highly <b>rated</b> on Maslow’s <b>Hierarchy</b> of Needs. It was also found that Project Managers had a marked desire for intrinsic rewards compared to the three other occupational groups. Quantity Surveyors and Construction supervisors provided mixed responses, however they still identified intrinsic rewards as their most significant motivating factors. Contract Administrators were found to have a stronger desire for extrinsic rewards such as monetary rewards and job security. It was concluded that the employees of a large New Zealand construction company were primarily motivated by intrinsic rewards, and employers should perhaps base their employee motivation strategies around these preferred motivators. On a more detailed level, different motivating factors were favoured by each individual occupational group, and this should also be taken into account to improve motivation and overall productivity...|$|R
40|$|Published by and {{copyright}} of Wiley Interscience. The definitive {{version of}} this publication is available at [URL] theory predicts that group fusion in female-philopatric primate species will be rare because females experience increased costs by associating with non-relatives. Indeed, fusion has been reported only 14 times in only 4 female-philopatric cercopithecines despite many years of observation. Here, we describe changes in ranging and agonistic behavior of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) after the fusion of two groups, the sole group fusion during 11 years of observation, induced by a brief but intense period of apparent leopard predation. Before fusion, both groups made few incursions into the other group's territory {{and spent most of}} the time in their own territories. After the fusion, the amalgamated group shifted its activities and used both territories in similar proportion. Rates of female agonism increased after fusion, particularly in the 2 weeks following fusion, and the small group females assumed the lowest ranks in the female dominance <b>hierarchy.</b> <b>Rates</b> of agonism returned to prefusion rates a month later. Although rates of high-intensity interactions (i. e., chases) did not increase after fusion, small group females {{were more likely to be}} the recipients of, and lose, agonistic interactions than large group females; a small group female and her infant were attacked and wounded by a coalition of large group females shortly after the fusion. The observations presented here reveal that the circumstances surrounding group fusions are more variable than previously realized, but are still in accordance with expectations from socio-ecological theory that predation can favor the formation of larger groups. In this case, under threat of severe predation, individuals may have surrendered group autonomy for the greater security of larger numbers. Am. J.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Define the {{epidemiology}} of {{the four}} recently classified syndromes describing the biologic response to infection: systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with a follow-up of 28 days or until discharge if earlier. SETTING: Three intensive care units and three general wards in a tertiary health care institution. METHODS: Patients were included if they met {{at least two of}} the criteria for SIRS: fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, or abnormal white blood cell count. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Development of any stage of the biologic response to infection: sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, end-organ dysfunction, and death. RESULTS: During the study period 3708 patients were admitted to the survey units, and 2527 (68 %) met the criteria for SIRS. The incidence density rates for SIRS in the surgical, medical, and cardiovascular intensive care units were 857, 804, and 542 episodes per 1000 patient-days, respectively, and 671, 495, and 320 per 1000 patient-days for the medical, cardiothoracic, and general surgery wards, respectively. Among patients with SIRS, 649 (26 %) developed sepsis, 467 (18 %) developed severe sepsis, and 110 (4 %) developed septic shock. The median interval from SIRS to sepsis was inversely correlated with the number of SIRS criteria (two, three, or all four) that the patients met. As the population of patients progressed from SIRS to septic shock, increasing proportions had adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and shock. Positive blood cultures were found in 17 % of patients with sepsis, in 25 % with severe sepsis, and in 69 % with septic shock. There were also stepwise increases in mortality <b>rates</b> in the <b>hierarchy</b> from SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock: 7 %, 16 %, 20 %, and 46 %, respectively. Of interest, we also observed equal numbers of patients who appeared to have sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock but who had negative cultures. They had been prescribed empirical antibiotics for a median of 3 days. The cause of the systemic inflammatory response in these culture-negative populations is unknown, but they had similar morbidity and mortality rates as the respective culture-positive populations. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective epidemiologic study of SIRS and related conditions provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence of a clinical progression from SIRS to sepsis to severe sepsis and septic shock...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{validate}} a modified version of the Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) rating scale, the CAP-II. The CAP is a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>rating</b> scale which assesses a child?s functioning in everyday situations. It covers a range of auditory performance and also takes into consideration different developmental rates of children. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by participants rating benefits young children receive with cochlear implants (CI). Volunteers watched video recordings of staff describing hypothetical cases of children who wear CIs. Children are difficult to assess using conventional methods, requiring their cooperation, thus there is need for additional assessment methods. The CAP has been validated and can provide additional information on disability reduction beyond that provided by audiological tests, as it illustrates the benefits that children now receive with CIs. The original CAP scale consists of 8 categories. There is evidence of ceiling effects as it does not address the more complicated listening skills achievable with CIs. Therefore it has been proposed that two new additional categories are added to the original scale to form the CAP-II. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using video recordings of rehabilitative staff describing behaviour and listening skills of children with CIs. Thirty-three participants, volunteers from the University of Southampton watched 6 video recordings and assigned ratings based on how each child was doing. High inter-rater reliability was found between all participants. The percent of overall agreement (PO) was 0. 76 % and no significant difference was found between the ratings (p> 0. 05). There was also a strong relationship between all participants, as there was a statistically significant correlation between participants when they were compared (p< 0. 05). Overall the results indicate that the modified CAP has good reliability. It is proven to be a relatively reliable and useful method. Specific findings about the CAP-II especially categories 7 (use of telephone with known speaker), 8 (follow group conversation in a reverberant room or where there is some interfering noise such as in a classroom or restaurant) and 9 (use of telephone with unknown speaker in unpredictable context) suggest that they need to be reordered. Categories 7 and 9 should be optional. Young children may not yet have developed these listening skills due to their age. Once these modifications are made the CAP-II could prove to be a valid tool in clinical use, as it addresses the additional benefits now achievable with CIs whilst avoiding ceiling effects. Although more research involving a larger population needs to be conducted in order to assess whether ceiling effects are evident...|$|R
