5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii <b>Remote</b> and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the <b>remote</b> {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii <b>Remote</b> to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the <b>remote</b> and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

5|$|Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a first-person action-adventure game. The player {{controls}} the protagonist, Samus Aran, using the Wii <b>Remote</b> and Nunchuk devices.

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} WarioWare series, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames, which are short games that last for about five seconds. Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii <b>Remote</b> in a specific way, such as holding it vertically, or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose. The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii <b>Remote</b> in certain microgames. Before each microgame begins, the required position for the Wii <b>Remote</b> is shown to the player, to allow them time to position the device. The game is broken up into stages, each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story, with the microgames divided among the stages. After the player completes a stage's microgames, they advance to the boss stage, which is a microgame that is longer and {{more complex than the}} others. After the player completes all of the single-player stages, the game unlocks a multiplayer mode, in which only one Wii <b>Remote</b> is used and shared by up to 12 players. While a player plays a microgame in this mode, other players watch, and after the microgame is completed, the player passes the Wii <b>Remote</b> to the next person.|$|E

5000|$|...NET <b>Remoting</b> allows an {{application}} {{to make an}} object (termed remotable object) available across <b>remoting</b> boundaries, which includes different appdomains, processes or even different computers connected by a network. The [...]NET <b>Remoting</b> runtime hosts the listener for requests to the object in the appdomain of the server application. On the client end, any requests to the remotable object are proxied by the [...]NET <b>Remoting</b> runtime over [...] objects, that encapsulate the actual transport mode, including TCP streams, HTTP streams and named pipes. As a result, by instantiating proper [...] objects, a [...]NET <b>Remoting</b> application {{can be made to}} support different communication protocols without recompiling the application.

25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> control (RF <b>remote</b> control) is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> control device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> controls, the radio <b>remote</b> control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> control duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> control in the market.|$|E

40|$|Requirement: Users of <b>remoting</b> systems (e. g., RPC and Messaging) want to {{concentrate}} on the data being sent. They should not have to use a different programming model just to use a different protocol. Problem: <b>Remoting</b> systems need to support alternate encodings, protocols and transports, either because of evolving standards or through dynamic negotiation with a peer. Solution: This paper has two main ideas. First, it clearly partitions a <b>remoting</b> system into four main blocks: presentation, encoding, protocol and transport. It identifies the extensibility points, the responsibilities and interactions of those blocks. Second, it shows how, for each message arriving on a connection accepted and created by an Acceptor, the Acceptor acts as a factory for specific encoders and protocol handlers. Thus a <b>remoting</b> system can dynamically adapt to new encodings, protocols and transports without changing the programming model presented to the programmer. Experience: We have used this model to adaptively alternate between XML and binary encoding, protocol and transport combinations in an RMI system. We show size and performance results for these combinations. Conclusion: This model isolates change from the <b>remoting</b> system user while allowing common <b>remoting</b> infrastructure to be extended and reused. The model does not degrade performance...|$|R
