In PIRLS 2006, Hong Kong Grade 4 students ranked second among the 46 participating states and countries. The study examined the relative role of gender, <b>reading</b> ability, and independent <b>reading,</b> as well as family and school influences in explaining students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes associated with <b>reading</b> attainment. Research question First, whether gender effect is found in students’ attitudes toward <b>reading?</b> Second, do <b>reading</b> ability and independent <b>reading</b> explain variance in students’ individual <b>reading</b> attitudes? Third, are home educational resources and parents’ <b>reading</b> attitudes associated with students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes? Lastly, to what extent, are instructional practices and school mean <b>reading</b> achievement related to students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes, either at school level or individual level? Method Each student completed a 90 -minute test booklet and an around- 20 -minute questionnaire. Students’ teachers, school principals and parents {{were also asked to}} fill out questionnaires. Data analyzed here was taken from the Hong Kong data in PIRLS 2006. It was collected in 2006 from 144 Hong Kong local schools, comprising a representative sample of 4712 primary fourth-grade students. Relationship between <b>reading</b> attitude and individual (i. e., gender, <b>reading</b> ability, and independent <b>reading),</b> family (i. e., parents’ <b>reading</b> attitudes and home educational resources), and school (i. e., teaching <b>reading</b> skills and school mean <b>reading</b> achievement) factors were modelled with multilevel analysis. Results Results show that gender, <b>reading</b> ability, independent <b>reading,</b> parents’ <b>reading</b> attitudes, and home educational resources made significant contribution to <b>reading</b> attitude. Moreover, teaching <b>reading</b> skills and school mean <b>reading</b> achievement were positively related to students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes. Discussion Male students’ less positive <b>reading</b> attitudes suggest that boys may be more beneficiary to intervention programs on <b>reading</b> attitudes. Thus teachers and parents should pay special attention to boys when considering methods or programs to accelerate <b>reading</b> achievement. In addition, the strong positive relation between in-school independent <b>reading</b> and <b>reading</b> attitude suggests that <b>reading</b> instruction should encourage more independent <b>reading</b> in class. Based on previous research and the present findings, school administrators and <b>reading</b> educators should give a high priority to independent <b>reading</b> when scheduling time for <b>reading</b> instruction. In order to facilitate students’ independent <b>reading,</b> it may be also important for teachers to teach explicitly skills and strategies in relation to <b>reading</b> comprehension. In fact, teaching <b>reading</b> skills and strategies will improve individual students’ <b>reading</b> ability and enlarge peer influence in a school...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine how late primary school students’ {{autonomous}} and controlled <b>reading</b> motivation contributes to their <b>reading</b> behaviour (i. e., <b>reading</b> frequency and engagement) and performance (i. e., comprehension) in a longitudinal study, since prior research was particularly cross-sectional and thus unable to test for the directions of effects. In addition, <b>reading</b> behaviour was examined as a mediator between <b>reading</b> motivation and comprehension, given that <b>reading</b> frequency and engagement have received mixed evidence as mediators in prior study. To pursue this aim, a longitudinal study (i. e., three measurement occasions) was set up. Participants included 458 fifth-grade primary school students (i. e., on average 10. 5 years old). Path analyses indicated that recreational and academic autonomous <b>reading</b> motivation predicted higher leisure-time <b>reading</b> frequency and better <b>reading</b> comprehension as compared to controlled <b>reading</b> motivation. Interestingly, recreational and academic controlled <b>reading</b> motivation did not affect <b>reading</b> engagement and even yielded a significantly negative association with <b>reading</b> comprehension. This underlines the significance of distinguishing qualitatively different types of <b>reading</b> motivation (i. e., autonomous and controlled <b>reading</b> motivation). As for the mediation of the relationship between <b>reading</b> motivation and comprehension through <b>reading</b> behaviour, no evidence was found for <b>reading</b> frequency as a mediator between <b>reading</b> motivation and comprehension. In contrast, <b>reading</b> engagement mediated the relationship between recreational autonomous <b>reading</b> motivation and <b>reading</b> comprehension. This suggests that especially the emotional and behavioural quality of students’ <b>reading</b> behaviour (i. e., engagement) rather than its quantity (i. e., frequency) is important in enhancing students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} explored the metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies used by university {{students and the}} correlation between metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies (Global, Problem-Solving, and Support <b>reading</b> strategies) and <b>reading</b> comprehension. Specifically, the objectives of this research are four-folds, namely to identify metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies used by the students during <b>reading,</b> to find the correlation between Global Reading Strategies (GLOB) and <b>reading</b> comprehension, to find the correlation between Problem-Solving Reading Strategies (PROB) and <b>reading</b> comprehension, and to find the correlation between Support Reading Strategies (SUPP) and <b>reading</b> comprehension. A survey on metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies and a <b>reading</b> comprehension test were administered to identify students’ metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies and comprehension performance. The subjects were 31 students of English Department at a university in Surabaya. The findings revealed that students preferred to use PROB <b>reading</b> strategies the most, followed by GLOB <b>reading</b> strategies, and SUPP <b>reading</b> strategies. This finding on prime preferences indicates that students {{had a tendency to}} concentrate and monitor their comprehension, particularly when they had difficulties in doing the <b>reading</b> test.

Parent reports concerned family <b>reading</b> histories and current <b>reading</b> practices. Significant relationships were found between parent <b>reading</b> history and children's single word <b>reading</b> skills, spelling, <b>reading</b> comprehension, orthographic processing skills, and perceptions of <b>reading</b> competence. No significant relationships were found between parent <b>reading</b> history and children's phonological, rapid visual processing or non-verbal ability. While children with poor <b>reading</b> skills {{were significantly more likely}} to come from a family with a history of <b>reading</b> difficulties, this measure did not account for additional variance in <b>reading</b> performance after accounting for other variables. Phonological, orthographic, rapid visual sequencing and children's perceptions of their <b>reading</b> competence made significant independent contributions to single word <b>reading</b> and spelling outcomes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was designed}} to provide information on the factors that impact the male gender gap in <b>reading.</b> Disparities between the <b>reading</b> achievement {{of boys and girls}} have long been a concern for educators. There are many reasons boys are lagging behind in <b>reading</b> such as the lack of male role models, stereotyping, lack of interest in <b>reading</b> material, and differences in brain development in boys and girls. Peer pressure also plays a role in the <b>reading</b> success of boys and <b>reading</b> may be considered a feminine activity. Another reason boys do not perform well in <b>reading</b> is their great need for physical movement on a regular basis. Students and teachers in three elementary third-grade classrooms were given a <b>reading</b> motivation survey.
