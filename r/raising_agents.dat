50|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the {{ingredients}} are: sugar, skimmed milk powder, cocoa butter, glucose syrup, barley malt extract, cocoa mass, palm fat, lactose, demineralised whey powder, milk fat, wheat flour, emulsifiers (e442, soya lecithin, e492), palm oil, <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> (e500, e501, e341), salt, gelling agent (pectin), flavouring.|$|E
50|$|Unleavened {{bread is}} {{any of a}} wide variety of breads which are not {{prepared}} with <b>raising</b> <b>agents.</b> Unleavened breads are generally flat breads; however, not all flat breads are unleavened. Unleavened breads, such as the tortilla and roti, are staple foods in Central America and South Asia, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{digestive}} biscuit contains coarse brown {{wheat flour}} (which gives it its distinctive texture and flavour), sugar, malt extract, vegetable oil, wholemeal, <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> (usually sodium bicarbonate, tartaric acid and malic acid) and salt. Dried whey, oatmeal, cultured skimmed milk and/or emulsifiers such as DATEM {{may also be}} added in some varieties.|$|E
5000|$|A Victoria sponge is {{made using}} one of two methods. [...] The {{traditional}} method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and <b>raising</b> <b>agent</b> into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. [...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra <b>raising</b> <b>agent,</b> and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture {{one of the most}} popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic [...] "cake" [...] mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding.|$|R

25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} is a food additive (E500) {{used as an}} acidity regulator, anticaking <b>agent,</b> <b>raising</b> <b>agent,</b> and stabilizer. It is one of {{the components}} of , a solution of alkaline salts used to give ramen noodles their characteristic flavor and texture. It is also used in the production of snus (Swedish-style snuff) to stabilize the pH of the final product.|$|R
50|$|Food {{is placed}} inside the {{pressure}} cooker {{with a small}} amount of water or other liquid such as stock. Food is either cooked in the liquid or above the liquid to be steamed; the latter method prevents the transfer of flavors from the liquid. The lid is closed, the pressure setting is chosen and the pressure cooker is placed on a stove on the highest heat (less than high for induction cooking to allow air to be vented - see the section below for an explanation). Once the cooker reaches full pressure, the heat is lowered to maintain pressure; timing the recipe begins at this point. Recipes for foods using <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> such as steamed puddings call for gentle pre-steaming, without pressure, in order to activate the <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> prior to cooking and achieve a light, fluffy texture.|$|E

In 2012 they {{performed}} her Can You Keep A Secret? the Rise And Fall Of the Yorkshire Luddites, in 2013 Don't Shoot the Messenger and in 2014 Troupers. Her 2015 play <b>Raising</b> <b>Agents,</b> celebrating the centenary of the Women's Institutes, {{was one of the}} two shows of Mikron's 150-venue 2015 tour; in writing it she worked with the National Federation of Women's Institutes and visited meetings of several WIs. For Mikron's 2017 season she wrote Best Foot Forward, about the Youth Hostels Association.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which {{is as simple as}} it is unpredictable. Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven. CO2 generation, on its own, is too small to account for the rise. Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the CO2 generation is stopped.|$|E
25|$|First, {{the chef}} must prepare choux pastry dough, a light pastry dough {{used to make}} profiteroles, croquembouches, éclairs, French crullers, beignets, St. Honoré cake, quenelles, Parisian gnocchi, dumplings, gougères, chouquettes and craquelins. It {{contains}} only butter, water, flour and eggs. Instead of a <b>raising</b> <b>agent,</b> it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The pastry is used in many European and European-derived cuisines.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, soda breads {{began to}} appear in the mid-19th century when {{bicarbonate}} of soda first became available for use as a <b>raising</b> <b>agent.</b> Breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid became popular in Austria, Britain, Ireland and Poland. Traditional soda bread, eaten in Serbian cuisine, also uses bicarbonate of soda, particularly the traditional česnica (Serbian Cyrillic: Чесница), a soda bread made at Christmas.|$|R
50|$|The thick batter {{contains}} eggs, flour, milk, and a <b>raising</b> <b>agent</b> such as baking powder. The batter {{can have}} ingredients such as buttermilk, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, apples, chocolate chips, cheese, or sugar added. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg {{can also be}} used. Yogurt {{may be used to}} give the pancakes a relatively moist consistency. Pancakes may be ⅓ inch (1 cm) thick and about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The natural release method {{allows the}} {{pressure}} to drop slowly; this is achieved by removing the pressure cooker from the heat source and allowing {{the pressure to}} lower without action. It takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes (possibly longer) for the pressure to disappear before the lid can be opened. On many pressure cookers, a coloured indicator pin will drop when the pressure has gone. This natural release method is recommended for foods that foam and froth during cooking, such as rice, legumes, or recipes with <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> such as steamed puddings. The texture and tenderness of meat cooked in a pressure cooker can be improved by using the natural release method. The natural release method finishes cooking foods or recipes that have longer cooking times because {{the inside of the}} pressure cooker stays hot. This method is not recommended for foods that require very short cooking times, otherwise the food overcooks.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} {{established a}} human T cell line, TPA-Mat, which can proliferate {{in response to}} not only interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), but also phorbol esters such as 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) and phorbol- 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu). The present study demonstrated that the PDBu-dependent growth of TPA-Mat cells was inhibited up to 90 % by adenosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> such as forskolin, cholera toxin and 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine, and cAMP analogues, whereas the IL- 2 -stimulated TPA-Mat growth was slightly inhibited. These {{findings suggest that the}} signal transduction pathway of PDBu-induced growth, which should involve activation of protein kinase C, is sensitive to cAMP, and that it cannot be exactly identical to the signal transduction pathway of Il- 2 -induced growth in TPA-Mat cells...|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide is an {{undesirable}} carcinogenic {{component of}} thermally processed foods being formed from reducing saccharides and asparagine. In this work, {{the effect of}} ammonium and sodium <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> themselves or in their combination with L-asparaginase enzyme catalyzing the conversion of asparagine into aspartic acid resulting in the reduction of acrylamide in gingerbreads was studied. Also, the influence of selected inorganic salts {{on the content of}} acrylamide in a model matrix simulating a composition of cereal products was observed. Simultaneously, the impact of these salts on activity of L-asparaginase was examined to find optimal conditions for its application in cereal technology. Based on experiments it was found, that addition of L-asparaginase reduces acrylamide content by 40 % while inorganic salts addition decreases acrylamide content in the range of 30 - 99 % when the most effective compounds were NH 4 Cl and CaCl 2...|$|E
5000|$|A leaven , {{often called}} a {{leavening}} agent [...] (and {{also known as}} a <b>raising</b> <b>agent),</b> is any {{one of a number of}} substances used in doughs and batters that cause a foaming action (gas bubbles) that lightens and softens. An alternative or supplement to leavening agents is a mechanical action by which air is incorporated. Leavening agents can be biological or synthetic chemical compounds. The gas produced is often carbon dioxide, or occasionally hydrogen.|$|R
5000|$|Apam balik - a {{turnover}} pancake with a texture {{similar to}} a crumpet with crisp edges, made from a flour based batter with <b>raising</b> <b>agent.</b> It is typically cooked on a griddle and topped with castor sugar, ground peanut, creamed corn, and grated coconut in the middle, and then turned over. Many different takes on this dish exist {{as part of the}} culinary repertoire of the Malay, Chinese, Peranakan, Indonesian, and ethnic Bornean communities; all under different names.|$|R

40|$|Prospective {{studies of}} {{cardiovascular}} risk-factors {{have shown that}} reduced plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol are associated with increased risk of coronary-disease. Experimental and translational studies have revealed several potential anti-atherogenic effects of HDL, including protective effects of HDL on endothelial cell functions. HDL has been suggested to protect endothelial cell functions by preventing oxidation of LDL and its adverse endothelial effects. Moreover, HDL from healthy subjects can directly stimulate endothelial cell production of nitric-oxide, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic effects, and endothelial-repair processes. Recent clinical-trials using HDL-cholesterol <b>raising</b> <b>agents,</b> such as torcetrapib, dalcetrapib and niacin, could not observe significant reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary-disease. Growing evidence suggests that vascular effects of HDL are highly heterogenous and vasoprotective properties of HDL are altered in patients with coronary-disease. Notably, in recent studies no clear association of higher HDL-cholesterol levels with reduced risk of cardiovascular events was observed in patients with established coronary-disease. Greater understanding of mechanisms of action of HDL and its altered vascular effects is therefore crucial {{within the context of}} HDL-targeted therapies. In this review, we will address different effects of HDL on endothelial cell functions potentially relevant to atherosclerotic vascular disease and explore molecular mechanisms leading to dysfunctional HDL...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Gluco-incretin hormones {{increase}} the glucose competence of pancreatic beta-cells by incompletely characterized mechanisms. Methods: We searched for genes that were differentially expressed in islets from control and Glp 1 r 2 / 2; Gipr 2 / 2 (dKO) mice, which show reduced glucose competence. Overexpression and knockdown studies; insulin secretion analysis; analysis of gene expression in islets from control and diabetic mice and humans {{as well as}} gene methylation and transcriptional analysis were performed. Results: Fxyd 3 was the most up-regulated gene in glucose incompetent islets from dKO mice. When overexpressed in beta-cells Fxyd 3 reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion by acting downstream of plasma membrane depolarization and Ca++ influx. Fxyd 3 expression was not acutely regulated by cAMP <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> in either control or dKO adult islets. Instead, expression of Fxyd 3 was controlled by methylation of CpGs present in its proximal promoter region. Increased promoter methylation reduced Fxyd 3 transcription as assessed by lower abundance of H 3 K 4 me 3 at the transcriptional start site and in transcription reporter assays. This epigenetic imprinting was initiated perinatally and fully established in adult islets. Glucose incompetent islets from diabetic mice and humans showed increased expression of Fxyd 3 and reduced promoter methylation...|$|E

50|$|The Norfolk {{dumpling}} is {{not made}} with fat, but from flour and a <b>raising</b> <b>agent.</b> Cotswold dumplings call for the addition of breadcrumbs and cheese, and the balls of dough may be rolled in breadcrumbs and fried, rather than cooked in a soup or stew. Vegetarian dumplings {{can be made with}} vegetable suet, a type of shredded vegetable fat.When sweetened with dried fruit and spices, dumplings can be boiled in water to make a dessert. In Scotland, this is called a clootie dumpling, after the cloth.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} for choux pastry are butter, water, flour and eggs. Like Yorkshire Pudding or David Eyre's pancake, {{instead of a}} <b>raising</b> <b>agent,</b> it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The high moisture content is achieved by boiling the water and butter, then adding the flour. The mixture is cooked a few minutes longer, then cooled before adding enough eggs to achieve the desired consistency. The boiling step causes the starch in the flour to gel, allowing the incorporation of more water.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{competition}} generally determines both {{the location and}} the extent of distortions due to information asymmetries. When agents have private information, increased competition <b>raises</b> <b>agent</b> welfare at the expense of uninformed principals. Nevertheless, increased competition among principals may lower total surplus: the losses sustained by principals as a group exceed the benefits realized by agents as a group when there is a sufficiently large proportion of agents with high cost of agent effort. These results are independent of the correlation between the agent's marginal cost and the principal's marginal benefit of agent effort. Copyright 1993 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
