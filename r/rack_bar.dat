No protection for downstream migrants is presently available, {{and the behavior}} of sturgeon to guidance structures has not been studied. We conducted experiments in a 5. 4 -m-long × 1. 5 -m-wide flume with a water depth of 37 cm to determine the guidance efficiency and behavior of yearling shortnose and pallid sturgeon to two guidance structures, a <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> and a louver array. We tested one vertical <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> configuration with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart (clear spacing). The <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> slats were oriented directly into the approach flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 45 ° angle to the flow. We tested two louver array configurations, one with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart and one with slats spaced 9. 0 cm apart (clear spacing). Louver slats were oriented at a 90 ° angle to the flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 20 ° angle to the approach flow. Mean approach velocity to both structures was 31 - 34 cm/s. Eighteen shortnose sturgeon tagged with passive integrated transponders were tested once in each configuration; 24 - 38 pallid sturgeon were tested in each configuration. Shortnose sturgeon showed some behavioral differences due to experience with the <b>bar</b> <b>rack,</b> but experience {{did not affect the}} percent guided.

40|$|Manufacturing {{system design}} can {{significantly}} affect the resulting product quality level. Therefore, the early prediction of product quality, as affected by manufacturing system configuration decisions, {{can enhance the}} manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness through achieving higher quality levels at lower costs in a responsive manner. In this research, a conceptual framework is proposed for the proactive assessment of product quality {{in terms of the}} manufacturing system configuration parameters. A new comprehensive model {{that can be used in}} comparing different system configurations based on quality is developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process. In addition, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system is developed to model the ill-defined relation between manufacturing system design parameters and the resulting product quality. This model is capable of mapping the considered manufacturing system configuration parameters into a Configuration Capability Indicator (CCI), expressed in terms of sigma capability level, which can be compared to the benchmark Six Sigma capability. The developed models have been applied to several case studies (Test Parts ANC- 90 and ANC- 101, Cylinder Head Part Family, Gearbox Housing, <b>Rack</b> <b>Bar</b> Machining, and Siemens Jeep Intake Manifold) with different configuration scenarios for illustration and verification. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the CCI in comparing different system configurations from quality point of view and in supporting the decision-making during the early stages of manufacturing system development. The included application of the developed models emphasized that high quality levels can be achieved by investigating all the improvement opportunities and it is recommended that efforts should be directed in the first place to design the system with high defect prevention capability. This can be achieved by using highly capable processes, implementation of mistake proofing techniques, as well as minimizing variability due to parallel processing and variation stack up. Considering the relationship between quality and complexity, it has been concluded that the CCI represents the time-independent real complexity of a system configuration. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the product complexity adversely affects the resulting product quality. Therefore, it is recommended that high product quality levels can be achieved not only by using highly capable system configurations, but also by minimizing the product complexity during the design stage.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{downstream}} migrant silver phase American eels Anguilla rostrata to guide along various configurations of angled <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> (25 - and 50 -mm clear spacing) and louvers (50 -mm clear spacing) was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} flume. Guidance tests were conducted with <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers angled at 45 and 15 degrees to the approach flow at velocities of 0. 3 m/s to 0. 9 m/s. A full-depth bypass was used for all tests. Guidance efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of fish recovered from the bypass {{by the total number}} recovered downstream (bypass and entrainment combined). Mean guidance efficiency (MGE) with the 45 -degree, 25 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> ranged from a low of 56. 8 % at 0. 6 m/s to a high of 65. 9 % at 0. 9 m/s. MGE of the 45 -clegree, 50 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> decreased from 72. 7 % at 0. 3 m/s to 54. 5 % at 0. 9 m/s, while MGE of the 45 -clegree louver ranged from a low of 34. 9 % at 0. 3 m/s to a high of 61. 9 % at 0. 6 m/s. Guidance efficiency was considerably higher for tests with the 15 -degree structures, exceeding 88 % at all velocities during tests with a solid bottom overlay placed over the lower 30 cm of each structure. During tests without the overlay in place and at a velocity of 0. 6 m/s, guidance efficiency of both <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers decreased to 83. 3 and 60. 7 %, respectively. The estimated guidance efficiencies indicate that angled <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers have potential for diverting American eels away from hydro intakes, particularly if a shallow angle is employed (e. g., 15 degrees to the approach flow). However, we believe our estimates of guidance efficiency are higher than would be experienced at an actual intake due to the full depth bypass, the limited depth of the flume, and the short length of each rack configuration that we evaluated...|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion.

40|$|Abstract: VAW of ETH Zurich conducts {{research}} on louvers and angled <b>bar</b> <b>racks,</b> so-called ‘fish guidance structures’ (FGS) for run-of-river hydropower applications. The {{purpose of the}} system is to improve the sustainable and efficient usage of hydropower by providing safe downstream fish guidance past the hydropower intake, guidance towards a fishbypass collection system, and minimizing negative economic impacts. The FGSs create complex two- and three-dimensional flow structures at different scales in the water column near them and the bypass, which can be sensed and behaviorally avoided by approaching fish. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> with and without a solid bottom overlay angled at 15 ° and 30 ° to the approach flow in a laboratory flume. The bars or slats were angled 45 ° against the flow direction. The bar spacing, thickness, and length were 0. 05 m, 0. 01 m and 0. 10 m, respectively. The mean approach flow velocity and flow depth were 0. 60 m/s and 0. 9 m/s, respectively. Profiles of longitudinal and transversal flow velocity components and turbulence characteristics in the water column were measured upstream, downstream, and around the structures using 2 D-Laser Doppler Anemometer at 1 kHz. The results of the experiments will be presented and discussed in relation to fish guidance efficiency of the investigated <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> configurations obtained from live-fish experiments.

40|$|Abstract: In Switzerland {{hydropower}} production contributes roughly 60 % to {{the electricity}} supply. However {{for the protection}} of fishes almost no downstream migration facilities yet exist. Until 2030 all hydropower facilities have to provide a safe downstream migration corridor for fishes. In Europe some technological solutions exist to enable downstream migration at small hydropower plants, but no analogous solutions exist for larger hydropower facilities. Guidance efficiency of five fish species (barbel, spirling, brown trout, eel and grayling) was tested in a laboratory flume with modified <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers angled at 30 and 15 degree to the approaching flow (0. 3 - 0. 9 m/s). The bar spacings were 5 and 11 cm. The test fishes were collected from wild river populations using electrofishing techniques. A total of 34 different configurations were evaluated. For selected experiments we additionally used a bottom overlay in order to increase the guiding efficiency. All the experiments were documented with video recordings. A detailed analysis of the flow is presented by the companion paper by Albayrak et al. (2015). The main angle of the guiding array (15 or 30 degree) did not {{have a significant effect on}} the guidance efficiency. Apart from the spirlin the increase in flow velocity did not affect the successful bypass passage. The guidance efficiency was • higher for <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers with clear spacings of 5 cm, compared to 11 cm • higher for <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> than for louvers (tested with barbel and spirlin) • considerably higher with a bottom overlay, notably for grayling.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis was to measure the head loss caused by fish-friendly trash racks in an open water channel and to measure the {{turbulent}} flow field around its bars. Angled model trash <b>racks</b> with different <b>bar</b> arrangement and orientation were tested, accompanied by a bypass. As {{a part of the}} master thesis a literature review was done with special focus on the turbulent flow field around bars and on different equations used for head loss prediction.

40|$|Narrow bar spacing’s (less than {{or equal}} to 2 inches) have been {{installed}} at many hydro project intakes to reduce entrainment of fish through turbines and, when combined with angled structures, to guide them to downstream bypasses. The ability of narrow bar spacing’s to prevent entrainment is dependent on fish size and behavior and approach velocities. Even when fish are small enough to pass through a given bar spacing, many fish will actively avoid entrainment through intake racks as long as approach velocities are low enough for them to escape. Additionally, the relatively small size (less than 8 inches in length) of most fish that are entrained at hydro projects (with and without narrow bar spacing) usually results in high turbine survival rates. Therefore, determining appropriate bar spacing’s for any species or life stage should include estimation of physical and behavioral exclusion associated with proposed intake modifications, as well as estimates of turbine passage survival for fish that are entrained. These parameters can be estimated using existing data describing <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> exclusion efficiencies and theoretical models developed for predicting turbine passage survival. When combined with the proportion of fish expected to pass over spillways for the expected river flows during a migration season, the <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> exclusion and turbine survival estimates can be used to calculate total downstream passage survival for several bar spacing’s and a range of fish lengths in order to assess relative effectiveness.

The Project is located in Cohoes, New York, on the Mohawk River, approximately 2. 5 river miles upstream from its confluence with the Hudson River. The Project was issued a new FERC License in 2007, which required downstream fish passage for anadromous and catadromous fish, as well as resident/riverine fish species.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} downstream migrating nonsalmonid fish to hydraulic conditions associated with river infrastructure is poorly understood. The response of downstream migrating adult European eels (Anguilla anguilla) to <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> (12 ?mm <b>bar</b> spacing) angled on the {{vertical and horizontal}} planes under different flow regimes and during periods of darkness was assessed. Eels predominantly moved along the channel floor and wall, tending to follow routes where turbulence intensity was high. Time taken to approach the racks was greater than expected if fish had moved passively with the flow. Eels did not exhibit clear avoidance behaviour prior to encountering the racks, instead marked changes in behaviour occurred only after physical contact was made with the structure. No impingement or passage through the racks occurred, and passes per approach were high (98. 3 %), when vertical racks were angled 15 °, 30 ° or 45 ° relative to the flow. Impingement and passage through the racks only occurred when horizontally inclined racks were placed perpendicular to the flow. The time eels were impinged on the racks was negatively related to discharge when angled at 30 ° relative to the channel floor, and positively related when upright. Frequency of impingement was higher under low discharge (132. 9 ?±? 16. 6 ?l·s? 1). Impinged eels escaped from racks at approach velocities of 0. 90 ?±? 0. 05 ?m·s? 1. Passage through the upright rack was common under high discharge (278. 9 ?±? 36. 2 ?l·s? 1).
