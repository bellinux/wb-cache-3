40|$|A hipertensão {{arterial}} é a complicação clínica mais freqüente da gestação sendo {{a principal}} causa de mortalidade materna no Brasil. Entre suas formas de manifestação está a pré-eclâmpsia, cuja etiologia é desconhecida e a fisiopatologia não está totalmente esclarecida. É causa de alterações em todo o organismo materno, destacando as manifestações no sistema nervoso central (SNC). Uma das formas de verificar e acompanhar esse comprometimento do SNC é o exame simplificado de reflexo profundo do tendão. Para avaliar o comprometimento a nível periférico do SNC, o presente trabalho propôs a realização da eletromiografia (EMG) do músculo quadríceps femoral (vasto medial - VM e vasto lateral – VL), no momento em que é estimulado artificialmente o reflexo patelar com um martelo de exame neurológico. A atividade elétrica dos músculos VM e VL foi registrada pelo aparelho MyoTrac com dois canais, conectado a um notebook da marca Toshiba. Foram estudadas 21 gestantes com pré-eclâmpsia (grupo PE) comparadas com 20 gestantes normais (grupo NL). Os resultados obtidos comparando os dois grupos foram estatisticamente significativos para o músculo VL, com valores menores encontrados no grupo PE (38, 72 μV x 71, 72 μV). Comparando as avaliações do grupo PE durante a gestação, 24 e 48 horas após o parto, os valores foram menores durante a gestação (38, 72 x 73, 35 x 71, 85 respectivamente). O presente estudo concluiu que em gestantes portadoras de pré-eclâmpsia a atividade elétrica do músculo vasto lateral está diminuída, mostrando estar comprometida por essa ocorrência. Entretanto, após a resolução da gestação esse comprometimento não é mais observado.

It is cause of alterations in all maternal organism, detaching the manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). One of the forms to verify and to follow this affecting of the CNS is the simplified examination of deep tendon reflex.

Comparing the evaluations of the group PE during the gestation, 24 and 48 hours after the childbirth, the values had been lesser during the gestation (38, 72 73, 35 x x 71, 85 respectively).

50|$|Hyporeflexia {{refers to}} below normal or absent {{reflexes}} (areflexia). It {{can be detected}} {{through the use of}} a <b>reflex</b> <b>hammer.</b> It is the opposite of hyperreflexia.Hyporeflexia is generally associated with a lower motor neuron deficit (at the alpha motor neurons from spinal cord to muscle), whereas hyperreflexia is often attributed to upper motor neuron lesions (along the long, motor tracts from the brain). The upper motor neurons are thought to inhibit the reflex arc, which is formed by sensory neurons from intrafusal fibers of muscles, lower motor neurons (including alpha and gamma motor fibers) and appurtenant interneurons. Therefore, damage to lower motor neurons will subsequently result in hyporeflexia and/or areflexia.|$|E
50|$|Striking the patellar {{ligament}} with a <b>reflex</b> <b>hammer</b> {{just below}} the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) {{at the level of}} L3 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres. From there, an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle, triggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick. This is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain posture and balance, allowing to keep one's balance with little effort or conscious thought.|$|E

The elicited response is compared with the reflex result of the same action when the maneuver is not in use. Often a larger reflex response will be observed when the patient is occupied with the maneuver, as the maneuver may prevent the patient from consciously inhibiting or influencing his or her response to the hammer [...] This effect was first observed in the late 19th century by Hungarian physician Ernő Jendrassik, whom it was named after.|$|E

Intention tremor amplitude decreased after peripheral arm cooling in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), likely caused by a reduction of muscle spindle afferent inflow, while amplitude increased when muscle spindles were artificially stimulated by tendon vibration. This study investigated the contribution of peripheral reflexes to the generation of MS intention tremor. Tendon reflexes of biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis, muscles were measured, using an electromechanical triggered <b>reflex</b> <b>hammer.</b> MS patients with (n = 17) and without (n = 17) upper limb intention and 18 healthy controls were tested.

40|$|The jaw jerk {{elicited}} {{by tapping}} the chin with a <b>reflex</b> <b>hammer</b> was electromyographically recorded in 14 patients with craniomandibular dysfunction, who {{were selected because}} of their strictly unilateral symptoms. Mandibular deviation, as measured {{by means of a}} kinesiograph, was on the same side as the pain. Neurological and neurophysiological investigations, including the recording of masseter motor potentials evoked by transcranial stimulation, showed normal function of the sensory and motor trigeminal nerve fibres. Latency and amplitude of the jaw jerk recorded in postural position and intercuspal occlusion were, respectively, longer and smaller on the affected side. In some cases the latency difference exceeded 1 ms, the limit usually considered significant for trigeminal neuropathy or brainstem lesions. Jaw-jerk asymmetry is probably due to facilitation on the side contralateral to mandibular deviation. In intercuspal occlusion, contralateral facilitation might be produced by a stronger input from muscle spindles and periodontal mechanoreceptors. In postural position, other factors probably intervene. status: publishe...|$|E
