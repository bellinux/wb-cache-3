25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as gyroplane, gyrocopter, or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E
25|$|Control of the V-12 {{presented}} {{several problems}} to the designers and engineers {{due to the}} sheer size {{as well as the}} rotor layout. The pilot and co-pilot sat in the lower flight deck with a wide expanse of windows to give excellent visibility. Using conventional cyclic stick, collective lever and rudder pedals the pilots input their commands in a conventional fashion. Roll control is by differential collective pitch change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in the hover or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending on direction of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin. Ascent and descent are controlled by the collective lever increasing or decreasing pitch of both rotors simultaneously. Large elevators on the tailplane control fuselage attitude and provide reaction to pitching moments from the wing and variation on <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> angle.|$|E

50|$|Disc {{loading of}} a {{hovering}} helicopter is {{the ratio of}} its weight to thetotal main <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> area. It is determined by dividingthe total helicopter weight by the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> area,which is the area swept by the blades of a rotor. Discarea can be found by using the span of one rotor bladeas the radius of a circle and then determining the areathe blades encompass during a complete rotation. When a helicopter is being maneuvered, its disc loading changes.The higher the loading, the more power needed tomaintain rotor speed. A low disc loading is a direct indicator of high lift thrust efficiency.|$|E

This paper presents a small power generation system motivated by a coreless stator AFPM (Axial Flux Permanent Magnet) generator which {{is driven by the}} rooftop ventilator. The generator consists of <b>discs</b> for the <b>rotor</b> and the stator geometry. The stator disc is sandwiched between two <b>rotor</b> <b>discs</b> and the magnets in the two opposite <b>rotor</b> <b>discs</b> may be placed N-S arrangements. Since there is no silicon steel inside the coils, we should eliminate the magnetic pulling force between the rotors and the stators. When the ventilator rotates, the flux of the permanent magnet rotors part move across the air gap and induces the emf in the coreless coils. After that, the ac voltage is rectified to dc voltage and finally charged to the 12 V 5 Ahr battery for household appliances. To analyze the magnetic circuit, the finite element analysis was used to simulate the magnetic flux density in the AFPM generator. The test is operated in electrical machines labo-ratory and essentially to determine the characteristics of prototype generator. Based on the experiments, the results of the output voltage can achieve 103 V with no-load, and 20 V on 100 Ω resistive loads at the speed of 200 rpm. For the results after installing the generator on the roof of a building to charge the 12 V battery, the minimum wind speed for enough charging to battery is at 10 rpm. Furthermore, the prototyped of the generator is relatively small and cheap. Af-ter the fabrication and testing of the prototype, this system has been proved feasible for practical application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The advent and {{proliferation}} of Ultrasonic Phased Arrays {{as a method}} of choice for the advanced inspection of industrial components has brought many of the benefits of this technology into the mainstream. Some of the benefits have been the reduction in inspection time resulting in cost savings as well as reduction in the logistics that the conventional method required. While using Phased Arrays offers a variety of benefits to suit the needs of different applications, in certain types of complex exams it is imperative that proper methods of examination and validation be developed. This paper addresses the development of Ultrasonic Phased Array methods for inspection of turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>discs</b> and turbine blade attachments and the validation of such methods. It also discusses issues as they pertain to probe positioning, ultrasound behavior, and component geometry...|$|R

To research the impact of convective cooling on the thermal properties of axial flux PM machines, a coupled electromagnetic and thermal model is introduced in this paper. This technique models {{a segment of the}} stator and the rotor only and links them together by analytical equations of the convective heat transfer at different boundaries of the machine model. This results in an accurate and time efficient multiphysics model. The coupled electromagnetic and thermal modeling technique is validated with measurements on a 4 kW axial flux PM machine having the yokeless and segmented armature topology...|$|R

In 1939, Bennett was issued a patent from the UK Patent Office, assigned to the Cierva Autogiro Company. On 23 August 1940 the Autogiro Company of America, licensees of the Cierva Autogiro Company, Ltd., filed a corresponding patent application in the United States. On 27 April 1943, US patent #2,317,340 was issued to the Autogiro Company of America. The patents describe a gyrodyne as: a rotary wing aircraft intermediate in type, hereinafter referred to as [...] "gyrodyne", between a rotaplane (with the rotor free for autorotation and an upward total axial flow through the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc),</b> on the one hand, and a pure helicopter (with the rotor driven, and a downward total axial flow through the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc),</b> on the other hand, that is with a mean axial flow through the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> substantially zero at high forward speed.|$|E

Collective pitch varies the magnitude of rotor thrust by increasing or decreasing thrust over the whole <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> at the same time. These blade pitch variations are controlled by tilting, raising, or lowering the swash plate with the flight controls. The vast majority of helicopters maintain a constant rotor speed (RPM) during flight, leaving the angle of attack of the blades as the sole means of adjusting thrust from the rotor.|$|E

50|$|During {{vertical}} autorotation, the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> {{is divided}} into three regions—the driven region, the driving region, and the stall region.

When changing autorotative rotational speed, blade pitch, or rate of descent, the size of the regions change in relation to each other.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the lift}} {{generated}} by an aerofoil increases as its relative airspeed increases, on a forward-moving helicopter the blade-tip at position A produces more lift than that at point B.

40|$|In axial gas turbines, hot {{air from}} the main annulus path tends to be {{ingested}} into the turbine disc cavities. This leads to overheating which will reduce the disc’s life time or lead to serious damage. Often, to overcome this problem, some air is extracted from the compressor to cool the <b>rotor</b> <b>discs.</b> This also helps seal the rim seals {{and to protect the}} disc from the hot annulus gas. However, this will deteriorate the overall efficiency. A detailed knowledge of the flow interaction between the main gas path and the disc cavities is necessary in order to optimise thermal effectiveness against overall efficiency due to losses of the cooling {{air from the}} main gas path.

50|$|Rotorcraft have {{spinning}} blades {{called a}} rotor which spins in the horizontal plane to provide lift.

50|$|An aft CG {{condition}} can {{be recognized}} by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control. In this case, dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> to tilt aft. With full forward cyclic control already applied, the <b>rotor</b> <b>disc</b> {{might not be able}} to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.|$|E

It has various uses in various fields of military, business, rescue mission, modern warfare etc. They have a vertical take-off and landing system.

40|$|The {{torque density}} of {{electric}} motors strongly {{depends on the}} performance of the cooling system. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, cooling inherently occurs through self-ventilation by both <b>rotor</b> <b>discs.</b> Nevertheless, an independent cooling system remains necessary for most applications. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, the individual stator cores with concentrated windings are potted in the stator housing using an epoxy resin.

Therefore, radially inward heat extraction fins are introduced in this paper. These fins provide an excellent thermal conduction path from the windings to the stator surface, where they can be abducted by conventional cooling techniques such as forced air or water jacket cooling. The focus of this paper is on the study of the radially inward heat extraction fins using thermal finite element modelling as well as experimental validation on a 4 kW axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine stator. At steady state and for the rated losses, the temperature difference between the winding and stator housing is less than 10 degrees Celcius...|$|R
