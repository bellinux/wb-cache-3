5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with a <b>rationale</b> for a large-scale U.S. {{military intervention in}} Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the <b>rationale.</b> In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|By 1944 it {{was fairly}} routine {{practice}} for Stavka to assign its operating fronts new and more ambitious missions while the Soviet Armed Forces were conducting major offensive operations. The <b>rationale</b> was that relentless pressure might trigger a German collapse. For the 1943/1944 winter campaign, Stalin ordered the Red Army to conduct major offensives along the entire Soviet-German front in {{a continuation of the}} 'Broad Front' strategy he had pursued {{since the beginning of the}} war. This was applied in consonance with his long-standing <b>rationale</b> that, if the Red Army applied pressure along the entire front, German defences were likely to break in at least one section. The Soviet winter campaign included major assaults across the entire expanse the front in the Ukraine, Belorussia and against the German Panther Line in the region of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Following the Black Death, the {{invasion}} of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped. The inauguration of Sankta Karin in 1412 {{marks the end of}} church building activity in Visby. When troops from Lübeck pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, the social and economic <b>rationale</b> for sustaining them had vanished. With the advent of the Reformation soon afterwards, the religious <b>rationale</b> to sustain the upkeep of the many churches also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day Visby Cathedral) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as quarries. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated money for their conservation.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} that multiple and diverse <b>rationales,</b> including rational, emotional and socially conditioned responses {{can influence the}} adoption of management practices. The study includes four case studies in order to subject the adoption <b>rationales</b> that Sturdy (2004) posits to empirical inquiry and to explore the impacts of these differing <b>rationales</b> on characteristics of the subsequent adoption. The findings show that {{five of the six}} <b>rationales</b> Sturdy proposes are empirically identifiable. The findings also suggest that, subject to the exploratory nature of the study, earlier adoption of management practices is associated with political and psychodynamic <b>rationales,</b> consistent with notions of being seen to adopt new ways of working. The findings also suggest that the political and dramaturgical <b>rationales</b> are associated with more rapid adoption due to influential individuals or groups acting as champions. Whilst Sturdy proposes his <b>rationales</b> as a simple list, {{the findings of this study}} suggest a more complex relationship between the <b>rationales.</b> The study contributes to the growing body of literature that addresses the important topic of management practices, particularly those that provide an expository consideration...|$|R
40|$|The Bottom Line on Board Diversity: A Cost Benefit Analysis of the Business <b>Rationales</b> for Diversity on Corporate Boards {{critically}} {{examines the}} business <b>rationales</b> for diversity {{in order to}} determine whether they can or should be used to encourage greater diversity on the boards of major corporations. The Article acknowledges the validity of some of the business <b>rationales</b> for diversity within corporations more generally, but questions whether those <b>rationales</b> apply with as much force in the context of corporate boards and the obligations board members undertake. On this point, the Article concludes that such <b>rationales</b> promise more, and in some cases significantly more, than directors of color can realistically deliver. The Article also concludes that while there may be practical reasons for relying on business <b>rationales</b> to encourage corporations to diversify, many diversity advocates have failed to analyze and appreciate the costs associated with adopting business <b>rationales.</b> In fact, these individual and societal costs, including the costs of marginalization and commodification, may outweigh the benefits of using market and economic <b>rationales</b> to justify board diversity...|$|R

30|$|This article {{explores the}} <b>rationales</b> and the {{research}} paradigms that countries have used to underpin policies on early childhood education and care (ECEC) services and to justify expenditure on them. Globalization — here narrowly defined as the global spread of theories and practices about early childhood mainly emanating from Euro-American sources — has led to some convergence of <b>rationales,</b> especially economic <b>rationales.</b> But within countries <b>rationales</b> almost always have deep historical roots, and reflect cultural ideas of motherhood, family, childhood, work {{and the role of}} the state. Perspectives may be incompatible yet sit alongside one another without the contradictions being addressed. Policy development and implementation are rarely straightforward or coherent, particularly when early education and care spans several policy areas. The article summarizes the differences between <b>rationales</b> and indicates in which country or groups of countries they are most likely to be found.|$|R

40|$|R&D {{managers}} at 50 firms {{randomly selected from}} all firms who have formal relations withtwo research universities in Stockholm are being interviewed about their <b>rationales</b> forcollaboration. Drawing on this material, a distinctive typology of <b>rationales</b> and the therewithassociated effects from cooperative relations is presented. As expected, <b>rationales</b> related toinnovation, in terms of invented or improved products or processes, {{are found to be}} themain drivers for interaction. As regards the nature of the innovation process leading toinnovation, most respondents indicate that “indirect” relationships between collaborationoutcomes and successful innovation dominate over “direct” appropriation of results. Contrasting open ended search <b>rationales</b> with pursuit of defined objectives, we find thatboth types are strongly represented among the studied collaborative linkages. We also findthat interaction <b>rationales</b> often go beyond the pursuit of innovation per se; firms also workwith university researchers to access academic networks, to develop its human capital and torealise direct business opportunities. The consequences of these findings for policy measuressteered towards the strengthening of collaborative university-industry linkages are discussed. QC 2012020...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{comparative}} case study of Canadian university internationalisation analysing selected activities of participants to determine which of four <b>rationales</b> - political, economic, academic, and social/cultural - are used to pursue internationalisation and whether consistency exists across provincial systems. Participants include provincial governments of Nova Scotia, Ontario, British Columbia, and a university within each, Dalhousie University, Wilfred Laurier University, and Simon Fraser University respectively. The Federal Government, Non-Governmental, and Intergovernmental Organisations activities are also reviewed for activities in internationalisation. Provincially, <b>rationales</b> are determined by organisational structure, key policies, funding, and programmes including recruitment and exchange initiatives. University <b>rationales</b> are assessed through organisational structure, policy and activities supporting student recruitment, curriculum, programming, and research. Results demonstrate varying provincial and university internationalisation <b>rationales</b> yet indicate a correlation in <b>rationales</b> between provinces and their universities.

First, we explain that we seek enactive interaction, rather than physical action. Next, we elaborate on how competition correlates with social interaction, relying on FIRO theory. Then, we analyze how the sensor technology within the WiiMote affords acceleration. Via an evaluation of existing physical mini-games, seniors and youngsters empirically verify these three design <b>rationales</b> on enactive interaction, competition and acceleration. We conclude that these <b>rationales</b> result in ease-of-use, equality- in-ease-of-use and visibility-of-player-action, which in turn stimulate competition and consequently intergenerational play. Finally, we present the design and user evaluation of our physical mini-game, designed in accordance with these <b>rationales.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
