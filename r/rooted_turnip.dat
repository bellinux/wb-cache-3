Eighty populations were analysed based on 18 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Populations showed a broad range of genetic diversity, thus offering good potential for further genetic improvement. Most of the variability was found within the population level, probably due to high rates of allogamy, to migration and/or interchange of seed among local growers.

In Galicia (Northwestern Spain) and in the coldest regions of Portugal Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L. includes three different crops: turnips, turnip greens and turnip tops. Turnips are the thickened <b>roots,</b> <b>turnip</b> greens are the young leaves harvested in the vegetative period, while turnip tops are the floral shoots and surrounding leaves. They have been under cultivation for a large period since they were among the first vegetables to be introduced into the Western Iberian Peninsula (Gómez-Campo, 1999). A collection of B. rapa subsp. rapa from northwestern Spain is currently kept at ‘Misión Biológica de Galicia’ (CSIC, Spain). This collection was preliminary evaluated based on agronomical and morfological traits by Padilla et al. (2005). One hundred and twenty B. rapa varieties of this collection were evaluated finding that in many cases, the same landrace is sown for more than one purpose. However, the potential yield of these varieties and the stability of performance have yet not been explored.

A range of morphological characters have been studied along with the DNA markers, AFLP and microsatellites, using the same plant material. Morphological characters discriminated between wild, weedy and cultivated forms of B. rapa. Within the cultivated group, the morphological analysis separates B. rapa var oleifera winter and spring turnip oil seed rape varieties. B. rapa var rapa stubble turnip varieties are separated from <b>root</b> <b>turnip.</b> Based on morphological analysis wild and weedy groups are differentiated, but this is not supported by AFLP analysis. AFLPs, as neutral markers, reflect the agricultural histories of B. rapa cultivars. All B. rapa var. rapa and var. oleifera cultivars clustered together in principal co-ordinate plots, although two accessions of vars. rapa clustered with wild and weedy forms (traditional cultivars, ‘Hardy Green Round’ and ‘Lincolnshire Red Globe’). Significant levels of genetic variation was observed in all B. rapa accessions. Genetic evidence indicates that weedy B. rapa is derived from wild plants not directly from cultivars. The microsatellite analysis indicated significant distinctions in allele frequency between wild, weedy and cultivated forms. The population structure of cultivated and weedy B. rapa was distinct from the wild group, with much enhanced homozygosity. Inbreeding and founder effects may be important factors here. Some plants of wild B. rapa growing adjacent to B. napus show intermediate DNA and morphological phenotypes. This indicates natural hybridisation and backcrossing.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Cr(VI) -induced toxicity in {{plants and animals}} has been assessed for mitochondrial bioenergetics and membrane damage in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> and rat liver mitochondria. By using succinate as the respiratory substrate, ADP/O and respiratory control ratio (RCR) were depressed {{as a function of}} Cr(VI) concentration. State 3 and uncoupled respiration were also depressed by Cr(VI). Rat mitochondria revealed a higher sensitivity to Cr(VI), as compared to turnip mitochondria. Rat mitochondrial state 4 respiration rate triplicated in contrast to negligible stimulation of turnip state 4 respiration. Chromium(VI) inhibited the activity of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from rat liver mitochondria and succinate-dehydrogenases (complex II) from plant and animal mitochondria. In rat liver mitochondria, complex I was more sensitive to Cr(VI) than complex II. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was not sensitive to Cr(VI). Unique for plant mitochondria, exogenous NADH uncoupled respiration was unaffected by Cr(VI), indicating that the NADH dehydrogenase of the outer leaflet of the plant inner membrane, in addition to complexes III and IV, were insensitive to Cr(VI). The ATPase activity (complex V) was stimulated in rat liver mitochondria, but inhibited in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> mitochondria. In both, turnip and rat mitochondria, Cr(VI) depressed mitochondrial succinate-dependent transmembrane potential (Deltapsi) and phosphorylation efficiency, but it neither affected mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to protons (H+) nor induced membrane lipid peroxidation. However, Cr(VI) induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to K+, an effect that was more pronounced in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> than in rat liver mitochondria.

Attacks are most important in Brassica seedbeds, with infection appearing as yellow speckling of the upper surface of seedling leaves, and white mildew on the lower surface. Severely affected seedlings are stunted or killed. Similar symptoms appear on leaves in the field, causing premature senescence and favouring bacterial spoilage in the cold store after harvest.

In the present study, we compared the absorption and translocation differences of Se (IV) selenite and Se (VI) selenate in turnip. The results showed that Se treatment, either by soil addition (0. 2 – 2 mg Se kg− 1 dry soil) or by foliar spraying (50 – 200 mg L− 1 Se), could significantly increase the Se concentrations in turnips, and 0. 5 mg Se (IV) or Se (VI) kg− 1 dry matter in soils could improve the biomasses of turnips. Moreover, turnip absorbed significantly more Se (VI) than Se (IV) at the same concentration and also transferred much more Se (VI) from roots to leaves. Based on the Se concentrations, as well as the bioconcentration factors and translocation coefficients, we considered that turnip might be a potential Se indicator plant.
