40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the {{processing}} of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. Different approaches {{to deal with the}} temporal dimension of the data are considered, which are derived from different target characterizations in this dimension. These approaches are the basis for defining two dif-ferent binary partition tree (BPT) structures that are employed for SAR polarimetry (PolSAR) data processing. Once constructed, the BPT is processed by a tree pruning, producing a set of spatio-temporal homogeneous regions, and estimating the polarimet-ric response within them. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique preserves the PolSAR information in the spatial and the temporal domains without introducing bias nor distortion. Additionally, the evolution of the data in the temporal dimension is also analyzed, and techniques to obtain BPT-based scene change maps are defined. Finally, the proposed techniques are employed to process two real RADARSAT- 2 data sets.

40|$|Abstract—Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{data are}} affected by speckle noise, originated by the SAR system’s coherent nature. The problem of speckle noise in one-dimensional (1 -D) data is already solved, as speckle has a multiplicative characteristic. SAR polarimetry represents an extension to multidimensional data {{by the use of}} polarization wave diversity. As a consequence of the existence of a correlation degree between the SAR images, the 1 -D speckle noise model cannot be extended to multidimensional SAR data. This paper is devoted to present a completely new speckle noise model for the complex covariance matrix describing polarimetric SAR data in the distributed scatterers case. As will be shown, this new model is able to identify which are the noise mechanisms in all the covariance matrix elements.

40|$|Sea oil {{pollution}} {{is a matter}} of great concern since it affects both the environment and human health. Recent studies demonstrated that synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> (SAR) <b>polarimetry</b> is able to provide additional information useful for environmental applications, i. e., oil spill observation. In this context, different approaches based on polarimetric SARs were developed. In this study, a dual-polarimetric feature, namely the modulus of the complex correlation coefficient between the co-polarized channels, is used to discriminate between sea oil spill and weak-damping look-alikes. The proposed approach relies on the fact that high correlation between co-polarized channels is expected over sea surface and weak-damping lookalikes due to the dominant Bragg scattering, while significantly lower correlation is expected over strong-damping oil spills since they are characterized by a no-Bragg scattering behaviour. Experimental results show that the modulus of the complex correlation between the co-polarized channels can be successfully exploited for both the observation of sea oil slicks and their discrimination from weak-damping look-alikes...|$|R

In synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> (SAR) <b>polarimetry,</b> {{it is generally}} assumed that the sensor has a fixed orientation with respect to objects and illuminates a scene with monochromatic radiations. Modern high-resolution SAR sensors have a wide azimuth beam width, however, and a large bandwidth in range. During SAR image formation, multiple squint angles and radar wavelengths are integrated to synthesize the full-resolution SAR image, and variations in the polarimetric signatures due {{to changes in the}} azimuthal look angle and in the wavelength commonly remain unconsidered. In this paper, a fully polarimetric two-dimensional (2 D) time–frequency analysis method is introduced to decompose processed polarimetric SAR images into range–frequency and azimuth–frequency domains. This 2 D representation permits characterization of the frequency response of the scene reflectivity, observed under different azimuth look angles and wavelengths. For the case of Bragg resonance in agricultural areas, the influence of anisotropic scattering and frequency selectivity on the polarimetric descriptors is pointed out in detail and compared with theoretical predictions from a quasi-periodic surface model. Lastly, a statistical analysis of polarimetric parameters is presented, which permits clear discrimination of media showin...|$|R

That same year a magnitude 7. 6 earthquake in central Taiwan generated around 10, 000 landslides, killing hundreds, damming major rivers, and severely damaging towns and villages in valleys (Sitar, Bardet et al., 2001).

The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries {{as much information as}} possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT- 1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure.

We analyzed the importance of topographic correction on the backscattering and polarimetric SAR signature and the advantage of quad-pol with respect to dual-pol data. When backscattering values only are employed, the incidence angle used as input feature of the SVM classifier assures the best classification accuracy, 9. 9 % higher than the accuracy obtained with cosine corrected γ 0 backscattering. The introduction of polarimetric features and decomposition parameters (such as Cloude–Pottier or Touzi decomposition parameters) increases the classification accuracy by 5. 2 % {{with respect to the}} backscattering case. The simulation of RADARSAT- 2 data as Sentinel- 1 like for dual-pol data shows a decrease of accuracy equal to 7. 8 % with respect to the fully polarimetric case (93. 5 %).

40|$|One of {{the prime}} factors in the global carbon budget is forest biomass, and it is {{estimated}} that about 20 % of the carbon flux to the atmosphere comes from deforestation and disturbance. Thus, it is important to quantify the amount of biomass present on Earth for climate change studies and for the estimation of global carbon stock. Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar</b> (SAR) <b>polarimetry</b> finds a useful application in remote sensing of forests as it can help with the assessment of forest structure and above-ground forest biomass. This thesis presents MATLAB implementation of three polarimetric target decomposition theorems, Pauli decomposition, Freeman-Durden decomposition, and H/A/alpha decomposition. The potential of air-borne SAR polarimetry for forest structure assessment is then evaluated using P- and L-band SAR data acquired with the ONERA SETHI system under the BioSAR 2010 campaign over the boreal forest of Remningstorp in southern Sweden. Results show that Freeman-Durden decomposition provides better visual classification of the forested area than Pauli and H/A/alpha decomposition techniques. Results also show that at L-band, most scattering occurs in forest canopy, while at P-band, forest canopy is penetrated to a higher degree and ground-locked mechanism takes over. Also, a biomass estimation model is developed based on a linear regression analysis of different decomposition products. Results for P-band data show that of all studied parameters, the parameter |δ|, which is a sensitive indicator for the amount of ground scattering visible, is best correlated with reference biomass. On the other hand, results for L-band data show that of all studied parameters, the parameter |HH-VV| is best correlated with reference biomass.

During the last decade, several research tasks revealed the contribution of polarimetric data in soil types and land cover classification. They contributed thus to a better comprehension of the scattering mechanisms and target identification. In this paper, we aim to identify and analyze earth terrain covers using the more recent approach which is the modified four-component scattering power decomposition derived from the coherency matrix. It is the extension of the Freeman-Durden decomposition which is based on three components model: surface, double bounce and volume scattering. This new method added an asymmetric component represented by the helix scatterer as a forth component for describing man-made targets in the urban area scattering and it has been developed to deal with the reflection and nonreflecton symmetry. The first point of this paper is to show the modification and the theoretical expansion for the covariance matrix of the nonsymmetry case. Secondly, four images have been generated corresponding to the four components of the new approach represented by: surface, double bounce, volume and helix scatterers. The results show the useful of using this approach for general scattering case for man-made (nonreflection symmetric case) and natural targets (reflection symmetric case) classification.
