40|$|Includes bibliographyUsing {{survey data}} on {{technical}} assistance projects that was collected by the International Competition Network's Competition Policy Implementation Working Group during 2004 and 2005, I estimate the effect {{of different types of}} technical assistance on several performance measures of <b>recipient</b> competition <b>authorities.</b> Moreover, I examine whether the impact of each type of technical assistance varies with the capacity of a <b>recipient</b> <b>authority</b> to absorb technical assistance (which I will refer to as absorptive capacity) and the socioeconomic development of the recipient country. A clear pattern of results emerges. Not all forms of technical assistance are alike in their effects and the impact on <b>recipient</b> <b>authority</b> performance appears to vary systematically with absorptive capacity and socio-economic development. Taken at face value, and supposing that maximizing the positive effect on <b>recipient</b> <b>authority</b> performance is the sole objective of a technical assistance programme in competition law and enforcement, these findings have implications for the mix of technical assistance activities that should be offered to competition authorities. These findings may, therefore, be of interest to suppliers of technical assistance which include established competition authorities, aid ministries, and international organizations...|$|R

5000|$|The later title Marshal General of France or more {{precisely}} [...] "Marshal General of the King's camps and armies" [...] (Maréchal général des camps et armées du Roi) was bestowed on outstanding military leaders.

50|$|Marshal of France (French: Maréchal de France) was a dignity {{bestowed}} only on to generals for exceptional achievements. The office alternated {{between being}} junior to and then senior to the Constable of France; after {{the suppression of}} the Constable, the Marshal of France became the de facto head of the army. The title Marshal General of the Camps and Armies of the King (French: Maréchal général des camps et armées du roi), more commonly referred to as the Marshal General of France, was created superior to the Marshal of France to signify that the <b>recipient</b> had <b>authority</b> over all the French armies in the days when a Marshal of France governed only one army.

500|$|During Burnell's time {{in office}} Edward and his royal {{officials}} made great efforts to reassert royal rights that were felt {{to have been}} usurped by the king's subjects. These efforts were made under writs of Quo warranto, which asked the recipient what royal grant or warrant gives the <b>recipient</b> the <b>authority</b> to exercise a right or a power. They were first issued in 1278, after earlier attempts to recover royal rights through parliament unintentionally resulted in too much work for that body. Through these writs, {{attempts were made to}} enforce the rule that the only correct way to receive a privilege or grant of land was through a written charter, which might have deprived most of the magnates of England of their lands and rights. Most lands at that time were held not by documentary grants, but by the force of custom. By the 1290s the government was forced to back down and permit rights as they had been allowed from [...] "time out of mind".|$|R
40|$|Many {{synchronous}} computer-mediated communication (SCMC) {{studies have}} been conducted on the nature of online interaction across a range of pragmatic issues. However, the detailed analyses of resistance to advice have received less attention. Using the methodology of conversation analysis (CA), the present study focuses on L 2 peer review activities in a synchronous online context: that of giving and receiving advice based on participants’ writing drafts. In L 2 peer review activities, advice givers are momentarily positioned as the more knowledgeable party on the issue being discussed, while advice recipients can be viewed as having a subordinate status. I show that advice <b>recipients</b> invoke <b>authority,</b> provide a justification, or initiate inquiries to indicate resistance in a delicate manner. I argue that these resistance strategies cooperate to establish the recipients’ identities as competent, independent participants and to assert their primary rights over their manuscripts. The study reveals that L 2 SCMC peer response is not only a means for participants to develop rhetorical knowledge, but also to negotiate advice and manage interactional practices. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{person or}} {{organisation}} requiring payment of an outstanding debt submits {{a claim to}} the Authority. This is forwarded to the debtor who must respond within 10 days. If there is no response, and it is established that the claim has reached the <b>recipient,</b> the <b>Authority</b> can take possession of money or property from the debtor. If the debt is denied within 10 days, a court must establish the debt. This a fairly short time, and furthermore creditors are more impatient today than earlier years. Someone taking a four-week vacation trip, can if they forgotten to pay a bill, find that the Enforcement Authority has withdrawn money from a bank account when they are back. Taxes have a special procedure in {{that they must be}} paid within the assigned time even if the debtor considers them to be incorrect. The Authority will claim the money and, if the tax claim is subsequently determined to be incorrect, the money will be refunded. The Authority allows a debtor to keep those necessities required to support themselves and any dependents. A debtor's home can be sold by the Authority.|$|R

It uses the PSSRU model of demand for long-term care. The impact of the new scenarios developed for this project is {{compared to that of}} scenarios investigated in previous research about variant population projections, marital status and rises in the real costs of care. The results show the impact of the scenarios in terms of the distribution between public and privately funded residents in care homes, projected numbers of <b>recipients</b> of local <b>authority</b> (LA) funded home care, total expenditure on long-term care (LTC) and workforce requirements for care homes...|$|R
40|$|Most {{long-term}} {{care in the}} UK is now delivered in markets, including both the private purchase of care and also publicly-funded care, commissioned on behalf of service <b>recipients</b> by public <b>authorities.</b> The widespread use of markets, an arrangement especially driven by New Right policies of the 80 s and 90 s, has nonetheless received relatively little critical evaluation. Most publicly funded long-term social care, as distinct from health care, {{is the responsibility of}} local authorities. Arguably many local authorities had taken the decision to out-source the provision of care because they anticipated savings in production costs (Wistow, Knapp et al. 1996). But there has been far less attention on the consequences of marketization for service recipients, the quality of care, and on the total costs of this policy, nor on wider impacts such as the effect on local labour markets...|$|R
40|$|The author {{highlights}} the media {{discourse of the}} budget process in its subject-temporal dimension. Place and role of the subjects of media discourse of the budget process are determined {{on the basis of}} the analysis of budgetary legislation, practical implementation of the budgeting process in the executive and legislative bodies and its reflection in the media. Public discourse of budgeting process includes not only participants, who are legally empowered, but also other actors involved in the formation of the informational agenda regarding the budget. For example, the subjects of media discourse of the budget process are executive and legislative bodies, regulatory <b>authorities,</b> <b>recipients</b> of budgetary funds, political parties, professional and expert communities, civil society activists. Sociocommunicative description of the budgeting process and its subjects is presented based on analytical and inductive methods. At the same time political journalism is not only a space for the formation of media discourse and reflection of the budgetary process, but also one of the indicators of the state of the political system as a whole. The conclusions present methodological aids for the media discourse analysis of specific cases of the budgeting process and may be used for scientific and practical research...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} of an All-In-One Companion for Visually Impaired has been proposed. The system aims to help such people while they are alone at their homes. The system will carry out the orders given by its user (a {{visually}} impaired man/woman) by analyzing his/her voice [1] and also by their hand gestures [2]. The system aims to provide necessary features for visually impaired like home automation. In this, different devices like fan, light, etc., which will be already interfaced with the system, can be turned on/off, by making different gestures, {{with the help of}} IR sensors mounted on the fingers of the user. RF signals are used for communication between the devices and sensors. Also, the systems aims to provide other features amongst which the key feature is security of the user. This feature has been proposed keeping in mind that the user is visually impaired. A GSM Modem with a SIM will be activated immediately when the user gives voice command – “HELP ” and will send an SMS alert, containing the location of the user as given by the GPS Module, will be sent to all the <b>recipients</b> including local <b>authorities</b> and kin of the user. In addition to it, a buzzer will be activated simultaneously which will generate an alarm to alert anyone nearby. Other features include two-way communication with the system via GSM Modem, a Gas Sensor to detect fire and a Temperature Sensor to detect the environment surroundings. Thus the system aims to be an ALL-IN-ONE STICK to support visually impaired, speaking figuratively...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of administrative courts judgments considered in terms of their impact over time for selected forms of action and inaction (inactivity) of tax authorities relating to the implementation of tax liability on the basis of Tax Law. Furthermore, this paper analyzed the impact of such judgments in time for the parties to respect the legal situation for tax purposes. In the simplest terms, the impact of judgment at the time means to have an effect on the legal consequences in respect of the contested act, interpretation or action back (retroactive – ex tunc) or from the time of its announcement (ex nunc). By influencing the action or inaction (inactivity) of tax administration the judgment of administrative court has also impact on the legal situation (procedural and substantive) for both the authority as well as the <b>recipient</b> of that <b>authority.</b> The effectiveness of the impact at the time of the judgments of provincial administrative courts depends largely on whether the court upheld the complaint or dismiss it. In case of taking into account the effectiveness depends on the type of penalties leading to the overthrow of the contested act, interpretation or actions, provided for in the Law on proceedings before administrative courts. We should also take into account and distinguish the impact point on appeal challenged action or inaction (inactivity) of the tax authorities from the impact – in a certain sense indirect – on the tax law situation (procedural and substantive) of the entity. p. pietrasz@uwb. edu. plUniwersytet w Białymstoku, Wydział Praw...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} beneficiary {{participation as}} a recent innovation {{in the evolution of}} international development assistance. International development assistance provided to less developed countries has its origins in the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of post World War II Europe. The success of this aid led to its application, though the World Bank and other specialist international and bilateral development agencies, directed at economic development rather than reconstruction. The results of adapting development approaches, to require participation of beneficiaries in planning and management, remain controversial, in terms of the additional time, costs, and development outcomes. Although the trend towards participation is gathering pace, even proponents do not agree precisely on the form of participation most appropriate to different situations. This research examines participation in agricultural development in Vietnam in the context of project preparation for a development agency. Two case studies were considered, in which a similar form of participation had been used in initial planning some two years apart, and had continued into implementation of the project in the earlier case. It compared both cases to determine variations in planning approaches and development outcomes that could have been associated with longer exposure to the participatory process in the first case. Although the initial planning ideas expressed by participants were similar in both cases, their ideas differed two and five years apart with iteration of the participatory planning process. It was found that the level of participation achieved in the initial planning was less significant in terms of Arnstein 's ladder than anticipated at the outset and this impacted on the plans made and their achievability over the plan period. Over the following five years, beneficiary participation evolved into a deeper level in the Arnstein (1969) sense when planning was allowed by the <b>recipient</b> Government <b>authorities</b> to result in action. This increasing confidence of beneficiaries, development agents and government officials, informed subsequent cycles of planning and positively impacted on the development outcome. The deeper level of participation was also associated with increased personal and group accountabilities and the increased availability of discretionary government budget for project activities. It was concluded that different perceptions of the purpose of the participation existed both within the external development agency and between it and the recipient Government staff and community leaders. These perceptions resulted from fundamental philosophical differences about the role of community participation in economic development. The research indicates that differing perceptions may be made more congruent and produce a more effective development outcome through use of participatory planning processes. It suggests that lengthy participatory planning in the absence of development action may not result in better development outcomes. In addition it corroborates other findings that projects having repeat phases {{are likely to be more}} effective than single phase projects. In terms of practical contribution to development planning the research suggests that it is worth initiating participatory planning processes early in the project cycle, during preparation, to introduce the concepts but the most effective participation is likely to occur during implementation when experience can inform the participatory planning process through participatory monitoring and evaluation. It further suggests that conditional commitment to subsequent phases of projects is desirable from the outset is good development outcomes are to be expected in complex situations such as is the case with opium growers in the hills of Vietnam.
