5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|D. lacustris ("of the lake") is a nomen dubium, {{named by}} Marsh in 1884 based on {{specimen}} YPM 1922 found by Arthur Lakes, {{consisting of the}} snout and upper jaw of a smaller animal from Morrison, Colorado. These remains are now {{believed to have been}} from an immature animal, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> a separate species. In 2015, it was concluded that the specimen actually belonged to Camarasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Desert Strike is a shoot 'em up game {{in which}} the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter. The game is less frantic than typical shoot 'em ups, with the {{addition}} of greater strategic elements. The action takes place on open, multi-directional scrolling levels viewed from an isometric perspective. The player views the action from outside the helicopter, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> within the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|Early in his Provisional Theatre conductorship Smetana {{had made}} a {{powerful}} enemy in František Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana's, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> Pivoda's school. In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, {{at the expense of}} other composers.|$|E

Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.caleyi, from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son Thutmose II, who in turn was succeeded by Thutmose II's sister, Hatshepsut. His reign is {{generally}} dated to 1506–1493 BC, but a minority of scholars—who think that astrological observations {{used to calculate the}} timeline of ancient Egyptian records, and thus the reign of Thutmose I, were taken from the city of Memphis <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> Thebes—would date his reign to 1526–1513 BC.|$|E

5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is {{too slow to}} cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E
5|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B.caleyi in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike shape; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.aculeata, which has narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E

5|$|Since then, most criticisms and denials of {{evolution}} {{have come from}} religious groups, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> the scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through theistic evolution, other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of creationism, {{the belief that the}} universe and life were created by supernatural forces. The U.S.-centered creation–evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E
5|$|The Rivers Agency {{concluded}} that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount {{of water in the}} rivers exceeded the capacity of the flood defences and the natural river banks.

Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking {{an end to the}} personal union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was also aware of the difficulties her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
