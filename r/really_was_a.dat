5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E

[...] "The ordering of those events <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> problem {{and we got to}} a point where we can either show Don doing the pitch, or show Joan being with the guy, but we can't do them both," [...] he said, explaining that he felt [...] "if Don gives the pitch after [...] seen Joan do this, {{no one is going to}} listen to a word that he says.

Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career.

At the other end you had Miller, who was unpredictable...It <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> perfect team." [...] He was an acrobatic slips fielder, who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease, often immediately returning to his discussion with those around him as if nothing was unusual.|$|E

500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough she had hoped for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] because she had a tendency to oversing or tried to put everything she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when he heard her sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mentor of mine. He taught me that less is more." ...|$|E

She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with UK's Daily Star, Gaga noted of the song, [...] "It's about a lot of different things. I gamble but I've also dated a lot of guys who are really into sex and booze and gambling, so I wanted to write a record my boyfriends would like too." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, when asked about the meaning of the line [...] "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained that it <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> metaphor for her vulva.|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the tour}} as a whole, and in {{combination}} with the preceding Magic Tour, Billboard magazine cover story stated that [...] "Even for an artist who has largely built his career on epic shows, Springsteen and the E Streeters have managed to find yet another gear at this stage in their legendary career." [...] Springsteen himself said, [...] "With the end of these shows, we're coming {{to the end of a}} decade-long project that <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tremendous renewal of the power, the strength and the service that our band hopefully provides." [...] Springsteen also touted the quality of the shows: [...] "I believe if you come and see us now you're seeing the best E Street Band that's ever played."

500|$|Studios Hergé serialised Tintin in Tibet weekly from September 1958 to November 1959, {{two pages}} per week, in Tintin magazine. Because {{of his desire}} for accuracy, Hergé added the logo of Air India to the {{airliner}} crash debris. A representative of Air India complained to Hergé about the adverse publicity the airline might suffer, arguing, [...] "It's scandalous, none of our aircraft has ever crashed; you have done us a considerable wrong." [...] Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu. While the crashed aircraft's tail number remained [...] "VT", the country code for Indian aircraft, Hergé agreed to change the airline logo in the published edition to the fictional Sari-Airways, dryly noting that {{there were so many}} Indian airlines it was possible that there <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Sari-Airways.|$|E
500|$|... "Hand in Glove" [...] was {{released}} as the Smiths' debut recording in May 1983. The single sold consistently {{for the next}} 18 months. Although the single failed to reach the UK Singles Chart, it reached number three on the UK Indie Chart. Its relative success earned the group a listing in the Guinness Book of Records in January 1984 when it and the group's next two singles' [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and [...] "What Difference Does It Make?"' held the top three position on the UK Indie Chart. [...] "It {{should have been a}} massive hit", Morrissey later said, [...] "it was so urgent. To me, it was a complete cry in every direction. It <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> landmark." [...] The single did raise the band's profile; a week after its release the band gained its first major live reviews in the music press, which in turn led to their first radio session with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel.|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> <b>A</b> steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E

Lincoln is featured on his own, so as not to [...] "take a super strong female character [...] and reduce her to being a part of a relationship where she won't be fulfilled until she finds her man", as are Ward / Hive and Malick, the latter with the symbol of the former upon him: [...] "We have told you who Ward's become, and Hive is the person that Malick is really in a relationship with. So the fact that reflection is on him or in him or around him is pretty potent," [...] explained Bell.|$|E
500|$|Because of the injury, Ford started {{only four}} regular season games in 1950. [...] However, {{he asked to}} be {{reinstated}} for the 1950 NFL Championship Game. [...] Head coach Paul Brown agreed to allow Ford to suit up after receiving approval from the team doctor and arranging for a special mask to be built to protect Ford from further injury. [...] Ford {{had been on a}} liquid diet until late November and dropped from 240 to 215 pound, though he was back up to 223 pounds shortly before the championship game. [...] As the championship game got underway, Ford sat on the bench as the Rams moved the ball 82 yards down the field for a touchdown. Browns head coach Paul Brown knew the defense had to tighten, and he called on Ford to enter the game. [...] The Cleveland Plain Dealer later called this [...] "one of Len Ford's great moments." [...] Paul Brown stated that Ford [...] "showed me that day he <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man."

500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> <b>A</b> lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks and I decided that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
