Everybody knows about its reputation across the world." [...] He also stated that he was linked to Mazhar Majeed as a player agent but not in any spot-fixing. He also stated that the video can easily be edited and modified and manipulated. One day before the hearing, Butt continued to state his innocence. The tribunal announced that a verdict on the decision had been deferred to 5 February 2011 and that the ICC also stated that the tribunal would <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> <b>charges</b> pertaining to the third Test match between England and Pakistan. Butt was the only player before the tribunal to face these additional charges.|$|R
25|$|Aspects {{such as the}} 'fast-paced' rules {{system and}} {{developed}} fantasy background were highly praised, with negative criticisms reserved for the 'wordiness' {{of the text and}} that the images, rather than illustrating the text, were largely decorative.

50|$|The {{controversy}} began {{two years}} after Djimba Mikulinov's appointment when he, his secretary and the ataman of the Ike Burul aimak were charged with forging {{the will of the}} late Lama Arkad Chubanov. According to local Don Cossack authorities, the provision in Arkad Chubanov's will nominating Djimba Mikulinov as his successor was forged. Therefore, Djimba Mikulinov's appointment was improper. The Russian court, however, <b>ruled</b> otherwise <b>on</b> all <b>charges,</b> freeing Djimba Mikulinov and his co-defendants, but his career as Lama of the Don Kalmyks was over.|$|R
500|$|In an April 17, 2012, game during Phoenix's {{first round}} playoff series against Chicago, Torres jumped into a hit that {{contacted}} Marian Hossa's head. Hossa {{was taken from}} the ice on a stretcher and sent to hospital by ambulance. [...] While Torres was not penalized on the play, the NHL characterized the hit as violating league <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> interference, <b>charging</b> and illegal contact to the head. [...] Citing his previous history, league disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan suspended Torres for 25 games for the hit—tied for the second-longest suspension for an on-ice incident in modern NHL history—sidelining Torres {{for the rest of the}} playoffs. [...] The league reduced Torres' suspension to 21 games on appeal over the summer. [...] He served 13 games of the suspension during the Stanley Cup playoffs and then missed the first 8 games of the 2012–13 NHL season, completing his suspension February 1, 2013.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} framework for R-parity violation. It is realized by a class of Calabi [...] Yau compactification of Heterotic string theory. Trilinear R-parity violation in superpotential is either absent or negligibly small without an unbroken symmetry, due to a selection <b>rule</b> based <b>on</b> <b>charge</b> counting of a spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry. Although such a selection rule cannot be applied in general to non-renormalizable operators in the low-energy effective superpotential, it is valid for terms trilinear in low-energy degrees of freedom, and hence {{can be used as}} a solution to the dimension- 4 proton decay problem in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Bilinear R-parity violation is generated, but there are good reasons why they are small enough to satisfy its upper bounds from neutrino mass and washout of baryon/lepton asymmetry. All R-parity violating dimension- 5 operators can be generated. In this theoretical framework, nucleons can decay through squark-exchange diagrams combining dimension- 5 and bilinear R-parity violating operators. B-L breaking neutron decay is predicted...|$|R

Wu won a second legislative term in 2004, and lost reelection in 2008 to Chen Chi-yu.

40|$|We {{describe}} the design, fabrication, characterization, and modeling of {{an array of}} single transistor synapses. The single transistor synapses simultaneously perform long term weight storage, compute {{the product of the}} input and floating gate value, and update the weight value according to a hebbian or a backpropagation learning <b>rule.</b> The <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the floating gate is decreased by hot electron injection with high selectivity for a particular synapse. The <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the floating gate is increased by electron tunneling, which results in high selectivity between rows, but much lower selectivity between columns along a row. When the steady state source current is used as the representation of the weight value, both the incrementing and decrementing functions are proportional to a power of the source current...|$|R
5000|$|In response, Philippe wrote [...] "Your venerable conceitedness may know, {{that we are}} nobody's vassal in {{temporal}} matters," [...] {{and called}} for a meeting of the Estates General, a council of the lords of France, who had supported his position. The King of France issued charges of sodomy, simony, sorcery, and heresy against the pope and summoned him before the council. The pope's response was the strongest affirmation to date of papal sovereignty. In Unam Sanctam (November 18, 1302), he decreed that [...] "it is necessary to salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff." [...] He was preparing a bull that would excommunicate the King of France and put the interdict over France, and to depose the entire clergy of France, when in September 1303, William Nogaret, the strongest critic of the papacy in the French inner circle, led a delegation to Rome, with intentionally loose orders by the king to bring the pope, if necessary by force, before a council to <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> the <b>charges</b> brought against him. Nogaret coordinated with the cardinals of the Colonna family, long-standing rivals against whom the pope had even preached a crusade earlier in his papacy. In 1303 French and Italian troops attacked the pope in Anagni, his home town, and arrested him. He was freed three days later by the population of Anagni. However, Boniface VIII, then 68 years of age, was deeply shattered by this attack on his own person and died a few weeks later.|$|R
