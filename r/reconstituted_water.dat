40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the survival and growth characteristics of Cronobacter species (Enterobacter sakazakii) in infant wheat-based formulas <b>reconstituted</b> with <b>water,</b> milk, grape juice or apple juice during storage. Methods and Results: Infant wheat-based formulas were <b>reconstituted</b> with <b>water,</b> UHT milk, pasteurized grape or apple juices. The reconstituted formulas were inoculated with C. sakazakii and C. muytjensii and stored at 4, 25 or 37 °C {{for up to}} 24 h. At 25 and 37 °C, Cronobacter grew more (> 5 logio) in formulas <b>reconstituted</b> with <b>water</b> or milk than those prepared with grape or apple juices (ca. 2 - 3 logio). The organism persisted, but did not grow in any formulas stored at 4 °C.

40|$|Life-history {{parameters}} of Ceriodaphnia cornuta (Cladocera: Daphniidae) fed on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Chlorophyceae) exposed to different copper concentrations were investigated. C. cornuta individuals were reared in four treatments: (a) <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> and non-contaminated algae (RW); (b) <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> and copper-contaminated algae with either 1. 28 x 10 (- 13) (10 (- 7) Cu) or (c) 1. 93 x 10 (- 13) g Cu cell(- 1) (10 (- 6) Cu); and (d) natural {{water from a}} local reservoir and non-contaminated algae (NW). Copper content in C. cornuta individuals increased as diet-borne exposure increased (RW < 10 (- 7) Cu < NW < 10 (- 6) Cu), except for NW individuals, which exhibited higher copper body burden than RW and 10 (- 7) Cu individuals, suggesting that some copper was available in the natural water. {{the results suggest that}} subacute levels of dietary copper stimulated C. cornuta's growth and reproduction, whereas organisms reared on <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> showed nutritional deficiency. Depending on copper exposure concentration, either growth (lower Cu concentration) or reproduction (higher Cu concentration) was further stimulated, suggesting that an alteration of resource allocation is involved in diet-borne copper exposure. Because differences among treatments were only significantly different after day 12 of the experiment, our results reinforce that full life-cycle tests are more appropriate than the standard 7 day or three-brood chronic bioassays used to evaluate dietary copper effects at low, chronic copper inputs and that the use of standard test-organisms may not address site-specific situations for tropical environments.

40|$|Despite nanotoxicological {{studies have}} been {{intensified}} in recent years, gaps remain in the methods {{used to assess the}} nanotechnology risks. These gaps are due to the complex nanomaterials behavior in the environment, especially in the presence of organic matter and depending on the nanomaterial characteristics. Studies indicate that humic acid present in the aquatic environment can increase the stability of nanomaterial dispersions and may change its toxicity to aquatic organisms. The adsorption of oxidative debris (carboxylated carbonaceous fragments - CCFs) has also been discussed as an important factor influencing GO properties and behavior. The surface characteristics of GO can influence its biotechnological application as well as its toxicological effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of the presence of oxidative debris and humic acid in the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) utilizing Fish Embryo Toxicity Test (FET test). GO (Sigma Aldrich) was refluxed with NaOH (0. 01 M, 1 h, 90 oC) and HCl (0. 1 M, 1 h, 90 oC) to produce GO without debris (GOwd). GO And GOwd were characterized through spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were exposed during 96 h to 100 mg. L- 1 GO or GOwd, in presence or absence of humic acid (HA, 20 mg. L- 1). A control group exposed to <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> was also performed. At the end of the exposure period, the larvae were measured and frozen at - 20 oC for subsequent evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity (AchE). We also performed an in vitro test to evaluate direct effect of the nanomaterial in zebrafish AchE activity. Homogenates of zebrafish larvae were incubated with GO and GOwd at 30 mg/L (20 min, 30 oC) before AchE assay was performed. Both GO agglomerated and precipitated quickly in <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water.</b> The presence of HA in the medium stabilized the GO suspensions similarly to that occurred with GO in ultrapure water. There was no difference between groups related to the occurrence of embryo malformation or mortality. Larvae exposed to GO were shorter and showed lower AchE activity than control and group exposed to GOwd. The in vitro test showed that the nanomaterial did not inhibit AchE activity. The nanomaterial showed low toxicity to embryo, but the reduction in total length and AchE activity in the organisms can be due to indirect effects in zebrafish development. More experiments will be performed to understand those effects. 201...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA prior {{assessment}} of the response of a metallic sandwich panels to water blast has identified soft and strong core responses and outlined the advantages of softness. Ensuing analysis has provided mechanism maps that distinguish these responses.

The model addresses cavitation and incorporates the momentum of <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> attached to the wet face. It assumes a transient dynamic strength of the core associated with dynamic buckling. The model includes coefficients that have been independently characterized using numerical simulations. The fidelity of the analytic model has also been assessed using simulations. The results reveal that analytic predictions of the wet face velocities are quite accurate for most of the soft cores examined. The implication is that the models may be used as reliable input to panel-level simulations for predicting such metrics as the reaction forces and the displacements. Discrepancies arise for strong cores with relatively large push back stress, and for systems with very thin wet faces, suggesting that embellishments are required for panels incorporating such features...|$|E

Functionalized multi-walled CNTs showed lower adsorption potential than their non-functionalized (MWCNTs) analogue. The adsorption potential of CNTs {{is affected by the}} type and extent of functionalization.

The influences of alkalinity, Cl-, and different concentrations of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and fulvic acid (FA) on the labile concentration and toxicity of Cu were investigated in <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> and natural water. The results showed that Cl- and alkalinity did not affect labile Cu concentration, but decreased the toxicity of Cu to S. oblignus in the Cu concentration range observed in fresh water. The influences of alkalinity and Cl- could be modeled if Cu-carbonate complexes and Cu-chloride complexes were considered as nontoxic species. Organic complexes of Cu with EDTA and FA did not contribute either to the labile concentration of Cu or to the toxicity of Cu on S. oblignus. The growth inhibition of Cu on S. oblignus in natural water could be predicted by using the bioavailable concentration of Cu, or [Cu*], which could be calculated from the labile Cu concentration using the DAM-DPASV method and {{the concentration}}s of Cu-carbonate and Cu-chloride complexes obtained from the MINTEQ A 2 model.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effect of natural organic matter (NOM) on the dissolution and the toxicity of sulfidized AgNPs (sAgNPs) to a model soil organism, Caenorhabditis elegans in two distinct exposure media. This study demonstrated that the aggregation and dissolution of sAgNPs (75 % Ag 2 S) was influenced by media composition, including inorganic composition and natural organic matter (NOM) concentration. Dissolution of sAgNPs was low (similar to 0. 5 %) but increased over time in all tested media (2 weeks). The presence of NOM either inhibited or enhanced Ag dissolution. Pony lake fulvic acid increased while Suwanee river and Pahokee peat fulvic acid (PLFA) decreased release of dissolved Ag from sAgNPs. Mortality of C. elegans exposed to sAgNPs was influenced by the inorganic composition of the media: with LC 50 values of 8. 15 mg Ag L- 1 and > 15 mg Ag L- 1 in moderately hard <b>reconstituted</b> <b>water</b> and soil solution pore water. Toxicity was totally rescued by the presence of all tested NOM types and concentrations, despite the increase of dissolved Ag in the media with PLFA.
