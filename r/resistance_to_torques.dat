40|$|OBJECTIVE:: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether a two-hole locking plate has biomechanical advantages over conventional screw stabilisation of the syndesmosis in this injury pattern. METHODS:: Six pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaver lower legs were prepared to simulate an unstable Maisonneuve fracture. Each limb was compared with its pair; the syndesmosis in one being stabilised with two 4. 5 mm quadricortical cortical screws, the other a two-hole locking plate with 3. 2 mm locking screws. The limbs were then mounted on a servo-hydraulic testing rig and axially loaded to a peak load of 800 N for 12000 cycles. Fibula shortening and diastasis were measured. Each limb was then externally rotated until failure occurred. Failure was defined as fracture of bone or metalwork, syndesmotic widening or axial migration > 2 mm. RESULTS:: Both constructs effectively stabilised the syndesmosis during the cyclical loading within 0. 1 mm of movement.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} many {{techniques}} to compensate bone atrophies of the posterior maxilla {{in order to obtain}} an implant-supported rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This case series describes the Ebanist technique: a sinus lift procedure to be used in case of extremely resorbed bone crests (≤ 3 mm) allowing simultaneous implant placement. METHODS: With a dedicated cylindrical trephine bur, it is possible to harvest a cylinder of bone from a fresh mineralized frozen homologous bone block graft and to simultaneously create a trapdoor on the recipient site. The trapdoor cortical bone is detached from the sinus membrane and removed. Dental implant is placed into the graft before the grafting procedure since the cylindrical block, once inserted in the recipient area, is not able <b>to</b> oppose sufficient <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>torque</b> needed for implant placement. RESULTS: Second-stage surgery and following prosthetic rehabilitation were performed after 5 months. In all cases, implant stability was manually checked and no pathological symptoms or signs were recovered at any follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: This technique can be considered a valid procedure for implant therapy on atrophic posterior upper maxillae, when the residual bone crest is extremely resorbed...|$|R

30|$|Successful {{integration}} of dental implants is largely {{dependent on their}} primary stability [13]. Implants placed in the maxilla present more challenges due to the poor bone quality usually found in these areas. Another anatomic challenge in the posterior maxilla is the pneumatization of the maxillary sinus which can limit the length of implant that can be placed. To avoid invasive sinus augmentation procedures, implants have been designed in shorter lengths such as 8  mm. To further enhance short implant primary stability, a tapered design has been developed which has been proven to provide greater initial stability [10 – 12, 14]. Implant stability can be evaluated by different measures such as torque {{at the time of}} implant placement, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> reverse <b>torque,</b> and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Multiple studies have established feasibility for validating implant stability in lab and animal models to justify using resonance frequency analysis in clinical trials [15, 16]. Limited literature exists on the OSPTX implant design, and to our knowledge, no clinical studies exist that compare OSP to OSPTX. A recent ex vivo comparison of two different designs of OSPTX implants in porcine mandibles demonstrated that a conical neck design presented higher primary stability (insertion torque and implant stability quotient (ISQ)) than a cylindrical neck design [17]. In our study, both the torque value and ISQ value were recorded at the time of placement. ISQ values were also recorded at implant uncovery at 6  weeks and also at 6 and 12  months when the final restoration was placed.|$|R

In this research, the slope traversabil-ity is defined as consisting both of slope climbing and traversing (crossing) capabilities. The authors have been investigated traction mechanics between a wheel of a rover and loose soil. Applying our ad-vantages in the wheel-soil interactions to the slope traversability of a rover, two criteria dominating the slope traversability, named as “Mobility limit ” and “Trafficability limit, ” are investigated. The mobility limit is determined by a margin between the torque limit of a wheel driving motor and the <b>resistance</b> <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the wheel. The trafficability limit is also de-termined by {{a relationship between the}} traction load of a rover and the summation of traction forces gen-erated by wheels.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} series of {{centrifuge}} model tests on torsionally loaded 12, 22, and 33 pile groups in sand. The objectives of the paper are to investigate: 1 {{the response of the}} pile groups subjected to torsion; 2 {{the way in which the}} applied torque is transferred in the pile groups; 3 the internal forces mobilized in these torsionally loaded pile groups and their contributions to resist the applied torque; and 4 the influence factors that affect the load transfer, such as soil density and pile-cap connection. In these model tests, the group torsional resistances of the pile groups increased monotonically in the test range of twist angles up to 8 °. Both torsional and lateral resistances of the individual piles were simultaneously mobilized to resist the applied torque. The torsional resistances were substantially mobilized at small twist angles, while the lateral resistances kept increasing in the whole range of twist angles. Thus, the contribution of the torsional <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> the applied <b>torque</b> decreased at large twist angles. The piles at different locations in a pile group could develop not only different horizontal displacements, but also different pile–soil–pile interactions and load–deformation coupling effect, hence, the torsional and lateral resistances of the piles are a function of pile location.

Methods: Profile (Dentsply Maillerfer, Ballaigues, Suíça) instruments sizes 15 to 40, taper 0. 04 and 0. 06 were used. Ten instruments of each size and taper were tested, totaling 120 files. The maximum torque (Tmax) until fracture was determined {{in accordance with}} the ANSI / ADA Protocol Nº 28. The maximum force was converted into maximum torque using the formula: Tmax = Loadmax x RadiusResults: The diameter (p< 0. 001) and taper (p< 0. 001) influenced the maximum <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> fracture. With the increase in diameter and taperthere was a gradual increase in the maximum torque. Using the multiple regression method an equation relating the maximum <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the diameter (D) and the taper (T) was found: Tmax = - 1. 4 + 0. 08 D + 10. 5 T. Conclusion: The increase in diameter and taper promoted an increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> torsion.
