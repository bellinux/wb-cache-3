5|$|In 1907 and 1908, {{the farm}} {{and many of its}} workers moved to Pine Plains. Although {{preliminary}} steps in the relocation were primarily small, the final October 1908 transfer used two trains to move 300 cattle. The rest of the cattle were transferred a day later, to the farm's main station (between Pine Plains and Attlebury on the Central New England Railway) at Barn A. During Briarcliff Manor's first automobile <b>race</b> <b>in</b> 1908, the barns were used for mechanic crews and each driver had his own crew weeks before the <b>race.</b> <b>In</b> 1909 Law formed the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Manor property.

5|$|In 1963, Rindt {{switched}} to Formula Junior {{with the assistance}} of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first <b>race</b> <b>in</b> Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into the spectators at a <b>race</b> <b>in</b> the streets of Budapest.|$|E
