40|$|Foreign {{reserves}} {{have been}} growing rapidly since the mid 1990 s in emerging economies hit by Sudden Stops (SS). For policy makers and researchers, this large buildup of reserves reflects a new policy that emerging economies have taken to insure against the risk of future SS. In this paper we have argue that the observed increase in foreign exchange holdings in Mexico {{is the result of}} more favorable global conditions and NOT a policy shift. We show that the long run demand for international reserves can be replicated using a linear combination of a set of exogenous shocks. We argue that using a set of asset returns and the oil price to investigate the determinants of <b>reserves</b> <b>holdings</b> is both conceptually appealing and quantitatively superior to traditional methods. We show {{that it is possible to}} approximate the reserves accumulation process in Mexico as a stationary function of these shocks without an abrupt regime shift after the Tequila crisis. Our results suggest that the rise in <b>reserves</b> <b>holdings</b> experienced by Mexico was the result of a series of positive shocks in the post crisis period. The strong and stable correlation between the foreign exchange and the exogenous shocks provides a basis for a flexible and simple method for determining the implicit market assessment of the sustainability of the current target of reserves to GDP ratio. Our findings suggest that the Mexican current policy is sustainable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{views the}} policy {{response}} to the recent financial crisis {{from the perspective of}} Milton Friedman’s monetary economics. Five major aspects of the policy response were: 1) discount window lending was provided broadly to the financial system, at rates that were low in relation to the market rates prevailing before the crisis; 2) the Federal <b>Reserve’s</b> <b>holdings</b> of government securities were adjusted with the aim of putting downward pressure on the path of several important interest rates for a given path of short-term rates; 3) deposit insurance was extended, helping to insulate the money stock from credit market disruption; 4) the commercial banking system received assistance via a recapitalization program, while existing equity holders have borne losses; and 5) an interest-on-reserves system was introduced. These five elements of the policy response were in keeping with those that would arise from Friedman’s framework, while a number of the five departed appreciably from other prominent benchmarks (such as the Bagehot-Thornton prescription for discount rate policy, and New Keynesian approaches to stabilization policy). One notable part of the policy response, the TALF initiative, drew largely on frameworks other than Friedman’s. But, in important respects, the overall monetary and financial policy {{response to the}} crisis can be viewed as Friedman’s monetary economics in practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in macroeconomics. The first one essay discusses the reasons of Chinese huge foreign <b>reserves</b> <b>holdings.</b> It {{contributes to the literature}} of sudden stops, precautionary saving and foreign assets holdings. In the second essay, I study the price volatility of commodities and manufactured goods. I measure the price volatility of each individual goods but not on the aggregated level and therefore the results complete the related study. The third essay explores the correlation between the relative volatility of output to money stock and financial development. It extends the application of financial accelerator model. In the first essay, I address the question of China's extraordinary economic growth during the last decade and huge magnitude of foreign <b>reserves</b> <b>holdings.</b> The coexistence of fast economic growth and net capital outflow presents a puzzle to the conventional wisdom that developing countries should borrow from abroad. This paper develops a two-sector DSGE model to quantify the contribution of precautionary saving motivation against economic sudden stops. The risk of sudden stops comes from the lagged financial reforms in China, in which banks continue to support inefficient state-owned enterprises, while the more productive private firms are subject to strong discrimination in credit market, and face the endogenous collateral constraints. When the private sector is small, the impact on aggregate output of binding credit constraints is limited. However, as the output share of private sector increases, the negative effect of financial frictions on private firms grows, and it is more likely to trigger a nation-wide economic sudden stop. Thus, the precautionary savings rise and the demand for foreign assets also increases. Our calibration exercise based on Chinese macro data shows that 25 percent of foreign reserves can be accounted for by the rising probability of sudden stops. The second essay studies the relative volatility of commodity prices with a large dataset of monthly prices observed in international trade data from the United States over the period 2002 to 2011. The conventional wisdom in academia and policy circles is that primary commodity prices are more volatile than those of manufactured products, although most existing studies do not measure the relative volatility of prices of individual goods or commodities. The literature tends to focus on trends in the evolution and volatility of ratios of price indexes composed of multiple commodities and products. This approach can be misleading. The evidence presented here suggests that, on average, prices of individual primary commodities are less volatile than those of individual manufactured goods. Furthermore, robustness tests suggest that these results {{are not likely to be}} due to alternative product classification choices, differences in product exit rates, measurement errors in the trade data, or the level of aggregation of the trade data. Hence the explanation must be found in the realm of economics, rather than measurement. However, the challenges of managing terms of trade volatility in developing countries with concentrated export baskets remain. The third essay tries to understand why the relative volatility of nominal output to money stock is negatively related to countries' financial development level from cross-country evidence. In the paper I modify Bernanke et al. (1999) 's financial accelerator model by introducing the classic money demand function. The calibration to US data shows that the model is able to replicate this empirical pattern quite well. Given the same monetary shocks, countries with poorer financial system have larger output volatility due to the stronger effect of financial accelerator mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Global {{liquidity}} {{has become}} a key focus of international policy debates over recent years. This reflects the view that global liquidity and its drivers are of major importance for international financial stability. The concept of global liquidity, however continues {{to be used in}} a variety of ways and this ambiguity can lead to unfounded and potentially destabilising policy initiatives. This report analyses global liquidity from a financial stability perspective, using two distinct liquidity concepts. One is official liquidity, which can be used to settle claims through monetary authorities and is ultimately provided by central banks. The other concept is private (or private sector) liquidity, which is created to a large degree through cross-border operations of banks and other financial institutions. Understanding the determinants of private liquidity is of particular importance. As many financial institutions provide liquidity both domestically and in other countries, globally, private liquidity is linked to the dynamics of gross international capital flows, including cross-border banking or portfolio movements. This international component of liquidity can be a potential source of instability because of its own dynamics or because it amplifies cyclical movements in domestic financial conditions and intensifies domestic imbalances. Policy responses to global liquidity call for a consistent framework that considers all phases of global liquidity cycles, countering both surges and shortages. Measures to prevent unsustainable booms in private liquidity are linked with micro- and macroprudential policies as well as the financial reform agenda. Country-specific or regional liquidity shocks, in turn, may effectively be addressed through self-insurance in the form of precautionary foreign exchange <b>reserves</b> <b>holdings</b> and existing arrangements which essentially redistribute liquidity. However, truly global liquidity shocks necessitate direct interventions in amounts large enough to break downward liquidity spirals. Only central banks have this ability. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the global financial}} crisis (GFC) and the structural changes of recent years that {{have been associated with}} new patterns of hoarding international reserves. We confirm that the determining factors of international reserves are evolving with developments in the global economy. From 1999 – 2006, the pre-GFC period, gross saving is associated with higher international reserves in developing and emerging markets. An outward direct-investment effect is consistent with the view of diverting international assets from the international reserve account, the “Joneses’ effect” lends support to the rivalry hoarding motivation, and commodity price volatility induces hoarding against uncertainty. During the 2007 – 2009 GFC, those variables became insignificant or displayed the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions that prevent a normal economic relationship to hold. Nevertheless, the propensity to continue to trade displays a strong positive effect. The 2010 – 2012 post-crisis results are dominated by factors that have been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the effects of swap agreements and gross saving are in line with expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and international reserves in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy is found to complement international reserve accumulation. Developed countries display very different demand behaviors for international reserves. Higher gross saving has been associated with lower international reserve holding because developed countries are more likely to deploy their savings in the global capital market. The presence of sovereign wealth funds is associated with a lower level of international reserve holding in industrial countries. Our predictive exercise affirms that if an emerging market economy experienced a deficiency in international <b>reserves</b> <b>holdings</b> in 2012, that economy tended to experience exchange-rate depreciation against the U. S. dollar during the recent adjustment to the news of tapering quantitative easing (QE) in 2013...|$|R
