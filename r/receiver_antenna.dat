5|$|Each <b>receiver</b> <b>antenna</b> {{was sent}} {{to one of the}} {{channels}} of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E

25|$|An FM signal {{can also}} be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with {{multiplexing}} and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes. A high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the <b>receiver</b> <b>antenna),</b> switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.|$|E

25|$|Each {{receiver}} must {{be connected}} to an external antenna, which is included with the <b>receiver.</b> <b>Antenna</b> placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such {{that they have an}} unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the <b>receiver</b> <b>antenna</b> array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E
