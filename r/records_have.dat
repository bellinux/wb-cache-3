5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Wehha or of his rule, as no written <b>records</b> <b>have</b> survived from this period in East Anglian history.

5|$|Snow in {{the city}} is so rare {{that it has been}} {{observed}} only five times in the century-and-a-half that <b>records</b> <b>have</b> been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for a few hours in higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E

Upon his return from exile, Cenwalh re-established Christianity in his own kingdom and the people of Wessex then remained firmly Christian.|$|E

5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world <b>records</b> <b>have</b> therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, athletes are not able to practice on ski flying hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head {{of human}} resources, {{suggests}} to Vidya {{that her husband}} resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's <b>records</b> <b>have</b> {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|During the 2016–17 NHL season {{a number}} of Toronto Maple Leafs team <b>records</b> <b>have</b> been either tied or broken by Hyman. On February 6, 2017, Hyman scored his third short-handed goal of the season, surpassing the {{previous}} Maple Leafs record for number of short-handed goals scored by a rookie which had been held by Gus Mortson since 1946-47. At six games with an assist, Hyman also tied for the most consecutive games with an assist by a rookie with Dan Daoust, Bob Nevin, and Frank Nigro. On March 28, 2017, when playing the Florida Panthers, Hyman set the Toronto Maple Leafs record for most short handed goals in a single season by a rookie with four.|$|E

5|$|In June 1847, Brannan {{traveled}} overland to Green River, Wyoming, to {{meet with}} Brigham Young, {{the head of the}} Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who was leading the first contingent of Mormon pioneers across the plains to the Great Basin region. Brannan urged Young to bring the Mormon pioneers to California as was previously planned, but Young rejected the proposal in favor of settling in what is present-day Utah. Brannan returned to northern California frustrated with how the meeting had gone. Being the only church leader of that region, Brannan continued to receive tithes of the church members, but no <b>records</b> <b>have</b> been found showing that those tithes were forwarded to the leaders of the church in Utah. Many members stopped paying him and began making their way eastward toward Salt Lake valley known to the Mormons as Zion.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelberht's life or reign, as very few East Anglian <b>records</b> <b>have</b> survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have {{provided}} dubious accounts of his life, {{in the absence of}} any real details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing in the fifteenth century, Æthelberht's parents were Æthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of Æthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry against his will, he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, and set out to visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Tytila's life or his rule, as no written <b>records</b> <b>have</b> survived from this period in East Anglian history. The mediaeval chronicler Roger of Wendover dated Tytila's reign from 578, but his source of {{information}} is unknown and the accession date {{may have been a}} guess {{on the part of the}} chronicler. Tytila's son and successor, Rædwald, the greatest of the Wuffingas monarchs, is the first East Anglian king who is more than a semi-historical figure, although much information about him, including the year of his death, is conjectural. The finds from the excavations of the two separate cemeteries at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk and at other sites in East Anglia point to close connections at this time between south-eastern Britain, the Frankish Rhinelands, the Eastern Mediterranean and of growing royal prestige and authority, reflected by the magnificent grave-goods discovered in the main burial-ship at Sutton Hoo.|$|E

5|$|One famous {{site where}} {{historical}} <b>records</b> <b>have</b> {{been used to}} interpret sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example {{which could have been}} overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the French {{team were}} {{scheduled}} to play a team from the United States, but the latter withdrew from the competition as three of their team were {{taking place in the}} hammer throw at the same time. The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, and their team was composed primarily of athletes who were competing in other events, though it also included a journalist, Edgar Aabye, to make up the numbers. The mixed team won each of the first two pulls against the French in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal. Due to a second, unofficial, match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some <b>records</b> <b>have</b> erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.|$|E
5|$|Their service <b>records</b> <b>have</b> {{added to}} their fame, ranging {{from their work}} as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
