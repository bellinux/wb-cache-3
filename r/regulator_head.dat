The dam was remodeled in 1938 to increase the permissible head to 13.8 ft from the 13.0 ft head that was allowed under its original design. In 1956 works were carried out at the Ibrahimiya <b>head</b> <b>regulator</b> {{as a result of}} significant scour holes that developed downstream of the structure. Extensions to downstream concrete apron were completed as well as lengthening of the southern lock wall. Some further grouting works and replacement of the lock gates took place in the 1970s.

40|$|Rice is a facultative {{short-day plant}} (SDP), and the {{regulatory}} pathways for flowering time are conserved, but functionally modified, in Arabidopsis and rice. Heading date 1 (Hd 1), an ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO), {{is a key}} regulator that suppresses flowering under long-day conditions (LDs), but promotes flowering under short-day conditions (SDs) by influencing {{the expression of the}} florigen gene Heading date 3 a (Hd 3 a). Another key <b>regulator,</b> Early <b>heading</b> date 1 (Ehd 1), is an evolutionarily unique gene with no orthologs in Arabidopsis, which acts as a flowering activator under both SD and LD by promoting the rice florigen genes Hd 3 a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUST 1 (RFT 1). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the flowering <b>regulator</b> <b>Heading</b> Date Repressor 1 (HDR 1) in rice. The hdr 1 mutant exhibits an early flowering phenotype under natural LD in a paddy field in Beijing, China (39 ° 54 'N, 116 ° 23 'E), as well as under LD but not SD in a growth chamber, indicating that HDR 1 may functionally regulate flowering time via the photoperiod-dependent pathway. HDR 1 encodes a nuclear protein that is most active in leaves and floral organs and exhibits a typical diurnal expression pattern. We determined that HDR 1 is a novel suppressor of flowering that upregulates Hd 1 and downregulates Ehd 1, leading to the downregulation of Hd 3 a and RFT 1 under LDs. We have further identified an HDR 1 -interacting kinase, OsK 4, another suppressor of rice flowering under LDs. OsK 4 acts similarly to HDR 1, suppressing flowering by upregulating Hd 1 and downregulating Ehd 1 under LDs, and OsK 4 can phosphorylate HD 1 with HDR 1 presents. These results collectively reveal the transcriptional regulators of Hd 1 for the day-length-dependent control of flowering time in rice...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOrthodenticle-related {{proteins}} {{function as}} <b>regulators</b> of <b>head</b> formation and other developmental events in flies and mice. Here, we characterize a cDNA clone encoding an orthodenticle-related protein {{from the sea}} urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The cDNA, termed SpOtx, has a highly conserved orthodenticle homeobox but otherwise diverges in sequence from its fly and mouse counterparts. Orthodenticle-related proteins bind with high affinity to DNA containing the sequence motif TAATCC/T. The S. purpuratus aboral ectoderm-specific Spec 2 a gene has several TAATCC/T sites in its control region, and we provide evidence, using bandshift analysis, that Spec 2 a may be target gene for SpOtx. Two SpOtx transcripts accumulate during embryogenesis, an early transcript whose level peaks at blastula stage and a late transcript accumulating to highest concentrations at gastrula stage. SpOtx transcripts were found initially in all cells of the cleaving embryo, but they gradually became restricted to oral ectoderm and endoderm cells. In contrast, SpOtx protein was found in nuclei of all cells at both blastula and pluteus stages. Our results suggest that SpOtx {{plays a role in}} the activation of the Spec 2 a gene and most likely has additional functions in the developing sea urchin embryo...|$|R

40|$|Leaf {{senescence}} is {{an important}} physiological process involving the degradation {{of a number of}} metabolites and their remobilization to new reproductive and storage organs. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factors are reported as important regulators of the senescence process. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of the NAC transcription factor gene, OsY 37 (Oryza sativa Yellow 37, ONAC 011) obtained from Oryza sativa cv. indica, and japonica. We created transgenic plants expressing the OsY 37 gene under the control of a strong and constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter. The resulting transgenic plants overexpressing OsY 37 gene showed early heading and precocious senescence phenotype of flag leaves compared with wild-type plants. By contrast, blocking the function of this gene via RNAi (RNA interference) and CRES-T (Chimeric Repressor Silencing Technology) technology, delayed both heading time and leaf senescence. Furthermore, knockdown of OsY 37 expression caused dwarfism and high accumulation of chlorophyll during the vegetative phase. Irrespective of early or delayed senescence, transgenic plants showed reduced grain yields. Our results indicate that OsY 37 acts as a positive <b>regulator</b> of <b>heading</b> and senescence during the reproductive phase in rice.
