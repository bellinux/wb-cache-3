50|$|Gammel Dansk is a bitters {{liquor and}} was {{originally}} created {{to become a}} competitor on the Danish market to other bitters such as Underberg and Fernet Branca. It is matured with 29 types of herbs, spices and even flowers, making it similar to other stomach bitters, such as Peychaud's Bitters or Jägermeister. These herbs and spices include <b>rowan</b> <b>berry,</b> angelica, star anise, nutmeg, anise, ginger, laurel, yellow gentian, Seville orange and cinnamon. The complete recipe is kept secret.|$|E
40|$|Systasis edlandi n. sp. is {{described}} from Norway, representing {{a new species}} of Systasis Walker, 1834. Discrimination from the closest species is discussed briefly.

60|$|There {{was no one}} so fully {{convinced}} of this as Walter himself, and one day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt.

5|$|Waxwings {{can be very}} tame in winter, {{entering}} {{towns and}} gardens in search of food, <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|R
40|$|Apple fruit moth Argyresthia conjugella is a {{specialist}} seed predator of rowan Sorbus aucuparia. Large-scale synchronous fluctuation of seed production in rowan (i. e. named masting) drives the {{apple fruit moth}} to seek alternative host plants such as apple, during years when <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> are not available for oviposition. The role of plant volatile compounds in the attraction of gravid apple fruit moth females is studied in a laboratory wind tunnel. Volatiles from rowan branches with green berries stimulate female moths to fly upwind and to land at the odour source. By contrast, females are not attracted to rowan branches without green berries, {{and they are not}} attracted to apple, demonstrating that the chemical stimulus from <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> is required for attraction. Attraction to synthetic compounds identified from rowan, anethole and 2 -phenyl ethanol confirms the role of plant volatiles in host finding. These two compounds, however, show a discrepant behavioural effect in wind tunnel and field tests. Field traps baited with 2 -phenyl ethanol capture female moths but anethole does not produce significant captures. Wind tunnel tests produce the opposite results: moths fly upwind towards the anethole lure, whereas 2 -phenyl ethanol is not attractive at all. Wind tunnel attraction to 2 -phenyl ethanol is achieved by adding odour from a <b>rowan</b> branch without <b>berries,</b> which is not attractive on its own. This finding demonstrates that interaction with the background odour contributes to the behavioural effect of plant volatile stimuli in the field...|$|R
6000|$|But why are any herbs or roots magical? While some scholars, like De Gubernatis, seek an {{explanation}} in supposed myths about clouds and stars, {{it is enough}} for our purpose to observe that herbs really have medicinal properties, and that untutored people invariably confound medicine with magic. A plant or root is thought to possess virtue, not only when swallowed in powder or decoction, but when carried in the hand. St. John's wort and <b>rowan</b> <b>berries,</b> like the Homeric moly, still 'make evil charms of none avail;' ...|$|R
5|$|Waxwings are {{primarily}} fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the breeding season. Mosquitoes and midges {{are the most}} common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. <b>Rowan</b> <b>berries</b> are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.|$|R
40|$|The {{stable and}} complex EPR signals {{produced}} {{by the action of}} ionizing radiation on crystalline L-sorbose (C 6 H 12 O 6) separated from <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> (Sorbus aucuparia) were studied. Isothermal heating of the samples at the temperature close to the melting point of L-sorbose (140 °C) results in the modification and simplification of the EPR signal involved. In the EPR signal of heated L-sorbose, the isotropic quartet was distinguished. In the differential spectrum obtained by subtraction of normalized spectra of unheated and heated L-sorbose, the isotropic doublet was identified in addition. The DFT fitting offers the probable assignment of the EPR signals to specific radical structures...|$|R
50|$|Different {{variants}} from Ireland and Scotland contain different episodes, sending Diarmuid and Gráinne to {{all manner}} of places. Commonly Diarmuid refuses to sleep with Gráinne at first {{out of respect for}} Fionn; in one version she teases that water that has splashed up her leg is more adventurous than he is. A similar quip appears in some versions of the Tristan and Iseult legend. Another episode describes how the newly-pregnant Gráinne develops a craving for <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> guarded by the one eyed giant Searbhán; though at first friendly to the lovers, Searbhán angrily refuses to give up the berries and Diarmuid must fight him. Searbhán's skill at magic protects him from Diarmuid's mortal weapons, but Diarmuid eventually triumphs by turning the giant's iron club against him.|$|R
60|$|I decline the task; I am {{not going}} to try to {{estimate}} either the eighteen of England or the sixty of the States. It is enough to speak about three living poets, in addition to those masters treated of in my last letter. Two of the three you will have guessed at--Mr. Swinburne and Mr. William Morris. The third, I dare say, you do not know even by name. I think he is not one of the English eighteen--Mr. Robert Bridges. His muse has followed the epicurean maxim, and chosen the shadowy path, fallentis semita vitae, where the dew lies longest on the grass, and the red <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> droop in autumn above the yellow St. John's wort.

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the {{possibility}} of growing and processing Chinese hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge.) and Chinese jujuba (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). The origin, morphological description, cultivation, ecological requirements, propagation, harvest, health effects and food utilization of these fruit trees is described in this thesis. Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia (Burm.) Nak. 'Hosui'), Hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta (Siebold & Zuccarini) Planch. Ex Miq.), Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) and Mountain-ash (Sorbus aucuparia L. 'Sorbinka') are describe too. From the harvested fruits were produced conserves, marmelades and other products, which have been assessed during the tasting. Top rated was a jelly with hawthorn and hardy kiwi, then marmalade from jujuba, <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> and compote from jujuba and hawthorn with alcohol. Based on the evaluation was found that all products were evaluated above average. Products have positive sensoric qualities, significant health effects and are easy to produce. Therefore, the possibilities of domestic production are very wide...|$|R
60|$|You {{were the}} {{daughter}} of a summer night, born where all the birds are free, and the moon christened you with her soft light to dazzle the eyes of man. Not our little minister alone was stricken by you into his second childhood. To look upon you was to rejoice that so fair a thing could be; to think of you is still to be young. Even those who called you a little devil, of whom I have been one, admitted that in the end you had a soul, though not that you had been born with one. They said you stole it, and so made a woman of yourself. But again I say I am not your judge, and when I picture you as Gavin saw you first, a bare-legged witch dancing up Windyghoul, <b>rowan</b> <b>berries</b> in your black hair, and on your finger a jewel the little minister could not have bought with five years of toil, the shadows on my pages lift, and I cannot wonder that Gavin loved you.|$|R
40|$|Autumn Northern Bullfinch {{abundance}} at bird observatories {{around the}} Baltic Sea con-firmed periodic irruptive behaviour outside of its normal wintering range, but age-ratio data suggested dispersal was not linked to reproductive success. <b>Rowan</b> <b>berries</b> are im-portant food of Fennoscandian Northern Bullfinches and show synchronised masting in annual fruit production over large spatial scales. Norwegian and Finnish annual berry abundance indices from 1972 – 2004 {{were used to}} test the hypothesis that poor rowanberry production in normal wintering areas was responsible for efflux of birds to other areas. Annual Finnish wintering bird surveys and catches at local bird observatories correlated with rowanberry abundance indices, supporting the prediction that highest Bullfinch abundance would occur in normal wintering areas in years with heavy rowanberry crops. Northern Bullfinch autumn abundance at Danish and Swedish bird observatories (outside the normal winter range) showed inverse correlations with Norwegian rowanberry crops, supporting the prediction of highest irruptions in years of lowest rowanberry abundance from the normal wintering range. These data suggest that at large spatial scales, berry masting can have profound effects on the annual distribution and migratory behaviour of birds consuming the crop. 1...|$|R
