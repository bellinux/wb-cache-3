2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center <b>rear</b> <b>gearbox,</b> a right side cavity gearcase [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary drive chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E
50|$|The Aston Martin has a {{very high}} belt-line, broad shapes and few surface breaks. The {{front of the car}} is {{designed}} to develop minimal downforce and to force as much air into the ducts. The air then moves through the car instead of over the top. There are numerous ducts inside the high bodywork, one for brake cooling, two through the side vents and one for <b>rear</b> <b>gearbox</b> cooling. One air scoop is in place to feed the turbocharger. Two side ducts on the rear of the car are for rear-brake cooling. The exhaust exits {{at the bottom of the}} vertical fin.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Progress 4WDS" [...] was Kyosho's first {{electric}} 4WD off-road racer. The motor {{was mounted}} on the rear overhang, and the forward wheel moves with a chain extending from the <b>rear</b> <b>gearbox.</b> This chain system was also tried on the on-road racer, [...] "Fantom EP." [...] The rear suspension was an orthodox double trailing arm and oil damper with coil springs, but the front suspension featured a double wishbone and mono damper, and substituted a torsion bar for a spring. This unique front suspension was rather difficult to set up, and had a short arm, which prevented it from taking powerful strokes.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some preliminary}} results of active control strategies {{aimed at reducing}} the transmission of structure-borne noise to the cabin structure on a AgustaWestland A 109 helicopter mockup. The experiments were performed on a full-scale mockup consisting of a gearbox housing connected to the fuselage via two front and two rear struts and an anti-torque plate. The mockup is provided with two electric motors that appropriately drive the gearbox at the nominal rotating speed. A suitable aerodynamic brake {{is attached to the}} rotor must in order to reproduce the load effect of the rotor blades. Peaks at the gear meshing frequencies reveal amplitudes very close to those acquired during in-flight measurements. <b>Rear</b> <b>gearbox</b> struts and the anti-torque plate were equipped with piezoelectric actuators and some control algorithms were designed and implemented to change the transfer function at the connection between the gearbox and the cabin. Vibration and acoustic results inside the cabin are presented and critical issues of the adopted solutions are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{examination}} of the morphological and compositional attributes of wear particles of tested universal tractor transmission oil (UTTO) samples by means of automatic particle counter and classifier LaserNetFinesTM-C, which is an ideal tool to establish the dynamic equilibrium concentration and hence to set the alarm limits for any type of machine. Such limits can be based on wear type and particle size ranges. The samples of two UTTO (mineral oil and biodegradable fully synthetic oil) were taken from the <b>rear</b> <b>gearboxes</b> of the wheel tractor during a long-term experiment. The measurement results showed that there was faster increase in the particle wear of mineral oil in comparison to biodegradable transmission oil. Considering the increase in the percentage of particles over 20 μm, the biodegradable oil seems to be more favourable for usage. Regardless of this, it can be concluded that the biodegradable oil is equivalent to petroleum-based oils...|$|R
50|$|Hans Ledwinka, Tatra's designer, {{came up with}} {{a revolutionary}} idea of a {{backbone}} tube chassis, which he introduced on Tatra 11. Tatra 12 follows the same principles with the backbone tube, which has mounted the differential with swing half-axles at the <b>rear.</b> The <b>gearbox</b> has 4 speeds (+reverse) and the engine is on the top of it, while both are mounted {{on the front of the}} backbone tube.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 {{there were}} only updates to the detail of the range for the 1301, aimed {{essentially}} to the interior (cigarette lighter, rear-view antiglare, better internal soundproofing, etc.) and mechanics (reinforced <b>gearbox,</b> <b>rear</b> brakes, etc.).|$|R
25|$|In the Scout and Wasp {{the main}} rotor drive {{is taken from}} the front of the gearbox and is {{transmitted}} beneath the gas generator via a flexible coupling, while the drive for the tail rotor is taken from the <b>rear</b> of the <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} was independent at {{the front}} using coil springs with semi elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The brakes used 12.25 in drums all round and were operated hydraulically {{at the front}} and mechanically at the <b>rear</b> via a <b>gearbox</b> driven servo.|$|R
50|$|Ferrari {{commissioned}} FFD-Ricardo in the US {{to develop}} an automatic version of the 456GT four-seater coupé, preserving the V12’s famous driving experience but offering ease of use. Ricardo configured a four-speed torque converter transmission from scratch, using bought-in internal components and with a novel layout dictated by the six-speed manual Ferrari’s <b>rear</b> transaxle <b>gearbox</b> architecture. The propeller shaft from the front-mounted V12 drove the torque converter mounted ahead of the rear axle line, while the gearbox was positioned behind and fed its output forward to the differential.|$|R
50|$|Lightning Bolt is an American-built {{streamliner}} motorcycle {{that held}} the motorcycle land-speed record from 1978, when Don Vesco rode it to 318.598 mph, until 1990. It was also the fastest vehicle participating in the 1978 Bonneville Speed Week with a one-way 333.117 mph run. It was powered by twin turbocharged inline-4 engines sourced from a Kawasaki Kz1000, with a combined displacement of 2,032 cc. The near-stock engines were linked {{at both ends of}} their cranks by two Gilmer belts and utilized the <b>rear</b> engine's <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car also {{featured}} a new carbon bodyshell, {{as well as}} a new shaped front wing, hollowed sidepods and multiple side deflectors designed to improve aerodynamic performance. However, several areas of the car, including the <b>gearbox,</b> <b>rear</b> suspension and carbon brakes, remained the same in order to keep costs under control.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{carried in a}} {{separate}} subframe on the ladder type chassis with semi-elliptic leaf springs, a live rear axle of orthodox design and shock absorbers front and <b>rear.</b> A four-speed <b>gearbox</b> with right hand change was fitted driving the rear wheels through a 3.08:1 straight cut bevel rear axle.|$|R
5000|$|The Tasmin was {{the first}} {{production}} car {{in the world to}} have both a bonded windscreen and also to incorporate the aerial in the rear screen heater element. As with all TVRs, the running gear was located in a tubular spaceframe steel chassis which was powder coated for extra corrosion resistance. Much of the running gear was sourced from Fords of the period. The suspension and steering was sourced from the Ford Cortina, with TVR engineered <b>rear</b> wishbones. <b>Gearboxes</b> were from the Cortina, Granada, and Sierra. Brakes were discs all round, with the front units from the Granada. The differential (and rear brakes) was from the Jaguar XJ-S.|$|R

50|$|The {{accident}} {{was attributed to}} the disengagement of {{the left and right}} spur gear teeth in the main transmission, caused by the load imposed by the failure of the <b>gearbox's</b> <b>rear</b> sleeve bearing journals. The rear sleeve bearing failure was caused by an oil leak although evidence was destroyed by fire and the source of the leak was not established.|$|R
25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed <b>gearbox,</b> <b>rear</b> wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was independent, using coil springs, and was {{bolted to}} a substantial sub-frame which also carried the recirculating ball steering gear. Semi-elliptic leaf springs were {{used on the}} rear axle. Lockheed hydraulic brakes with 9 in drums were fitted front and <b>rear.</b> The three-speed <b>gearbox</b> had a column change and the optional overdrive was operated by a switch on the steering column. A four-speed floor change became an option.|$|R
25|$|The C11 used a C10 motor {{fitted with}} an {{overhead}} valve cylinder head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added plunger <b>rear</b> suspension. Early <b>gearboxes</b> were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|R
50|$|In the Mondial 8, QV and 3.2 models, the {{transmission}} housing {{is integral with}} the engine sump casting, albeit with its own oil supply, sitting below and slightly {{to one side of}} the main block. Drive to the gearbox is via a single-plate, diaphragm-spring clutch and a set of drop-gears located outboard of the left-hand end of the crankshaft, with output torque feeding into a friction-plate limited-slip final drive unit offset to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Lotus 22 was the {{car from}} which the Lotus 23 was derived, being {{essentially}} a two-seat 22 widened in the middle but using the same front and <b>rear</b> suspension and <b>gearbox</b> as the 22. The 23's introduction at the Nürburgring 1000km in 1962 was made legendary by Jim Clark, who led many laps in the tiny 1,000-pound 23, with only a [...] engine, against cars with many times the displacement, at one point leading by a minute or more in the wet.|$|R
500|$|Like its contemporaries, the BT49 {{uses the}} engine as a fully {{stressed}} structural component, carrying all loads between {{the front and}} rear of the car: the front of the engine bolts directly to the integral fuel tank and the back of the engine attaches to the car's <b>rear</b> suspension and <b>gearbox.</b> The Ford Cosworth engine integrated into the car much more easily than Alfa Romeo's large, heavy and inconsistently sized units: Murray described returning to the DFV as being [...] "like having a holiday".|$|R
50|$|Further {{contributing}} to the weight advantage was the adoption of lightweight sequential manual transmission originally developed for Lotus 12 by Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy incorporating the unique sequential-shifting gearbox and a ZF limited slip differential in a common Magnesium alloy housing to form a transaxle, which also provided the mounting points for inboard <b>rear</b> brakes. This <b>gearbox</b> had been improved in its reliability for Lotus 15 and 16 in 1957-58 by a Keith Duckworth who had just joined Lotus as a gearbox engineer.|$|R

5000|$|Another visual {{hallmark}} of the 701 was its combined oil tank and de-aerator. This large, cylindrical tank was mounted vertically to the right hand side of the Hewland transaxle, filling {{the space between the}} right <b>rear</b> wheel, the <b>gearbox</b> and the wing. Autocar sporting editor Innes Ireland described it as [...] "enormous" [...] and looking [...] "like an old fashioned coffee percolator". The oil radiator itself was mounted atop the gearbox, to avoid the surge and starvation problems associated with the lengthy pipes needed to mount the radiator in the nose, alongside the water radiator.|$|R
50|$|The 1,087 cc {{four-cylinder engine}} had {{hemispherical}} combustion chambers with the valves inclined at 45 degrees in a crossflow head. To save the expense and complication of overhead camshafts, the valves were operated by two camshafts mounted {{high in the}} crankcase through short pushrods and rockers. The engine was mounted in the chassis by a rubber bushed bar that ran through the block with a further mount at the <b>rear</b> of the <b>gearbox.</b> Drive was to the rear wheels through a torque tube and spiral bevel live rear axle mounted on semi elliptic springs.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{model was}} the {{mid-engined}} Argyll GT (or [...] "Turbo GT"), {{which was based}} on a sturdy box section chassis with space frame clothed in a fibreglass bodyshell made next door to the old Arrol-Johnston factory in Dumfries by Solway Marine. The 1976 prototype car featured a turbocharged Rover V8 engine. A version with a turbocharged Saab engine was also mooted, but none was built. The suspension came from the Triumph 2500 and the gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. By undoing 10 bolts, the entire <b>rear</b> end, suspension, <b>gearbox</b> and engine came away.|$|R
5000|$|Named {{to evoke}} {{memories}} of the Sunbeam Tiger, the Avenger Tiger concept began as a publicity exercise. Avenger Super (four-door) cars were modified by the Chrysler Competitions Centre under Des O' Dell and the Tiger model was launched in March 1972. Modifications included the 1500 GT engine with an improved cylinder head with enlarged valves, twin Weber carburetors and a compression ratio of 9.4:1. The engine now developed [...] at 6,100 rpm. The suspension was also uprated, whilst brakes, <b>rear</b> axle, and <b>gearbox</b> are directly from the GT.|$|R
