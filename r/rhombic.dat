5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} woodcut, Study for Stars, {{completed}} in August 1948, depicts wireframe versions {{of several of}} the same polyhedra and polyhedral compounds, floating in black within a square composition, but without the chameleons. The largest polyhedron shown in Study for Stars, a stellated <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron, is also one of two polyhedra depicted prominently in Escher's 1961 print Waterfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} of defects in crystals {{is described by}} the point groups. They differ from the space groups describing the {{symmetry of}} crystals by absence of translations, and thus are much fewer in number. In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed thus far: tetrahedral (Td), tetragonal (D2d), trigonal (D3d,C3v), <b>rhombic</b> (C2v), monoclinic (C2h, C1h, C2) and triclinic (C1 or CS).|$|E
5|$|The {{two towers}} of Waterfalls {{impossible}} building are topped with compound polyhedra, one {{a compound of}} three cubes, the other a stellated <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron known as Escher's solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars, which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6cm refracting telescope and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars.|$|E
5|$|Use-wear {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the plates on the pommel and the crossguard {{were made by the}} same artist, while the plates on the grip were added later. The latter – obverse and reverse – were probably decorated in the same workshop and using the same tools, but by two different craftsmen. Moreover, a side plate with a <b>rhombic</b> pattern was added in the 19th century to replace one of the lost inscripted side plates.|$|E
5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid {{version of the same}} octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E

25|$|The vertex-first {{parallel}} {{projection of}} the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral envelope. Twelve of the 24 octahedral cells project in pairs onto six square dipyramids that meet {{at the center of}} the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron. The remaining 12 octahedral cells project onto the 12 <b>rhombic</b> faces of the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron.|$|E

25|$|Johannes Kepler in Harmonices Mundi (1618) named this {{polyhedron}} a rhombicuboctahedron, being {{short for}} truncated cuboctahedral rhombus, with cuboctahedral rhombus being his {{name for a}} <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron. This truncation creates new vertices mid-edge to the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron, creating rectangular faces inside the original <b>rhombic</b> faces, and new square and triangle faces at the original vertices. The semiregular form here requires the geometry be adjusted so the rectangles become squares.|$|E

25|$|The Minkowski sum of any two zonohedra {{is another}} zonohedron, {{generated}} by the union of the generators of the two given zonohedra. Thus, the Minkowski sum of a cube and a truncated octahedron forms the truncated cuboctahedron, while the Minkowski sum of the cube and the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron forms the truncated <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron. Both of these zonohedra are simple (three faces meet at each vertex), as is the truncated small rhombicuboctahedron formed from the Minkowski sum of the cube, truncated octahedron, and <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rhombic</b> triacontahedron is {{the dual}} of the icosidodecahedron.|$|E

25|$|A vertex-first {{cross-section}} uses some hyperplane {{orthogonal to}} a line joining opposite vertices {{of one of the}} 24-cells. For instance, one could take any of the coordinate hyperplanes in the coordinate system given above (i.e. the planes determined by x'i = 0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by one of these hyperplanes gives a <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral honeycomb. Each of the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedra corresponds to a maximal cross-section of one of the 24-cells intersecting the hyperplane (the center of each such (4-dimensional) 24-cell lies in the hyperplane). Accordingly, the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral honeycomb is the Voronoi tessellation of the D3 root lattice (a face-centered cubic lattice). Shifting this hyperplane halfway to one of the vertices (e.g. x'i = ½) gives rise to a regular cubic honeycomb. In this case the center of each 24-cell lies off the hyperplane. Shifting again, so the hyperplane intersects the vertex, gives another <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral honeycomb but with new 24-cells (the former ones having shrunk to points). In general, for any integer n, the cross-section through x'i = n is a <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral honeycomb, and the cross-section through x'i = n + ½ is a cubic honeycomb. As the hyperplane moves through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between the two periodically.|$|E

25|$|Robertson's apex graph {{is shown}} in the figure. It can be {{obtained}} by connecting an apex vertex to each of the degree-three vertices of a <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron, or by merging two diametrally opposed vertices of a four-dimensional hypercube graph. Because the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron's graph is planar, Robertson's graph is an apex graph. It is a triangle-free graph with minimum degree four, so it cannot be changed by any YΔY-reduction.|$|E
25|$|Heating {{a mixture}} of solid mercury(II) sulfate and sodium {{chloride}} also affords volatile HgCl2, which sublimes and condenses {{in the form of}} small <b>rhombic</b> crystals.|$|E
25|$|Generators {{parallel}} {{to the edges of}} an octahedron form a truncated octahedron, and generators {{parallel to}} the long diagonals of a cube form a <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|If, instead, every sphere is {{augmented}} {{with the}} points in space that {{are closer to}} it than to any other sphere, the duals of these honeycombs are produced: the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral honeycomb for fcc, and the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb for hcp.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{antennae}} {{were added}} to the site over the years, each for a specific purpose, particularly after OTC took control of the station. In 1960 two <b>rhombic</b> antennae were installed for use with NASA space missions, bringing the total number of antennae up to 22.|$|E
25|$|Roger Penrose (b. 1931) {{discovered}} in 1974 the Penrose tiling, {{a pattern that}} {{is related to the}} golden ratio both in the ratio of areas of its two <b>rhombic</b> tiles and in their relative frequency within the pattern. This in turn led to new discoveries about quasicrystals.|$|E
25|$|Cross section—the {{horizontal}} cross-section {{taken at}} {{some distance from}} the base. It is possible to discern retouching or rebuilding in deteriorated parts of the edges. The following types of cross section are commonly seen: triangular (sub-triangular and backed triangular), <b>rhombic</b> (rhomboidal and backed rhomboidal), trapezium (trapezoid and backed trapezoidal), pentagon (pentagonal and backed pentagonal), polygonal, biconvex or lenticular (sub lenticular).|$|E
25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a hot end and a cold end, containing a power piston and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a <b>rhombic</b> drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, {{but they can be}} joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} studying zonohedra {{is that the}} Voronoi diagram of any lattice forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are zonohedra. Any zonohedron formed in this way can tessellate 3-dimensional space and is called a primary parallelohedron. Each primary parallelohedron is combinatorially equivalent to one of five types: the rhombohedron (including the cube), hexagonal prism, truncated octahedron, <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron, and the rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|Other Rubik's Cube {{modifications}} include cubes {{that have}} been extended or truncated {{to form a new}} shape. An example of this is the Trabjer's Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3×3. Most shape mods can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of Tony Fisher's <b>Rhombic</b> Dodecahedron, there are 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, and 6×6 versions of the puzzle.|$|E
25|$|The first 8 {{vertices}} are the vertices of {{a regular}} 16-cell and the other 16 are the vertices of the dual tesseract. This gives a construction equivalent to cutting a tesseract into 8 cubical pyramids, and then attaching them to the facets of a second tesseract. This {{is equivalent to the}} dual of a rectified 16-cell. The analogous construction in 3-space gives the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron which, however, is not regular.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{bubbles in}} soapy {{water in a}} fcc or hcp arrangement, when {{the water in the}} gaps between the bubbles drains out, also {{approach}} the <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedral honeycomb or trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. However, such fcc or hcp foams of very small liquid content are unstable, as they do not satisfy Plateau's laws. The Kelvin foam and the Weaire–Phelan foam are more stable, having smaller interfacial energy in the limit of a very small liquid content.|$|E
25|$|The Jitterbug Transformation {{provided}} a unifying dynamic in this work, with much significance {{attached to the}} doubling and quadrupling of edges that occurred, when a cuboctahedron is collapsed through icosahedral, octahedral and tetrahedral stages, then inside-outed and re-expanded in a complementary fashion. The JT formed a bridge between 3,4-fold rotationally symmetric shapes, and the 5-fold family, such as a <b>rhombic</b> triacontahedron, which later he analyzed {{in terms of the}} T module, another tetrahedral wedge with the same volume as his A and B modules.|$|E
25|$|The planar graphs and {{the apex}} graphs are linklessly embeddable, {{as are the}} graphs {{obtained}} by Y-Δ transforms from these graphs. The YΔY reducible graphs are the graphs that {{can be reduced to}} a single vertex by Y-Δ transforms, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices; they are also minor-closed, and include all planar graphs. However, there exist linkless graphs that are not YΔY reducible, such as the apex graph formed by connecting an apex vertex to every degree-three vertex of a <b>rhombic</b> dodecahedron. There also exist linkless graphs that cannot be transformed into an apex graph by Y-Δ transforms, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices: for instance, the ten-vertex crown graph has a linkless embedding, but cannot be transformed into an apex graph in this way.|$|E
25|$|Beta vulgaris is an {{herbaceous}} biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to 120cm (rarely 200cm) height; cultivated {{forms are}} mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. vulgaris); or brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen and woody {{in the wild}} subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is oblanceolate to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent midrib, with entire or undulate margin, 5–20cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The upper leaves are smaller, their blades are <b>rhombic</b> to narrowly lanceolate.|$|E
