50|$|<b>Shake</b> <b>Ray</b> Turbine was a DIY rock/punk {{band from}} Little Rock, Arkansas. They {{formed in the}} summer of 1995 and played their first show that August with Richard Matson as vocalist. The band toured and {{recorded}} from 1996-1998. As of late 1998, <b>Shake</b> <b>Ray</b> Turbine had material for their second full-length album (with several songs reaching the 7-14 minute marks), but none of these songs were ever recorded; their last show as Arkansas residents was with Fugazi in Conway, AR in November 1998. The band relocated to Philadelphia around January 1999; soon after, Dustin Clark left the band and Jeb Bell (Fracture) took over on bass.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Radially {{oriented}} ray {{tissue is}} important for regulating radial strength of wood. The present study was undertaken {{in order to assess}} whether radial <b>rays</b> in-fluence ring <b>shake</b> occurrence in chestnut wood (Casta-nea sativa Mill.), a species very prone to ring <b>shake.</b> <b>Ray</b> volume fraction was measured on tangential samples from two sets of wood discs, either with or without ring shake, collected from three coppice stands in the south-ern part of the Swiss Alps. Our data indicate that ring shaken trees tend to exhibit higher ray volume than un-shaken ones. This rather unexpected finding could be partly explained if biomechanical processes that control and determine the inner architecture of the tree are con-sidered...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Rays</b> <b>shook</b> off {{the ghosts}} of Red Sox past to win their first American League pennant, winning a tight game 3-1. Dustin Pedroia got the Red Sox {{off to a good}} start with a one-out solo homer in the first off Matt Garza, but Garza settled in and {{delivered}} an MVP performance. Tampa Bay tied the game in the fourth with an Evan Longoria RBI double, then went ahead in the fifth on an RBI single by Rocco Baldelli. In the seventh, Willy Aybar added insurance with a solo home run to leadoff. In the eighth, David Price, who made his major league debut a little over a month before came on to pitch to J. D. Drew with the bases loaded and struck him out on a checked swing. In the ninth, Price recorded his first Major League save by getting Jed Lowrie to ground into a force play to Akinori Iwamura. With the win, the Rays become the second team to go to the World Series after posting the worst record the year before, joining the 1991 Atlanta Braves, who went on to lose to the Minnesota Twins.|$|R

[...] Mr. <b>Ray</b> laughed and <b>shook</b> {{his head in}} mockery of her cheap device. [...] "You mustn't be vexed because I'm so vague about it. I'm very ignorant." ...|$|R

'Thank you, sir,' with a most {{grateful}} {{touch of}} the hat; and Guy hastened to set things in order, preferring the carols to everything at that moment, even though disabused of his pristine admiration for James Robinson's fiddle, and for Harry <b>Ray's</b> grand <b>shake.</b> A long space was spent in listening, and a still longer in the endeavour to show what Mr. Ashford meant by suggesting some improvements which they were regarding with dislike and suspicion, till they found Sir Guy was of the same mind. In fact, when he had sung a verse or two to illustrate his meaning, {{the opinion of the}} choir was, that, with equal advantages, Sir Guy might sing quite as well as Harry Ray.|$|R

Though <b>Ray's</b> {{confidence}} is <b>shaken,</b> Tony saves him by playing [...] "The Flame Still Burns". Brian is pleased to hear the band playing the song, which helps him finally overcome his demons and joins the band onstage to play an inspiring guitar solo, much to the surprise and delight of everyone.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{commentary}} {{regarding the}} music video focused on Cyrus' increasingly provocative image. Margaret Eby of Daily News stated that she [...] "just can't stop strutting her stuff" [...] and [...] " [...] several barely-there outfits in the three-minute video." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post shared a similar sentiment, adding that [...] "even though her wardrobe {{is full of}} crop tops and itty bitty shorts, Miley Cyrus' skimpy outfits still manage to shock." [...] A writer for Rap-Up provided a favorable review, complimenting Cyrus for [...] " [...] up the heat" [...] in the [...] "striking visuals". Writing for VH1, Emily Exton joked that [...] "hip-hop's fledgling relationship with a former Disney star just got a little stronger", and noted that [...] "Jay-Z may have encouraged Miley’s love of twerking with his [...] "Somewhereinamerica" [...] shout-out, but it appears Sean is less interested in seeing Billy <b>Ray's</b> daughter <b>shake</b> her thing than having her walk around in dazzling heels and stare the camera down {{in the name of}} art." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ray {{attended}} an elite vocational fine art & design high school specifically {{established by the}} Ontario Ministry of Education for those showing exceptional talent in fine art and design. An intense and rigorous 4-year program, many who started never completed the course but Ray seemed to thrive in this environment. It was during this time that his sister Eileen passed on. This <b>shook</b> <b>Ray</b> to the core but he continued on, graduating and finding himself on the road, heading west and away from Ottawa. Reaching Vancouver, Ray studied at the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. Not feeling all that challenged by their curriculum, after one year he dropped out and found himself drawn to a world he would eventually return to for good ... music! That started with him playing bass in a Vancouver punk rock group called The Secret Vs.|$|R
60|$|The Lunardi, {{mounting}} {{through a}} stagnant calm {{in a line}} almost vertical, had pierced the morning mists, and now swam emancipated in a heaven of exquisite blue. Below us, by some trick of eyesight, the country had grown concave, its horizons curving up like the rim of a shallow bowl--a bowl heaped, in point of fact, with sea-fog, but to our eyes with a froth delicate and dazzling as a whipped syllabub of snow. Upon it the travelling shadow of the balloon became no shadow but a stain: an amethyst (you might call it) purged of all grosser properties than colour and lucency. At times thrilled by no perceptible wind, rather by {{the pulse of the}} sun's <b>rays,</b> the froth <b>shook</b> and parted: and then behold, deep in the crevasses, vignetted and shining, an acre or two of the earth of man's business and fret--tilled slopes of the Lothians, ships dotted on the Forth, the capital like a hive that some child had smoked--the ear of fancy could almost hear it buzzing.|$|R
