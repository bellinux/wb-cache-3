40|$|The {{relationship}} between media representations and real {{acts of violence}} {{is one of the}} most contentious and hotly debated issues today. This book is the first to bring together a selection of highly influential readings that have helped to shape this area of research. It includes key investigations of how, and with what implications, the media portray violence in the twenty-first century. Critical Readings: Violence and the Media contains sections examining how media violence and its `effects' have been theorized; how media production contexts influence the <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>representation</b> of violence; and how audiences engage with depictions of violence. Violence is analysed in as it is portrayed in different media formats, including television, film, radio, the news, public information campaigns, comics, video games, popular music, photography, and the internet. The readings cover a range of perspectives, including social learning, desensitisation and cultivation theories, `no-effects' models, sociological, feminist and postmodern arguments. An editor's introduction and section introductions serve to contextualise the readings. Providing a detailed and theoretically grounded consideration of the cultural and social significance of media violence, Critical Readings: Violence and the Media is an essential resource for students of media studies, cultural studies, sociology and communication studies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} the media in construction of a destination image with the theoretical framework being applied to the experience of Kenya as a tourist destination. The objectives of the study are to empirically analyse {{the role of the}} media as a factor in destination image construction, to analyse the impact of media on visitation, and to propose a media communication framework that can be applied by the Kenya Tourism Board to influence construction of a positive destination image of Kenya in normal times, and to mitigate negative media representations in times of crisis. An in-depth literature review was conducted and a mixed method approach was used to collect data. The quantitative method was used to collect data from actual and potential visitors to Kenya through airport and web-based surveys. Through in-depth interviews with Kenya tourism stakeholders, the qualitative method explored: the current tourism situation in Kenya; views of the stakeholders on the influence of media <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>representation</b> on the destination image and visitation; and the media communications strategies followed by the Kenya tourism industry in promoting the image of Kenya. The resulting data from the surveys are mostly categorical in nature and were analysed using Chi square tests and T-tests. Analysis of the qualitative data was done by summarising the content of the interviews and categorising the statements, from which conclusions were drawn. The findings revealed that the media has an influence on destination perception, however not all aspects of the destination image will be influenced and not all media information sources have the capacity to influence. Similarly the media will influence destination visitation but again not all media has the capacity to influence, and the potential and the actual visitors intent to visit will be influenced differently. Television news reports and television travel documentaries were identified as the most influential media in construction of the organic image of Kenya. Nevertheless, in regard to the construction of a destination image in general, although both potential and actual visitors will depend mostly on the Internet and travel guides, it is the media of television, travel guides and newspapers that were found most influential. Of the three, the media of television proved to be prominent. From the perspective of the Kenyan stakeholders the Internet and social media are the most used sources for providing information on Kenya. The results show that although the media is influential in construction of a destination image and also on visitation intent, it is not as highly influential as theorised or expected. Other aspects that influence destination image and visitation come into play. A media communication framework for destination image is constructed based on the empirical results of the study.

40|$|Today the {{questions}} of adaptation and mitigation to climate change risks are arching their way out to community platforms in an interpretive flow through various communication modes that shape public opinion and mediate scientific commentaries. At the forefront of this process, are news media which facilitate critical public engagement in alternative discourse concerning climate change controversies. However, {{the question of whether}} or not the media can lead to informed citizenry that can help communities and governments to enact sustainability measures for society is an elusive one. Some quarters have put reservations on the ecological integrity of media concerning climate change highlights as it plays to the tune of dominant systems of environmental representation, which is biased on framing alarming reports of ecological collapse. Using content analysis of selected media this paper examines climate change <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>representations</b> in Kenya. Further interviews were done with scientists to examine their perception about climate science reporting in Kenya’s mainstream media. It was found that climate change continues to receive low coverage locally, however from time to time when new research findings are published the media are quick to flash out alarmist news. This brings the question of true representation of science in mainstream media; is it a triumph of business over journalistic norms as media are quick to sell and remain relevant? The findings also posit a proactive role yet to be embraced by the media in addressing environmental failures as well as its healing possibilities in bid to tackle the prevailing climate change crisis observed both globally and locally...|$|R

40|$|Rumour and {{speculation}} in Iran have been rife for generations that the BBC {{has had a}} hand in every political upheaval in the country. In this vein the BBC has become a notable element in the complex and tortured narrative of Anglo-Iranian relations. The BBC Persian Service was initially developed in 1940 to prepare and broadcast British war-time propaganda. And it has since been seen by many in Iran {{as an integral part of}} British policy-making in the region. Thirty years ago, the Shah of Iran regarded the BBC Persian Service radio as his 'enemy number one' and held it responsible for promoting the revolution of 1979. Only a couple decades earlier, the BBC Persian Service was widely accused for having been complicit in the CIA-led 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Musaddiq. And a decade earlier, the BBC Persian Service was strongly linked to the British-planned removal of Reza Shah in 1941. The BBC Persian service has frequently been perceived as an entity which was not simply a vehicle to record the changes occurring in Iran and throughout the Middle East, but rather an active agent of change. In this book, Annabelle Sreberny and Massoumeh Torfeh track the history of the BBC Persian Service, critically analysing both the assumptions that the BBC is a standard bearer for objective <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>representations</b> of it as a simple tool of Western interests. Also examining the history of relations between the Foreign Office and the BBC Persian Service, they demonstrate that these have never been pre-defined or rigid. Instead, they explore how both institutions have moved from an interest in what can crudely be called state-orchestrated 'propaganda' to a more subtle advocacy of fair and balanced journalism as the best agent of British values and influenc...|$|R
40|$|This thesis theorizes the {{neoliberal}} restructuring {{of capitalism and}} the gendered trajectories of biopolitics that have occurred alongside the reconfiguration of the state, post-September 11, 2001.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{circulation}} and reproductive impact of public representations of the Burnage Report, a document which loomed large in the public debates in Britain on the issue of antiracism policies in schools in the late 1980 s. Emanating from an inquiry into a student's murder at Manchester's Burnage High School, the Report was held up in much of the British press as having concluded that antiracism policies were a blameworthy factor in the murder. Such conclusions were contested by the authors of the Report, who maintained that racism, not antiracism, was the primary factor in the murder. Making use of methodologies and analyses derived from the fields of Cultural Studies and Critical Discourse Analysis, this thesis examines the apparent disjuncture between the <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> its <b>representations,</b> comparing a "preferred reading" of the Report with press readings, and analyzing the discursive sources of press representations of antiracism.

40|$|Abstract—Eyewitness <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> {{cultural}} <b>representations</b> {{have been}} interpreted by some researchers {{to suggest the}} existence of a large, long-bodied marine vertebrate in the northeast Pacific. Dubbed “Caddy ” or “Cadborosaurus” (after Cadboro Bay, British Columbia), it was formally named and described as Cadborosaurus willsi by Bousfield and LeBlond in 1995. Among the supposedly most informative accounts is the alleged 1968 capture of a juvenile by William Hagelund, detailed in his 1987 book Whalers No More. Reportedly morphologically similar to adult “Cadborosaurs, ” the specimen was comparatively tiny, and apparently precocial. Bousfield and LeBlond argue that this strongly supports their contention that “Caddy ” is reptilian (juvenile reptiles are typically precocial, recalling “miniature adults ” in both behavior and morphology). Anomalous traits suggest some degree of misrecollection in Hagelund’s account, furthermore a quantitative analysis of the similarity of 14 candidate identities with the specimen indicates that it most strongly resembles the bay pipefish (Syngnathus leptorhynchus) —far more so than a cryptid or reptile. While this detracts from the plausibility of the cryptid, the re-identification of this particular specimen does not discount the data as a whole nor does it suggest that all “Caddy ” reports are necessarily of known fish. We contend that the “reptilian hypothesis ” does, however, need to be seriously re-examined in light of the removal of a strong piece of evidence...|$|R

This computerization combined with new threats present a challenging complexity. Situational awareness in evolving distributed operations and follow-up in training systems depends on humans in the field reporting observations of events. The use of this observer-reported information can be largely improved by implementation of models supporting both <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> computer <b>representation</b> of objects <b>and</b> phenomena in operations. This thesis characterises and describes observer model-based data collection in distributed tactical operations, where multiple, dispersed units work to achieve common goals. Reconstruction and exploration of multimedia representations of operations is becoming an established means for supporting taskforce training. We explore how modelling of operational processes and entities can support observer data collection and increase information content in mission histories. We use realistic exercises for testing developed models, methods and tools for observer data collection and transfer results to live operations. The main contribution of this thesis is the systematic description of the model-based approach to using observers for data collection. Methodological aspects in using humans to collect data to be used in information systems, and also modelling aspects for phenomena occurring in emergency response and communication areas contribute to the body of research. We describe a general methodology for using human observers to collect adequate data for use in information systems. In addition, we describe methods and tools to collect data on the chain of medical attendance in emergency response exercises, and on command-and-control processes in several domains...|$|R

40|$|Background: in 2009 a novel infective agent, a(H 1 n 1), was {{recognized}} by the World Health organization (WHo) as a pandemic virus. Like most European countries, Italy experienced a single pandemic wave during fall-winter 2009. The objective of our study was to evaluate the news <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> the <b>representation</b> of the a(H 1 n 1) pandemic in the Italian newspapers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods: from april 24 th, 2009 to February 28 th, 2010, seven national newspapers were monitored for the quantitative reporting of a(H 1 n 1). In a three month sample period, reports were evaluated quali- tatively by considering their front page presence, tones used for headlines, and images and figures dedicated to the topic. Results: in a ten month window, a total of 1220 articles were published. The reporting period showed four peaks and one hollow, with a similar pattern for all the newspapers. during the three-month sample period, we found a total of 382 articles, 98. 4 % of which appeared on front pages, 33. 8 % of which contained headlines using alarming tones, and 47. 8 % which contained info-graphic elements. Conclusions: the a(H 1 n 1) 2009 pandemic in Italy was mild; nonetheless, newspapers devoted great attention to the new influenza and used alarmist tones. In similar situations, there are several areas where scientists should play a greater role. scientists should support journalists in understanding scientific issues and help them translate scientific information into news items. scientists should also help to contain the anxiety aroused in lay people by a pandemic, and support vaccination efforts dedicated to it [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} an image <b>representation</b> <b>and</b> matching framework for image categorization in medical image archives. Categorization enables to determine automatically, {{based on the}} image content, the examined body region and imaging modality. It is a basic step in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems, the goal {{of which is to}} augment textbased search with visual information analysis. CBIR systems are currently being integrated with Picture-Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) for increasing the overall search capabilities and tools available to radiologists. The proposed methodology is comprised of a continuous <b>and</b> probabilistic image <b>representation</b> scheme using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) along with information-theoretic image matching via the Kullback Leibler (KL) measure. The GMM-KL framework is used for matching and categorizing x-ray images by body regions. A multi-dimensional feature space is used to represent the image input, including intensity, texture and spatial information. Unsupervised clustering via the GMM is used to extract coherent regions in feature space which are then used in the matching process. A dominant characteristic of the radiological images is their poor contrast and large intensity variations. This presents a challenge to matching between images and is handled via an illumination invariant representation. The GMM-KL framework is evaluated for image categorization and image retrieval on a dataset of 1500 radiological images. A classification rate of 97. 5 % was achieved. The classification results compare favorably with <b>reported</b> global <b>and</b> local <b>representation</b> schemes.
