25|$|Related to this, a single-pole RCD/RCBO {{interrupts}} the energized conductor only, while a double-pole device interrupts {{both the}} energized and return conductors. Usually {{this is a}} standard and safe practice, since the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> is held at ground potential anyway. However, because of its design, a single-pole RCD will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations, for example where the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> is not being held, as expected, at ground potential, or where current leakage occurs between the return and earth conductors. In these cases, a double-pole RCD will offer protection, since the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> would also be disconnected.|$|E
25|$|Typically an {{electric}} railway will {{have at least}} one of the rails used as a <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> for the traction current. This rail is in contact with the earth at many places throughout its length. Since current will follow every parallel path between source and load, some part of the traction current will also flow through the earth. Where the railway uses direct current, this stray current can cause damage to other buried metallic objects by electrolysis and accelerate corrosion of metal objects in touch with the soil.|$|E
2500|$|Power is {{supplied}} to moving trains with a (nearly) continuous conductor {{running along the}} track that usually takes one of two forms: overhead line, suspended from poles or towers along the track or from structure or tunnel ceilings; third rail mounted at track level and contacted by a sliding [...] "pickup shoe". Both overhead wire and third-rail systems usually use the running rails as the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> but some systems use a separate fourth rail for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Coplanar {{waveguide}} (CPW) has the <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> {{on top of}} {{the substrate}} in the same plane as the main line, unlike stripline and microstrip where the <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> are ground planes above or below the substrate. The <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> are placed either side of the main line and made wide enough that they can be considered to extend to infinity. Like microstrip, CPW has quasi-TEM propagation.|$|R
50|$|Coplanar {{waveguide}} {{is a type}} {{of electrical}} planar transmission line which can be fabricated using printed circuit board technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. On a smaller scale, coplanar waveguide transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) consists of a single conducting track printed onto a dielectric substrate, together with a pair of <b>return</b> <b>conductors,</b> one to either side of the track. All three conductors are {{on the same side of}} the substrate, and hence are coplanar. The <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> are separated from the central track by a small gap, which has an unvarying width along the length of the line. Away from the cental <b>conductor,</b> the <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> usually extend to an indefinite but large distance, so that each is notionally a semi-infinite plane.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its advantages, CPW has not proved popular. Its {{disadvantages}} include that <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> {{take up a}} {{large amount}} of board area that cannot be used for mounting components. However, it is possible in some designs to achieve a greater density of components than microstrip. More seriously, there is a second mode in CPW that has zero frequency cutoff. Since this mode cannot be avoided by operating below it, and multiple modes are undesirable, it needs to be suppressed. It is an odd mode, meaning that the electric potentials on the two <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> are equal and opposite. Thus, it can be suppressed by bonding the two <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> together. This can be achieved with a bottom ground plane (conductor backed coplanar waveguide, CBCPW) and periodic plated through holes, or periodic [...] {{on the top of the}} board. Both these solutions detract from the basic simplicity of CPW.|$|R
2500|$|The {{number of}} poles {{represents}} the number of conductors that are interrupted when a fault condition occurs. [...] RCDs used on single-phase AC supplies (two current paths), such as domestic power, are usually one- or two-pole designs, also known as single- and double-pole. A single-pole RCD interrupts only the energized conductor, while a double-pole RCD interrupts both the energized and return conductors. (In a single-pole RCD, the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> is usually anticipated to be at ground potential at all times and therefore safe on its own, however see limitations below).|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to ground (earth) for several reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> (see single-wire earth return).|$|E
2500|$|RCDs {{are usually}} {{testable}} and resettable devices. Commonly {{they include a}} button that when pressed, safely creates a small leakage condition, and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared. Depending upon their design, some RCDs disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault, while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> being at ground (earth) potential. [...] The former {{are commonly known as}} [...] "double-pole" [...] designs; the latter as [...] "single-pole" [...] designs. [...] If the fault has left the return wire [...] "floating" [...] or not at its expected ground potential for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.|$|E
50|$|Work was {{completed}} in 2016 to replace the subsea sections of the LV <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> with two new return cables. This {{was carried out by}} Nexans (Norway) with the aid of Morrows (N.I) and Romac Civil Engineering (N.I).|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} years of the 20th century, various {{patented}} forms of wiring system such as Bergman and Peschel tubing were used to protect wiring; these used very thin fiber tubes, or metal tubes which were also used as <b>return</b> <b>conductors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Twisted pair cabling {{is a form}} of wiring {{in which}} pairs of wires (the forward and <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> of a single circuit) are twisted {{together}} for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other wire pairs and from external sources. This type of cable is used for home and corporate Ethernet networks. Twisted pair cabling is used in short patch cables and in the longer runs in structured cabling.|$|R
2500|$|Stray voltage is {{any case}} of {{undesirable}} elevated electrical potential, but more precise terminology gives {{an indication of}} the source of the [...] voltage. Neutral to earth voltage (NEV) specifically refers to a difference in potential between a locally grounded object and the grounded <b>return</b> <b>conductor,</b> or neutral, of an electrical system. The neutral is theoretically at 0V potential, as any grounded object, but current flows on the neutral back to the source, somewhat elevating the neutral voltage. [...] NEV is the product of current flowing on the neutral and the finite, non-zero impedance of the neutral conductor between a given point and its source, often a distant substation. [...] NEV differs from accidentally energized objects because it is an unavoidable result of normal system operation, not an accident or a fault in materials or design.|$|E
50|$|These {{effects can}} be {{eliminated}} with installation of a metallic <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> between the two ends of the monopolar transmission line. Since one terminal of the converters is connected to earth, the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> need not be insulated for the full transmission voltage which makes it less costly than the high-voltage conductor. The decision {{of whether or not}} to use a metallic <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> is based upon economic, technical and environmental factors.|$|E
50|$|The {{important}} part of the electric field of a conductor extends to the <b>return</b> <b>conductor,</b> which usually is only a few feet distant. At greater distance, the aggregate field can be approximated by the differential field between conductor and <b>return</b> <b>conductor,</b> which tend to cancel. Hence, the intensity of the electric field is usually inappreciable at a distance which is still small compared to the wavelength. Within the range in which an appreciable field exists, this field is practically in phase with the flow of energy in the conductor. That is, the velocity of propagation has no appreciable effect unless the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> is very distant, or entirely absent, or the frequency is so high that the distance to the <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> is an appreciable portion of the wavelength.|$|E
50|$|CPW is {{simpler to}} manufacture; {{there is only}} one plane of {{metallization}} and components can be surface mounted whether they are connected in series or shunt (that is, in parallel across the line). Shunt components in stripline and microstrip require a connection through {{to the bottom of the}} substrate. CPW is also easier to miniaturise; its characteristic impedance depends on the ratio of the line width to the distance between <b>return</b> <b>conductors</b> rather than the absolute value of line width.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical calculations of lightning surge currents and voltages in a telecommunication building during direct strike to the communication tower. The analysis concerned currents in waveguides and DC <b>return</b> <b>conductors,</b> potential differences between various installations and voltages induced in cable loops. The calculations were carried out using a numerical program based on the electromagnetic field theory and the method of moments. Large voltages were observed between isolated cable installations (even those running very close to each other). For cables grounded at one end the corresponding voltages were much lower. ...|$|R
2500|$|... 1+N and 1P+N – {{non-standard}} terms used in {{the context}} of RCBOs, at times used differently by different manufacturers. Typically these terms may signify that the <b>return</b> (neutral) <b>conductor</b> is an isolating pole only, without a protective element (an unprotected but switched neutral), or that the RCBO provides a conducting path and connectors for the <b>return</b> (neutral) <b>conductor</b> but this path remains uninterrupted when a fault occurs (sometimes known as [...] "solid neutral"), or that both conductors are disconnected for some faults (such as RCD detected leakage) but only one conductor is disconnected for other faults (such as overload).|$|R

50|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} {{with a central}} rail sectional steel conductor; the sections were connected by copper strips, U shaped to allow expansion of the joints. The rails were used as <b>return</b> <b>conductors,</b> also connected by copper strips at rail joints. The total resistance was approximately 0.25 Ohms per mile. The centre track conductor was not laid at twelve level crossings; electrical connectivity was maintained by having a collector {{on the front and}} rear of the locomotive-carriages, the distance between which was greater than the insulated section. Another level crossing, made at a slew angle, 150 ft long used an overhead copper wire, 15 ft high, connecting to a cast iron collector {{on the roof of the}} locomotive. After a lightning strike resulted in several electrificutions, and caused blown fuses at the generator the rails were connected to earth at several points.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} use of unbalanced {{transmission lines}} was for electric telegraph communications. These consisted of single wires strung between poles. The return path {{for the current}} was originally provided by a separate conductor. Some early telegraph systems, such as Schilling's experimental needle telegraph (1832) and the Cooke & Wheatstone five-needle telegraph (1837) used by British railways required multiple code wires. Essentially, they were parallel bus coding. In these systems {{the cost of the}} <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> was not so significant (one conductor in seven for Schilling's earliest needle telegraph and one conductor in six for the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph) but the number of coding conductors was progressively reduced with improved systems. Soon only one coding wire was required with the data being transmitted serially. Important examples of these single-wire systems were the Morse telegraph (1837) and the Cooke & Wheatstone single-needle telegraph (1843). In such systems the cost of a <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> was fully 50 per cent of the cable costs. It was discovered that a <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> could be replaced with a return path through the Earth using grounding spikes. Using earth return was a significant cost saving and rapidly became the norm.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and professional audio, a balanced line or balanced signal pair is a transmission line {{consisting of two}} conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. The chief advantage of the balanced line format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a differential amplifier. Common forms of balanced line are twin-lead, used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair, used for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to unbalanced lines, such as coaxial cable, {{which is designed to}} have its <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> connected to ground, or circuits whose <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> actually is ground. Balanced and unbalanced circuits can be interconnected using a transformer called a balun.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electrode}} line {{is used in}} some high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) {{power transmission}} systems which use the ground or sea as the return path for electric current. Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated metallic <b>return</b> <b>conductor</b> on an overhead wire or cable.|$|E

The magnet is a circular current dominated design with a circular iron <b>return</b> yoke. <b>Conductor</b> angles are determined by a method of direct multipole elimination which theoretically eliminates the first four higher order multipole field components. Coils are fabricated from solid round film-insulated conductor, wound as a single layer ''non-spiral bedstead'' coil having a diagonal leadout entirely within one upturned end. The coils are wound and stretched straight in a special winder, then bent in simple fixtures to form the upturned ends...|$|R

40|$|Direct current (DC) {{traction}} power systems {{are widely used}} in metro transport systems, with running rails usually being used as <b>return</b> <b>conductors.</b> When traction current flows through the running rails, a potential voltage known as “rail potential” is generated between the rails and ground. Currently, abnormal rises of rail potential exist in many railway lines during the operation of railway systems. Excessively high rail potentials {{pose a threat to}} human life and to devices connected to the rails. In this paper, the effect of regenerative power distribution on rail potential is analyzed. Maximum safety regenerative power tracking is proposed for the control of maximum absolute rail potential and energy consumption during the operation of DC {{traction power}} systems. The dwell time of multiple trains at each station and the trigger voltage of the regenerative energy absorbing device (READ) are optimized based on an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to manage the distribution of regenerative power. In this way, the maximum absolute rail potential and energy consumption of DC traction power systems can be reduced. The operation data of Guangzhou Metro Line 2 are used in the simulations, and the results show that the scheme can reduce the maximum absolute rail potential and energy consumption effectively and guarantee the safety in energy saving of DC traction power systems...|$|R
50|$|In bipolar {{transmission}} {{a pair of}} conductors is used, each at a high potential with respect to ground, in opposite polarity. Since these conductors must be insulated for the full voltage, transmission line cost is higher than a monopole with a <b>return</b> <b>conductor.</b> However, {{there are a number}} of advantages to {{bipolar transmission}} which can make it an attractive option.|$|E
50|$|Two of the {{high-voltage}} cables {{are normally}} {{used as the}} respective high-voltage conductors for the two converter poles and the medium-voltage cable is normally used as the neutral <b>return</b> <b>conductor,</b> but the third high-voltage cable is capable of being connected in parallel with, or instead of, {{any of the other}} three cables, giving a large number of possible operating modes.|$|E
50|$|Underground {{telegraph}} cables {{into large}} buildings or between stations often needed to carry multiple independent telegraph lines. These cables {{took the form}} of multiple insulated conductors enclosed by a metal screen and overall protective jacket. In such cables the screen can be used as the <b>return</b> <b>conductor.</b> Undersea telegraph cables were usually a single conductor protected by steel-wire armour, effectively a coaxial cable. The first transatlantic cable of this kind was completed in 1866.|$|E
25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} {{current transformer}} which surrounds (but is not electrically connected to) the live and neutral conductors.
