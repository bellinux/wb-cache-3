They held an estate from the king, {{consisting of a}} house, a garden, a field, stock, and a salary, on condition of personal service on the king's errand. They could not delegate the service, on penalty of death. When ordered abroad, they could nominate a capable son to hold the benefice and carry on the duty. If there was no capable son, the state put in a locum tenens but granted one-third to the wife to maintain herself and her children. The fief was otherwise inalienable; {{it could not be}} sold, pledged, exchanged, sublet, devised or diminished. Other land was leased from the state. Ancestral estate was strictly tied to the family. If a holder would sell, the family kept the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption,</b> and there seems to have been no time limit to its exercise.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), if an Israelite fell into straits and came under a {{resident}} alien's authority {{by virtue of}} his debts, the Israelite debtor was to have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> A relative was to redeem him or, if he prospered, he could redeem himself by paying the pro rata share of the sales price for the remaining years until the jubilee.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, {{as a result}} of debts, the County of Zweibrücken was pledged, with the Palatinate holding the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> Count Palatine Stephan found these rights useful when he married Anna von Veldenz in 1406, {{daughter}} of Count Friedrich III, the last count in the younger line of Veldenz. In 1444, after Friedrich’s death, Stephan founded a new principality out of the County of Veldenz and the redeemed County of Zweibrücken, which {{came to be known as}} the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Breitenbach now lay within this new state.|$|R
40|$|Neste artigo, abordamos o acesso de pessoas em situação de rua com transtorno mental grave aos serviços públicos de saúde mental. Para tanto, realizamos revisão narrativa sobre o tema. Concluímos que os serviços de Assistência Social têm frequente contato com essa parcela da população, oferecendo respostas às suas necessidades, como moradia e resgate de direitos civis. Os serviços de saúde mental ainda apresentam dificuldades em estabelecer estratégias para o atendimento às pessoas em sofrimento mental na própria rua e em inseri-las em CAPS e UBS. Desse modo, a rede socioassistencial tem sido frequentemente a porta de entrada dessa população aos serviços de saúde mental, indicando que o trabalho intersetorial precisa ser mais bem desenvolvido para a efetividade do acesso à rede pública de saúde. In this paper, {{we address}} the access of {{homeless}} people with severe mental disorder to public mental health care. To this end, we conducted a narrative review on the topic and concluded that Social Welfare services have frequent contact with {{that portion of the}} population, providing answers to their needs, such as housing and civil <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> Mental health services still have difficulty establishing strategies to care for people in mental distress in the street and enter them in CAPS and health units. Thus, the welfare network has often been the gateway of this population to mental health services, indicating that the intersectoral work needs to be further developed to ensure effective access to public health services...|$|R
40|$|About {{one third}} of states in the U. S. offer the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> {{statutory}} <b>redemption</b> to a defaulting mortgagor who can reclaim his/her foreclosed property within {{a certain period of}} time, usually lasting for one month to one year. We derive a closed-form solution of a buyer’s decision at the foreclosure sale, which predicts that the buyer is less likely to purchase in states with statutory redemption than in states without it. In states with statutory redemption, a buyer is less likely to purchase if the redemption period lasts longer or housing price inflation fluctuates more severely because the buyer will then be hurt more by the mortgagor who owns more valuable repurchasing option...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), if one sold {{a house in}} a walled city, one could redeem it for a year, and {{thereafter}} the house would pass to the purchaser beyond reclaim and not be released in the jubilee. But houses in villages without encircling walls were treated as open country subject to redemption and release through the jubilee. Levites were to have a permanent <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> for houses and property in the cities of the Levites. The unenclosed land about their cities could not be sold. If a kinsman fell into straits and came under one's authority by virtue of his debts, one was to let him live by one's side as a kinsman and not exact from him interest. Israelites were not to lend money to countrymen at interest.|$|E

60|$|He {{expressed}} this certain {{restoration of}} the Jews, on one occasion, by a sort of symbol, by means of which he made a much stronger impression {{on the minds of}} the people than could have been done by simple words. There was a piece of land in the country of Benjamin, one of the provinces of Judea, which belonged to the family of Jeremiah, and it was held in such a way that, by paying a certain sum of money, Jeremiah himself might possess it, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> being in him. Jeremiah was in prison at this time. His uncle's son came into the court of the prison, and proposed to him to purchase the land. Jeremiah did so in the most public and formal manner. The title deeds were drawn up and subscribed, witnesses were summoned, the money weighed and paid over, the whole transaction being regularly completed according to the forms and usages then common for the conveyance of landed property. When all was finished, Jeremiah gave the papers into the hands of his scribe, directing him to put them safely away and preserve them with care, for after a certain period the country of Judea would again be restored to the peaceable possession of the Jews, and such titles to land would possess once more their full and original value.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 November 1866, Russia {{adopted a}} law [...] "On the Land Device State Peasants", {{allowing}} the rural society to maintain land in their possession with the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> [...] "ownership". <b>Redemption</b> {{from the government}} of the property holdings was regulated by the law of 12 June 1886. After the implementation of these reforms, plots of state peasants were reduced by 10% in the central provinces and 44% - in the northern. Payments were calculated for 49½ years, and in some cases had to be made before 1931, but were canceled on 1 January 1907 as part of the Stolypin agrarian reform {{under the influence of the}} revolution in 1905.|$|R

6000|$|But for {{the better}} {{understanding}} of those that are weak of apprehension, I shall prove it thus--1. The soul that hath eternal life, he must have it by <b>right</b> <b>of</b> purchase or <b>redemption</b> (Heb 9:12; Eph 1:7). 2. This purchase <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> must be through the blood of Christ. [...] "We have redemption through His blood." [...] "Without shedding of blood is no remission." [...] Now the law {{is not in a}} capacity to die, and so to redeem sinners by the purchase of blood, which satisfaction justice calls for. Read the same Scriptures (Heb 9:22). Justice calls for satisfaction, because thou hast transgressed and sinned against it, and that must have satisfaction; therefore all that ever thou canst do cannot bring in redemption, though thou follow the law up the to the nail-head, as I may say, because all this is not shedding of blood; for believe it, and know it for certain, that though thou hadst sinned but one sin before thou didst turn to the law, that one sin will murder thy soul, if it be not washed away by blood, even by the precious blood of Jesus Christ, that was shed when He did hang upon the cross on Mount Calvary.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> is an {{equitable}} right, foreclosure is an action in equity. To keep the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption,</b> the debtor {{may be able}} to petition the court for an injunction. If repossession is imminent the debtor must seek a temporary restraining order. However, the debtor may have to post a bond in the amount of the debt. This protects the creditor if the attempt to stop foreclosure is simply an attempt to escape the debt.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{a lender}} obtains a {{security}} interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset {{like a house}} to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts of equity can grant the borrower the equitable <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> if the borrower repays the debt. While this equitable right exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot {{be sure that they}} can repossess the property. Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to foreclose (in plain English, immediately terminate) the equitable <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple. Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors' bills or overdue homeowners' association dues or assessments.|$|E

40|$|The {{prohibition}} against 2 ̆ 2 clogging the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> 2 ̆ 2 has been {{enforced by the}} courts for centuries, yet the traditional justifications (invoking fairness or unfair bargaining power) offered for this central premise of mortgage law are rather unconvincing, particularly in the commercial context. After describing and critiquing the traditional view, this article lays out an alternative justification for the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption,</b> stressing {{the role of the}} law in fostering efficient renegotiation upon default. This view explains why the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> cannot be waived in the initial loan documents, and why it can be waived in subsequent workouts only if the court is convinced of the fairness of the waiver. Moreover, this article demonstrates that, even if the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> is an efficient term in most mortgages, an adverse selection dynamic may prevent parties from including it in their contracts, thus justifying the judicial insistence that the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> be a mandatory, rather than default, term...|$|R

50|$|However, if the {{borrower}} {{was a single}} day late in repaying the debt, he forfeited his land to the lender while still remaining liable for the debt.
