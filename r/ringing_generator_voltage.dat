40|$|Abstract: This paper derives {{the power}} {{conversion}} in a nonlinear resistive element {{that is in}} series with linear resistors. The derivation of the power conversion {{is analogous to the}} Manley and Rowe analysis. The power at the fundamental and intermodulation frequencies is defined as the product of the Fourier coefficients of the current and voltage components at these frequencies. In the analysis, the Fourier coefficients are derived as functions of the <b>generator</b> <b>voltage</b> in a lumped-element circuit. To evaluate the Fourier coefficients, the relationship between current and <b>generator</b> <b>voltage</b> is expressed by a power series. The coefficients of the power series are given in the form of polynomials that are valid for nonlinear resistive elements with exponential characteristics. For the investigation of interference phenomena, the equivalence between the lumped-element circuit and a microwave circuit is derived and the <b>generator</b> <b>voltage</b> is related to the power flux density carried by the incident waves intercepted by support structures. The transfer of power at the intermodulation frequencies to radiating structures is then described. Finally, the power at the intermodulation frequencies is evaluated numerically for different power levels in the incident waves. The computed values were verified experimentally...|$|R

The system {{is based on a}} buck converter input filter capacitor discharge through excitation winding of the generator. The buck converter is connected to the stator outputs through an uncontrollable diode rectifier, but excitation winding is used as a load. Input filter capacitor of the converter provides initial current pulse which magnetizes excitation system and produces the <b>generator</b> <b>voltage</b> increase, for this reason the capacitor is charged before self-excitation process starts.
