50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of controlled radical polymerization reactions {{is that they}} tend to become rather slow. Controlled polymerization conditions are usually achieved by extending the life-time of the growing polymer chain radical, by keeping it in a dormant state for most of the time (known as the Persistent Radical Effect). Thereby the control agent substantially slows-down the over-all <b>radical</b> <b>polymerisation</b> reaction. However, some CMRP reactions proceed via a different mechanism, called degenerative transfer (DT), which allows controlled radical polymerization reactions to proceed at roughly the same rate as any uncontrolled free <b>radical</b> <b>polymerisation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} (e. s. r.) spectroscopy {{should be}} useful for the measurement of propagation rate coefficients (k(p)) in free <b>radical</b> <b>polymerisations,</b> since the propagating radical concentration can be directly observed. However, in previous studies, k(p) values have generally been inconsistent, and disagreed with data from other accepted experimental techniques, such as pulsed laser polymerisation. This study shows that for styrene, consistency can be obtained, but only when experimental conditions are selected such that polymer of sufficiently high molecular weight is formed; otherwise incorrect rate constants may be measured. The measured Arrhenius parameters were in good agreement with IUPAC accepted data. The values at 343 K for both thermally and photochemically initiated experiments {{were found to be}} consistent, suggesting that photoinitiated systems may polymerise in the ground state. Some previously inconsistent data could be explained in terms of selection of experimental conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Characterisation techniques used such as Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) are also detailed Chapter 3 examined the influence of applying conventional and microwave heating during the RAFT polymerisation of vinyl acetate. A series of experiments were designed to observe the effect of varying different reactant concentrations, as well as introducing a solvent into the reaction mixture. Each of these were examined to determine which induced an acceleration when using microwaves, while maintaining the desired control. Chapter 4 investigated the RAFT polymerisation of vinyl acetate while using CO 2 as a viscosity modifier. Various reaction parameters such as monomer loading and RAFT : AIBN ratio were altered to examine the effect on the final polymer produced. Kinetic studies allowed the application of CO 2 to be compared with RAFT polymerisation with conventional and microwave heating from Chapter 3.

40|$|Polymer nanocomposites are of {{considerable}} interest in academia and industry, {{due to the}} enhanced properties arising from the addition of nanoparticles to a polymer matrix. Recent developments in controlled <b>radical</b> <b>polymerisations</b> {{have led to the}} synthesis of well-defined chain-grafted polymer nanocomposites. Research into the changes in chain conformation and dynamics in these systems is crucial for understanding the effect on macroscopic properties. Therefore, this thesis focuses on an extensive study of the structure and dynamics of these chain-grafted polymer nanocomposites. Two types of nanocomposites were investigated: polymer-silica nanocomposites and polystyrene-fullerene stars. The samples were studied primarily by neutron scattering techniques, along with complementary techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and rheological measurements. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data on 6 arm PS-fullerene samples were analysed using the standard star and core-star models. The model fits have shown that the PS-fullerene stars have slightly extended chains around the fullerene core, leading to the stars being larger than expected compared to pure polymer stars. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and rheological measurements showed that PS-fullerene stars have unusual dynamics compared to typical polymer stars, exhibiting total rather than arm molecular weight dependence. SANS measurements on polymer-silica nanocomposites in solution established that samples prepared with colloidal silica exhibit no change in chain conformation. However, fumed silica nanocomposites show a significant change in the large structure region that could not currently be modelled. QENS measurements on these samples showed that the dynamics of the polymer chains are significantly slowed down by the presence of fumed silica nanoparticles. Using the Time-Temperature Superposition principle (TTS) on the QENS and rheological data on these samples revealed a significant loss of free volume, which is therefore suggested to be the main cause of the decreased chain dynamics. Rheological measurements also confirmed a large increase in viscosity and modulus of dispersed poly(butyl acrylate) -silica nanocomposites. The presence of fumed silica has a greater effect on these properties than colloidal silica. Finally, a preliminary SANS and microscopy study on two polymer blends containing silica nanoparticles was carried out, establishing that the addition of silica can significantly decrease the miscibility of the blend. The effect of silica on the phase separation temperature is complex, and depends on the concentration of nanoparticles...|$|R

Mucoadhesion was ex vivo evaluated under static conditions by applying nanoparticle suspensions on rat intestinal mucosal surfaces and evaluating the amount of nanoparticles remaining attached to the mucosa after incubation. The analysis of the results obtained demonstrated that the presence of either chitosan or thiolated chitosan on the PIBCA nanoparticle surface clearly enhanced the mucoadhesion behaviour thanks to noncovalent interactions (ionic interaction and hydrogen bonds) with mucus chains. Both, the molecular weight of chitosan and the proportion of chitosan-TBA in the formulation influenced the nanoparticle hydrodynamic diameter and hence their transport through the mucus layer. Improved interpenetration ability with the mucus chain during the attachment process was suggested for the chitosan of high molecular weight, enhancing the bioadhesiveness of the system.

40|$|The growing {{environmental}} awareness and the not so distant scarcity of fossil feedstocks are promoting nowadays {{a renewed interest}} in the use of renewable raw materials derived from biomass, i. e., cellulosic products. Recently, a relatively novel type of cellulose product namely, bacterial cellulose, biosynthesised by cellulose-producing bacteria Gluconobacter xylinus, has appeared as a promising raw material for the development of advanced renewable (nano-) materials owing to its outstanding properties such as inherent nanosize (width: 1 to 25 nm; length: 1 to 9 m), high degree of crystallinity (70 % to 90 %) and impressive mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 78 to 155 GPa). This thesis describes the preparation of different types of renewable (nano-) materials composed of bacterial cellulose, which includes all-cellulose hierarchical composites, macroporous cryogel microspheres, functional bioinorganic nanohybrids and entirely bacterial-based nanocomposites. Bacterial cellulose was deposited around the surface of sisal fibres by Gluconobacter xylinus, which resulted in a dense bacterial cellulose coating of the surfaces of sisal fibres. Furthermore, the bacterial cellulose coated sisal fibres obtained after surface modification of fibres enhanced the mechanical performance of all-cellulose hierarchical composites owing to an improvement {{of the quality of the}} sisal fibres-regenerated cellulose matrix interface. Bacterial cellulose manofibrils were dissolved in DMAc/LiCl cosolvent, then templated into a microsphere shape, regenerated in H 2 O and freeze-dried to obtain highly porous cryogel microspheres composed exclusively of regenerated bacterial cellulose, which possessed a Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area ranging from 55 m 2 /g to 123 m 2 /g. Thioether functionalised bacterial cellulose nanofibrils were synthesised using a "grafting from" approach during the free <b>radical</b> grafting <b>polymerisation</b> of a monomer containing thioether moieties, namely 2 -(methylthio) ethyl methacrylate. The thioether moieties grafted from the bacterial cellulose (MTEMA-g-BC) nanofibrils subsequently enabled the preparation of optically functional bioinorganic nanohybrids, where either gold nanoparticles or cadmium telluride quantum dots were chemisorbed onto the thioether moieties functionalised bacterial cellulose nanofibrils. Hydrophobised bacterial cellulose nanofibrils were also synthesised using the same "grafting from" approach using free <b>radical</b> grafting <b>polymerisation</b> of a hydrophobic caprolactone-based macromonomer, caprolactone 2 - (methacryloyloxy) ethyl ester. Then, entirely bacterial-based nanocomposites composed of caprolactone grafted bacterial cellulose (PCLMA-g-BC) nanofibrils reinforced poly(3 - hydroxy- butyrate) (PHB) matrix were produced by solution casting. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of bacterial-based nanocomposites reinforced with PCLMA- g-BC nanofibrils (i. e., nanofiller content of 10 wt. /wt. %) increased by 101 % and 170 %, respectively, as compared to the neat PHB lm.

The weight {{fraction of}} clay in the PCN was systematically varied {{in order to}} understand the effect of clay on the physical properties of the resulting PCNs. However, unexpectedly it was found that the weight fraction of clay had a dramatic impact upon the molecular weight of the polymer matrix and a relationship between clay concentration and polymer molecular weight was established. Furthermore, it was also found that the change in molecular weight was dependent upon the clay type. Three different clay types were investigated; an organically modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 15 a), a synthetic clay (Laponite RD) and a PEO modified Laponite RD. To produce the modified Laponite RD, mono amino PEO was synthesised via anionic polymerisation using dimethyl ethanol amine as an initiator. The modification of the Laponite RD clay took place in the reaction flask prior to the suspension polymerisation of the PCN. The PCN were characterised using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and oscillatory shear rheology. Morphological studies of the PCN showed that the extent of clay dispersion depended on the clay type. Within the PMMA/Laponite RD nanocomposites an unusual network structure was formed, which appeared to be continuous throughout the material. Thermal properties of the PCN were investigated using DSC, TGA and Microcalorimetry. From oscillatory shear rheology, the full master curves for the PCN were obtained by applying the time-temperature superposition (TTS) principle. To quantify the effect of the clay upon the rheology, the experimental data was compared to the time dependent diffusion model of Des Cloizeaux for polydisperse polymer melts, which enables polydispersity to be incorporated through the use of the molecular weight distribution obtained via SEC. ...|$|R
40|$|Electro-optical {{switches}} {{based on}} {{low molecular weight}} liquid crystals are increasingly used in a large range of flat panel display applications. Here, a new display principle is presented based on (sub) micron-sized highly crosslinked polymer particles dispersed in a continuous, low molecular weight liquid crystal, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 Polymer Filled Nematics (PFN's) 2 ̆ 2. These electro-optical devices can be electrically switched from a light scattering to a transparent state. In general, the optical and electro-optical properties of LCD's based on two-phase mixtures strongly depend on, for instance, the degree of phase separation between the two phases, the interfacial interaction and on {{the shape and dimensions}} of the two phases. Conventional Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) blends, which consist of liquid crystal droplets dispersed in a continuous polymer phase, are usually prepared via controlled phase separation processes. However, the phase separation is never complete and control over the final morphology of the PDLC blend is difficult. In PFN's the dispersed polymeric phase is produced prior to the preparation of the blend, via free <b>radical</b> dispersion <b>polymerisation</b> in organic medium. In this way it becomes possible to tune the morphology of the final polymer/LC blend with respect to chemical and physical properties, interfaces and dimensions of both constituent phases. Moreover, it seems that, via this novel processing route, the production of completely phase separated polymer/LC blends is enabled, which further promotes the accurate control of both the structure and the properties of electro-optical cells produced from these materials. Rather surprisingly, it was also found that, due to the rheological properties of the blends, long term stable, thin layers of these PFN blends can be simply produced by conventional coating processes. Efforts were directed towards characterisation of the polymerisation process and towards derivation of structure-property relationships for the PFN blends serving as model systems...|$|R
