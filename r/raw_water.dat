40|$|Nanofiltration (NF) {{and tight}} {{ultrafiltration}} (tight UF) membranes are a viable treatment option for high quality drinking water production from sources with {{high concentrations of}} contaminants. To date, there is limited knowledge regarding the contribution of concentration polarization (CP) and fouling {{to the increase in}} resistance during filtration of natural organic matter (NOM) with NF and tight UF. Filtration tests were conducted with NF and tight UF membranes with molecular weight cut offs (MWCOs) of 300, 2000 and 8000 Da, and model <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> containing different constituents of NOM. When filtering model <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> containing high concentrations of polysaccharides (i. e., higher molecular weight NOM), the increase in resistance was dominated by fouling. When filtering model <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> containing humic substances (i. e., lower molecular weight NOM), the increase in filtration resistance was dominated by CP. The results indicate that low MWCO membranes are better suited for NOM removal, because most of the NOM in surface waters consist mainly of humic substances, which were only effectively rejected by the lower MWCO membranes. However, when humic substances are effectively rejected, CP can become extensive, leading to a significant increase in filtration resistance by the formation of a cake/gel layer at the membrane surface. For this reason, cross-flow operation, which reduces CP, is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Eight water {{distribution}} systems were sampled over an 18 -month period (528 water and 55 biofilm samples) {{to measure the}} frequency of recovery and number of mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare, in <b>raw</b> source <b>waters</b> before and after treatment and within the distribution system. The systems were chosen to assess the influence of source water, treatment, and assimilable organic carbon levels on mycobacterial numbers. Overall, mycobacterial recovery from the systems was low (15 % of samples). Numbers of mycobacteria ranged from 10 to 700, 000 CFU liter− 1. The number of M. avium in <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> was correlated with turbidity. Water treatment substantially {{reduced the number of}} mycobacteria in <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> by 2 to 4 log units. Mycobacterial numbers were substantially higher in the distribution system samples (average, 25, 000 -fold) than in those collected immediately downstream from the treatment facilities, indicating that mycobacteria grow in the distribution system. The increase in mycobacterial numbers was correlated with assimilable organic carbon and biodegradable organic carbon levels (r 2 = 0. 65, P = 0. 03). Although M. intracellulare was seldom recovered from water samples, it was frequently recovered (six of eight systems) in high numbers from biofilms (average, 600 CFU/cm 2).

40|$|In a multi-laboratory trial, minerals-modified {{glutamate}} medium (MMGM) {{was compared}} with lauryl tryptose lactose broth (LTLB) in the multiple tube method for the enumeration of coliform organisms, including Escherichia coli, in <b>water.</b> Samples of <b>raw</b> and chlorinated <b>waters</b> yielded {{a total of}} 2313 positive tube-reactions with MMGM and 2174 with LTLB. These were interpreted either as E. coli; other coliform organisms; or as false positive reactions.

All three analyses indicated the same trends. For the detection of E. coli in <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> LTLB was better than MMGM at 18 - 24 h, but MMGM was better at 48 h with waters containing small numbers of coliform organisms; for <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> with greater numbers of organisms, both media performed equally well. Analysis of a subset of samples read at both 18 and 24 h indicated that the superiority of LTLB over MMGM with <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> disappeared by 24 h.

40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of bromide and iodide on {{disinfected}} waters was examined and potential treatment technologies for their removal or mitigation were investigated. Distributed waters from two Western Australian drinking water sources were evaluated {{in terms of their}} bromide and iodide concentrations, disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, halogen-specific adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) formation and chlorinous odours after disinfection. In both systems, the brominated DBPs dominated the measured DBPs and, in both cases, the known DSPs accounted for only 30 % of total organohalogens. Chloramination with a sufficient free chlorine contact time followed by ammonia addition, rather than preformed monochloramine, may be a viable mitigation strategy for the minimisation of I-OBPs, since exposure to free chlorine should promote the conversion of iodide to iodate, a safe form of iodine. This study has shown that bromide {{plays an important role in}} this process, mainly by enhancing the preferred conversion' of iodide to iodate. Ozone pre-treatment selectively oxidised iodide to iodate and minimised the formation of I-OB Ps. Complete conversion of iodide to iodate, while minimising the bromate formation to below the guideline value of 10 µg L- 1 was achieved for a wide range of ozone concentrations in <b>raw</b> <b>waters,</b> including <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> with high bromide concentrations...|$|R

The data set used encompassed <b>raw</b> and treated <b>water</b> sampled over a 30 -month period from 30 water treatment works (WTWs) across Scotland, all employing conventional clarification. Both trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) FPs were considered. In addition to the standard bulk WQDs, the DOC content was fractionated and analysed for the hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. Results were quantified in terms of the yield (dDBPFP/dWQD) and the linear regression coefficient R 2 of the yield trend. The NOM in the <b>raw</b> <b>waters</b> was found to comprise 30 – 84 % (average 66 %) of the more reactive HPO material, with this proportion falling to 18 – 63 % (average 50 %) in the treated water. Results suggested UV 254 to be as good an indicator of DBPFP as DOC or HPO for the <b>raw</b> <b>waters,</b> with R 2 values ranging from 0. 79 to 0. 82 for THMs and from 0. 71 to 0. 73 for HAAs for these three determinants. For treated waters the corresponding values were significantly lower at 0. 52 – 0. 67 and 0. 46 – 0. 47 respectively, reflecting the lower HPO concentration and thus UV 254 absorption and commensurately reduced precision due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument. It is concluded that fractionation offers little benefit in attempting to discern or predict chlorinated carbonaceous DBP yield for the waters across the geographical region studied. UV 254 offered an adequate estimate of DBPFP based on a mean yield of ∼ 2600 and ∼ 2800 μg per cm− 1 absorbance for THMFP for the <b>raw</b> and treated <b>waters</b> respectively and ∼ 3800 and 2900 μg cm− 1 for HAAFP, albeit with reduced precision for the treated waters...|$|R
