5000|$|During {{the winter}} of 1917-18 it was [...] "quiet" [...] on the Western Front—British {{casualties}} averaged [...] "only" [...] 3,000 a week. Serious attacks were impossible in the winter because of the deep caramel-thick mud. Quietly the Germans brought in their best soldiers from the eastern front, selected elite storm troops, and trained them all winter in the new tactics. With stopwatch timing, the German artillery would lay down a sudden, fearsome barrage just ahead of its advancing infantry. Moving in small units, firing light machine guns, the storm troopers would bypass enemy strongpoints, and head directly for critical bridges, command posts, supply dumps and, above all, artillery batteries. By cutting enemy communications they would paralyze response in the critical first half hour. By silencing the artillery they would break the enemy's firepower. <b>Rigid</b> <b>schedules</b> sent in two more waves of infantry to mop up the strong points that had been bypassed. The shock troops frightened and disoriented {{the first line of}} defenders, who would flee in panic. In one instance an easy-going Allied regiment broke and fled; reinforcements rushed in on bicycles. The panicky men seized the bikes and beat an even faster retreat. The stormtrooper tactics provided mobility, but not increased firepower. Eventually—in 1939 and 1940—the formula would be perfected with the aid of dive bombers and tanks, but in 1918 the Germans lacked both.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Under {{constrained}} {{budgets and}} <b>rigid</b> <b>schedules,</b> NASA and industry have greatly increased their utilization of small satellites to conduct low-cost planetary investigations. Recent failed small planetary science spacecraft such as Mars Polar Lander (MPL) and Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO), and impaired missions such as Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) have fueled the ongoing debate on whether NASA’s “Faster, Better, Cheaper ” (FBC) approach is working. Several noteworthy failures of earth-orbiting missions have occurred as well including Lewis and the Wide-field Infrared Experiment (WIRE). While {{recent studies have}} observed that FBC has resulted in lower costs and shorter development times, these benefits may have been achieved {{at the expense of}} lowering probability of success. One question remaining to be answered is when is a mission “too fast and too cheap ” that it is prone to failure? This paper assesses NASA FBC missions in terms of a complexity index measured against development time and spacecraft cost. A comparison of relative failure rates of recent planetary and earth-orbiting missions are presented, and conclusions regarding dependence on system complexity are drawn...|$|E
3000|$|A dummy-variable {{regression}} model {{on the basis}} of daily and hourly truck traffic volume is formulated and calibrated for developing the winter weather truck traffic model. Separate models are developed for weekday and weekend truck traffic. The calibrated models are tested for statistical significance of the independent variables using the standard test statistics of R [...] 2, F test, incremental F test, and t test. The truck volume is not significantly affected by the snowfall or the cold category variables. Trucks (or commercial vehicles) are usually required to follow <b>rigid</b> <b>schedules</b> to complete their mandatory travel irrespective of severe weather conditions. These kinds of business-oriented mandatory movements are most likely to generate unique truck travel patterns even when weather is unfavorable for making a trip. The conclusions of this study are based on 5  years of WIM data collected from a single site in the province of Alberta. Further research work is currently underway to study the remaining five WIM sites, which are operating on highway segments carrying provincial and interprovincial truck traffic. Future research will also focus on interaction impacts of snow and cold variables on truck traffic.|$|E

30|$|Even though {{communal}} {{ownership of}} resources could imply some lack of efficiency, it also ensures equality, since the community controls resources. There is much literature about communal resources, especially since Hardin published his paper “The Tragedy of the Commons” in 1968. Nonetheless, the cultural factor of preference forwork {{on a small}} scale could also imply a lack of hierarchy and, consequently, the absence of economic specialization, with traditional technologies and the inability of the community to build large factories. In other words, people prefer workshop discipline to factory discipline. For this paper, I take discipline to mean behavior in accordance with standards of conduct; thus, factory discipline is complying with hierarchies, <b>rigid</b> <b>schedules,</b> division of labor and so forth, while workshop discipline is understood as the absence of predefined conditions. Factory discipline applies to work in industrial plants, production lines and mass production, while workshop discipline applies to individual work, family work and work in small groups. It is worth noting that this definition of discipline is independent of the intensity or duration of work. The Cultural Factor promotes the development of family businesses and/or self-employment. Henceforth, in the rest of paper, the Cultural Factor, work {{on a small scale}} and workshop discipline will be used as synonyms.|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} by which learners learn and teachers teach are about as ever-changing as the seasons. Throughout time, pedagogical researchers have developed new methods for the educational process, but none have been quite as revolutionary or as controversial as e-learning. E-learning, {{often referred to as}} distance learning or online learning, provides a platform that facilitates learning through communication without requiring a face-to-face contact in the same space and time (Wahlstedt 1021). Optimistic commentators see a new world of an educational process: “Every learner can, at his or her own choice of time and place, access a world of multimedia material…immediately the learner is unlocked from the shackles of fixed and <b>rigid</b> <b>schedules,</b> from physical limitations…and is released into an information world which reacts to his or her own pace of learning (Benjamin 49; Salmon 11). ” However, is this view of education universally shared? Is distance education truly a “new world” of learning, or is it only the latest “miracle” that promises solutions to problems in education and training (Huett 66) ? Perhaps, the most important question: Will this process replace traditional “face-to-face” methods of learning? The answer to all of these questions is no. E-learning has, indeed, redefined education, but it has not replaced class-based learning...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>schedules</b> of long-distance {{migrants}} {{could be}} among candidate traits for adaptive migratory syndromes. This prediction was tested on stonechats, passerines that differ widely in migratory behavior and seasonal schedules. Stonechats in Europe are short-distance migrants and multiclutched, whereas African residents and Siberian long-distance migrants usually raise single broods. In captivity, all subspecies displayed endogenous cycles of reproductive development and molt. The subspecies differed in time afforded to life cycle stages. Under conducive aviary conditions, African stonechats were multibrooded, whereas Siberian stonechats did not add clutches. This difference in flexibility was exclusively {{related to the}} length of breeding windows. Stonechats also differed in premigratory preparations. Postjuvenile molt started early in Siberian stonechats, but in European and African stonechats, depended strongly on hatching date. In contrast, all subspecies shortened molt duration at the same rate when hatched from late broods. Plasticity of Zugunruhe timing was identical in Siberian and European subspecies and nearly compensated for hatching late. The stonechat data suggest a refined understanding of temporal plasticity in long-distance migrants. Overall, plasticity was not reduced, but was differently organized. Apparently rigid migrant schedules were related to short breeding cycles and inflexible molt onset. Short windows for breeding and juvenile development could provide safety measures for timely departure. Once molt was initiated, temporal plasticity of long-distance migrants matched that of less migratory conspecifics. In addition to adjusting endogenous programs, stonechats differed in implementing them in the field. Modifying the conditions under which programs are expressed may be an efficient way to enhance seasonal plasticity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the present practices and problems of scheduling high schools in St. John’s, Newfoundland. Additionally, this study attempted to determine the potential of computer developed master schedules for Newfoundland high schools. A set of ten research questions was considered to achieve the objectives of this study. The questions dealt with scheduling procedures, scheduling practices, scheduling problems, schedule adequacy, scheduling alternates, schedule experimentation, computer scheduling advantages and computer scheduling disadvantages. [...] An interview was conducted in each of four St. John’s high schools. The interviews dealt with data relevant to existing schedules. The second phase of the study resulted in the production of a computer schedule for Lester Pearson Memorial High School. This schedule was compared with the school’s manual schedule. Data from the interviews and schedules were analyzed and reported within the framework of the research questions. [...] Findings from the analyses of the data were as follows: [...] 1. All schools used the hand mosaic method of schedule construction. [...] 2. No significant difference existed in the scheduling practices of the schools. [...] 3. Several problems such as workload problems, inadequate guidance services, standard periods, unresolved conflicts, and <b>rigid</b> <b>schedules</b> were identified by the school administrators. [...] 4. All principals stated that their schedules were inadequate. [...] 5. Experimentation is practically non-existent in the high schools. [...] 6. Many disadvantages such as a long scheduling period, increased costs, large numbers of unscheduled periods, uniform scheduling, and the clustering of courses were revealed in the computer generated schedule. [...] The major recommendations arising out of the study were: [...] 1. School districts should provide in-service programs on scheduling for their principals. [...] 2. Memorial University of Newfoundland should provide at least one course in scheduling for graduate students in Administration. [...] 3. The Department of Education should assume a leadership role in the utilization of computers for high school master scheduling. [...] 4. Computer scheduling should not be implemented in high schools in the near future. [...] 5. This study should be replicated to determine the potential of computers in high schools in the province.

30|$|Knowledge of the {{potential}} impact that an individual’s chronotype may have on both cognitive and physical performance could have significant beneficial implications within the general population. This information could also provide new insight to sectors that require individuals to achieve optimal performance such as military personnel, first responders (firefighters, police and paramedics) and professional athletes. At an elite sporting level, a winning margin can {{be as little as}} 1 %. At the most recent 2016 Olympic Games (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), had the fourth place swimmer in the men’s 100  m freestyle improved his time by 0.5 % (0.24  s), it would have been enough to secure a gold medal. Similarly, if the last placed competitor in the men’s 100  m sprint had run 0.25  s faster (2.5 %), it would have been enough to beat Usain Bolt. These differences are so minute that any potential advantage to be gained should be researched in depth. Previous research has shown that aerobic performance can vary up to 26 % {{over the course of a}} day [21]. The present study supports this by showing a ~[*] 10 % diurnal increase in a simple measure of physical performance and ~[*] 9 % and ~[*] 7 % variation in simple and complex measures of cognitive performance, respectively. Using these findings, training strategies could be developed and implemented by coaches to maximise performance through adhering to the athlete’s individual chronotype and taking into account the time since entrained awakening. This would be of particular relevance to LCTs who have been shown to exhibit greater variation in diurnal performance profiles. If LCTs are required to train/compete during non-optimal morning hours, it could significantly influence their abilities since our study shows that LCTs are compromised at 08 : 00  h. These results do not just apply for individuals but also teams, as previous research has shown that chronotype distribution within a team is highly predictive of overall performance, highlighting how this research can be used to give teams a ‘circadian advantage’ [41]. However, <b>rigid</b> <b>schedules</b> often present a challenge for athletes having to perform at non-optimal times. Therefore, this information could be used to develop personalised interventions targeting at sleep and circadian biology aimed to shift the timing of peak performance to accommodate inflexible competition times. It is fair to speculate from our results that such a strategy may result in greater improvements in overall performance, although in-depth research is required to develop these approaches.|$|E
