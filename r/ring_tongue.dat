50|$|Pintle/gudgeon sets {{have many}} applications, for example: in sailing {{to hold the}} rudder onto the boat; in {{transportation}} a pincer-type device clamps through a lunette <b>ring</b> on the <b>tongue</b> of a trailer; in controllable solid rocket motors a plug moves {{into and out of}} the motor throat to control thrust.|$|R

50|$|The boy came, but {{the king}} turned him away as a beggar, though the princess {{knew he was}} like the boy. Somewhat later, he came back, better dressed, and the princess insisted on {{speaking}} with him. He produced the <b>ring</b> and the <b>tongue</b> and married the princess. And they lived happily ever after.|$|R
50|$|Permanent or {{long term}} {{piercing}} {{of the tongue}} {{is part of the}} resurgence of body piercing in contemporary society. The ready availability of high quality, surgical steel barbell style jewelry is associated with the emergence of this piercing in the 1980s. As with many piercing innovations, the origin of this piercing is associated with Gauntlet, the first professional body piercing studio in the United States, formerly located in Los Angeles, California. Elayne Angel, the first person awarded the Master Piercer's certificate by Jim Ward, body piercing pioneer and founder of Gauntlet, is commonly associated with the promotion and popularity of this piercing. Also note that the tongue piercing is not gender specific. It was not created specifically for just a man or just a woman. Popular names for tongue piercing include <b>tongue</b> <b>ring,</b> which is a misnomer, as only rarely are <b>rings</b> worn in <b>tongue</b> piercings.|$|R
40|$|T he {{growing trend}} for body {{jewellery}} is amatter {{of concern for}} all dental professionals. Strictly speaking, the term “body jewellery” refers to jewellery {{that is designed to}} go through the body, rather than simply on the body. Examples of dental relevance include lip studs and <b>rings,</b> <b>tongue</b> bars, and <b>rings</b> placed through the uvula. As will be discussed in this article, there are multiple compli-cations from intra-oral piercing and from an ethical standpoint, all dental professionals should dis-courage oral piercing because of these risks. Most dental professionals are well aware of the common long term risks of intra-oral body jew-ellery, such as damaging teeth on tongue barbells while eating, sleeping, talking or chewing. Certain problems such as speech impairment from oral jew-ellery 1 and swallowed jewellery 2 are obvious complications. Thus the emphasis herein will be on the broader list of less obvious but nevertheless doc-umented problems, summarized in Tables 1 and 2. It is doubtful whether such a comprehensive listing of complications is considered by every person contemplating undergoing or performing intra-oral piercing. In this author’s view, patients should be actively discouraged from having piercings involving the oral cavity, while patients with existing piercings should be informed of all the long term complications and encouraged strenuously to remove their intra-oral body jewellery and allow the hole to close. If patients will not do this, they should remove tongue bars every time before they eat, sleep or engage in strenuous physical activity. Missing the point: The risks of intra-oral piercin...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to that, {{there is a}} separate language family that is spoken by Men, the most prominent member of which was Westron (derived from the Númenórean speech Adûnaic), the [...] "Common speech" [...] of the peoples of The Lord of the <b>Rings.</b> Most Mannish <b>tongues</b> showed influences by Elvish, {{as well as some}} Dwarvish influences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, an example being Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves. Other languages are Valarin (the tongue of the Valar), and the Black Speech created by Sauron in the Second Age.|$|R
6000|$|None {{the less}} I thought {{a good deal}} about birthdays that afternoon, and {{wondered}} how it was that we human beings can bear even to go on living between two such mysteries as {{the beginning and the end}} of life. Where was my mother now? Where was I but two-and-twenty years ago? What was all this [...] "Past," [...] this [...] "History," [...] of which I had heard so much and knew so little? Just a story? Better brains than mine have puzzled over these questions, and perhaps if I had studied the philosophers I should know the answers. In the evenings, wrapped up in a shawl, Pollie carried me downstairs, and we took a sober whispering walk in the hush and perfumes of the deserted garden. Loud <b>rang</b> the <b>tongues</b> of the water over the stones. The moths were fluttering to their trysts, and from some dark little coign the cricket strummed me a solo. Standing up there in the starry night the great house looked down on me like an elder brother, mute but compassionate.|$|R
5000|$|It {{happened}} as the calf said. Monkeys climbed the tree after him, {{and the boy}} squeezed the cheese, claiming it was flint; {{when they saw the}} whey, they retreated. The boy set out to find the dragon and kill it. He found a princess who had been staked out for the dragon. He killed it, though it bit off his forefinger. He said he must leave her, but first he cut out the dragon's tongue and the princess gave him a diamond ring. The princess told her father, who asked for him to come, and many gentlemen cut off their forefingers and brought diamond <b>rings</b> and the <b>tongues</b> of all kinds of beasts, but none were the dragon's tongue or the princess's ring.|$|R
50|$|The clutch and {{flywheel}} {{are mounted}} {{on the back of}} the engine block This part of the clutch is of aluminium and carries a friction surface of leather To make for a more gradual engagement a steel spring is set between the leather and the metal face. It is formed into a <b>ring</b> with projecting <b>tongues</b> which ac t as springs. The large spiral spring to hold the clutch in engagement is stationary. It acts on the fork imparting a sliding motion to the propellor shaft. A ball bearing takes the thrust between fork and the shaft. A long propellor shaft runs from the clutch to the gearbox's first motion shaft. This propellor shaft carries a flexible coupling and is splined to allow longitudinal movement together with the clutch. The gearbox is mounted between the back axle and the sprocket shaft for the chain drive.|$|R
5000|$|Yukmouth {{first met}} The Game at a club, {{at the time}} Yukmouth was engaged in a feud with 50 Cent and G-Unit. The Game {{released}} a diss track aimed at the rapper over the [...] "I Got 5 on It" [...] beat, a song which Yukmouth recorded {{when he was a}} part of Luniz. Yukmouth responded with a track that mocked The Game's appearance on Change of Heart. The two later tried to bury the hatchet, due to a personal friend and even recorded a song together with C-Bo's protégé Speedy, named [...] "Peace". However the rivalry continued afterward, since Game dissed Yukmouth on the [...] "Peace" [...] song (they recorded their verses separately). 3 Since then, Yukmouth responded by releasing the song and music video [...] "Game Over Part 2" [...] over Fabolous' [...] "Breathe" [...] instrumental in which it parodied Game. In the video there is a lookalike of the rapper getting robbed and beaten up. Yukmouth claimed on the song that Game had a <b>tongue</b> <b>ring</b> and was slapped by mogul Suge Knight. Since the West Coast Peace Conference both rappers ended the feud.|$|R
40|$|Chronic upper {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) {{symptoms of}} unclear etiology are frustrating {{to patients and}} physicians alike. The integrative medicine procedures of acupuncture and neural therapy may provide treatment options. Tongue piercing, which is prevalent in 5. 6 % of the adolescent population, may be a contributing factor in upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The objectives {{of the study were}} as follows: (1) To demonstrate the usefulness of an integrative medicine treatment approach in two cases of patients with chronic abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting of unclear etiology who had failed standard medical management. (2) To identify scars from tongue piercings as a possible contributing factor in chronic upper GI symptoms of unclear etiology. Two retrospective case studies are presented of young adult females who were seen in a private multi-physician integrative medicine practice in the US. The patients were treated with neural therapy and acupuncture. The desired outcome was the cessation or reduction of the frequency of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Both patients had resolution of their symptoms. From this study, we have concluded the following: (1) Tongue scars from <b>tongue</b> <b>rings</b> may be causes of chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms. (2) Neural therapy and acupuncture may be helpful in the treatment of chronic upper GI symptoms related to tongue scars...|$|R
60|$|Richard was now {{seated on}} the stool again, and, the black taking the hind seat, the steeds were put in motion toward home, As they dashed down the hill on a fast trot, the driver {{occasionally}} turned his face to Aggy, and continued speaking; for, notwithstanding their recent rupture, the most perfect cordiality was again existing between them, “This goes to prove that I turned the horses with the reins, for no man who is shot in the right shoulder can have strength enough to bring round such obstinate devils. I knew I did it from the first; but I {{did not want to}} multiply words with Marmaduke about it.—Will you bite, you villain? —hip, boys, hip! Old Natty, too, that is the best of it!—Well, well—’Duke will say no more about my deer—and the Judge fired both barrels, and hit nothing but a poor lad who was behind a pine-tree. I must help that quack to take out the buckshot for the poor fellow.” In this manner Richard descended the mountain; the bells <b>ringing,</b> and his <b>tongue</b> going, until they entered the village, when the whole attention of the driver was devoted to a display of his horsemanship, to the admiration of all the gaping women and children who thronged the windows to witness the arrival of their landlord and his daughter.|$|R
