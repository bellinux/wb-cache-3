At the beginning of 2008 the ASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope revealed a never-before-seen phenomenon in space: a pair of glowing rings, one nestled inside the other like a bull's-eye pattern.

40|$|<b>Ringholes</b> are space-time tunnelings {{connecting}} two asymptotically flat regions {{by means}} of a throat with the topology of a torus. This report considers the processes of semiclassical thermal emission from <b>ringholes.</b> It is shown that at or near the throat the <b>ringholes</b> can be characterized as a mixture of two thermal sources, one at positive temperature and the other at negative temperature which, respectively, emit usual black body radiation and phantom-like radiation, leading to two possible limiting situations, one similar to a wormhole in that it behaves just like a diverging lens, and the other similar to a black hole in that it behaves only as a converging lens.

40|$|The {{effects that}} the present {{accelerating}} expansion of the Universe has on {{the size and shape}} of Lorentzian wormholes and <b>ringholes</b> are considered. It is shown that, quite similarly to how it occurs for inflating wormholes, relative to the initial embedding-space coordinate system, whereas the shape of the considered holes is always preserved with time, their size is driven by the expansion to increase by a factor which is proportional to the scale factor of the Universe. In the case that dark energy is phantom energy, which is not excluded by present constraints on the dark-energy equation of state, that size increase with time becomes quite more remarkable, and a rather speculative scenario is here presented where the big rip can be circumvented by future advanced civilizations by utilizing sufficiently grown up wormholes and <b>ringholes</b> as time machines that shortcut the big-rip singularity. © 2003 The American Physical Society.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that in a}} {{classical}} spacetime with multiply connected space slices having the topology of a torus, closed timelike curves are also formed. We call these spacetime ringholes. Two regions on the torus surface can be distinguished which are separated by angular horizons. On one of such regions (that which surrounds the maximum circumference of the torus) everything happens like in spherical wormholes, but the other region (the rest of the torus surface), while still possessing a chronology horizon and non-chronal region, behaves like a coverging, rather than diverging, lens and corresponds to an energy density which is always positive for large speeds {{at or near the}} throat. It is speculated that a <b>ringhole</b> could be converted into a time machine to perform time travels by an observer who would never encounter any matter that violates the classical averaged weak energy condition. Based on a calculation of vacuum fluctuations, it is also seen that the angular horizons can prevent the emergence of quantum instabilities near the throat.

40|$|Ringholes are space-time tunnelings {{connecting}} two asymptotically flat regions {{by means}} of a throat with the topology of a torus. This paper considers the processes of semiclassical thermal emission from ringholes and the accretion of dark energy onto them by adapting the results previously obtained for wormholes to toroidal topology. It is shown that at or near the throat the ringholes can be characterized as a mixture of two thermal sources, one at positive temperature and the other at negative temperature which, respectively, emit usual black body radiation and phantomlike radiation, leading after completion of thermal emission to two possible limiting situations, one similar to a wormhole in that it behaves just like a diverging lens, and the other similar to a black hole in that it behaves only as a converging lens. These two limiting situations, though described at rather diverging sizes, are also the final consequences from the accretion processes of quintessential and phantom vacuum energies. Finally, a brief discussion is added on the <b>ringhole</b> thermodynamics and its associated laws which are nothing but the extension to toroidal geometry from the thermodynamic laws which were recently established for wormholes. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

40|$|Holographic {{dark energy}} {{models have been}} {{recently}} suggested which most clearly show that accelerating cosmology appears to be incompatible with mathematically consistent formulations of fundamental theories such as string/M theories. In this paper it is however argued that holographic phantom models are no longer incompatible with such theories, provided that we allow {{for the existence of}} wormholes and <b>ringholes</b> near the big rip singularity and a quantization condition on the parameter of the equation of state is introduced. It is also seen that such a condition actually implies a quantization of the phantom energy which stabilizes the fluid against decay processes.

40|$|Connections between universes through {{tunneling}} space-times {{could make}} the multiverse a physical entity able to be observed from our own single universe. In this paper we first study the thermal properties of the static Klein-bottle holes and then consider one of the potentially observable effects from wormholes, <b>ringholes,</b> and nonorientable tunnelings when they are converted into time machines connecting other universes with ours own, that is a randomly varying {{in space and time}} thermal radiation which, with an unpredictable cadence, randomly manifested to a far observer as a short, occasional pulse with very high intensity and fluence which would be made of black body phantom or ordinary radiation. We discuss the odds for these bursts of thermal radiation to be eventually observable. © 2012 American Physical Society. This work was supported by MICINN under Research Project No. FIS 2008 - 06332.
