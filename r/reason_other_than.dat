5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any <b>reason</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E

25|$|Gorrell {{resigned}} {{his commission}} on March 19, 1920, only {{six weeks after}} his 29th birthday. He gave no <b>reason</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> {{he felt he had}} achieved the highest position possible in the Army at a young age and would face the tedium of a long climb back to that position (and without comparable compensation) if he remained in the peacetime service. He joined the Nordyke and Marmon Company's automobile manufacturing subsidiary in May 1920 as the manager of its Department of Sales Extension in Indianapolis, Indiana, at a wage of only $25.00 a week. By February 1924 he had risen to a vice president in the company and was in Boston, Massachusetts. In September 1925 he accepted a vice presidency with the Stutz Motor Car Company and became its president on January 25, 1929. He remained with the company until August 1935, serving as chairman of the board.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor {{contains}} eight {{stained glass}} windows depicting various saints, Saint Edward among them, which date to the early 1900s. The same French company also completed a large stained glass portrait of the University's founder Father Edward Sorin, which {{is found in the}} central stairwell.

The mural depicts a meeting between Father Sorin and the local Native Americans at the founding of the University in 1842. The residence hall is the oldest building on campus currently in use as an undergraduate dormitory, and its original wing is constructed of the signature yellow bricks dredged by Holy Cross religious from the marl found in the University's two lakes.|$|E

30|$|In this meta-analysis, lithium is {{superior}} to placebo regarding prevention of overall mood episodes, manic episodes, completion of study (no mood episode and no drop out due to <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode), and, dependent {{on the type of}} analyses performed, depressive episodes, while placebo {{is superior}} to lithium regarding drop out due to <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode. With respect to the comparison with anticonvulsants, lithium is superior regarding prevention of manic episodes; however there is no significant difference regarding overall mood episodes, depressive episodes, drop-out due to <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode, or study completion. With no other drug available having such ample and consistent evidence for its efficacy in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorders, lithium remains the most valuable treatment option in this indication (Miura et al. [2014]).|$|R

500|$|On January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives {{voted in}} favor of a {{proposed}} constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used [...] "race or color" [...] as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state. The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states that denied the vote to male citizens over twenty-one for any <b>reason</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> participation in crime. Later, the Fifteenth Amendment was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.|$|E

The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence out of gratitude for Andy's past kindnesses, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover. However, when David meets with Andy he is almost completely oblivious to Andy's erroneous statements, and Andy quickly catches on to what the employees are up to.|$|E
30|$|In {{all of the}} {{included}} trials except Prien et al. ([1973]) and Geddes et al. ([2010]), data from patients who developed a mood episode were censored from the analysis of time to discontinuation for <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode (mutually exclusive endpoints). Similarly, data from patients who developed a depressive episode were censored from the analyses of time to a manic episode - and vice versa. In contrast to Kaplan–Meier survival analyses, in meta-analyses, with categorical data used for analyses, censoring due to a mood episode may substantially affect the risk of discontinuation due to <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode - and vice versa - if the drug affects {{the risk of a}} mood episode compared to the risk of dropping out due to <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode differently than placebo. For lithium, this seems to be the case. In our meta-analysis, significantly fewer patients on lithium compared to placebo developed a mood episode while at the same time, significantly more patients on lithium compared to placebo dropped out of the study due to <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode. Assuming that lithium’s prophylactic efficacy against mood episodes were the primary event, more patients would be at risk to potentially drop out for <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode (for example, due to side effects) - and consequently, this meta-analysis may be biased to the disadvantage of lithium when it comes to dropping out of the study for <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode. Therefore, studying the number of individuals who completed the study without dropping out for whatever reasons (mood episodes + <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a mood episode) is not only clinically highly relevant - as lithium can only work if patients adhere to it - but also essential to get an unbiased picture on how lithium compares to placebo in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorders. In the present meta-analysis, lithium proved superior to placebo in the number of individuals who completed the study, thus confirming the results from the analyses of mood episodes. However, there was significant quantitative heterogeneity.|$|R

500|$|According to a {{reviewer}} in Choice, {{the poems}} in Oh Pray focus on themes of love, insight, and tension. [...] They also focus on [...] "the black condition celebrated triumphant over difficulties". [...] The reviewer finds some poems uneven, sometimes banal, also best if read aloud, and meant to [...] "be reread and laughed over and thought about". [...] Reviewer James Finn Cotter states that this volume suffers from [...] "the dangers of success" [...] that happen when poets gain too much fame too soon. [...] Gilbert blames Angelou's publishers for capitalizing on her success as an autobiographer, stating that Oh Pray [...] "...is such a painfully untalented collection of poems that I can't {{think of any}} <b>reason</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the Maya myth {{for it to be}} in print". [...] Writer Lyman B. Hagen responds to Gilbert's criticism by stating that Angelou had been a poet long before she began writing prose and that Angelou's audience is comfortable with her sparse lines. [...] He insists that Angelou's critics have missed the power of her poems' message in her apparently simple lines. [...] Hagen calls Angelou's poetry light verse. [...] He states that she writes about ordinary objects and experiences, and with deep feelings, about a variety of racial themes and concerns.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Potts, {{the clerk}} to the Lancaster Assizes, records that {{after hearing the}} {{evidence}} many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they [...] "humbly fell upon their knees with weeping teares", and [...] "desired him [...] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts". Immediately [...] "the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed"; the witnesses [...] "began to quarrel and accuse one another", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and {{said she had been}} told what to say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage.

500|$|In {{baseball}} statistics, {{on-base percentage}} (OBP) {{is a measure}} of how often a batter reaches base for any <b>reason</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a fielding error, fielder's choice, dropped or uncaught third strike, fielder's obstruction, or catcher's interference. OBP is calculated in Major League Baseball (MLB) by dividing the sum of hits, walks, and times hit by a pitch by the sum of at-bats, walks, times hit by pitch and sacrifice flies. A hitter with a [...]400 on-base percentage is considered to be great and rare; only 55 players in MLB history with at least 3,000 career plate appearances (PA) have maintained such an OBP. Left fielder Ted Williams, who played 19 seasons for the Boston Red Sox, has the highest career on-base percentage, [...]4817, in MLB history. Williams led the American League (AL) in on-base percentage in twelve seasons, the most such seasons for any player in the major leagues.
