5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese heavy {{artillery}} in Mount Suribachi opened their <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This {{made it difficult}} for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece. To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.|$|E

The solution pH had a significant effect on the localized corrosion of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel,</b> and the critical pH value for localized corrosion of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> in SCP solutions was between 11. 46 and 11. 31.

25|$|The {{construction}} of the weir, according to the Council minutes, was designed by the Council's Civil Engineers Department which was a concrete and <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> structure. The creation of this lake proved very popular with the community as many social functions were held as recorded in the newspapers. Those activities were swimming, canoeing, various games of sport and picnics. As part of this two small bathing boxes were erected as change rooms on the flat area {{close to the edge}} of the top of the bank. In 1931 a devastating flood in Enoggera Creek occurred under-mining the supporting earth bank at the west end of the concrete weir wall, reducing the water-retaining capacity of the wall and was not able to serve its design purpose – as well the bathing boxes were washed away and were not replaced. History has not recorded the outcome of the weir but it is believed within the community that the structure was dynamited and destroyed some time in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{years after}} the death of Charles II of England (in 1685), who left no {{legitimate}} son as heir to the throne, Queen Catherine of Braganza, daughter of John IV, returned to Portugal in 1693. Without a home in Lisbon, she resided in the homes of various noblemen for a time, including the Count of Redondo in Santa Maria or the palace of the Count of Aveiras, in Belém. She decided to purchase from Francisca Pereira Teles, the noble homes and land in Bemposta area in the centre of Lisbon, in order to build her residence. A chapel dating back to 1501 existed there and she requested the architect, João Antunes (1642–1712), to incorporate a chapel in the site plan under the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Our Lady of the Conception). The project began in 1694, with Antunes coming on board in 1702, and by 1702 the Queen had already begun to live in the palace. The building was a mixed construction: limestone and marble was used in many of the flourishes, but the structure was built of <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel,</b> wood and masonry.|$|E

40|$|The {{corrosion}} inhibition {{effect and}} mechanism of D-sodium gluconate for <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> in the simulated concrete pore solution containing Cl were studied by electrochemical techniques, including corrosion potential, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The {{results indicate that}} 0. 01 M D-sodium gluconate showed a good corrosion inhibition effect on <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> in the simulated concrete pore solution containing 0. 1 M NaCl because it strongly hindered the anodic reactions. The inhibition mechanism could be explained {{on the basis of}} the competitive adsorption between gluconate anions and chloride ions on the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> surface. And D-sodium gluconate could eventually form a compact adsorptive film by strong chelation and effectively inhibit the initiation of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> corrosion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> {{actually}} {{available on}} the European market is generally characterised by a good strength, but also by reduced ductility; {{on the other hand}} European codes concerning concrete and composite structures point out the importance of using <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> with sufficient ductility. In this paper, the influence of the properties of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> on the rotational capacity of composite beams under negative bending is theoretically analysed using a refined model, validated with experimental tests. An equivalence criterion for the classification of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> is also introduced. Plastic rotation that can be sustained by composite beams at failure is assumed as the main parameter to define the equivalent structural performance. To this end, the results of a wide parametric analysis are discussed. The comparison with similar analyses made for concrete structures shows that one classification for <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> seems to be not reliable for both types of structures.

40|$|It is {{unquestionable}} {{the fact}} that a structural system should be able to fulfil the function for which it was created, without being damaged to an extent disproportionate to the cause of damage. In addition, it is an undeniable fact that in reinforced concrete structures under severe dynamic loadings, both concrete and reinforcing bars are subjected to high strain-rates. Although the behavior of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> under high strain rates is of capital importance in the structural assessment under the abovementioned conditions, only the behaviour of concrete has been widely studied. Due to this lack of data on the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> under high strain rates, an experimental program on rebar <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steels</b> under high strain rates in tension is running at the DynaMat Laboratory.
