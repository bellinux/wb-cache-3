25|$|A {{much smaller}} <b>retransmission</b> <b>site</b> also exists to cover residences in the suburb of Eastgrove.|$|E
50|$|The QFARP Detachment {{followed}} in trace of Task Force Tarawa. This detachment established a critical AN/TRC-170 <b>retransmission</b> <b>site,</b> between Jalibah and An Numaniyah while {{providing services to}} VMU-1 on two separate occasions, and to MWSS-371.|$|E
50|$|For much of {{its early}} history, channel 28 was unable to get a direct feed from NBC because AT&T {{microwave}} and wireline operations weren't available in northeast Pennsylvania. Station engineers were thus forced to switch {{to and from the}} signals of WNBT in New York City (now WNBC) and WPTZ in Philadelphia (now CBS O&O KYW-TV) when NBC programming was airing. WPTZ was used as a backup. In efforts to improve the quality and reliability of the received signals, WBRE built its own relay site on Pimple Hill {{on the west side of}} Route 115, just south of Pocono Raceway. Reception of the New York stations is very clear and reliable from that site; indeed, it served as a microwave <b>retransmission</b> <b>site</b> for many of the area's cable systems well into the 1990s until fiber optics made microwave transmission obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Imparja Television had {{an initial}} {{population}} reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 {{had grown to}} 125,000. Imparja was available through <b>retransmission</b> <b>sites</b> at Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Leigh Creek and Woomera in South Australia, and Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory, {{as well as on}} the Optus Aurora satellite platform.|$|R
50|$|QQQ (also {{known as}} Southern Cross Central) is an Australian {{television}} station broadcasting in remote eastern, southern and central areas of Australia, owned by Southern Cross Austereo. The station is available via satellite and terrestrial platforms - mostly through community <b>retransmission</b> <b>sites,</b> although it also transmits {{into the town}} of Mount Isa, Queensland under the call sign ITQ. The station is primarily affiliated with the Seven Network, while carrying {{a limited amount of}} sport programming from Network Ten.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a natural distributed model for analyzing the survivability of distributed networks and network routing schemes based on considering {{the effects of}} local constraints on network connectivity. We investigate the computational consequences of two fundamental interpretations {{of the meaning of}} local constraints. We consider a fullduplex model in which constraints are applied to edges of a graph representing two-way communication links and a half-duplex model in which constraints are applied to edges representing one-way links. We show that the problem of determining the survivability of a network under the fullduplex model is NP-hard, even in the restricted case of simply defined constraints. We also show that the problem of determining the survivability of network routing under the half-duplex model is highly tractable. We are able to effectively determine fault-tolerant routing schemes that are able to dynamically adapt to withstand any connectivity threats consistent with the constraints of the half-duplex model. The routing scheme is based on a multitree data structure, and we are able to generate optimal multitrees of minimum weighted depth. We also investigate an optimization problem related to achieving survivable network routing using a small sets of <b>retransmission</b> or landmark <b>sites.</b> Although the associated optimization problem is NP-hard, we show that sufficiently dense graphs can achieve survivable routing schemes using a small sets of landmarks. We prove an associated extremal result that is optimal over all graphs with minimum degree #...|$|R
