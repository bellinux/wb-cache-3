25|$|A larger {{commercial}} variant, the 10-passenger Percival P.105, with stub wing mounted engines {{either side}} of the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> was envisaged, and the P.74 was expected to offer information into the necessary ducting required hence the engine was mounted underneath the fuselage with ducts running up through the cabin.|$|E
25|$|Less common {{today is}} the tractor configuration. In this version, the engine and {{propeller}} are located {{at the front of}} the aircraft, ahead of the pilot and <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> This was the primary configuration in early autogyros, but became less common after the advent of the helicopter. It has enjoyed a revival since the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} phase, a general {{clean-up}} of the airframe {{was performed to}} reduce drag. New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor. The skid landing gear also had streamlined fairings applied to it and the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> {{was replaced by a}} mast that could be tilted in-flight.|$|E
5000|$|... 26 April 1998:N1345Q, private, {{written off}} with 2 {{fatalities}} at Stevensville, MD, after the <b>rotor</b> and <b>mast</b> separated due to 'mast-bumping in low-g manoeuvres.|$|R
50|$|The A-70 was {{the first}} product of Aerotechnik, later merged and renamed Evektor-Aerotechnik. The A-70 was a towed gyroglider. The two seat variant placed seats in front of and behind the <b>rotor</b> head <b>mast.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors—also {{known as}} Coaxial mounted—one {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), helicopter control requires interaction between the two <b>rotors.</b> Howevererent <b>rotor</b> <b>masts</b> (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential collective pitch to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases collective pitch on the front rotor and increases collective pitch on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential collective pitch to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential cyclic pitch to control movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|R
25|$|The PKZ-2 was {{developed}} by Žurovec in parallel with the PKZ-1, but wholly independently. Zurovec acknowledged the support only of Petróczy, although later reports have mistakenly attributed the entire design to Kármán. The aircraft was built by Dr Liptak & Co AG under Žurovek's direction. It had three radiating arms, each housing a rotary piston engine. These engines were coupled together to drive a central pair of co-axial, contra-rotating two-bladed wooden propellers or rotors, of 6m diameter, mounted above the airframe. A round cockpit for the aircrew was fixed centrally, {{on top of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> Landing gear again comprised rubber-fabric cushions, one large central one and three smaller ones {{at the end of each}} arm.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, <b>rotor</b> <b>mast,</b> main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|Modern autogyros {{typically}} follow one of {{two basic}} configurations. The most common design is the pusher configuration, where the engine and propeller are located behind the pilot and <b>rotor</b> <b>mast,</b> {{such as in the}} Bensen [...] "Gyrocopter". It was developed by Igor Bensen in the decades following World War II, and came into widespread use shortly afterward.|$|E
5000|$|... 28 July 1983:N450FH, Hiller Aviation, {{written off}} with 2 {{fatalities}} at Porterville, CA during an airshow: the pilot using aggressive low-g manoeuvres {{which led to}} 'mast-bumping' and <b>rotor</b> separation / <b>mast</b> failure.|$|R
50|$|After the {{programme}} was terminated, {{the prototype}} Rotodyne itself, which was government property, was dismantled and largely destroyed in fashion reminiscent {{to that of}} the Bristol Brabazon. A single fuselage bay, as pictured, plus <b>rotors</b> and rotorhead <b>mast</b> survived and are on display at The Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare.|$|R
5000|$|Jesus nut or Jesus pin is a slang {{term for}} the main rotor {{retaining}} nut [...] that holds the main <b>rotor</b> to the <b>mast</b> of some helicopters, such as the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter; or more generally is any component that represents a {{single point of failure}} with catastrophic consequences.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, {{design work}} was well underway. [...] Progress {{was being made}} in weight {{reduction}} efforts to meet operational requirements. [...] Increases in engine performance and rotor blade improvements are options to help meet requirements if needed. [...] The <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> tilt angle was decreased and components shifted to ensure {{the center of gravity}} does not shift too far rearward as fuel is burned. [...] The design requirements were 'frozen' in 2009–10 and not changed since.|$|E
2500|$|Distinctive {{features}} included wheeled tricycle landing gear, flat canopy window plates, {{an unusual}} [...] "tee" [...] tail, a large ventral fin, and a three-barreled General Electric XM-188 [...] cannon. The YAH-63's <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> could be lowered and {{the landing gear}} could kneel to reduce its height for transport. One less noticeable feature was that the pilot occupied the front seat instead of the rear, the reverse of the AH-1's arrangement. This {{was believed to be}} more prudent since the YAH-63 was intended to fly [...] "in the treetops" [...] during [...] "nap-of-the-earth" [...] (NoE) operations, and the pilot needed to have {{a clear view of the}} aircraft's surroundings.|$|E
2500|$|The Hawk 4 had a steel <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> {{and engine}} {{mountings}} but was mostly aluminium elsewhere, including the rotor, rotor head and propeller. The fuselage was an aluminium semi-monocoque. [...] Some components, {{such as the}} nosecone, engine cowling and cabin door were formed from composite materials. [...] The rotor was a semi-rigid or teetering design with a swash plate, rotating at up to 270 rpm. [...] Yaw was jointly controlled by the balanced rudders on the endplate fins and the all-moving inboard rudders. [...] It had a fixed, tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels mounted at {{the tips of the}} stub wings. [...] Two rows of seats accommodated the pilot and up to three passengers; alternatively, the rear seats could be folded to provide baggage space.|$|E
50|$|Mellersh debarked from a {{helicopter}} onto a quay on 25 May 1955; {{he had been}} invited to cruise on a yacht belonging to the Itchenor Yacht Club. As the helicopter departed, one of its <b>rotors</b> hit the <b>mast</b> of a yacht. As the copter crashed, the main rotor killed Mellersh.|$|R
50|$|A forward CG {{may occur}} when a heavy pilot and {{passenger}} take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are located aft of the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> because as fuel burns the weight located aft of the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> becomes less.|$|E

50|$|The Super Rotor AC.4 Andorinha ("Swallow") was a sport {{autogyro}} first {{produced in}} Brazil in the 1960s. The prototype {{was built by}} Altair Coelho and flown in 1960 as the AC.1, a typically minimalist autogyro design consisting of an open framework supporting the pilots seat, <b>rotor</b> <b>mast,</b> engine mounting and tail fin. Power was supplied by a converted Volkswagen engine driving a pusher propeller. Francisco Mattis purchased the prototype and manufacturing rights and founded Super Rotor (now Montalva) of São Paulo to produce the aircraft. Refinements for serial production as the AC.4 included an extra reinforcing strut for the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> and a larger tail fin.|$|E

50|$|The {{swashplate}} {{consists of}} two main parts: a stationary swashplate and a rotating swashplate. The stationary (outer) swashplate is mounted on the main <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> and {{is connected to the}} cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) swashplate is mounted to the stationary swashplate by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> An anti-rotation link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer swashplate typically has an anti-rotation slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both swashplates tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating swashplate is connected to the pitch horns by the pitch links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) swashplate are the hexapod and the universal joint.Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} monocoque aluminum sheet, with a steel <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> and the twin tails supported by aluminium tubing. The series uses American-made Vortech and SportCopter rotor blades with a 9.14 m diameter and a chord of 20 cm. The 2004M model has an empty weight of 350 kg and a gross weight of 550 kg, giving a useful load of 200 kg.|$|E
50|$|Intermeshing rotors on a {{helicopter}} are {{a set of}} two rotors turning in opposite directions, with each <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> mounted with a slight angle to the other, in a transversely symmetrical manner, so that the blades intermesh without colliding. The arrangement allows the helicopter to function without a tail rotor, which saves power. However, neither rotor lifts directly vertically, which reduces efficiency per each rotor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} welded steel tubing. Its dual two-bladed rotors have diameters of 14.5 ft and incorporate dual flapping hinges. Directional control is achieved by tilting the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> The aircraft has an empty weight of 500 lb and a gross weight of 850 lb, giving a useful load of 350 kg. With full fuel of [...] the payload is 194 lb.|$|E
50|$|A much {{improved}} {{version of the}} SA 365 C Dauphin 2, the first prototype flying on 31 March 1979. This version introduced the uprated 492 kW (660 shp) Arriel 1C turboshafts, a retractable tricycle undercarriage, enlarged tail surfaces, and revised transmission, main rotor, <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> fairing and engine cowlings. The aircraft's initial M.T.O.W. of 3850 kg was later raised to 4000 kg. Deliveries of the production model began in 1982.|$|E

50|$|The SparrowHawk is a pusher {{configuration}} autogyro with an uncowled single 160 hp (120 kW) Subaru EJ25 {{flat-four engine}} mounted behind a totally enclosed glass fibre cabin. This pod, which seats two side by side, has almost triangular sides and is entered via optional large, partially glazed doors. An aluminium keel projects aft of the pod and a vertical member fixed to it carries {{the engine and}} <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> The two-bladed rotor is of bonded metal construction.|$|E
50|$|The Chadwick C-122 was a single-seat {{ultralight}} helicopter {{developed in}} the United States in the 1980s. It was a minimalist design consisting of a fibreglass shell enclosing a truss structure to which the engine, <b>rotor</b> <b>mast,</b> landing gear, and pilot's seat were attached. A wide variety of roles were envisaged for the aircraft, and therefore it was equipped with attachment points for spray bars, a cargo hook, external cargo racks, and even weapons for law enforcement work. The skid-type undercarriage could be quickly fitted with wheels for ground-handling, or floats for operations from water.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the tailboom built from carbon fibre. Its 6.10 m diameter two-bladed rotor has a chord of 20 cm, with anti-torque handled by a conventional two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor transmission uses a combination of V-belts and toothed belts. Pitch link controls are mounted inside the hollow <b>rotor</b> <b>mast</b> tube. The aircraft has an empty weight of 193 kg and a gross weight of 386 kg, giving a useful load of 193 kg. With full fuel of 58.8 L the payload is 151 kg.|$|E
50|$|The Layzell Cricket is a single-seat {{autogyro}} {{produced in}} the United Kingdom for homebuilding, although it was first {{produced in the}} early 1970s fully factory-built. It was a typically minimalist design, featuring a pilot's seat semi-enclosed within a fairing, and a pusher engine and large tailfin located aft of the <b>rotor</b> <b>mast.</b> Forty-three of the original Crickets were built by Campbell Aircraft, with the type enjoying a brief revival in 2001 when it was marketed in kit form by Mike Concannon of Cricket Gyroplanes, before reaching production again in 2005 by Layzell Gyroplanes as the Mk.6.|$|E
