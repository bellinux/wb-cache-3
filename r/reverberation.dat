5|$|Following the album's December 1990 release, {{critical}} reviews {{were not}} favourable; critics noted Burke to be a poor replacement for McCulloch, who they believed was an indispensable {{aspect of the}} band. After <b>Reverberation</b> failed to chart, the band were dropped by WEA Records and, after two independently released singles, disbanded in 1993.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Echo & the Bunnymen in 1988 {{to pursue}} a solo career, vocalist Ian McCulloch {{released}} two albums that were not commercial successes. Despite McCulloch's departure and drummer Pete de Freitas's death, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson decided to recruit three new members– Noel Burke (vocals), Jake Brockman (keyboards) and Damon Reece (drums)– and continue with the same band name, which angered McCulloch. The Bunnymen released one further album, <b>Reverberation</b> (1990), which critics and fans alike received poorly. WEA Records subsequently dropped the group, {{who went on to}} break-up in early 1993.|$|E

5|$|<b>Reverberation</b> is {{the sixth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album was {{released}} amidst a line-up {{change for the}} group, due to the departure of vocalist Ian McCulloch {{and the death of}} drummer Pete de Freitas. The remaining members, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson, were joined by ex-St. Vitus Dance singer Noel Burke, keyboard player Jake Brockman and drummer Damon Reece. The album was produced by former engineer for The Beatles Geoff Emerick at Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey, England, and had a more pronounced psychedelic sound than the group's previous releases.|$|E
5|$|Rihanna's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland. Marcos Tovar mixed her vocals, which were engineered by Spike Lindsey and mastered from Detroit over the Internet. The American songwriter Makeba Riddick provided additional vocal production. Strange used equalization, compression and <b>reverberation</b> but left the vocal balance. He assumed that Rihanna was satisfied with her recorded vocals and did not make major changes on her seven stereo vocal tracks.|$|E
5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and <b>reverberation</b> to give it its own unique sound. Much of the <b>reverberation</b> effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E

30|$|Active sonar is used {{to detect}} a target under water using a {{reflected}} ping. However, in addition to reflection from the target, the received signal contains <b>reverberations</b> caused by reflection from scatterers.

5|$|Strange {{arranged}} the Pro Tools session {{in a more}} traditional manner by laying out the drums, bass instruments, guitars, keyboards, main vocals and overdubs from left to right. While mixing, he began with drums, then the main vocals. He added the chorus and bridge, followed by other instrumentation. Strange mixed the track to satisfy Eminem, who, after entering the studio, made his own adjustments, providing additional production; by then, Resto's tracks were added. Strange made adjustments to Boi-1da's tracks, using SSL equalization (EQ) and some compression. To keep the track in tune from pitch fluctuation, Strange used Trim and Auto-Tune on Resto's TR-808 kick. Strange arranged <b>reverberation</b> tools, including the Bricasti, Eventide 2016, the Lexicon 480, Lexicon PMC70, and the Yamaha SPX90.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled <b>reverberation</b> from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less <b>reverberation</b> and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the <b>reverberation</b> that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, <b>reverberation,</b> treble or bass.|$|E
25|$|Flanging, chorus and <b>reverberation</b> (reverb) are all delay-based sound effects. With {{flanging}} and chorus, {{the delay}} time is very short and usually modulated.

30|$|Experiments are {{conducted}} with both simulated and measured <b>reverberations</b> {{to evaluate the}} proposed algorithm. The results of the simulations show {{the ability of the}} proposed algorithm to find the target echo signal by enhancing SNR from 6 to 15 dB compared to that of the received signal. ROC curves calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation confirm that the proposed algorithm enhances detection probability with a low false alarm rate. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also verified in an ocean by measuring the <b>reverberations.</b> Overall, the results show that the proposed algorithm suppresses <b>reverberations</b> and enhances detection performance in simulations and practice. Expanding our algorithm to multichannel sonar signals and analyzing the convergence of the constrained NMF are expected to be considered in our future work.|$|R
25|$|The narrow {{lines are}} {{believed}} to originate from the outer part of the active galactic nucleus, where velocities are lower, while the broad lines originate closer to the black hole. This is confirmed {{by the fact that}} the narrow lines do not vary detectably, which implies that the emitting region is large, contrary to the broad lines which can vary on relatively short timescales. <b>Reverberation</b> mapping is a technique which uses this variability to try to determine the location and morphology of the emitting region. This technique measures the structure and kinematics of the broad line emitting region by observing the changes in the emitted lines as a response to changes in the continuum. The use of <b>reverberation</b> mapping requires the assumption that the continuum originates in a single central source. For 35 AGN, <b>reverberation</b> mapping has been used to calculate the mass of the central black holes and the size of the broad line regions.|$|E
25|$|On {{the advice}} of {{acoustics}} firm, Kirkegaard Associates, the lack of <b>reverberation</b> and the difficult performance conditions for musicians were corrected by changes {{in the fabric of}} the auditorium. Surfaces that had previously absorbed sound were transformed to support and sustain that sound. The tapestries on the back walls of the boxes were gathered up to increase <b>reverberation,</b> but can be redeployed, together with additional absorbent blinds above the stage and around the Hall whenever needed. The wooden wall panels of the Hall were relined to change their acoustic qualities and the undulating plaster ceiling panels were completely reconstructed using more robust materials to provide greater warmth of sound and support for bass frequencies.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{an instance of}} contained violence during the 2011 riots in London, when Turkish and Kurdish ‘shopkeepers’ in Dalston, East London prevented rioters from entering the area. Introducing a ‘peaks’ and ‘troughs’ approach to the sociological study of violence, the article argues {{that we need to}} look at the troughs of non-violence in order to understand the peaks of violence and vice-versa. Based on a small-scale empirical study, this article also shows that contrary to the dominant representation of social actors playing fixed roles during social unrest, we found shifting positions and blurred boundaries in the drama of the 2011 riots. The paper demonstrates that the instance of contained violence in Dalston was informed by three types of <b>reverberations.</b> Firstly, we identified anticipatory <b>reverberations,</b> as the shopkeepers were aware of concurrent events elsewhere in London and, as a result, anticipated rioting in Dalston. Secondly, we saw experiential <b>reverberations,</b> as they used their own experience of unrest in Turkey to inform their behaviour. Finally, the representation of the action of the shopkeepers in traditional and social media may have contributed to the containment of violence elsewhere in England, suggesting representational <b>reverberations...</b>|$|R
