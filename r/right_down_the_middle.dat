25|$|The Cougars first {{match of}} the MVC Championships was a rematch of last Saturday's MVC finale versus Loyola. As {{in the first}} meeting, the game was an epic {{struggle}} between the two top defenses in the Valley. In the first half, the Cougars' offense outshot the Ramblers 8–2, while in the second half, Loyola's offense came to the fore, leading 6 shots to 3. Both goalkeepers and their defenders, {{among the best in}} the NCAA, kept clean sheets through regulation time. SIUE seemed to gain an advantage when Loyola went a man down due to a red card in the 86th minute, but the Ramblers continued to force the action, and the Cougars were unable to formulate an effective offensive plan. As in the teams' first meeting, the game went into golden goal extra time tied 0–0, and, after two ten-minute overtimes, the tie still stood, leaving the result to a penalty shoot-out. Both teams made their first three shots count, then both missed the fourth with high shots. Loyola's fifth shot was up to the MVC Player of the Year, who also missed high. The Cougars' team captain Ledbetter then fired a shot <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> past the Loyola keeper to give the Cougars the win and set them up to defend their tournament championship in the Sunday title game.|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two {{teammates}} threw {{a perfect}} {{game against the}} Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3–1. [...] "I was just telling myself, 'Don't walk him,'" [...] Feldman said. [...] "Once it got to 3–1, I threw it <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> [...] If they got a hit, they got a hit. [...] But they're not going {{to break up a}} perfect game on a walk." [...] The batter grounded out. [...] On July 31, the three pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.|$|E

Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called the book a [...] "definitive history" [...] of the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. Willa Paskin wrote for New York Magazine that Carter, [...] "spoke with enough people involved in the situation to provide an account so detailed, it even includes re-created conversations and dialogue". Neal Justin of Star Tribune commented on the author's neutrality in his writing style, [...] "The next time network TV executives stumble into an ugly behind-the-scenes battle, they should consider hiring Bill Carter to negotiate.

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle?</b> Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics.

5000|$|The reason I'm {{telling you}} about this is to explain what I know about Sloan's lake. The stage line was from Denver to Golden and Central City. The road was the {{southern}} route to Golden and we crossed the Platte river where Larimer street crosses it now, and the road went on out over the hill and into that wide sag, or swale, where Sloan's lake is now. The road was good <b>right</b> <b>down</b> through <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of what would now be {{the bed of the}} lake. In June, 1861, when I went down into Kansas territory to keep a stage station, there wasn't any lake there. When I came back {{in the early part of}} 1863, less than two years later, there was the lake just as it is now, and it never has changed a bit that ever I could see. There was some talk years afterward about a man having dug a well there and it overflowed, forming the lake, but I was along there about as much as anybody and I never saw any well. However, it may have started from a well. All I know is that it came there in a good deal less than two year, to my certain knowledge. When I came back from the lower country, the road I used to travel was changed. The lake had covered up the old right of way.|$|R

60|$|The {{children}} did not wait to be asked twice. They seized the rope and pulled their very best. But they could not move Tommy one inch. The rope hung <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the well, and as they had to reach over a good deal even to touch it, they could get no opportunity of exerting their full strength upon it. And it is very well that they could not, for had they been able to raise Tommy, {{it is probable that}} one or two of them would have been jerked down the well every time he slipped down again, which he would have been certain to do a great many times before he reached the top.|$|E
5000|$|This {{game was}} {{particularly}} frustrating to Steeler fans. One week previous, the Steelers beat the San Francisco 49ers in San Francisco {{being the only}} team to beat the 49ers that year going 15-1 {{on the way to}} winning the Super Bowl. Then coming back East to play one of the worst teams of the season, the Indianapolis Colts, who had only 2 wins at that point and 4 total on the year, they lost on a last minute improbable play after leading throughout the game. The Colts third-string quarterback, Mike Pagel, came off the bench in the third quarter and was leading a final minute drive from their 20. On the Colts 40 with 34 seconds left, Pagel avoided a near sack, scrambled <b>right</b> and threw <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of <b>the</b> field to WR Bernard Henry. The ball however went directly to the hands of Steeler CB Sam Washington who bobbled the ball. Between Washington and a few other Steeler defenders, WR Ray Butler burst through the gap, snatched the ball in the air and ran untouched 54 yards for the touchdown. The extra point sealed the game.

60|$|Ting-a-ling {{stood in}} <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of <b>the</b> bed and looked about him. It {{was as if}} he {{was in the midst of}} a great plain. The bed was a double one, that had belonged to the Giant's father and mother, and he had given it to Ting-a-ling because it was the best in the house. The little fairy was delighted with this bed, which was very smooth, and covered with a great white counterpane. He ran from one end to the other of it, and he turned heels-over-head, and walked on his hands, and amused himself in this way until he was {{thoroughly}} tired. Then he lay <b>right</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> very <b>middle,</b> and went to sleep. I would like to have a picture of Ting-a-ling in the Giant's bed, but any one can draw it so easily for himself, that it is of no use to have it here. All that is necessary is to take a large sheet of white paper,--the largest you can get,--and in the centre of it make a small dot,--the smallest you can make,--and there you have the picture.|$|R
5000|$|Signifying in a {{three and}} a half star review for 365 Days Of Inspiring Media, Jonathan Andre citing that the EP is [...] "one deserving to be listened to" [...] and that it is [...] "A must for anyone who loves EDM and worship,". David Jeffries of AllMusic, {{affixing}} a {{three and a}} half star rating to the EP, says that the first three songs [...] "aim for the club with drum machine beats and bright synthesizer lines fueling the music," [...] describes the acoustic version of [...] "This Is Living" [...] as settling [...] "into afternoon material" [...] and calls [...] "Sinking Deep" [...] an [...] "empowering ballad". David Hitchcock, allotting the EP a four and a half star rating at Band Hangout, says, [...] "All in all, the songs chosen make for a great and interesting EP" [...] and that [...] "Y&F has definitely pushed the boundaries of what has been considered [...] "worship" [...] music. Most of their [...] "payoff" [...] moments musically are instrumental breaks. Their melodies and lyrics push the limits of [...] "congregational"." [...] Giving the EP a nine out of ten rating on Geeks Under Grace, David Austin Black describes the EP as being [...] "bright and God-centered, rejoicing in the freedom that life in Christ gives us and pausing to voice quiet, impassioned cries of the heart." [...] Indicating in a four star review at Louder Than The Music, Jono Davies lists [...] "This Is Living" [...] and [...] "Energy" [...] as the standout tracks and states: [...] "This isn't just an EP for young people, this is a fresh musical movement for anybody to get involved with. Musical styles and sounds are not ageist. Yet this EP has a youthful, even playfulness to it, but deep <b>down</b> <b>right</b> in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of <b>the</b> big dance sound is a heart to live for God. A joyful living for God and for me that's what I got most out of this EP." [...] Caitlin Lassiter of NewReleaseToday bestowed the EP a four and a half star rating, noting that [...] "After only minutes of listening to the music they've poured their heart into, it's clear that they're passionate about Christ and making His name known through worship. This Is Living is a perfect representation of that passion, exuding praise and joy from every single lyric." [...] Jeremy Armstrong of Worship Leader rated the EP four stars, stating that Hillsong Young & Free [...] "describes themselves as “young people who are passionate about bringing the message of Jesus, and the spirit of freedom that comes only from knowing him.” Their music certainly matches that description! Youthful, high energy, and fun. Perfectly suited for youth and young-adult settings." ...|$|R

60|$|Each skull {{was split}} or fractured, not clean cut, {{as with a}} sword or bullet, but hacked and hewn with some blunt implement, presumably either a club or a stone tomahawk. The skull of the great chief inside was entire and his {{skeleton}} unmutilated: but we could see at a glance that the remains we found huddled together on the top were those of slaves or prisoners of war, sacrificed beside the dead chieftain's tomb, and eaten with the other products of the chase by his surviving tribesmen. In an inner chamber behind the chieftain's own hut we came upon yet a stranger relic of primitive barbarism. Two complete human skeletons squatted there in the same curious attitude as their lord's, as if in attendance upon him in a neighbouring ante-chamber. They were the skeletons of women--so our professional bone-scanner immediately told us--and each of their skulls had been carefully cleft <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> by a single blow from a sharp stone hatchet. But {{they were not the}} victims intended for the pièce de résistance at the funeral banquet. They were clearly the two wives of the deceased chieftain, killed on his tomb by his son and successor, in order to accompany their lord and master in his new life underground as they had hitherto done in his rude wooden palace {{on the surface of the}} middle earth.|$|E

Of course, he isn't as broad as he is long, but he looks almost that when he is lying flat down and that long hair of his is spread out on both sides. He really has a handsome coat when you come to look at it. It is silvery gray and silky looking. It seems to be parted <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of his back. His tail is rather short, but stout and hairy. His head and face are really handsome. His cheeks, chin and a broad stripe from his nose right straight back over his head are white. On each cheek is a bar of black. The back part of each ear is black, and so are his feet. He has rather a sharp nose. Somehow when he is walking he makes me think of a little, flattened-out Bear with very short legs. And such claws as he has on his front feet! I don't know any one with such big strong claws for his size. I guess that must be because he is such a digger." ...|$|E
