25|$|On May 15, 1754, {{at about}} 9 or 10 {{o'clock in the}} night, the volcano quite {{unexpectedly}} commenced to roar and emit, sky-high, burning flames intermixed with glowing rocks which, falling back upon the island and <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slopes of the mountain, created {{the impression of a}} large river of fire. During the following days there appeared in the lake a large quantity of pumice stone which had been ejected by the volcano. Part of these ejecta had also reached the hamlet of Bayuyungan and completely destroyed it.|$|E

25|$|Boston {{began the}} postseason by {{sweeping}} the AL West champion Anaheim Angels in the ALDS. However, Curt Schilling suffered a torn ankle tendon in Game 1 {{when he was}} hit by a line drive. The injury was exacerbated when Schilling fielded a ball <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> first base line. In the third game of the series, what looked to be a blowout {{turned out to be a}} nail-biter, as Vladimir Guerrero hit a grand slam off Mike Timlin in the 7th inning to tie the game. However, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game. The Sox advanced to a rematch in the 2004 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees.|$|E
25|$|The {{powerful}} explosion sent a ball {{of flame}} <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street and a pall of black smoke rose upwards. The blast wave ripped into the crowds {{of people who had}} run into Donegall Street for safety, tossing them in all directions and killing another four men outright: three of them, Ernest Dougan (39), James Macklin (30) and Samuel Trainor (39) were corporation binmen working in the area, and the fourth man was Sydney Bell (65). Trainor was also an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier {{and a member of the}} Orange Order. A seriously wounded pensioner, Henry Miller (79) would die in hospital on 5 April. Most of the bodies of the dead were mutilated beyond recognition; one of the binmen lay in the road with his head shattered. With the exception of Constable O'Neill, who had been a Catholic, the other six victims were Protestants.|$|E
25|$|Boston {{began the}} playoffs by {{sweeping}} the AL West champion Anaheim Angels. The Red Sox {{blew out the}} Angels 9–3 in Game 1, scoring 7 of those runs in the fourth inning. However, the Sox' 2003 off season prize pickup Curt Schilling suffered a torn tendon when {{he was hit by}} a line drive. The injury was exacerbated when Schilling fielded a ball <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> first base line. The second game, pitched by Pedro Martínez, stayed close until Boston scored four in the ninth to win 8–3. In game three, what looked to be a blowout {{turned out to be a}} nail-biter, as Vladimir Guerrero hit a grand slam off Mike Timlin in the top of the seventh inning to tie it at six. However, David Ortiz, who was noted for his clutch hitting, delivered in the 10th inning with a game winning two-run homer, off Jarrod Washburn, sailing over the Green Monster. The Red Sox advanced to a rematch in the 2004 American League Championship Series against their bitter rivals, the New York Yankees.|$|E

500|$|A second, new crater and a {{blue flame}} were {{observed}} on March 29. The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to [...] long. Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30, and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare {{a state of emergency}} on April 3. Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a [...] "red zone" [...] around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine or six months in jail. This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.|$|E

Another legend states that a Buddhist priest impressed the celestial king with his asceticism and the celestial king used his supernatural powers to carry the rock to its current place, specifically choosing the rock as the resemblance to the monks head. It is the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma after the Shwedagon Pagoda and [...] the Mahamuni Pagoda.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the night}} of November 1, Taal resumed its former fury, {{ejecting}} fire, rocks, sand, and mud in greater quantities than ever before. On November 15, it vomited enormous boulders which <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slopes of the island, fell into the lake and caused huge waves [...] The paroxysms were accompanied by swaying motions of the ground which caused all the houses of the town to totter. We had already abandoned our habitation and {{were living in a}} tower which appeared to offer greater security; but on this occasion we resolved that the entire population retire to the Sanctuary of Casaysay, only the [...] "Administrator" [...] and myself to remain on the spot.|$|E
2500|$|To {{build the}} high banking, crews had to {{excavate}} {{over a million}} square yards of soil from the track's infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what {{is now known as}} Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph [...] "Sax" [...] Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange speedboat races on it.) 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track's binding base, over which asphalt would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny {{had to come up with}} a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the series}} {{returning}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 6, the improbable comeback continued, with Curt Schilling pitching on an ankle that had three sutures {{wrapped in a}} bloody [...] white sock (red with a blood stain). Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings to lead the team to victory. Mark Bellhorn also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run {{home run in the}} fourth inning. Originally called a double, the umpires conferred and agreed that the ball had actually gone into the stands before falling back into the field of play, which was apparent to the television audience but angered Yankees fans. A key play came {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning with Derek Jeter on first and Alex Rodríguez facing Bronson Arroyo. Rodríguez hit a ground ball down the first base line. Arroyo fielded it and reached out to tag him as he raced down the line. Rodríguez slapped at the ball and it came loose, <b>rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line. Jeter scored and Rodríguez ended up on second. After conferring, however, the umpires called Rodríguez out on interference and returned Jeter to first base, the second time in the game they reversed a call. Yankees fans, upset with the calls, littered the field with debris. The umpires called police clad in riot gear to line the field in the top of the 9th inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player Tony Clark, who had played well against the Red Sox since leaving the team, to the plate as the potential winning run. Closer Keith Foulke however, struck out Clark to end the game and force a Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback on the strength of Derek Lowe's one-hit, one-run pitching and Johnny Damon's two home runs, including a grand slam in the second inning off the first pitch of reliever Javier Vázquez, and defeated the New York Yankees, 10–3. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.|$|E
