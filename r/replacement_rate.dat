We study {{the effects of}} this kind of intervention with student subjects in an experimental laboratory setting rich enough to allow for moral hazard, adverse selection, and crowding out of good intentions. Both wages and <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> offered by competing employers are reciprocated by workers. However, <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> are only reciprocated as long as no minimum level is mandated. Although we observe adverse selection when workers have different exogenous probabilities for being absent from work, this does not lead to a market breakdown.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the methodology of}} measuring <b>replacement</b> <b>rates,</b> comparing simulation based approaches, which simulate <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> for {{a representative sample of}} the population, with other approaches that simulate <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> for "typical" families or are entirely based on recorded household data. We emphasise the advantages of the first method. Utilising a cross-country microsimulation model for Europe, EUROMOD, we generate the distribution of <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> for four European countries, Denmark, France, Spain and the UK. In particular we show the important role of household composition and the presence of other household members' incomes in preserving the standard of living while out of work. We argue that, given this strong influence of primary incomes, <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> are not necessarily the best indicator {{of the impact of the}} taxbenefit system in this respect. To isolate the effects of the tax-benefit system on both work incentives and the degree of social protection for the out-of-work population, we therefore introduce a new measure, the “tax-benefit-to-earnings ratio”.

5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the <b>replacement</b> <b>rate</b> of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E

Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably {{would not have been able}} to chew.

They {{do not reflect the}} views of the International One of the strongest objections against personal pension plans is that they transfer the investment risk to individual workers, who are then exposed to the vagaries of equity and bond markets. Using U. S. historical data, this paper investigates the impact of the volatility of investment returns on <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> in the context of personal pension plans. We find large fluctuations in <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> across different cohorts of workers, if undiversified portfolios are used.

These strategies include: portfolio diversification, a late gradual shift to bonds, a gradual purchase of nominal or real annuities, and a purchase of variable annuities. The first three of these strategies lower the volatility of <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> but at a significant cost in terms of lower <b>replacement</b> <b>rates.</b> But purchase of variable annuities reduces the dispersion of <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> across generations without lowering their level.

Our most important finding is that a non-trivial fraction of the elderly in the age/vintage group we study either remained poor, became poor, or had very low <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> {{in terms of their}} total income. This occurred despite the enormous general improvement of the economic status of the elderly, part of which was made possible by very large increases in real Social Security benefits. Examination of the characteristics of those who fell through the safety net reveal that females, especially widows, were the most likely candidates for economic difficulty in this cohort in this stage of their life. We also note a sharp difference in realizations of retirement income expectations among those who were poor and/or had low <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> relative to those who were well off and/or had high <b>replacement</b> <b>rates.</b> Both groups received substantially more Social Security benefits than expected, whereas those with (ex post) low <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> received less in pensions and continued earnings than they had expected while those with high <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> received more than expected. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} but {{difficult to distinguish}} between desirable and undesirable effects of unemployment insurance (UI) that are observationally equivalent when designing optimal UI schemes. For example, a UI-induced rise in the wage rate caused by workers taking more time to match their skills with job vacancies is desirable. However, another view of the same observation is that UI causes permanently higher involuntary unemployment by raising the reservation wage. This paper avoids this problem by regarding the trade-off between the UI <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> and unemployment as an intermediate relationship that matters {{only as far as}} it impacts economic growth. An empirical analysis of UI <b>replacement</b> <b>rates,</b> unemployment rates, and growth rates using annual panel data finds UI <b>replacement</b> <b>rates</b> are associated with higher unemployment.
