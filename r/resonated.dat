5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. Disco reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that <b>resonated</b> with the middle and lower classes.|$|E

In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu's stay. He commented that, in later years, the politician adopted views which <b>resonated</b> with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations.|$|E
5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records. The album is noted for {{a blend of}} regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work.

5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it <b>resonated</b> with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's Zelda team {{initiated}} {{plans for}} a new game early {{in the development of the}} GameCube system, before Majora's Mask was completed for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. Eiji Aonuma, director of Majora's Mask, returned to helm the project, while Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka served as producers. Early concepts generally followed Ocarina of Times designs, with graphics enhanced for the new system's capabilities. The team hastily created a brief clip of Link fighting Ganondorf for a demonstration at the 2000 Space World exposition, where Nintendo announced the GameCube. The clip <b>resonated</b> with fans and commentators who hoped it previewed the next Zelda title.|$|E

5|$|Vonnegut {{published}} his first novel, Player Piano, in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively, {{but was not}} commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as Cat's Cradle (1963) and God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1964). Vonnegut's magnum opus, however, was his immediately successful sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. The book's antiwar sentiment <b>resonated</b> with its readers amidst the ongoing Vietnam War, and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, Slaughterhouse-Five went {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list, thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and commencement addresses around the country and received many awards and honors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{expected}} {{to accommodate the}} needs of the entire workforce, by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62,000. This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1,300 family units and 20 dormitories built. More shopping and recreational facilities were added, the schools were expanded to accommodate 9,000 students, and a 50-bed annex was added to the hospital. The number of school children reached 8,223 in 1945. Few issues <b>resonated</b> more with the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system. Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board, the school system was run autonomously, with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army. Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably higher than those of Anderson County. The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 2015, Clinton {{formally}} {{announced her}} candidacy {{for the presidency}} in the 2016 election. She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure. The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics <b>resonated</b> with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{excitations}} in a Fermion system with large quantum fluctuations that can be described by resonance of non-orthogonal Slater determinants with different correlation structures, namely, by the <b>resonating</b> Hartree·Fock (HF) theory developed previously. We obtain a new approximation for excitations from time dependent small fluctuations of the <b>resonating</b> HF ground state {{in a similar manner}} to the time dependent HF derivation of the random phase approximation (RPA). It, therefore, is called the <b>resonating</b> RPA. It gives two kinds of excitations. One is the collective excitations due to secular vibrations of the orbitals in the <b>resonating</b> Slater determinants. These excitations are called vibrons. In contrast to the usual RP A giving only one class of vibrons arising from a Slater determinant, the <b>resonating</b> RP A gives many different classes of vibrons arising from different Slater determinants involved in the ground state. Another kind of excitations arises from secular vibrations of the mixing coefficients of the <b>resonating</b> Slater determinants. These excitations of quite a new kind are shown to correspond to the excited states in the Res HF theory due to the resonance of the Slater determinants and are called· resonons. The <b>resonating</b> RP A gives a unified description of vibrons and resonons and their interac-tions. We discuss new concepts emerging from and suggested by the <b>resonating</b> HF-RPA theory such as <b>resonating</b> energy bands, destruction of long range orders by resonance, solitonic and polaronic resonons and excitons, spin waves with moving solitons and polarons and so on...|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1968 election, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this <b>resonated</b> with voters; in surveys conducted {{in parts of the}} metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan. In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and the major issues were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy. Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it. With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in the print media, which had long been a bastion of the LCL. Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count, Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of Murray gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber's lone independent, Tom Stott, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor. Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This <b>resonated</b> with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
5|$|Patton left France for New York City on March 2, 1919. After {{the war he}} was {{assigned}} to Camp Meade, Maryland, and reverted to his permanent rank of captain on June 30, 1920, though he was promoted to major again the next day. Patton was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. that year to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time he developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. Patton supported the M1919 tank design created by J. Walter Christie, a project which was shelved due to financial considerations. While on duty in Washington, D.C., in 1919, Patton met Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career. During and following Patton's assignment in Hawaii, he and Eisenhower corresponded frequently. Patton sent Eisenhower notes and assistance to help him graduate from the General Staff College. With Christie, Eisenhower, {{and a handful of other}} officers, Patton pushed for more development of armored warfare in the interwar era. These thoughts <b>resonated</b> with Secretary of War Dwight Davis, but the limited military budget and prevalence of already-established Infantry and Cavalry branches meant the U.S. would not develop its armored corps much until 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{series has}} gained a strong {{popularity}} in not only Japan but also throughout the world. For instance, coverage of the anime appeared {{on the front page}} of the Hong Kong free newspaper am730 on May 27, 2013, concerning its popularity within Hong Kong as well as in China and Taiwan. However, the series also attracted criticism: the South Korean Electronic Times magazine accused Attack on Titan of having a militaristic message that serves Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's political leanings; while the series also <b>resonated</b> with Hong Kong youths who saw the invading Titans as a metaphor for mainland China. Hong Kong media commentator Wong Yeung-tat praised Isayama's style and the versatility of Attack on Titans setting, which opens itself to readers' various interpretations. In 2013, after media linked to a 2010 blog post by Isayama indicating that the design of the character Dot Pixis was based on the Imperial Japanese General Akiyama Yoshifuru, an Internet flame war about the general's war record (e.g. allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur) ensued on his blog and included death threats to the author.
