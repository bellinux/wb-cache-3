25|$|The many anecdotes about Democritus, {{especially}} in Diogenes Laërtius, attest to his disinterest, modesty, and simplicity, {{and show that}} he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately blinding himself {{in order to be}} less disturbed in his pursuits; it may well be true that he lost his sight in old age. He was cheerful, and was always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.|$|E
2500|$|A {{severely}} burned body {{found inside}} Spengler's house {{is believed to}} be Spengler's 67-year-old sister Cheryl, with whom he was living. The shooting was suspected to have followed an argument between Spengler and Cheryl. A two-to-three-page typewritten letter written by Spengler was found at the scene. It reflected Spengler's intent to ambush first responders, but offered no motive for the shooting. In it, he wrote, [...] "I still have to get <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how much of the neighborhood I can burn down, and do what I like doing best, killing people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enough is {{a thriller}} film which also details an abusive relationship. Kazan said it's [...] "About the worst {{aspect of the}} male psyche is that males have been taught, traditionally, to expect {{to get what they}} want. Much of the {{problems}} that men have, or the problems that men impose on women, have to do with feeling like they’re entitled, and that women should do what men want." [...] Ryan J. Downey of MTV News said [...] "Is America <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its favorite iced-up, well-manicured diva, Jennifer Lopez, all glammed-down and kicking ass as a battered wife?".|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, critics often {{disagree}} {{about the nature}} of Dryden's ode: some believe his praise to be too excessive, and even ironic. These individuals condemn Killigrew for using well worn and conventional topics, such as death, love, and the human condition, in her poetry and pastoral dialogues. In fact, Alexander Pope, a prominent critic, as well as the leading poet of the time, labelled her work [...] "crude" [...] and [...] "unsophisticated." [...] As a young poet who had only distributed her work via manuscript prior to her death, it is possible that Killigrew was not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her work published so soon.|$|E
2500|$|After 19 May, {{three or}} four British frigates, four tugs, {{and as many as}} five Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels, were in the disputed area to protect an average of 46 {{trawlers}} from Icelandic harassment. In order to keep some on station at all times, seven frigates were taken from ordinary duties to be assigned to the squadron. In addition, several Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft were sent to the area, and the total manpower assigned was in the region of 2,000 personnel. The strategy used by the British was relatively straightforward: they marked out [...] "fishing boxes" [...] for use by trawlers, protected by high-speed frigates at the outer edges, and with the slower tugs <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> off any attempts by the ICG to intervene inside the boxes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, West {{appeared}} at the live televised Academy Awards and performed the song [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Rock Hudson, which brought a standing ovation. In 1959, she released an autobiography, Goodness Had Nothing to Do With It, which became a best seller and was reprinted with {{a new chapter in}} 1970. West guest-starred on television, including [...] The Dean Martin Show in 1959 and The Red Skelton Show in 1960, to promote her autobiography, and a lengthy interview on Person to Person with Charles Collingwood, which was censored by CBS in 1959, and never aired. CBS executives felt members of the television audience were not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a nude marble statue of West, which rested on her piano. [...] In 1964, she made a guest appearance on the sitcom Mister Ed. [...] Much later, in 1976, she was interviewed by Dick Cavett and sang two songs on his [...] "Back Lot U.S.A." [...] special on CBS.|$|E

60|$|It {{may seem}} {{surprising}} that Rollo {{should be so}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>see</b> the docks before he knew at all what they were. The truth is, what attracted him was the word shipping. Like other boys of his age, he was always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go, no matter where, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> ships, or any thing connected with shipping.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of photography, people commonly hired painters and engravers to [...] "re-create" [...] an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate {{based on the information}} available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others removed elements out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>to</b> <b>see</b> illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.|$|R

2500|$|Darshana {{is viewed}} as {{experiencing}} {{the presence of a}} highly revered person, which can awaken latent potential for spiritual growth, or intellectual understanding.
