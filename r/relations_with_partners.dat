40|$|NoClass theorists ask for {{research}} on the 'paradox of class' - the fact that while class appears to be materially {{just as important as}} ever, it hardly features as part of a self-conscious social identity. At the same time mothering is usually seen as a classless activity. This paper describes class based differences in how mothers combine employment and caring for their children, how they divide labour with their partners, and how they choose childcare. These are not simple structural divisions between working class and middle class, but instead refer to more nuanced social identities. These class based differences in mothering present different mixes of choice and constraint, or of 'rationality' and 'preference' in choosing alternative courses of action. However, theories focusing on classless individualised preference (Hakim) and class-based rationality (Goldthorpe) do not go far beyond a tautological description of these alternatives. Rather, the paper shows how preference and rationality are socially and culturally created through the development of career as an identity, through biographical experience, through <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>partners,</b> and through the development of normative views in social networks...|$|E

Strategic management researchers associate competitive advantage in part with consensus on the means of competition, whereas other researchersâ€™ entrepreneurship or negotiation, accentuate the importance of common ends (e. g., goals and values) in cooperative arrangements. Competitive advantage refers to the superior capabilities of the firm over rivals and means of competition involve resource allocations. Desired ends include business goals, as well as standards of fairness and trustworthiness. Strategy researchers report that consensus among managers on methods of competing relates to higher firm performance. cooperation, dissension, franchise network, case study, Yoplait., Financial Economics, Industrial Organization,...|$|E

30|$|For TBCs {{to survive}} in the market after graduation, it is {{necessary}} to guide the efforts of strategic planning to establish <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>partners,</b> in order to obtain technologies and funding. The image of a lone-wolf entrepreneur that single-handedly solves all problems needs to be discarded, in favor of an image of an entrepreneur responsible for managing networks. This means developing new capabilities related to external relationships (O’Connor & DeMartino, 2006). The objectives of these partnerships with external players involve gaining specific assets, knowledge-sharing routines, and access to complementary resources. Planning efforts need {{to take into account the}} ability of managing these networks (Dyer & Singh, 1996). If the TBC can take advantage of the incubator network in the early stages of pre-incubation and incubation, then in the post-incubation stage it is up to the TBC to keep the previously-established relationships while managing a new range of partnerships that enable the acquisition of knowledge and resources to develop their innovation capacity. On the one hand, graduated TBCs need to build partnerships to sustain their commercial or market risks associated with expanding their activities. On the other hand, they need these partnerships to increase their levels of efficiency and market share by developing radical or significantly-improved innovations (Story et al., 2009). If entrepreneurs develop these relational capabilities, they can obtain competitive advantages from learning, from the flow of information, and from the economy of scale (Ebers & Jarillo, 1998). In sum, it is the new ranges of competencies for the entrepreneurs that change the way to manage their enterprises. In the lines below, we present our hypotheses, in order to show how these relational competences are essential for TBC innovativeness.|$|E
