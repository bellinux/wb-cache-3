40|$|International audienceBivalve {{aquaculture}} is worldwide {{impacted by}} biofouling development. Immersed infrastructures and shells of the <b>reared</b> <b>species</b> create new substrate {{for a wide}} range of epibionts, mainly composed of suspension feeders. Biofouling development is generally considered as a plague for bivalve aquaculture, and its control results in additional costs that can represent up to 30 % of total operational costs of the industry. Epibionts have not only consequences for the species they overgrow (i. e. basibiont), but they can also alter the ecological functioning of the exploited ecosystem. In this review, we point out that the assessment of the net effect of biofouling is more complex than expected, as it combines negative and positive effects on both the commercial production and the ecosystem. Furthermore, we emphasize that the removal of biofouling can be stressful and damaging for the <b>reared</b> <b>species.</b> Biofouling control should be carefully reconsidered, on the basis of a holistic approach considering: (i) the interactions between epibionts and their basibionts; (ii) its impact on the final product; and (iii) its contribution to the sustainability of the ecosystem...|$|E

The most studied and easily <b>reared</b> <b>species</b> {{are not necessarily}} the most sustainable, acceptable, or delicious. Here, we review the literature on the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, which is capable of efficiently converting a wide variety of organic materials, from food waste to manure, into insect biomass. They can be grown and harvested without dedicated facilities and are not pestiferous. Their larvae are 42 % crude protein and 29 % fat, although they are higher in saturated fats than most insects. They do not concentrate pesticides or mycotoxins. They are already grown and recommended for use as animal feed, but with regional legal restrictions on how this is done. For commercial use in human foods, larvae could potentially be milled and converted into a textured protein with a strong flavor. Their biggest advantage over other insects is their ability to convert waste into food, generating value and closing nutrient loops as they reduce pollution and costs. This general advantage is also their greatest disadvantage, for the social stigmas and legal prohibitions against eating organisms that eat waste are added to extant taboos facing insect consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tenebrio molitor {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>reared</b> <b>species</b> of insect at {{industrial}} scale. The entire life cycle of mealworms takes place in the same ecosystem and the duration of the different stages is highly dependent on environmental and physical conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, diet and population density. Most of the environment conditions as well as diet have already been studied and are documented. Tenebrio molitor is deeply adaptable to extreme dry conditions, obtaining water from both food ingestion (even substances with low water content) and/or atmosphere, however larvae grows faster in moist conditions upper than 70 %. At the industrial scale, water can be provided as pure water, through wet paper, fresh vegetables with high water content or even polymers capable of absorbing water (polyacrylamide). Chapter 1 is a review of the optimal conditions for Tenebrio molitor rearing. In Chapter 2, the effects of relative humidity and the effects of ingesting fresh vegetables contaminated with pesticides and polyacrylamide are evaluated. Relative humidity affected the development of mealworm larvae, with higher pupation and body mass attained at 65 % and with faster growth rates attained at 40 %. No effects of pesticides were detected. However, the chemical analysis of body mass will allow knowing if there was bioaccumulation.) ...|$|E

Due to its remarkable advantages of fast-growing and facultative adaptability in various habitats under different conditions, {{it has become the}} most dominant commercially <b>reared</b> <b>species</b> of freshwater aquaculture in Greece. Despite its economic importance, there is a dearth of population genetic studies regarding the origin of any posterior introduction by the private aquaculture sector. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was used, in order to assess variation in five mitochondrial DNA protein-encoding regions and the control region, covering more than 5, 500 bp of the 16, 600 bp total mitochondrial genome size. The samples derived from 10 rainbow trout farms throughout Greece representative of the freshwater aquaculture sector. The conducted population structure analysis revealed two major clusters among the farmed-rainbow trout populations. Moreover, the overall genetic diversity was substantially attributed to the diversity within populations rather than among them. In any case, both factors obtained from AMOVA analysis were statistically significant. The obtained haplotype network reinforced the existence of two central haplotype clusters among the farmed-rainbow trout populations in the Greek freshwater aquaculture sector. © Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey...|$|E

In aquaculture sector, the most recent legislative framework regarding the organic production in Europe is the Commission Regulation (EC) 710 / 2009, where chapter for aquaculture animals include requirement for animal welfare conditions in husbandry and maximum stocking densities. In Italy, only ten farms are involved in the supply of certified organic fish and only some pilot projects were carried out for organic farming of different species.

40|$|Based on the {{individual}} growth, food limitation, population renewal through seeding, and individual marketable size, a theoretical model of the cultured species population dynamics {{was used to assess}} the carrying capacity of an ecosystem. It gave a domeshape curve relating the annual production and the standing stock under the assumption of individual growth limited by the available food in an ecosystem. It also showed the influence of mortality rate and marketable size on this curve and was introduced as a means to explore the global properties resulting from the interactions between the ecophysiology of the <b>reared</b> <b>species</b> and the environment at the ecosystem level. In a second step, an ecosystem model was built to assess the carrying capacity of MarennesOl ´eron bay, the most important shellfish culture site in France, with a standing stock of Crassostrea gigas around 100 000 tonnes fresh weight (FW) and an annual production of 30 000 tonnes FW. The ecosystem model focused on the oyster growth rate and considered the interaction between food availability, residence time of the water, oyster ecophysiology and number of individuals. It included a spatial discretization of the bay (box design) based on a hydrodynamicmodel, and the nitrogen or carbon cycling between phytoplankton, cultured oysters, and detritus. From simulations of the oyster growth with different seeding values, a curve relating the total annual production and the standing stock was obtained. This curve exhibited a dome shape with a maximum production corresponding to an optimum standing stock. The model predicted amaximum annual production of 45 000 tonnes FWfor a standing stock around 115 000 tonnes FW. The prediction confirmed some results obtained empirically in the case of MarennesOl ´eron bay and the results of the theoretical model. Results were compared with those obtained in Carlingford Lough (Ireland) using a similar ecosystem model. Carlingford Lough is a small intertidal bay where the same species is cultured at a reduced scale, with current biomass less than 500 tonnes FW. The model showed that the standing stock can be increased from 200 tonnes FW to approximately 1500 tonnes FW before any decrease of the production...|$|E
40|$|The {{setting up}} of {{effective}} rearing protocols for domestication of new candidate species for aquaculture and/or to enhance quality in widely <b>reared</b> <b>species</b> requires {{the availability of}} appropriate tools to detect patterns of covariation among rearing parameters and fish quality. In this framework, the pattern of occurrence of skeletal anomalies (SAs) in reared lots represents a proxy for quality, since the presence of SAs is associated with both a general lowering of performance and a negative image of aquaculture products in consumers. In this paper we explore the advantages of using Self-Organized Maps (SOMs) when dealing with the analysis of correlations between the pattern of SAs presence and rearing parameters in dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus, Lowe 1834) lots following two different experimental rearing approaches. SOMs were tested because the classic multivariate approach failed to produce meaningful results in the same dataset. A SOM was trained on a dataset containing the mean frequencies of 43 SAs occurring in 20 lots of dusky grouper sampled during three larval rearing cycles carried out in 2001, 2002 and 2004 in Italy, using two rearing approach: Green Water and Large Volume. A series of well-defined patterns were detected in SAs occurrence with respect to body regions. When SOM units were grouped into three clusters, a significant relationship was detected between lot origin (in terms of rearing approach) and SAs occurrence: The Large Volume methodology is to be considered more effective in enhancing the quality of dusky grouper larvae. This finding was independently validated by the superimposition of Hellinger distances obtained from the analysis of meristic counts. Finally, SOM visualized coherent and clear patterns of covariation between SAs occurrence and two crucial aspects or rearing: initial rearing density and final survival rate. We concluded that as a new ordination method SOMs afford effective representations of information gathered from patterns of SAs occurrence in aquaculture lots. Furthermore, SOM appears able to detect subtle but meaningful relationships between quality, as measured by independent descriptors such as SAs and meristic counts, and rearing parameters. It could be useful for quality assessment in both experimental and productive contexts, ultimately helping to {{reduce the incidence of}} SAs in aquaculture products and facilitating the identification of more effective approaches to the domestication of new species...|$|E
