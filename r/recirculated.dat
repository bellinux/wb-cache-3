5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn <b>recirculated</b> the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can {{be picked up by}} people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that <b>recirculated</b> air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.|$|E

Much of the North American production of Arctic char has been within <b>recirculating</b> systems, which can provide more optimum water temperatures for fish growth and can also overcome limitations created {{by a lack of}} high-quality water resources or strict pollution discharge limits. This paper describes some of the developments that have been made in <b>recirculating</b> systems used to produce Arctic char and examines several North American facilities that have used <b>recirculating</b> systems to produce Arctic char.

We discriminated resident from <b>recirculating</b> T cells in human-engrafted mice and lymphoma patients using alemtuzumab, a medication that depletes <b>recirculating</b> T cells from skin, and then analyzed these T cell populations in healthy human skin. All nonrecirculating resident memory T cells (T-RM) expressed CD 69, but most were CD 4 (+), CD 103 (-), and located in the dermis, in contrast to studies in mice. Both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) CD 103 (+) T-RM were enriched in the epidermis, had potent effector functions, and had a limited proliferative capacity compared to CD 103 (-) T-RM. T-RM of both types had more potent effector functions than <b>recirculating</b> T cells. We observed two distinct populations of <b>recirculating</b> T cells, CCR 7 (+) /L-selectin(+) central memory T cells (T-CM) and CCR 7 (+) /L-selectin(-) T cells, which we term migratory memory T cells (T-MM). Circulating skin-tropic T-MM were intermediate in cytokine production between T-CM and effector memory T cells. In patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, malignant T-CM and T-MM induced distinct inflammatory skin lesions, and T-MM were depleted more slowly from skin after alemtuzumab, suggesting that T-MM may <b>recirculate</b> more slowly.

40|$|Abstract: Reactors with fixed {{biocenosis}} {{are most}} commonly applied for fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water treatment, {{as they have}} a number of advantages over other biological purification plants. In actual practice, inefficient plants which generally operate in a single-stage mode are often used. Finer treatment of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water with removal of organic and nitrogen-containing contaminants can be achieved by a multi-stage biological process. Comparative studies of multi-stage treatment of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water by reactors with fixed biocenosis were conducted in order to choose the optimal process flow scheme. The study results determine optimal process flow schemes for fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water treatment in such bioreactors as well as parameters for their operation in the course of bio-oxydation of organic contaminants and ammonium salts and denitrification. The best results were achieved when applying three-stage biological treatment of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water where the oxidizer is configured as a percolating filter and the nitrification filter and the denitrification filter are accomplished in the form of flooded bioreactors. Besides, the oxidizer and the nitrification filter are placed successively in the main water flux to be treated whereas the denitrification filter is installed in a separate zone. The obtained results allow to define reactor volumes for carrying out of nitrification and denitrification in the course of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water treatment.

It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E

The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are <b>recirculated</b> into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle.

25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be <b>recirculated.</b> Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment.
