60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. One day, when I {{was tired}} of {{learning}} to walk forward with some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feet and backwards with others and sideways with the rest all at once, I sat on a rock with my four chins <b>resting</b> on four <b>of</b> <b>my</b> palms, and four or my elbows <b>resting</b> on four <b>of</b> <b>my</b> knees. And suddenly it came into my mind that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was no more me than my statues had been me, {{and that it was}} only an automaton that I had enslaved.|$|R

His daughter Katherine presented a rather different version: his wife had refused to uproot their children {{from their home in}} Bremerton, Washington, to join him in California. Their marriage was by now in terminal difficulties and he chose to stay in California.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} a {{milestone}} for one coach and a millstone for another; {{it was the}} 100th win for Mack Brown at Texas; and it put more pressure on beleaguered Nebraska coach Bill Callahan.

500|$|On March 28, Hinckley {{arrived in}} Washington, D.C. by bus and {{checked into the}} Park Central Hotel.

60|$|I grinned; but Perry {{was quite}} serious about it. It {{had always seemed}} rather more or less of a joke to me that I should be {{addressed}} as majesty and all the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> it. Yet <b>my</b> imperial power and dignity had been a very real thing during my brief reign.|$|R
5000|$|Although Riegel said {{it would}} be [...] "very painful" [...] to watch someone else portray Bianca, and that she would not want to watch, she later tweeted, [...] "My Children gets a new Bianca and shes super pretty!
