40|$|Heterostructures of n-GaNn- 6 H-SiC {{grown by}} hydride {{vapor phase epitaxy}} (HVPE) and molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) are {{characterized}} with the current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) techniques. Using different contact configurations, the I-V results reveal a <b>rectifying</b> <b>barrier</b> in the n-GaNn- 6 H-SiC heterostructures. When GaN is negatively biased, the current is exponentially proportional to the applied voltage with the built-in barrier being 0. 4 - 1. 1 eV for the HVPE samples and 0. 5 eV for the MBE sample. DLTS measurements reveal intense band-like deep level states in the interfacial region of the heterostructure, and the Fermi-level pinning by these deep level defects is invoked {{to account for the}} interfacial <b>rectifying</b> <b>barrier</b> of the heterostructures. © 2005 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to characterize the TCO/p contact and the TCO sheet resistance in a-Si TCO/p-i-n superstrate devices. It is extremely useful for understanding resistance losses in modulus and diagnosing how plasma processing influences the TCO layers. Analysis of 4 -terminal dark J-V measurements {{as a function of}} temperature on devices with varying TCO geometry yields the TCO/p contact resistance RTCO=p, its activation energy Ea or barrier height, and the TCO sheet resistance RSH in an integrated device structure. The method is applied to devices fabricated on dierent brands of commercial SnO 2 substrates with dierent p-layers. Important new results are found. Ea for the SnO 2 =p contact resistance are about 40 - 50 meV which is < 2 kT, and therefore not a <b>rectifying</b> <b>barrier.</b> RSH in one brand of SnO 2 has a benecal decrease of 60 % after a-Si deposition while another brand is unaected.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes to}} use optical rectennae (rectifying antennae) for {{generating}} electricity by harvesting solar energy. Rectennae have theoretical efficiency over 90 %, well above that of current photovoltaic devices. They {{could be built}} by arraying nano- antennae combined with a self-assembled monolayer for DC current rectification. Gold nanoarrays were built to absorb light by plasmonic resonance by depositing a gold layer on CdSe tetrapods or directly growing nanowires via template synthesis; various alkanethiolates were explored as rectifying units. The tunneling properties of alkanethiolates on gold nanoarrays were examined by electrochemical analysis. Preliminary photocurrent tests show that electric currents can be induced at different optical frequencies depending on the aspect ratios of the nanoarrays. However, gold contributes as an enhancement rather than an active material. Furthermore, by fitting the impedance spectroscopy data with equivalent electric circuits, the calculated tunneling barrier of the self-assembled monolayer on gold nanoarrays is ten times lower than on gold film, suggesting that the monolayer formed on gold nanoarrays is defective and cannot serve as a practical <b>rectifying</b> <b>barrier.</b> This concept will need further investigation to lead to an applicable photovoltaic cell...|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} {{feature that}} differentiates the ICL {{from all other}} laser diodes is its provision for electrically-pumped operation without a p-n junction. This is possible because the injectors function as <b>rectifying</b> <b>barriers</b> that keep the current flowing in a single direction. Nevertheless, it is highly advantageous to dope certain layers in each cascade stage {{as a means of}} controlling the active electron and hole densities, via a design technique called “carrier rebalancing.” [...] While the most favorable combination of electron and hole populations depends on the relative strengths of various free carrier absorption and Auger recombination processes, the studies done thus far indicate that the ICL performance is optimal when at threshold the two concentrations are roughly equal. Since the hole population tends to substantially exceed the electron population in undoped or moderately-doped ICLs, carrier rebalancing is achieved by heavily n-doping the electron injector (typically, with Si) so as to add electrons to the active QWs.|$|R

We present a field-effect solar cell using graphene to form a tunable junction barrier with an Earth-abundant and low cost zinc phosphide (Zn_ 3 P_ 2) thin-film light absorber. Adding a semitransparent top electrostatic gate allows for tuning of the graphene Fermi level and hence the energy barrier at the graphene-Zn_ 3 P_ 2 junction, going from an ohmic contact at negative gate voltages to a <b>rectifying</b> <b>barrier</b> at positive gate voltages. We perform current and capacitance measurements at different gate voltages in order to demonstrate {{the control of the}} energy barrier and depletion width in the zinc phosphide. Our photovoltaic measurements show that the efficiency conversion is increased 2 -fold when we increase the gate voltage and the junction barrier to maximize the photovoltaic response. At an optimal gate voltage of + 2 V, we obtain an open-circuit voltage of V_(oc) = 0. 53 V and an efficiency of 1. 9 % under AM 1. 5 1 -sun solar illumination.

50|$|The two {{injector}} {{regions are}} each designed to efficiently transfer its namesake carriers (electrons or holes) from the semimetallic interface to the active region. They must also double as <b>rectifying</b> <b>barriers</b> for the opposite type of carrier {{in order to}} prevent inter-stage leakage currents. The total injector (electron injector plus hole injector) should also be sufficiently thick overall to prevent the electric fields forming under bias from becoming great enough to induce dielectric breakdown of the material. The electron injector is usually made longer because of the relatively fast inter-well scattering rate of electrons compared to that of holes. This ensures a smaller series resistance contribution from the total injector transport. The hole injector is composed of GaSb/AlSb quantum wells. It is made just thick enough (typically with just one or two wells) to ensure effective suppression of electron tunneling from the active region to the electron injector of the next stage. The electron injector typically consists of a longer series of InAs/AlSb quantum wells. To maximize the InAs/AlSb superlattice miniband width, the InAs layer thicknesses are varied across the injector so that their ground state energies nearly align when the device is biased. The quantum well energy gaps in the injector must be large enough to preclude reabsorption of the photons generated by the active quantum wells.|$|R

An excellent fit of experimental data has been achieved using SCEPTRE with an equivalent circuit derived from the shape of the measured current voltage characteristics.

40|$|Although {{the public}} understands that {{participation}} in clinical research is necessary to advance {{the knowledge and skills}} of medical science, the rates of participation have been demonstrated to be trending downwards. Inadequate participation rates can have dramatic scientific and economic effects that ultimately affect the advancement of science. The attitudes and reasons for participation and non-participation in clinical research have been examined by a multitude of researchers. However, willingness to participate research is typically focused on a narrow range of populations, that is those diagnosed with an illness or disease and minority populations. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the demographic and knowledge factors which influence community-dwelling young adults 2 ̆ 7 attitudes, as the future generation of clinical research volunteers, towards willingness to participate in clinical research. Knowing which factors are associated with young adults 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and intention of willingness to participate will be of benefit to those who conduct research by identifying and <b>rectifying</b> <b>barriers</b> to participation. Quantitative data, in the form of a one-time questionnaire administered by a paper and pencil instrument, were collected from a purposive sample of Grade 12 (seniors) students recruited from Iowa public high schools. My findings suggest that knowledge, acquired both by formal education and informal education, was associated with behavioral beliefs and attitudes about clinical research in this sample of students as a precursor to being willing to participate in clinical research. Fewer demographic factors, such as gender, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, were associated with the behavioral beliefs and attitudes measures. This is excellent news to those who conduct research as informational factors may be changed. Aiming interventions at informing young adults about clinical research process and procedures may be of benefit to attitude formation with hopes to impact future enrollment in clinical research.

From current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics of the ITO/c-Si junctions, we found that ITO deposited on 1 -Omega. cm n-type doped silicon forms a <b>rectifying</b> junction with <b>barrier</b> heights varying from 0. 9 to 0. 3 eV, while at room temperature, an ohmic behavior on 1 -Omega. cm p-type c-Si is obtained...|$|R

When chemical vapor deposited graphene is transferred onto n-type Si, GaAs, 4 H-SiC and GaN semiconductor substrates, there is a strong van der Waals attraction that is accompanied by charge transfer across the interface and the formation of a <b>rectifying</b> (Schottky) <b>barrier.</b> Thermionic emission theory in conjunction with the Schottky-Mott model within the context of bond-polarization theory provides a surprisingly good description of the electrical properties. Applications, such as to sensors where in forward bias there is exponential sensitivity to changes in the Schottky barrier height due to the presence of absorbates on the graphene or to analogue devices for which Schottky barriers are integral components are promising because of graphene's mechanical stability, its resistance to diffusion, its robustness at high temperatures and its demonstrated capability to embrace multiple functionalities.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Investigating {{health disparities}} {{requires}} studies designed {{to recruit and}} retain racially and socioeconomically diverse cohorts. It is critical to address the barriers that disproportionately affect participation in clinical research by minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This study sought to identify and <b>rectify</b> these <b>barriers</b> to recruit and retain a biracial (African American and non-Hispanic White) and socioeconomically diverse cohort for a longitudinal study. DESIGN AND METHOD: The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study is a 20 -year longitudinal examination of how race and socioeconomic status influence the development of age-related health disparities. One goal {{was to create a}} multifactorial recruitment and retention strategy. The recruitment paradigm targeted known barriers and identified those unique to the study's urban environment. The retention paradigm mirrored the recruitment plan but was based on specifically developed approaches. RESULTS: This cohort recruitment required attention to developing community partnerships, designing the research study to meet the study hypotheses and to provide benefit to participants, providing a safe community-based site for the research and creating didactics to develop staff cultural proficiency. These efforts facilitated study implementation and enhanced recruitment resulting in accrual of a biracial and socioeconomically diverse cohort of 3, 722 participants. IMPLICATIONS: Recruiting and retaining minority or poor research participants is challenging but possible. The essential facets include clear communication of the research hypothesis, focus on providing a direct benefit for participants, and selection of a hypothesis that is directly relevant to the community studied...|$|R

40|$|The use of Ge in {{semiconductor}} electronics has been {{constrained by the}} lack of a simple method of passivating the crystal surface. Toward that end, we have explored the utility of chemically bonded hydrocarbon monolayers. Alkylated Ge(111) surfaces have been prepared by addition of 1 -alkenes to the H-terminated Ge(111) surface as well as by a two-step halogenation/alkylation procedure. The chemical compositions of the resulting methyl-, ethyl-, and decyl-terminated surfaces have been evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thermal addition of 1 -decene produced hydrophobic surfaces with 0. 3 ± 0. 1 monolayer of Ge oxide detected by XPS, whereas no oxide was observed on the methyl-, ethyl-, or decyl-terminated surfaces that were prepared using the two-step halogenation/alkylation method. Methyl-terminated Ge(111) surfaces prepared by the two-step method displayed a well-resolved C 1 s XPS peak at a binding energy of 284 eV, consistent with carbon bonded to a less electronegative element such as Ge. The electronic properties of all of the alkylated surfaces were characterized by measurements of the surface recombination velocity as a function of an externally applied gate voltage. Treatment of HF-etched Ge(111) surfaces with Br 2 vapor, followed by reaction with alkylmagnesium or alkyllithium reagents, yielded air-stable surfaces that had surface recombination velocities of 100 cm s^(− 1) or less under flat-band conditions. The field-dependent surface recombination velocity experiments indicated that, in contact with air, methyl-terminated n-type Ge(111) samples had a negative surface potential approaching 300 mV, in contrast to the oxidized Ge(111) surface, which exhibited a strongly positive surface potential under the same conditions. Mercury contacts to n-type methyl-, ethyl-, or decyl-terminated Ge(111) substrates that were alkylated using the two-step method formed <b>rectifying</b> junctions with <b>barrier</b> heights of 0. 6 ± 0. 1 eV, whereas no measurable rectification was observed for Hg contacts to p-type Ge(111) substrates that were alkylated by the two-step method, to n-type Ge(111) substrates that were alkylated through addition of 1 -decene, or to oxidized n-type Ge(111) samples...|$|R
40|$|The halogenation/alkylation {{procedure}} {{that has been}} proven to chemically and electrically passivate the Si(111) surface has been adapted for application to Ge(111). Removal of the Ge(111) surface oxide with 6 – 9 M HF(aq), followed by exposure to Br 2 vapor, then alkylmagnesium or alkyllithium reagents yields air stable surfaces with surface recombination velocities (SRVs) as low as 40 cm/sec− 1 at ﬂat-band conditions. Surface charges with a density {{on the order of}} 1012 cm− 2 cause a negative surface potential of almost 300 mV in n-type CH 3 -Ge(111) samples prepared with this method. The oxidized surface shows a strongly positive surface potential in atmospheric conditions. A negative surface potential is also present in CH 3 -Si(111), but the wider bandgap prevents this from causing inversion conditions in extrinsic samples. Ge(111) surfaces alkylated with a larger organic group, such as ethyl or decyl, displayed a weaker surface potential and higher surface recombination velocity as the surface was brought near ﬂat-band. Mercury contacts to alkylated n-type substrates form <b>rectifying</b> junctions with <b>barrier</b> heights of 0. 6 ± 0. 1 eV. Contacts to p-type substrates or to oxidized n-type substrates show no measurable rectiﬁcation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) conﬁrms that the area concentration of surface-bound carbon on CH 3 -Ge(111) surfaces is equal to that of CH 3 -Si(111) surfaces. Other passivation methods were less successful. Every atop Ge atom of an ideal CH 3 -Ge(111) should be capped and the Ge-C bonds should be directed normal to the surface plane. Infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) of methyl-terminated surfaces prepared from HF-etched precursors did not display distinguishable absorption peaks, but if the Ge substrate is ﬁrst treated with an anisotropic etch before the HF etch, IRAS conﬁrms the methyl group orientation with the polarization-dependent “umbrella” mode absorption at 1232 cm− 1 and a polarization-independent rocking mode at 755 cm− 1. Well-ordered CH 3 -Ge(111) surfaces displayed less surface charging while maintaining the low SRVs, indicating that such surfaces are successfully passivated. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. (Education Management) The {{individual}} behaviour of the involved experienced teacher gives {{form and}} direction {{to the practice}} of teaching and education. The improvement of the school's effectiveness can be the consequence of the dedication and enthusiasm of involved experienced teachers. By developing highly motivated involved experienced teachers, the educational leader creates the potential for effective teaching and the improvement of school efficiency. Education leaders should regard their motivational task as a high priority. From the research material it is clear that there is a large variety of problems facing the uninvolved experienced teacher. These problems differ in degree and scope. For every separate problem area specific solutions will have to be found. In order to find sensible solutions for these problems. " it is desirable to group them together in separate areas or categories. From a wide variety of problems, it is possible to isolate the following areas or categories, viz: + discontent with aspects of management + adaptation to the school environment, and + limited promotional opportunities Although not all uninvolved experienced teachers experience the same problems, there are, however, problems that are common to them all. Communication is one such problem that could bring about major change. Communication is a way of Iiving and forms an integral part of one's existence. It forms the basis of the establishment, maintenance and improvement of human relations. Due to the educational leader's managerial function, manifold opportunities arise for effective communication, which are enhanced by his qualities, such as leadership, guidance, the ability to organise, to be decisive and to exercise discipline. The school climate, human relations and the management style within a school constitute the basic requirements for a particular mode of communication. The educational leader should always endeavour to communicate effectively in order to prevent and <b>rectify</b> communication <b>barriers.</b> xii In order to allow the educational leader to formulate a sensible motivation strategy it is necessary for him to be aware of and get an overall picture of the multiplicity of existing theories of motivation. Each theory, in its own way, gives expression to the nature of human needs and motives as forces governing motivation. At the same time it is an indication of the human personality and these theories allow educational leaders to: + improve the uninvolved experience teacher's attendance, quality of work, and personal involvement + bring about the acceptance of responsibility without the use of threats, and + turn traditional practises into innovative teaching methods. It would be unrealistic to think that a perfect approach to motivation could ever be achieved. The educational leader must, of necessity, apply motivation in a specific situation, adapting the motivational strategy to suit each individual, depending on his needs in changing circumstances. A positive school climate is of particular importance if the pupils are to achieve maturity and teachers are to enjoy job satisfaction. The success of motivation as a managerial skill applied by the educational leader depends on the efficiency of the execution of his other managerial activities. This efficiency can be achieved by training during which the educational leader becomes more skilled in dealing with the key elements of the task of motivation, viz: + the importance of school climate in the development of highly motivated uninvolved experienced teachers, and + the effect of different leadership styles on the motivation of the uninvolved experienced teacher. The creation of the so-called ideal or positive school climate should form part of the educational leader's managerial strategy. In this regard the leadership style of the educational leader is of paramount importance {{in the creation of a}} positive school climate in order to encourage motivated behaviour of the uninvolved experienced teacher...|$|R
