6000|$|... "Often. When {{you meet}} the snow on the frozen trail, a hundred miles from shelter, mind and body shrink. Perhaps it's worse when all that stands for warmth and life is loaded on the hand-sledge you haul across the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice.</b> Then it's {{significant}} that the Metis are sometimes more afraid than white men. They know the country better." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the adaptation of}} a Bayesian sea ice detection algorithm for the scatterometer on-board the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites (ERS- 1 and ERS- 2). The algorithm is based on statistics of distances to ocean wind and sea ice geophysical model functions (GMFs) and its performance is validated against coincident active and passive microwave data. We furthermore propose a new model for sea ice backscatter at the C-band in vertical polarization based on the sea ice GMFs derived from ERS and advanced scatterometer data. The model characterizes the dependence of sea ice backscatter on the incidence angle and the sea ice type, allowing a more precise incidence angle correction than afforded by the usual linear transformation. The resulting agreement between the ERS, QuikSCAT, and special sensor microwave imager sea ice extents during the year 2000 is high during {{the fall and winter}} seasons, with an estimated ice edge accuracy of about 20 km, but shows persistent biases between scatterometer and radiometer extents during the melting period, with scatterometers being more sensitive to summer (lower concentration and <b>rotten)</b> sea <b>ice</b> types...|$|R
60|$|Gilbert {{laid down}} the {{ponderous}} medical tome over {{which he had been}} poring until the increasing dusk of the March evening made him desist. He {{leaned back in his chair}} and gazed meditatively out of the window. It was early spring--probably the ugliest time of the year. Not even the sunset could redeem the dead, sodden landscape and <b>rotten</b> black harbor <b>ice</b> upon which he looked. No sign of life was visible, save a big black crow winging his solitary way across a leaden field. Gilbert speculated idly concerning that crow. Was he a family crow, with a black but comely crow wife awaiting him in the woods beyond the Glen? Or was he a glossy young buck of a crow on courting thoughts intent? Or was he a cynical bachelor crow, believing that he travels the fastest who travels alone? Whatever he was, he soon disappeared in congenial gloom and Gilbert turned to the cheerier view indoors.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have grit," [...] Jim said, smiling. [...] "Grit {{that would}} carry you {{anywhere}} and makes you something of an aristocrat. So long as you're not afraid you must be fine. Well, I suppose I made good when I was up against <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> and sliding snow, but when I think about what I have and what I'd risk, my pluck goes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They told us {{up above}} {{that the bottom}} was {{dropping}} out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over," [...] Hal said in response to Thornton's warning to take no more chances on the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice.</b> [...] "They told us we couldn't make White River, and here we are." [...] This last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.|$|E
60|$|As they {{descended to}} the lower level of the Pass, the solid ice gave way to <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> and slush, in which they {{frequently}} sank to their ankles. Here the stream broadened out into several ponds, and finally ended in a wide, marshy expanse, forming {{the upper end of}} Lake Linderman. Along the edge of this marsh they picked their way, first, however, stopping for dinner, for the night had passed and the forenoon had been consumed in the journey from Crater Lake. The Indians kept pressing on, and they followed.|$|E
60|$|Raging blizzards, snowslides, crevassed glaciers and <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> {{were things}} he knew; there were {{scars on his}} body he had got in {{stubborn}} fights. So far he had conquered; but he owned {{that he had had}} enough, and tried to picture the Old Country his father talked about. Its woods were not primitive jungles, wrecked by gales and scorched by fires; men planted and tended them and the trees had room to grow. White farmsteads with gardens and orchards dotted the valleys; the narrow fields were rich with grass and corn. Then there were wonderful old houses, stored with treasures of art.|$|E
60|$|He {{had made}} a long and risky journey over a rough trail and across <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> and after George's {{messenger}} found him had pushed on {{as fast as possible}} through deep, melting snow, but he did not mean to talk about this. By and by he gave Agatha a humorous account of a small accident at the mine, and she followed his lead. She had felt disturbed and anxious, but now he had come she could smile. For all that she was silent when they drove up a shabby street where the company's office was situated at the top of an old building.|$|E
60|$|He {{was asleep}} in another ten minutes, but Seaforth lay awake {{shivering}} under his clammy blankets most of the night, and rose aching when he heard his comrade's voice through the patter of the rain in the misty darkness of the early morning. They made four miles that day, and floundered waist-deep in water amidst the boulders during most of it. The hillsides above them were steep and almost unclimbable, and no man could have driven a canoe upstream amidst the grinding ice-cake which cumbered the river, that was frozen still in its slower reaches. There they found better travelling through the slush that covered the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> but those reaches were few and short, and {{they went back to}} the boulders when the swollen river burst its bonds again.|$|E
60|$|Laurie had {{vanished}} round the bend, Jo was {{just at the}} turn, and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice {{in the middle of}} the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a sudden crash of <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out...|$|E
6000|$|Dawson, always {{eager for}} news, beheld Montana Kid's sled {{heading down the}} Yukon, and {{went out on the}} ice to meet him. No, he hadn't any newspapers; didn't know whether Durrant was hanged yet, nor who had won the Thanksgiving game; hadn't heard whether the United States and Spain had gone to fighting; didn't know who Dreyfus was; but O'Brien? Hadn't they heard? O'Brien, why, he was drowned in the White Horse; Sitka Charley {{the only one of the}} party who escaped. Joe Ladue? Both legs frozen and amputated at the Five Fingers. And Jack Dalton? Blown up on the [...] "Sea Lion" [...] with all hands. And Bettles? Wrecked on the [...] "Carthagina," [...] in Seymour Narrows,--twenty {{survivors}} out of three hundred. And Swiftwater Bill? Gone through the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> of Lake LeBarge with six female members of the opera troupe he was convoying. Governor Walsh? Lost with all hands and eight sleds on the Thirty Mile. Devereaux? Who was Devereaux? Oh, the courier! Shot by Indians on Lake Marsh.|$|E
60|$|But by May, {{spring was}} so far {{advanced}} that travel on the creeks became perilous, and on {{the last of the}} thawing ice the miners travelled down to the bunch of islands below the mouth of the Stewart, where they went into temporary quarters or crowded the hospitality of those who possessed cabins. Corliss and Bishop located on Split-up Island (so called through the habit parties from the Outside had of dividing there and going several ways), where Tommy McPherson was comfortably situated. A couple of days later, Jacob Welse and Frona arrived from a hazardous trip out of White River, and pitched tent on the high ground at the upper end of Split-up. A few chechaquos, the first of the spring rush, strung in exhausted and went into camp against the breaking of the river. Also, there were still men going out who, barred by the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> came ashore to build poling-boats and await the break-up or to negotiate with the residents for canoes. Notably among these was the Baron Courbertin.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the first}} time Buck had failed, in itself a {{sufficient}} reason to drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club. Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, he had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of impending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank, and it had not departed from him. What of the thin and <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so far gone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they continued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly out. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great distance, he was aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him. He no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body. But it was no longer his body, it seemed so far away.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Rupert heard a loud squeal of fear, and saw a dark spot {{blotting}} the smoothness of the lake’s frozen surface. The Sheep was struggling helplessly in an ice-hole of his own making. Rupert gave one loud curse, and then dashed full tilt for the shore; outside a low stable building on the lake’s edge he remembered having seen a ladder. If he could slide it across the ice-hole before the Sheep went under the rescue would be comparatively simple work. Other skaters were dashing up from a distance, and, with the ladder’s help, they could {{get him out of}} his death-trap without having to trust themselves on the margin of <b>rotten</b> <b>ice.</b> Rupert sprang on to the surface of lumpy, frozen snow, and staggered to where the ladder lay. He had already lifted it when the rattle of a chain and a furious outburst of growls burst on his hearing, and he was dashed to the ground by a mass of white and tawny fur. A sturdy young yard-dog, frantic with the pleasure of performing his first piece of active guardian service, was ramping and snarling over him, rendering the task of regaining his feet or securing the ladder a matter of considerable difficulty. When he had at last succeeded in both efforts he was just by a hair’s-breadth too late to be of any use. The Sheep had definitely disappeared under the ice-rift.|$|E
60|$|The mound, or {{barrier of}} lava and scoriæ that {{composed}} the outer wall of this crater, was almost mathematically circular. Its inner precipice was {{in most places}} absolutely perpendicular, though overhanging in a few; there being but two or three spots where an active man could descend in safety. The area within might contain a hundred acres while the wall preserved a very even height of about sixty feet, falling a little below this at the leeward side, where there existed one narrow hole, or passage, on a level with {{the bottom of the}} crater; a sort of gateway, by which to enter and quit the cavity. This passage had no doubt been formed by the exit of lava, which centuries ago had doubtless broken through at this point, and contributed to form the visible reef beyond. The height of this hole was some twenty feet, having an arch above it, and its width may have been thirty. When Mark got to it, which he did by descending the wall of the crater, not without risk to his neck, he found the surface of the crater very even and unbroken, with the exception of its having a slight descent from its eastern to its western side; or from the side opposite to the outlet, or gateway, to the gateway itself. This inclination Mark fancied was owing to the circumstance that the water of the ocean had formerly entered at the hole, in uncommonly high tides and tempests, and washed the ashes which had once formed the bottom of the crater, towards the remote parts of the plain. These ashes had been converted by time into a soft, or friable rock, composing a stone that is called tufa. If there had ever been a cone in the crater, as was probably the case, it had totally disappeared under the action of time and the wear of the seasons. Rock, however, the bed of the crater could scarcely be yet considered, though it had a crust which bore the weight of a man very readily, in nearly every part of it. Once or twice Mark broke through, as one would fall through <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> when he found his shoes covered with a light dust that much resembled ashes. In other places he broke this crust on purpose, always finding beneath it a considerable depth of ashes, mingled with some shells, and a few small stones.|$|E

50|$|Hidden {{changes in}} the ice cover of the Beaufort Sea were {{discovered}} in 2009. Whereas the ice area remain stable, as detected by the observation satellites, so as the associated water temperature and salinity, the ice structure has changed recently. The new ice, called <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> is thinner and much weaker structurally.|$|E
50|$|The east {{buttress}} on {{the southwest}} face, known also as Fowler-Watts route was climbed on the 26 May 1982 and since has defeated many competent parties. It is a serious undertaking on mixed ground, steep sections of rock (difficulty UIAA V+) with key passages at A3+ and vertical <b>rotten</b> <b>ice.</b> A variation of the Fowler-Watts route is the Sykes-Clay, climbed on 10 July 1989 and rarely repeated since.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotten</b> <b>ice</b> is a loose {{term for}} ice that is melting, disintegrating, or {{otherwise}} formed, having water, air, or contaminants between ice grains, causing the ice to be honeycombed. It forms on open water, when snowpack and ice are mixed together and other conditions. It may be transparent, {{causing it to}} look like new black ice. Though it may appear strong, <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> is weak — even several feet thick may not hold a person's weight (although it may hold a dog sled's weight). On land, it is difficult or impossible to climb. It melts more quickly than solid ice. Candle ice {{is a form of}} rotten ice.One way to tell that ice is rotting would be the grey, splotchy color. Also, the thickness of ice cannot determine how safe it is, because water from underneath the ice can erode the ice and cause it to be thinner without a sign on the surface. Even thick ice may be weak, especially if it has frozen and thawed repeatedly or if it contains layers of snow. Minerals in the water make vertical veins in the ice. These veins melt much faster {{than the rest of the}} ice causing vertical channels and the ice to weaken along those channels. Many people tend to question if snow actually warms up ice, making it more likely to crack and break, or if snow actually causes ice to freeze faster. Snow will actually act like an insulating blanket. The ice under the snow will be thinner and weaker. A new snowfall can also warm-up and melt existing ice. <b>Rotten</b> <b>ice</b> is becoming more commonly found in the Beaufort Sea, near Alaska, due to different climate changes. This is concerning, because it is a sign that the amount of multiyear ice is declining, and it is being replaced with heavily decayed ice.|$|E
40|$|Meltponds on Arctic sea ice have {{previously}} {{been reported to}} be devoid of marine metazoans due to fresh-water conditions. The predominantly dark frequently also green and brownish meltponds observed in the Central Arctic in summer 2007 hinted to brackish conditions and considerable amounts of algae, possibly making the habitat suitable for marine metazoans. Environmental conditions in meltponds as well as sympagic meiofauna in new ice covering pond surfaces and in <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> on the bottom of ponds were studied, applying modified techniques from sea-ice and under-ice research. Due to the very porous structure of the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> the meltponds were usually brackish to saline, providing living conditions very similar to sub-ice water. The new ice cover on the surface had similar characteristics as the bottom layer of level ice. The ponds were thus accessible to and inhabitable by metazoans. The new ice cover and the <b>rotten</b> <b>ice</b> were inhabited by various sympagic meiofauna taxa, predominantly ciliates, rotifers, acoels, nematodes and foraminiferans. Also, sympagic amphipods were found on the bottom of meltponds. We suggest that, in consequence of global warming, brackish and saline meltponds are becoming more frequent in the Arctic, providing a new habitat to marine metazoans...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and dark nilas, fast ice, icefoot, ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, thaw holes, <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> ice islands, dried ice puddles, hummocked ice, and leads...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Sea ice is detectable {{in all of}} the ERTS- 1 MSS bands and can be distinguished from clouds through a number of interpretive keys. Considerable information on ice type can be derived from the ERTS- 1 data. Ice types that appear to be identifiable include: ice floes of various categories, pack ice of various concentrations, ice belts, brash ice, <b>rotten</b> <b>ice,</b> fast ice, leads, fractures, cracks, puddles, thaw holes, and flooded ice. Although larger icebergs can be seen, it is difficult to distinguish them from ice floes. Ice features as small as the small floe of 20 to 100 m across can be detected, and the sizes of features somewhat smaller than 100 m can be measured from enlarged ERTS- 1 prints. The multispectral analysis of the ERTS- 1 MSS- 7 bands provides much information on ice type and ice surface features that cannot be derived from a single spectral band. For example, thaw holes can often be distinguished from puddles because of their different appearances in the two bands. These surface features can be indicative of ice age. Furthermore, snow lines on glaciers can be reliably mapped through the joint use of the MSS- 4 and 7 data...|$|E
