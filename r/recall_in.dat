5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> order {{to vote for a}} {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions to be on the ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> order to vote for a replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{played in}} Scotland's {{run in the}} 1989 FIFA U-16 World Championship, where he scored in the final, but went on to miss in the penalty {{shoot-out}} as Scotland lost to Saudi Arabia. He made his senior international debut on 7 October 2000, coming on as a substitute in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino. He made two further substitute appearances that year, against Croatia and Australia. Limited first-team opportunities at club level then meant Dickov was not selected for international duty for another two years. Good form at Leicester earned him a <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> September 2002. He made his first international start against the Faroe Islands. However, playing out of position on the wing, he was substituted at half-time as the faltering Scotland team drew 2–2 against a nation 62 places lower in the world rankings. In the return fixture a year later, Dickov scored his first international goal in a 3–1 win. His last cap came in a 1–0 defeat against Norway in October 2004. In total, Dickov earned ten Scotland caps and scored one goal.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{overlooked}} for {{selection for}} entirety of the 1955–56 season. After four {{years out of}} first-class cricket, Harvey earned a <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> {{the latter half of}} the 1958–59 season for a match against Queensland. He made only 21 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 17 when time ran out in the second innings. He was retained for the match against South Australia the following week and scored 97 in an innings win. In the subsequent fixture against New South Wales, who were in the process of completing a sixth consecutive Shield title, Harvey faced a full-strength team with Australia's two leading Test bowlers Benaud and Davidson. He made 86 in the first innings but managed only 6 in the second before being removed by Benaud, as the Victorians ended 37 runs short of victory with five wickets in hand when time ran out. Harvey made six in his only innings in the last match of the season against Queensland. He ended the season with 233 runs at 46.60.|$|E

5|$|In 1959–60, the Test team {{toured the}} Indian subcontinent during the Australian summer, opening up more {{vacancies}} in the Sheffield Shield. Harvey {{was given a}} <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> December 1959. However, he was not successful and failed to convert his starts into substantial scores, making 8, 36, 12, 25, 22 and 20 in three matches. In the last of these matches, he took his career-best bowling figures of 3/26, in the first innings against South Australia. He dismissed the top-scorer John Lill for 176 and his other victims were Michael Clingly and Peter Trethewey. This allowed Victoria to take first innings points and eventually complete a six-wicket win. This meant that all of Harvey's five wickets as first-class level came against South Australia. Harvey's first-class career ended with the following match against New South Wales. He made 1 and 9, and conceded 26 runs from three wicketless overs, and was dropped, having made only 133 runs at 16.62 for the season.|$|E
5|$|Kartik then {{played in}} one Test against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe {{respectively}} in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, {{and did not have}} an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance to stake his claims for a Test <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
5|$|On 24–25 July, Republican forces {{launched}} {{the last major}} offensive of the war, the Battle of the Ebro. Reconnaissance units of the Condor Legion had noticed a troop build-up, and warned Nationalists forces. The warning went unheeded. Although the Republic gained ground, Republican forces failed {{to gain control of}} Gandesa, with 422 sorties by the Legion having considerable effect. However, tensions in Czechoslovakia and a shortage of pilots in Germany led to the return of 250 pilots from the Legion. Although trained Spaniards made up some of the shortfall, Volkmann complained to central command in Berlin, which led to his <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> September. During the battle, which saw 113 days of fighting, only 10 aircraft were lost (some by accident); the Legion claimed around 100 Republican aircraft. Only five aircrew had been killed, and six captured. Aid from Germany temporarily halted in mid-September. Germany and Nationalist Spain settled the issue of German interests in Spanish mines.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–November 1933. While in the Mediterranean, Diana was commanded by Geoffrey Oliver for a time. The ship was refitted at Sheerness Dockyard between 3 September and 23 October 1934 for service on the China Station with the 8th (later the 21st) Destroyer Flotilla and arrived there in January 1935. She {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in the Red Sea from September 1935 to May 1936 during the Abyssinian Crisis and made port visits in Bombay and East Africa before returning to Hong Kong on 7 August. On one occasion in 1937 Diana investigated why a lighthouse near Amoy was not lit and discovered that it had been attacked by pirates. She remained in the Far East until the rise in tensions before World War II began prompted her <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> August 1939.|$|E

The ship was refitted there in October and toured Southeast Asia {{in the first quarter of}} 1937. Decoy required further repairs and fumigation in April–May after her return. In August 1938 she sailed for Tsingtao, carrying representatives to apologise for incidents where drunken sailors had insulted the Japanese flag. She remained in the Far East until the rise in tensions before World War II began prompted her <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> August 1939.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, Kerala was a {{relatively}} unknown destination compared to other states in the country. In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism an important industry {{and it was the}} first state in India to do so. Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, the government agency that oversees the tourism prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the tourism industry. Many advertisements branded Kerala with the tagline Kerala, God's Own Country. Kerala tourism is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest <b>recall.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, Kerala attracted 8.5million tourists, an increase of 23.68% over the previous year, making the state one of the fastest-growing popular destinations in the world. In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million mark.|$|E

5|$|With Arundel's {{change of}} {{allegiance}} came {{a conflict of}} interest. In August 1321, a demand was made to the king that Hugh Despenser and his father, Hugh Despenser the elder, be sent into exile. The king, facing a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, {{had no choice but}} to assent. Arundel voted for the expulsion, but later he claimed that he did so under compulsion, and also supported their <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> December. Arundel had suffered personally from the rebellion, when Roger Mortimer seized his castle of Clun. Early in 1322, Arundel joined King Edward in a campaign against the Mortimer family. The opposition soon crumbled, and the king decided to move against Thomas of Lancaster, who had been supporting the marcher rebellion all along. Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March, and executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of sweet-tasting but toxic diethylene glycol in Chinese-made toothpaste {{led to a}} <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> 2007 involving multiple toothpaste brands in several nations. The world outcry made Chinese officials ban the practice of using diethylene glycol in toothpaste.|$|E
