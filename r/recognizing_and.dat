5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home is {{assisting}} in research towards preventing some viruses, such as influenza and HIV, from <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> entering biological cells. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme RNase H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.|$|E
5|$|While {{the concept}} of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the {{emerging}} popularity of the locavore movement and farmer's markets. Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups. During World Food Day in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in The Tyee, the Vancouver City Hall held a 100-mile themed breakfast. Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges. Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet, or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province. A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> encouraging local food markets.|$|E

25|$|The form of {{reasoning}} used in common law {{is known as}} casuistry or case-based reasoning.

The type of procedure practiced in common law courts is known as the adversarial system; this is also a development of the common law.|$|E
25|$|The World Englishes initiative, in <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> {{describing}} the New Englishes of the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, has been partly {{motivated by a}} consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by {{a consideration of the}} wider cultural and political contexts of language acquisition and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of pluralism and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.|$|E

25|$|Auditory {{processing}} disorder (APD), {{also known}} as central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), is an umbrella term {{for a variety of}} disorders that affect the way the brain processes auditory information. Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear {{in the same way as}} others do, which leads to difficulties in <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech.

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Congressional {{delegation}} of the State of Hawaiʻi introduced the Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition Bill, beginning {{the process of}} <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> forming a Native Hawaiian government entity to negotiate with state and federal governments. The significance of the bill {{is that it would}} establish, {{for the first time in}} the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).|$|E
25|$|According to Lewis, this {{reduction}} {{resulted in}} Arabs who wanted slaves having {{to look elsewhere}} to avoid the restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands, primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll. Patrick Manning states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian Peninsula {{and to a lesser}} degree for the whole area of the whole Umayyad Caliphate where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that {{with the passage of time}} and the extension of Islam, Islam by <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} {{argue that}} humans dream {{for the same}} reason other amniotes do. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness. In 2000 Antti Revonsuo, a professor at the University of Turku in Finland, claimed that centuries ago dreams would prepare humans for <b>recognizing</b> <b>and</b> avoiding danger by presenting a simulation of threatening events. The theory has therefore been called the threat-simulation theory. According to Tsoukalas (2012) dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by encounters with predators, a fact that is still evident in the control mechanisms of REM sleep (see below).|$|E
