40|$|Four {{species of}} Stenchaetothrips are here {{recorded}} from Peninsular Malaysia. These are S. biformis, the widespread <b>rice</b> <b>thrips,</b> S. hullikali, known only from Karnataka in Southwest India, S. indicus, a widespread species on grasses, and S. langkawiensis sp. nov., described here from Langkawi Island, West Malaysia.

40|$|The major {{insect pests}} of rice crop {{encountered}} in northeastern {{part of the}} Uttar Pradesh are: (a) Root feeders such as termites, mole cricket, rice root weevil and rice water weevil; (b) Stem borers that include yellow stem borer [Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) ], white stem borer [Scirpophaga innotata (Walker) ], striped stem borer [Chilo suppressalis (Walker) ], dark headed stem borer [Chilo polychrysus (Meyrick) ], pink stem borer [Sesamia inferens (Walker) ], (c) Leafhoppers and plant hoppers such as: white rice leafhopper (Cofana spectra Distant), brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal), whitebacked planthopper [Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) ]. the green planthopper [Nephotettix nigropictus (Stat.) ], Nephotettix virescens (Distant), leafhopper (Pyrilla perpusilla Walker), (d) Defoliators such as swarming caterpillar or armyworm [Spodoptera mauritia (Boisduval) ], oriental armyworm [Mythimna separata (Walker) ], rice grasshopper [Hieroglyphus banian (Fabr.) ], (e) Grain suckers such as rice earhead bug (Leptocorisa acuta Thunberg), and (f) other pests such as rice gall midge [Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason) ], the rice leaf folders [Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee), Marasmia patnalis Bradley, Marasmia exigua (Butler) ], the grain aphid [Hysteroneura setariae (Thomas) ], pentatomid bug [Nezara viridula (Linn.) ], rice mealy bug [Brevennia rehi (Lind.) ], rice hispa [Dicladispa armigera (Oliver) ], <b>rice</b> <b>thrips</b> [Stenchaetothrips biformis (Bagnall) ], rice caseworm [Nymphula depunctalis (Guenee) ], whorl maggot flies [Hydrellia philippina Ferino], zigzag leafhopper [Recilia (Inazuma) dorsalis (Motschulsky) ] and the common cutworm [Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) ]...|$|E
40|$|Nontarget {{impacts of}} six {{transgenic}} Bt rice lines (expressing the Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ab/Cry 1 Ac protein) on the thrips, Stenchaetothrips biformis (Bagnall), attacking the rice seedling and tillering stages, were evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. Laboratory results showed relatively longer larval, pupal development and preoviposition durations of S. biformis. Although {{it had a}} shorter oviposition period, female adult longevity and less total laid eggs were found when fed on some tested Bt rice in comparison to non-Bt controls. S. biformis population dynamics in Bt and non-Bt plots were monitored using the plastic bag and beat plate methods. In the field, the temporal patterns of S. biformis population changes were similar between tested Bt rice lines and their respective control; however, {{the total number of}} S. biformis individuals collected from the Bt plots were significantly less or the same, varying from variety to variety, compared with those from the non-Bt plots. ELISA results showed that the Bt insecticidal protein could be transferred from Bt <b>rice</b> to the <b>thrips,</b> and the concentrations of the protein in <b>rice</b> leaves and <b>thrips</b> were not significantly correlated with some important biological parameters of the thrip. In addition, the potential effects of Bt rice on the abundance of S. biformis candidate predators are also discussed. In conclusion, our results show that the six Bt rice lines assessed may be less preferable host plants to S. biformis at the individual and population levels in comparison to the non-Bt rice plant...|$|R
40|$|The FAO-IPM {{programme}} {{is based}} on anew understanding of rice field ecol-ogy. Experience in many countries has shown that insecticides actually cause more pests, and {{there is now a}} better understanding of the importance of beneficial insects and spiders in the rice ecosystem. Research has shown that the use of insecticides early in the season destroys the detritivore and plankton feed-ing insect populations which are the first food source for generalist predators such as spiders. A lack of generalist predators leaves the crop more vulnerable to pest population increases later in the season. Four Principles of IPM There are four principles central to IPM. First, to encourage the growth of healthy crops and to stimulate farmers to use the best possible agricultural practices. Second, FFSs should emphasise the impor-tance of conserving beneficials: pesticides should only be used as a last resort. Third, crops should be observed every week and farmers should be guided in this during training sessions designed to improve their skills. Finally, farmers should become experts, their training empowering them to make crop protection decisions responsive to the needs of their crops. Farmers need to know which pests, dis-eases and animals are beneficial. In rice fields, beneficial species tend to outnumber pest species by about two or three to one. Farmers should also be able to identify neu-trals- insects that are neither pests nor ben-eficials. Above all, they must be able to identify all these agro-ecosystem elements in their fields- not only on a classroom chart. The agro-ecosystem of all crops changes in the course of the cropping season. In Sichuan, for example, very few stemborers are found early in the <b>rice</b> season, whereas <b>thrips</b> abound at this time. The proportion of these two pests changes as the rice grows. Parasitic wasps (beneficials killing leaf-eating caterpillars) are scarce early in the season, but become numerous in the second half. In the FFS, farmers acquire the skills needed to observe these changes as they occur from week to week. This model was first used to train farmers in China in 1994. Twenty-five farmers wh...|$|R
