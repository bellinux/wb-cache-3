30|$|In a {{practical}} aspect, a promising application of amorphous Ti-Cu-based alloys is brazing filler materials [25 – 27]. Owing to their flexibility and ductility, thin amorphous ribbons offer a convenient way of placing an alloy {{of a certain}} composition between the parts to be joined. Ti-Cu-based amorphous alloys are attractive brazing fillers with titanium {{playing the role of}} an active component capable of chemically reacting with the material of the brazed parts. When <b>resistance</b> <b>brazing</b> is conducted, the heat can be delivered locally to a well-defined region using electrical pulses. The crystallization behavior of the Ti-Cu alloys under electrical pulsing should be taken into account during selection of the brazing parameters. Joule heating of metallic glasses can be used for connecting and shaping purposes at temperatures within the supercooled liquid region of the glass [28]. If pulsed current is applied in such processes, a possibility of crystallization occurring locally needs to be considered as the presence of crystallization products can deteriorate the quality of the joint and its mechanical strength.|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{aluminum}} graphite composites have unique {{thermal properties}} due to opposing coefficients of thermal expansion of aluminum and graphite. The thermal and mechanical properties of such composites are anisotropic due to directional properties of graphite fibers and their designed orientation. A joint with different fiber orientations would theoretically produce an isotropic material for thermal management. This paper presents results for welding and brazing of the composite using different joining techniques. Laser welding of Al-Gr composite {{showed that a}} power density above 30 kW/mm 2 gives a weld with microstructure defects. Also the laser beam melts the matrix and delaminates the graphite fibers. The molten aluminum reacts with graphite to form aluminum carbide (Al 4 C 3). The joint strength is compromised when laser welding at optimal conditions to minimize the carbide formation. Also porosity and redistribution of graphite fibers is seen during laser welding. These defects prompt us to consider a low temperature joining. Brazing is considered since the low melting temperature of a filler material suppresses the formation of Al 4 C 3 while minimizing pores and microstructural defects in the joint. Microstructural study and shear test are performed to analyze the joints. Shear strengths of brazed joints are determined to be 20 - 21 MPa which {{is comparable to the}} composite shear strength (46. 5 MPa in x-y plane and 19 MPa in z plane). The fracture surface is found to be mostly on the composite rather than in brazed material or along the interface. Also, the microstructural study showed no Al 4 C 3 formation and minimal porosity in the brazed region. These results show a successful joining of the composite using laser brazing and <b>resistance</b> <b>brazing</b> methods...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the study of a new {{aluminum}} brazing process, called Galluminium. This technique, consisting in using gallium as a solder, is advantageous since it enables to braze at ambient air without flux. Indeed if the gallium coating is done mechanically, it descales the alumina layer and acts as a barrier against further reoxidation. Nevertheless, liquid gallium causes a severe aluminum embrittlement since it penetrates into the aluminum grain boundaries. We will show in this paper that this phenomenon has only a little impact on the mechanical <b>resistance</b> of the <b>brazed</b> joints since the amount of deposited gallium is enough low to avoid a severe embrittlement and the heat treatment (from 200 degrees C to 600 degrees C during several minutes) during brazing process dissolves gallium in the bulk...|$|R
40|$|A joining process, {{designated}} weld-brazing, {{was developed}} which combines {{resistance spot welding}} and <b>brazing.</b> <b>Resistance</b> spot welding is used to position and aline the parts, {{as well as to}} establish a suitable faying-surface gap for brazing. Fabrication is then completed at elevated temperature by capillary flow of the braze alloy into the joint. The process was used successfully to fabricate Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy joints by using 3003 aluminum braze alloy and should be applicable to other metal-braze systems. Test results obtained on single-overlap and hat-stiffened panel specimens show that weld-brazed joints were superior in tensile shear, stress rupture, fatigue, and buckling compared with joints fabricated by conventional means. Another attractive feature of the process is that the brazed joint is hermetically sealed by the braze material, which may eliminate many of the sealing problems encountered with riveted or spot welded structures. The relative ease of fabrication associated with the weld-brazing process may make it cost effective over conventional joining techniques...|$|R
40|$|Components made of {{high-performance}} ceramics or superalloys {{are subject}} to strict requirements {{with regard to their}} geometric and dimensional accuracy. The surface finish and edge zone characteristics have a large effect on the component's performance. These requirements can not be met directly by the sintering process used in the manufacture of ceramic materials or traditional casting of superalloys. Grinding is both technically and economically the number one choice when one has to consider machining these materials. Metal Single Layer (MSL) grinding technology provides an alternative way {{to make use of the}} superabrasives, diamond and CBN, in grinding these materials. One of the primary challenges in MSL grinding technology is to develop suitable active braze alloy(s) which can bond the superabrasive grits. Ticusil (Ag-Cu eutectic+ 4. 5 wt% Ti) and 70 Cu- 21 Sn- 9 Ti (wt%) are two of the currently used active braze alloys. The primary failure mode of these two MSL wheels in the grinding test is transverse fracture and debonding of the diamond grits. The high applied load is responsible for transverse fracture of the diamond grit, and the intermetallic phase existing at the interface between the diamond and the braze alloy is one of the causes of the debonding of the diamond grits. Also, a finite element analysis shows that most of the residual thermal stresses and the thermal mismatch strains are localized at the diamond/braze alloy interface. This results in potential weakness of this area. Moreover, the inherent defects, such as voids, and the brittle intermetallics in the interface can cause crack initiation and propagation. Both deteriorate the life of the grinding wheel. The failure of the braze alloy can be divided into two categories. If the grinding process is very abrasive, such as green concrete grinding, the wear <b>resistance</b> of the <b>braze</b> dominates the fracture of the braze alloy. On the other hand, failure of the braze alloy can also result from cracks at the interface. In such a case, the fatigue <b>resistance</b> of the <b>braze</b> alloy plays an important role in determining the wheel's life. The wear <b>resistance</b> of the <b>braze</b> alloy can be improved by introducing suitable hard particles. It was found that a braze alloy of 77 Cu- 23 Sn- 12. 5 Ti- 7. 5 Zr- 10 TiC- 0. 2 C (by weight) exhibits excellent performance in a wear test (a ten fold improvement), which is further confirmed in the grinding test (a two fold increase in life). The fatigue resistance of the active braze alloy can be modified by either reducing the volume fraction of the brittle intermetallic phase in the braze and/or enhancing the ductility of the braze alloy matrix. A ductile active braze alloy can be achieved by combining the two-layer structure and two step brazing process. To aid dissolution and diffusion of the Cu atoms into the Cu/Sn/Ti braze alloy, a lower volume fraction of the intermetallic phase and higher ductile matrix of the braze can be achieved. Both have beneficial effects in modifying the ductility of the active braze alloy, and make removal of the braze alloy from the substrate by acid etching easier. by Ren-Kae Shiue. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Aluminium brazing sheet is a {{sandwich}} material {{made out of}} two aluminium alloys (AA 4 xxx/AA 3 xxx) and is widely used in automotive heat exchangers. One of the main performance criteria for heat exchanger units is the lifetime of the product. The lifetime of the heat exchanger units is determined by their corrosion resistance. The most common way to measure the corrosion resistance of heat exchanger materials is the so called Sea Water Acidified Accelerated Test (SWAAT). Unfortunately {{there is no agreement}} on how corrosion performance should be evaluated in SWAAT. The first aim of the current research work was to perform a statistical and in-depth analysis of the critical parameters of the SWAAT. By keeping the climatic parameters constant, the correlation between the variation of the test results and the actual fundamental differences in the material condition i. e. temper and brazing condition was elucidated. Parameters that potentially could influence the outcome of the SWAAT test were investigated. The results were used to narrow the operation window of the test and making it more reproducible and reliable. The possibility of the presence of some links between SWAAT and electrochemical characterization were also investigated. Corrosion mechanism and morphology of attack in SWAAT and potentiodynamic test were compared. The result confirmed that the SWAAT performance of the material can be reflected in potentiodynamic responses. Finally a new statistical reliability evaluation approach and a novel result interpretation method were developed. Nowadays cost reductions are key within automotive industry and the current corrosion resistant alloys become less competitive. There is a strong demand for low cost alloys but still with the excellent corrosion protection properties of the expensive alloys. In depth knowledge of how alloy composition, microstructure and thermo-mechanical processing alter the corrosion <b>resistance</b> of aluminium <b>brazing</b> sheet is crucial to allow production of cost effective alloys with sufficient properties in the near future. Therefore the second aim of this research was to develop a fundamental understanding over the correlation between microstructural features and the resulting electrochemical responses of aluminium brazing sheet materials. The detailed and fundamental mechanistic understanding of the effects of microstructural variations and the consequent electrochemical reactivities was aimed at providing solutions for enhanced corrosion protection by microstructural control of aluminium brazing sheet. A full microstructural characterization of the material was btained. A complete electrochemical characterization of the structure at macro, localized and micro scales was achieved and correlated to the microstructural features developed as consequences of brazing treatment. The results were used to explain the corrosion propagation mechanism through the structure of the brazed material and to investigate possibilities for improving the corrosion <b>resistance</b> of the <b>brazed</b> structure. Using the generated knowledge over the correlation between the microstructural features and the electrochemical responses, it was concluded that applying a proper post-braze heat treatment may improve the corrosion resistance of the aluminium brazing sheet. An innovative technique for improving corrosion resistance of a modified AA 4 xxx/AA 3 xxx aluminium brazing sheet has been developed. In this process the controlled atmosphere brazed (CAB) material is subjected to a thermal post-brazing treatment. The investigations of the corrosion resistance of the post-braze heat treated material confirmed the effectiveness of the developed thermal treatment for improving the corrosion <b>resistance</b> of the <b>brazing</b> sheet material. The relatively high tolerance to increased Si and Fe alloying element concentrations in this post-braze heat treated structure will provide the opportunity for further usage of recycled aluminium in its production process. Therefore this new material is referred to as a green corrosion resistant aluminium brazing sheet. This new generation of aluminium brazing sheet is able to tolerate a higher amount of previously considered detrimental alloying elements and thus a lower need for purification during primary and recycling processing saving energy, material and labor costs.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Heat transfer with open cell aluminium foam has been studied mainly for electronics cooling. In this contribution, {{we want to show}} the possibilities of using this foam in an automotive heat exchanger application. More specific, a water cooler for a high performance race car was build and tested. Bonding of the foam was done with an alumina particles enriched epoxy, which introduces an extra thermal <b>resistance</b> compared with <b>brazing</b> technology. Furthermore, it is known that pressure drop of open cell foam versus louvered fins, is rather at the high end. To overcome these issues, use was made of the relatively more isotropic nature of the foam compared to finned structures. This resulted in a completely different shape of the cooler when comparing with conventional rectangular coolers. As a result, heat exchanging surface area could be increased dramatically. The drawback is an increased complexity to design such coolers. Preliminary results have shown a 50 % increase of heat transfer compared with a conventional cooler mounted at the same position. This was measured during a wind tunnel test campaign and confirmed by real-time measurements when driving the car. Recalling that the cooler was manufactured with a single epoxy, it is believed that performance can be augmented significantly by a metallic bonding. ej 201...|$|R
40|$|Brazing, {{as a type}} {{of joining}} process, is widely used in {{manufacturing}} industries to join individual components of a structure. Structural reliability of a brazed assembly is strongly dependent on the joint mechanical properties. In the present work, mechanical reliability of low carbon steel brazed joints with copper filler metal is investigated and a methodology for failure analysis of brazed joints using the cohesive zone model (CZM) is presented. Mechanical reliability of the brazed joints is characterized by strength and toughness. Uniaxial and biaxial strengths of the joints are evaluated experimentally and estimated by finite element method using the ABAQUS software. Microstructural analysis of the joint fracture surfaces reveals different failure mechanisms of dimple rupture and dendritic failure. <b>Resistance</b> of the <b>brazed</b> joints against crack propagation, evaluated by the single-parameter fracture toughness criterion, shows dependency on the specimen geometry and loading configuration. Fracture of the brazed joints and the subsequent ductile tearing process are investigated using a two-parameter CZM. The characterizing model parameters of the cohesive strength and cohesive energy are identified by a four-point bend fracture test accompanied with corresponding FE simulation. Using the characterized CZM, the joint fracture behavior under tensile loading is well estimated. Predictability of the developed cohesive zone FE model for fracture analysis of brazed joints independent of geometry and loading configuration is validated. The developed cohesive zone FE model is extended to fatigue crack growth analysis in brazed joints. A cyclic damage evolution law is implemented into the cohesive zone constitutive model to irreversibly account for the joint stiffness degradation over the number of cycles. Fatigue failure behavior of the brazed joints is characterized by performing fully reversed strain controlled cyclic tests. The damage law parameters are calibrated based on the analytical solutions and the experimental fatigue crack growth data. The characterized irreversible CZM shows applicability to fatigue crack growth life prediction of brazed joints...|$|R
40|$|Ti-Al {{intermetallics}} {{were developed}} as light weight high temperature alloy. The phase diagram of Ti-Al {{is well known}} by several papers [1]. Particularly the -phase of TiAl is preferred because of its ductility and mechanical strength [2, 3]. Meanwhile technical use has started with engineering products made of TiAl [2]. The application as high temperature braze is not mentioned in literature until now. Challenges as high melting point (> 1250 °C) and availability of TiAl alloys as brazing material can be overcome in the future. This paper describes an economic preparation method of Ti-Al brazes and first results of joining experiments with alumina, silicon carbide and silicon nitride ceramics. The use of single Al- and Ti foils {{in combination with the}} ceramic parts enables the formation of a favorable Ti-Al composition and the TiAl formation at temperatures below 1200 °C for successful joining. Brazing experiments between 1200 up to 1500 °C were done to find optimal brazing temperature for different ceramic materials. The Ti-Al composition was varied to produce different Ti-Al phase during the brazing procedure. Phase formation, material structure, thermal effects and mechanical properties of the TiAl braze are investigated and reported. Because of the numerous parameters the development still needs to be completed but first results show promising features of the joint like high temperature strength and oxidation <b>resistance</b> of the <b>braze</b> material. 1.
