40|$|Esta monografia analisa a influência do Poder Legislativo brasileiro no que tange à celebração de acordos internacionais após o lançamento da Carta de 1988. Neste contexto, é importante salientar que, embora o País apresente um Executivo forte, o qual procura formar maioria parlamentar a partir de alianças partidárias, nem todos os seus projetos contam com o pleno consentimento dos congressistas. No âmbito dos tratados, o Congresso, ao discordar dos interesses do Executivo, possui a prerrogativa de rejeitá-los, bem como de instituir ressalvas e emendas aos textos dos Decretos Legislativos que os autorizam. Segundo estudo empírico, os dois últimos mecanismos foram efetuados, mesmo que pouquíssimas vezes, pela Comissão de Relações Exteriores e Defesa Nacional da Câmara dos Deputados durante o intervalo {{temporal}} compreendido entre 2000 e 2006. Verifica-se, desse modo, o alto índice de aprovação da totalidade do conteúdo dos tratados por esta instância, o qual decorre da iniciativa do Executivo de antecipar as preferências dos congressistas no que se refere às negociações internacionais, visto que os constrangimentos impostos pelo Legislativo, quando da apreciação dos acordos, afeta a credibilidade externa do País. Ademais, a análise empírica, uma vez que compreende o último mandato do governo Fernando Henrique Cardoso e o primeiro de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, procura, por meio do estudo temático dos acordos, identificar mudanças na política externa entre as duas administrações, o que se comprovou de fato. This monograph {{analyzes the}} influence of Brazilian Legislative, regarding the conclusion of international agreements after the Constitution of 1988. In this context, {{it is important to}} note that, although Brazil has a strong Executive, which seeks to form parliamentary majority from party alliances, not all of its projects have the full approval of the Congress. Regarding the treaties, the Legislative, when disagrees with the Executive, can reject them as well as establish <b>reservations</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> to the texts of the Legislative Decrees that authorize them. According to empirical analysis, the last two mechanisms were practiced for a few times by the Committee on Foreign Relations and National Defense of the Chamber of Deputies between 2000 and 2006. Thus, the high rate of approval of the entire content of the treaties by that institution arises from the anticipation of the congressmen’s preferences by the Executive on international negotiations, once the constraints imposed by the Legislative, when studying the agreements, affect the international credibility of the Country. Moreover, the empirical analysis, which embraces the last mandate of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the first of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, seeks to identify, through the thematic study of the agreements, changes in the foreign police between the two administrations, which were proved indeed...|$|R
