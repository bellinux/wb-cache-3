This paper presents substantial enhancement of the generalized explicit guidance to include the terminal <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> constraint in three dimension (3 -D) [...] With the availability of the desired total <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> in 3 -D, it computes the necessary terminal flight path and heading angles so that it not only satisfies the <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> constraint, but also leads to the minimum among all minimum control effort solutions for various possible terminal flight path and heading angle combinations.

This guidance law not only achieves the minimum control effort, but also generates the desired optimal terminal angl es (in both pitch and yaw planes) {{that can lead to}} proper trajectory shaping to assure the desired <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> during the midcourse. If both plane terminal <b>lead</b> <b>angles</b> are free, then this guidance will generate the desired terminal <b>lead</b> <b>angles</b> suc h that control effort can be minimized.

In a case where both <b>lead</b> <b>angles</b> are specified, this guidance law will achieves this with minimum control effort. For all the three cases close form solutions for the lateral acceleration command has been obtained. Simulation results for all three cases are quite very promising.

40|$|This work {{concentrated}} on the machined surface properties produced by the multi-axis ball-end milling process {{in order to enhance}} the high-performance application of multiaxis ball-end milling technology. The cutting speed of the engaged cutting edges and machining characteristics under various inclination angles were analyzed. The effects of inclination angles on the machined surface hardness, residual stresses, surface textures, topographies, and roughness were investigated under up-milling and down-milling conditions. Under up-milling condition, the machined surface hardness with regard to various tilt angles are larger than the ones under corresponding <b>lead</b> <b>angles,</b> and the variations of surface hardness with increasing <b>lead</b> <b>angles</b> are not apparent. In down-milling condition, double-peaks shape appears in the changing curve of surface hardness with increasing tilt and <b>lead</b> <b>angles.</b> The residual stresses present the overall trend of firstly increasing, then decreasing, and finally increasing with the increasing tilt angle from - 45 to 45 degrees. The surface residual stresses in both feed and cross-feed directions firstly decrease, and then increase with the increasing <b>lead</b> <b>angle.</b> Under both up-milling and down-milling, the compressive residual stresses significantly appear at the tool inclination angles near 0 degrees due to extrusion action of the cutting edges close to tool tip and the low effective cutting speed. For down-milling condition, the surface textures are approximately parallel with the feed direction when using tilt angles with large values, and are approximately perpendicular to feed direction under varying <b>lead</b> <b>angles.</b> The apparent machining marks under negative tilt angles with relatively larger absolute values and obvious regular surface patterns corresponding to positive tilt angles could be observed. More surface pits and burrs and circular arc textures probably appear under small tilt <b>angles</b> and <b>lead</b> <b>angles</b> near 0 degrees...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{effective}} orthogonal cutting edge in turning is considered. The orientation of this edge in the radial-longitudinal plane, as commonly modeled through an effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle,</b> is studied. The methods of effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> prediction used in numerous previously developed force models are plagued with large errors over ranges of process inputs, in particular feed rate and depth of cut. Four previously developed methods of effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> prediction are reviewed and compared to a new method presented here. This new method accounts for the size effect as introduced through the variation in chip thickness along the cutting edge, especially along the tool nose region. The difference in the new method is {{that the effect of}} continuous chip thickness variation along the cutting edge is included when evaluating the specific machining energies rather than using an average chip thickness, which has been used in the other methods. Therefore, the differential normal and friction force components acting on the rake face are functions of chip thickness through both the elemental chip load and the specific energies. Their directions are characterized by the orientations of the rake face and edge. By numerically integrating the differential force components modeled in this fashion, a significant improvement in effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> prediction accuracy is realized. This improved accuracy is verified using experimental data obtained for 1018 steel and 304 stainless steel at varying levels of feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, nose radius and tool <b>lead</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} jetting {{performance}} of liquid metals, an electromagnetic micro-jetting (EMJ) valve that realizes drop-on-demand (DOD) jetting while not involving any valve core or moving parts was designed. The {{influence of the}} <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> of the nozzle on the jetting of liquid metal gallium (Ga) was investigated. It {{was found that the}} Lorentz force component parallel to the nozzle that jets the electrified liquid Ga is always larger than its internal friction; thus, jet can be generated with any <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> but with different kinetic energies. Experimental results show that the mass of the jetting liquid, the jetting distance, the initial velocity of the jet, and the resulting kinetic energy of the jet increase first and then decrease. When the <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> is 90 Â°, the mass of the jetting liquid and the kinetic energy are at their maximum. When the angle is 80 Â°, the initial velocity achieves its maximum, with a calculated value of 0. 042 m/s. Moreover, very close and comparatively high kinetic energies are obtained at 80 Â° and 90 Â°, indicating that angles in between this range can produce a preferable performance.
