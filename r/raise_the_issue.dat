5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of a divorce again.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney General Janet Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90U.S. refugees, including Shakur.|$|E

5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in his appeal.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in May 1957, bids {{opened for}} the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon, that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway. Groundbreaking took place on June 10, and the project was to cost $3.6 million. The {{rebuilding}} of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding, and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from {{both the left and}} the right. In July, the Highway Development Association decided to formally <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting. In 1958, federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight-lane freeway, and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway. In August, the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains, including one with a tunnel. A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $1.2 million. In November, Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80, which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages, as well as being the least expensive alternative.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1431, {{the general}} council of the Church convened in Basel but its initial full meeting {{did not take place}} until 14 December by which time Pope Eugenius and the council were in {{complete}} disagreement. It was the council and not the pope who requested that James send representatives of the Scottish church and it is known that two delegates—Abbot Thomas Livingston of Dundrenanan and John de Winchester, canon of Moray and a servant of the king—were in attendance in November and December 1432. In 1433 James, this time in response to a summons by the pope, appointed two bishops, two abbots and four dignatories to attend the council. Twenty–eight Scottish ecclesiasts attended at intervals from 1434 to 1437 but the majority of the higher ranking churchmen sent proxy attendees but Bishops John Cameron of Glasgow and John de Crannach of Brechin attended in person as did Abbot Patrick Wotherspoon of Holyrood. Even {{in the midst of the}} Basel general council, Pope Eugenius instructed his legate, Bishop Antonio Altan of Urbino, to meet with James to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the king's controversial anti-barratry laws of 1426. The Bishop of Urbino arrived in Scotland in December 1436 and apparently a reconciliation between James and the papal legate had taken place by the middle of February 1437 but the events of 21 February when James was assassinated prevented the legate from completing his commission.|$|E

25|$|The ROK has {{not been}} willing to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> with the DPRK, {{thinking}} of the abductions in political rather than humanitarian terms.

Democratic reforms in the ROK allowed for moral and economic restitution to these citizens.|$|E
25|$|One major point often {{omitted from}} the debate (though Costello covers it thoroughly) is the Philippines, where MacArthur, unlike Kimmel or Short, had {{complete}} access to all decrypted Purple and JN-25 traffic CAST could provide (indeed, Stinnet quotes Whitlock to that effect), and was nonetheless caught unprepared and with all planes on the ground nevertheless, nine hours after the Pearl Harbor attack.

25|$|Slavery did not vanish in Saudi Arabia until King Faisal {{issued a}} decree for its total {{abolition}} in 1962. Peter Hobday stated that about 1,682 slaves were freed at that time, {{at a cost}} to the government of $2,000 each. It is argued that the US began to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of slavery after the meeting between King Abdulaziz and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 and that John F. Kennedy finally persuaded the House of Saud to abolish slavery in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Higgins {{used his}} {{platform}} in the Dáil to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of exploitation of migrant and guest workers in Ireland.

25|$|The civil {{standard}} {{is also used}} in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to drunk in charge {{that there was no}} likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence).|$|E

25|$|Other people <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of hazards to {{the animals}} in their working environments. The risk of {{accidental}} detonation of a mine by an animal is of concern to some; the Navy maintains that the chances of this are minimal, because the animals are trained not to touch the mines, which in any case are specifically designed not to be detonated by marine animals. Another fear is that opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals.|$|E
