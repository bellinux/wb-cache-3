50|$|<b>Resin</b> <b>casting</b> is used {{to produce}} {{collectible}} and customized toys and figures like designer toys, garage kits and ball-jointed dolls, as well as scale models, either individual parts or entire models of objects like trains, aircraft or ships. They are generally produced in small quantities, from the tens to a few hundred copies, compared to injection-molded plastic figures which are produced in many thousands. <b>Resin</b> <b>casting</b> is more labor intensive than injection molding, and the soft molds used are worn down by each cast. The low initial investment cost of <b>resin</b> <b>casting</b> means that individual hobbyists can produce small runs for their own use, such as customization, while companies {{can use it to}} produce small runs for public sale.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Polymerized cyclic {{butylene}} terephthalate (pCBT) <b>resin</b> <b>casts</b> {{filled with}} short carbon fibers were {{prepared by the}} melt-mixing approach. The electrical conductivity of short-carbon-fiber (SCF) reinforced thermoplastic pCBT <b>resin</b> <b>casts</b> were investigated with a special attention paid to the properties in the percolation threshold region and the mechanical properties of the composites were also studied. The percolation threshold value of the novel material system was determined which was also verified by SEM images and the thermoelectric behavior of the specimens. Even though the electrical properties of SCF/pCBT composites enhanced significantly, the material becomes more brittle than neat pCBT and all the specimens appear brittle fracture during the mechanical test. Moreover, fiber pull-out is the main damage form in three-point-bending test...|$|R
50|$|Its remains {{came from}} the Konservat-Lagerstätte of Las Hoyas, Cuenca, Spain. The holotype (LH13500), housed in the {{collection}} of , consists on both slab and counterslab preserving mainly the thoracic region, part of the neck and both almost complete forelimbs of an adult specimen. It also preserves remains of the body, primary, secondary feathers and a bastard wing which have been covered by layers of limonite {{as a result of the}} fossilization process. The preservation is consistent with the taphonomic processes associated with obruption, stagnation and the action of microbial mats in the locality that have yielded a wide variety of examples of soft-tissue preservation (e.g., connective tissues in fishes and theropods or insect wings). Most of the osteological features of the holotype became apparent only after its acid preparation and transference to a <b>resin</b> <b>cast.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy, in terms of trueness and precision, of optical dental scanners. An experimental acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> was created and digitized using a microcomputed tomography (microCT) scanner, which sewed as the reference model. Five polyether impressions were made of the acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> to create five stone casts. Each dental digitizer (Imetric, Lava ST, Smart Optics, KaVo Everest) made five scans of the acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> and one scan of every stone cast. The scans were superimposed and compared using metrology software. Deviations were calculated between the datasets obtained from the dental digitizers and the microCT scanner (= trueness) and between datasets from the same dental digitizer (= precision). With exception of the Smart Optics scanner, there were no significant differences in trueness for the acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>cast.</b> For the stone casts, however, the Lava ST performed better than Imetric, which did better than the KaVo scanner. The Smart Optics scanner demonstrated the highest deviation. All digitizers demonstrated a significantly higher trueness for the acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> compared to the plaster cast, except the Lava ST The Lava ST was significantly more precise compared to the other scanners. Imetric and Smart Optics also demonstrated a higher level of precision compared to the KaVo scanner. All digitizers demonstrated some degree of error. Stone cast copies are less accurate because of difficulties with scanning the rougher surface or dimensional deformations caused during the production process. For complex, large-span reconstructions, a highly accurate scanner should be selected...|$|E

40|$|The {{post-cure}} {{behavior of}} a commercially available DGEBA-based epoxy modified cyanate ester resin (1, 1 -bis (4 -cyanato phenyl) ethane) was investigated by thermo analytical techniques and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Thermally initiated resin cure was carried out at 170 ^o C/ 1 h followed by 180 ^o C/ 2 h. Two different post-cure procedures, (PCPs), PCP-I (210 ^o C/ 2 h + 250 ^o C/ 1 h) and PCP-II (280 ^o C/ 3 h), were independently followed for the cured resin material. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) characterization of the resin casts indicated significant lowering of glass transition temperature (T_g), by about 35 ^o C in PCP-II casts in comparison with PCP-I, though the former was post cured at higher temperature. However, the PCP-II specimens recorded considerable enhancement in storage modulus values at room temperature and above till about the T_g region. FTIR spectroscopic studies of the <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> support the formation of both cyanurate triazine ring (1563 cm^- 1, 1368 cm^- 1) and oxazolidinone ring (1736 cm^- 1) for the PCP-I <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> while in the PCP-II specimens the former, namely the cyanurate formation {{was found to be}} absent. The absence of rigid cyanurate triazine rings in PCP-II was further strengthened by the tan δ_max values observed in these resin casts by DMA.

40|$|SUMMARY From a <b>resin</b> <b>cast</b> of {{a normal}} {{pulmonary}} arterial tree, the diameter, length, and number of branches in each order were determined for arteries from 25 to 300 /xm in diameter. Histological sections 120 -ftm thick were cut from a normal human lung in which the pulmonary artery had been injected {{with a mixture of}} ink and gelatin. Similar measurements were made on arteries from 10 to 70 ftm in diameter, and the mode of origin of the capillaries was studied. The data thus obtained were found to correspond reasonably well to values previously estimated by extrapolation from data for arteries of 100 (im or more in diameter. The branching rules apply down to arteries of about 10 - 15 fim in diameter, the estimated number of which is 73 million. Distal to these vessels, capillaries arise either directly from small arteries or indirectly via precapillaries which are given off in great numbers and diverse patterns from the small arteries. THE MORPHOLOGY of the human pulmonary arterial tree, as determined from measurements of a <b>resin</b> <b>cast,</b> has been described previously. 1 In that study, the branches were divided into three zones according to their diameters; a proximal zone (PZ) down to 0. 8 mm in diameter, an intermediate zone (IZ) down to 0. 1 mm in diameter, and a distal zone (DZ) of branches smaller than this. No data were presented for branches in the distal zone, but their dimensions were estimated by extrapolation. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to provide data for arteries 100 (im and less in diameter and to compare the data with the values previously obtained by extrapolation. Two methods were used: (1) casting of the arterial tree with resin and (2) injection of the arterial tree and capillary network with a mixture of ink and gelatin solution...|$|E

Samples were loaded until resin delaminated from the substrate and the load at failure was recorded. An analytical solution for a composite beam was used to relate the force at failure to interfacial shear stress. This resulted in an average estimated shear strength of 490 kPa (71 psi) for a resin/steel interface. The accuracy of the analytic solution was examined using a three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA). The FEA was also {{used to examine the}} assumptions of the first approximation analytic solution. The analytic solution can be applied more generally, considering the mechanical characteristics of both constituents, to design experiments that lead to a simplified determination of interfacial shear strength...|$|E
