50|$|The Pegasus is a {{powerful}} and fast two person racing and cruising dinghy designed by Uffa Fox in 1958. It was notable for being a boat capable of being built at home using marine ply but still with an efficient and aesthetically pleasing <b>round</b> <b>bilged</b> hull form - see pictures on the cvrda website.|$|E
50|$|At the time, the Class Secretary commented:This {{exciting}} new design incorporates all modern features. The easily driven, lightweight hull planes readily yet possesses fantastic stability. Fully equipped she is priced considerably below other high-performance dinghies. Her <b>round</b> <b>bilged</b> hull, designed with glass fibre in mind, has a double bottom, self-draining through transom flaps and wells for helmsman and crew equipped with self bailers. The ample built-in buoyancy and reserve foam buoyancy {{is designed to}} make self rescue easy {{in the case of}} capsize.|$|E

50|$|HDMLs had a round bilge heavy {{displacement}} hull 72 ft long with {{a beam of}} 16 ft and a loaded draught of 5 ft. Loaded displacement was 54 tons. The hull had a pronounced flare forward to throw the bow wave clear and provided considerable lift to prevent all but the heaviest seas from coming aboard. Although seaworthy, the boat had a considerable tendency to roll, especially when taking seas at anything other than directly ahead or astern. The cause was the round bilge midship section and a considerable reserve of stability, the effect of which was to impart a powerful righting moment if the boat was pushed over in a seaway. This, coupled with the <b>round</b> <b>bilged</b> hull and lack of bilge keels, would set up a rapid and violent rolling.|$|E
50|$|He was {{research}} associate at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1944 to 1959 where the Office of Naval Research generously supported his projects. He became professor of oceanography at Harvard University in 1959 and moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963, where he remained until 1978, returning to Woods Hole until his retirement. Stommel established the PANULIRUS station (begun in 1954) in Bermuda. PANULIRUS was the name of a wooden, <b>round</b> <b>bilged</b> research vessel (thus R/V Panulirus) operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research for many years. On a monthly schedule, the vessel obtained sea water samples a vertical intervals from the surface to great depths, which yielded temperature, salinity and some additional chemical data. Because the sea bottom falls away very sharply, particularly to the East-south-east of Bermuda, it is possible to obtain a representative sampling within a few miles of land. The resulting data set constitutes the longest such data series of similar character in the North Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

50|$|Smooth curve hulls are hulls {{that are}} rounded and don't usually have any chines or corners. They can be moulded, round-bilged or soft-chined. Examples are the <b>round</b> <b>bilge,</b> {{semi-round}} bilge and s-bottom hull.|$|R
40|$|The report {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} seakeeping properties of catamarans. Three geometrically similar hull forms were tested covering a range of Length:Displacement ratio from 7. 4 to 9. 5. The hulls are of <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> transom stern form and {{are based on the}} NPL <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> series. A number of hull configurations, including monohull and two catamaran demihull spacings, were tested at three Froude numbers (F subscript n = 0. 2, 0. 53, 0. 8) and over a range of wavelengths. Long-crested head-seas were used for all experiments. Measurements of heave, pitch, vertical acceleration at two stations and added resistance in waves were made. Response functions have been calculated from both regular and irregular wave experiments...|$|R

50|$|A Mersey flat {{is a type}} of doubled-ended barge with <b>rounded</b> <b>bilges,</b> carvel {{build and}} fully decked. Traditionally, the hull was built of oak and the deck was pitch pine. Some had a single mast, with a fore-and-aft rig, while some had an {{additional}} mizzen mast. Despite having a flat bottom and curved sides, they were quite stable. They were common from the 1730s to 1890s.|$|R
50|$|As {{usual for}} barges they were carvel built, with bluff bows and <b>rounded</b> <b>bilges.</b> The stem post is high with a towing bitt behind, {{and with a}} canoe stern. Both stem and stern had a small decked area. The bow carried a large iron {{windlass}} and the stern provided a small living cabin beneath the deck.

40|$|In this article, {{the results}} of a {{numerical}} and experimental study of the stability and roll motion of different advanced multihull vessels are presented. The study concerns the effect of the lines, transverse and longitudinal spacing for two catamarans – one with <b>rounded</b> <b>bilge</b> and one with a hard chine, an innovative bulbcat hull in comparison to the basic catamaran and two trimarans.

This, however, was a trawler yacht with a difference. The Corvette 32 had a most unusual hull shape (<b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> sections flanked by shallow vee flats out to the chine). This semi-planing design gave the Corvette significantly better performance than normally achieved by the more traditional displacement hull used on this type of craft.|$|R
40|$|Malaysia as {{a country}} {{surrounded}} by water has a huge economic and geographical potential {{in the development of}} super yacht industry in South East Asia. There is lack of super yacht design study specifying to Malaysian marinas and seas. Most of the super yacht operates in Malaysia were built and bought directly from oversea, and chartered by foreign companies. It is hence {{the purpose of this study}} to survey on Malaysian sea water, particularly Langkawi Island, to introduce a design methodology in producing a preliminary design of super yacht that suits Langkawi Island, and serves as a guideline for future super yacht design for Malaysian sea in different marinas. Suitable dimensions of super yacht were derived by using dimensional relationship via statistical method. Two types of hull form designs (<b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> and V-bottom hull) were designed using Maxsurf Pro software. Resistance analysis on the two hull forms were carried out using Savitsky Pre-Planing and Compton methods via MaxsurfHullspeed software, and stability performance of the two hull forms was analyze using Hydromax software. VBottom hull form is found to have better resistance performance as compared to <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> hull form, and both hull forms are found to be in stable conditions and comply with IMO requirements...|$|R
40|$|Actual sea {{waves and}} vessel motion are an {{unsteady}} nonlinear random process. The currently adopted test to simulate wave impact of vessel models in tank can 2 ̆ 7 t fully reveal {{the impact of}} real sea waves on vessel swing motion. In this paper the buoy wave height meter is adopted to carry out measurements and analyses of the coastal wave environment. The correlation between the coastal wave spectra and the ocean wave spectra is analyzed. The test system is established for remote control and telemetry self-propelled vessel models suitable for the experiment conducted in the coastal areas. The seakeeping performance test is conducted for the same tonnage of <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> vessel model and the deep-V hybrid monohull of large-scale vessel model under the coastal wave conditions. The experimental results are compared with the test results of small-scale vessel model in the towing tank. The experimental {{results show that the}} seakeeping performance of the deep-V hybrid monohull is improved by a wide margin in contrast to that of the <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> model, and there is a marked difference between the motion characteristics of large-scale vessel models in the coastal wave environment and that of small-scale vessel models in tank...|$|R
50|$|A Mark II was {{introduced}} as a cheaper GRP version without a permanent fore-deck, {{but did not}} prove very popular. The original boats became known as Mark 1 and wooden boats, probably mainly from kits, continued to be built to this specification. In the late 1970s a Mark 3 was produced, starting with no 1800. This was a radical redesign featuring a <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> hull, greater beam and side decks. The design was optimised for and only available in GRP.

40|$|Multihull due to {{a couple}} of {{advantages}} has been the topic of extensive research work in naval architecture. In this study, a series of investigation of fishing vessel to save fuel energy was carried out at ITS. Two types of ship models, monohull (<b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> and hard chine) and catamaran, a boat with two hulls (symmetrical and asymmetrical) were developed. Four models were produced physically and numerically, tested (towing tank) and simulated numerically (CFD code). The results of the two approaches indicated that the catamaran mode might have drag (resistance) smaller than those of monohull at the same displacement. A layout of catamaran fishing vessel, proposed here, indicates the freedom of setting the deck equipments for fishing vessel...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{multi-hull}} small-sized motor yachts with <b>rounded</b> <b>bilge</b> hulls were examined as alternative options for enough high speed: catamarans without and with under-water foils, {{as well as}} outriggered boats without and with foils. Besides, a twin-hull motor yacht with decreased water-plane area was examined too. Restriction of speed, {{as a result of}} avoiding hard chine, was examined; necessary power and seakeeping levels of the examined yachts were estimated too. It has shown that the examined yachts are compatible (from the energy point of view) with today’s dominant planing monohulls for defi ned ranges of speed; the examined multi-hulls are better from the seakeeping point of view than the comparable monohulls...|$|R

5000|$|The hull was of <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> wooden construction, planked {{with two}} diagonally opposed skins {{with a layer}} of oiled calico between them - known as a “double-diagonal” technique. The hull was {{completed}} with frames or “timbers” riveted perpendicularly from the keel to the gunwale {{on the inside of the}} planking, forming a very strong hull. The hull was further strengthened by the addition of longitudinal stringers riveted inside the timbers together with further timbers, known as [...] "web frames". They were fastened inside the stringers opposite every third main timber. HDMLs were fitted with a deeper section rubbing strake aft. Its purpose was to roll depth charges (kept in and delivered from racks on the side decks) clear of the hull and propellers.|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{determination}} of roll damping of warped hull form at low relative speed for which little data are available. The effect of hard chine and <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> on roll damping has been investigated for two models of same characteristics and same inertial properties in displacement and semi-displacement regime. It was expected to experience the difference between two forms in nonlinear roll damping only, which is amplitude dependent and therefore roll decay tests were performed for angles from 10 to 30 degrees at zero speed up to Fn = 0. 48. Roll decays have been analyzed considering logarithmic and linear decrements. Obtained results are natural roll frequencies and periods, equivalent linear damping αEQ and linear α and quadratic β damping coefficients as functions of ship speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper will}} present the results {{obtained}} from the experimental tests, performed in the towing tank of the University of Trieste, on two fast fishing vessels models, having the same main dimensions, ratios and coefficients, but different body plan. The hulls were designed by using hard-chine type and <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> sections respectively. The hull performances were compared as regards the towing and wave pattern resistance, the wave generation, the transversal stability and the rolling motions in regular beam waves. The experience confirmed that the hard chine sections reduce the rolling motion but slightly increase the wave and towing resistance, as reported also by other who analysed separately the two aspects. In this case, simultaneous comparisons of the different phenomena allow a better evaluation of the two hulls performances...|$|R
5000|$|In 1940 the Lighthouse Service {{merged into}} the Coast Guard (The Coast Guard {{was formed in}} 1913 when the U.S. Revenue Service was {{combined}} with the U.S. Life Saving Service). The Coast Guard amended the tender designs to include Search and Rescue (SAR) features and an icebreaking capability, making them the first true [...] "multi-mission" [...] capable cutters. The SAR requirements provided finer design lines at the bow and stern, and a reduced beam to length ratio. A larger deckhouse was incorporated to increase the available interior space. Single screw propulsion, a cutaway forefoot under the bow, and <b>rounded</b> <b>bilges</b> facilitated ice-breaking. The hull displacement was 960 LT. To reduce costs, on available off-the-shelf technology was utilized. The contract for the lead ship was awarded to Zenith Dredge Company of Duluth, Minnesota, in January 1941.|$|R
60|$|Whitney {{could not}} {{determine}} what to do; {{and while he}} waited in tormenting indecision, the boat rose upright and the water swirled furiously <b>round</b> her <b>bilge.</b> Then his heart leaped as a cry {{came out of the}} dark, and soon afterward two indistinct figures appeared {{at the side of the}} gut.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the bottom}} of the boat, out to a maximum of {{approximately}} 1m from the centreline, the hull has a <b>round</b> <b>bilge,</b> canoe-like underbody. Either side of this, out to the chine, the sections are flat and shallow-vee, virtually horizontal at the stern. The flat sections give the lift required for planing performance, while the round ones soften the ride. The very shallow vee sections, acting like broad chine-flats, cause the boat to turn at speed with almost none of the expected inward heel making for a very comfortable ride. Trim tabs have always been fitted.There were some problems on early boats, which did slam in very difficult conditions. But the early boats had engines close to the stern. In the 1980s the engines were moved under the wheelhouse, and all evidence of slamming and other handling problems were immediately eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} adaptability especially integrated sailing {{performance in}} rough sea of ships is very important. In this paper the evaluation index system and method {{of wind and}} wave environment adaptability were proposed. Then {{the relative importance of}} the given indices was analyzed, and the weighting coefficients of the indices were given by estimation matrixes. Besides this the evaluation equation was built. And the AHP method and the method based on fuzzy theory were used for evaluating the environment adaptability of a hybrid monohull and a <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> monohull. Furthermore, the effect of different models and weighting coefficients given by different matrixes for evaluation results were analyzed. The research indicated that the choice of evaluating parameters had great influence on the evaluation results, and the weighting coefficients were the difficult point but critical point for environment adaptability evaluation of ships...|$|R
50|$|Mersey flats were sailing barges {{that were}} used in the inland {{waterways}} of Northwest England. They were carvel-built with <b>rounded</b> <b>bilges</b> and sterns, and had a shallow draught. As originally built, the flats had a single mast that could be lowered or lifted out. Typically they were about 70 ft long by 14 ft wide. Some flats were larger and could be used as small coasters. Other flats were unrigged and were designed to be pulled by horses or tugs, but strong enough to survive conditions on the river estuaries. The waterways in which the flats were used were the rivers Mersey, Dee and Weaver, and canals and navigations such as the Bridgewater Canal, the Sankey Canal, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the Weaver Navigation, the Rochdale Canal, the Chester Canal and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.|$|R
50|$|The ship is 90 m {{long with}} a {{displacement}} of 1,300 tonnes. She carries twin diesel engines with a distance adjustable tail rotor which can provide enough power for her {{top speed of}} more than 25 kn.

Compared to the traditional <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> boat, the ship is designed with V type, having angle bending line at the bottom so that she can sail with high speed in rough sea states. However, the ship does not carry any type of sonar so she has no anti-submarine warfare capability. As a result, she will act as a surface warfare corvette only. BNS Shadhinota has a helicopter deck aft which can support a medium-size helicopter, but she has no hangar.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an optimization technique to improve hull forms in a seaway {{by a new}} index, namely the Overall Motion Induced Interruptions OMIIs, defined as the mean MIIs value on ship main deck and chosen as single-objective function to be minimized. Parametric hull modelling is used to generate, by the Lackenby method, several ship variants, with some modified hull form parameters. Despite of classical optimization techniques, mainly based on heave, pitch and roll RAOs peak values minimization in regular head seas, all heading angles are considered, accounting for the probability of occurrence of each sea state, derived by the wave scattering diagram for the Mediterranean Sea. The method {{is applied to the}} hull form optimization of the <b>round</b> <b>bilge</b> NPL series. Optimum hull is finally derived and OMIIs indexes are compared, as well as heave, pitch and roll RAOs at various and relevant speed polar plots...|$|R
50|$|An older {{usage of}} the term “bass boat” refers to a type of sport fishing boat once popular for fishing for striped bass off the Atlantic coast of the United States. These bass boats were about 25 feet long and {{featured}} a hull form similar to a New England lobster boat with a sharp entry, <b>rounded</b> <b>bilges,</b> and relatively little deadrise at the stern. They were powered with inboard engines and had {{a top speed of}} about 20 knots. The typical deck configuration featured a long cockpit with a windshield at the forward end and a cuddy cabin in the bow. Examples still in production include the Fortier 26 and the Dyer 29. Some outboard-powered sport fishing boats emulate bass boat styling including the Steiger Craft Block Islands and the Parker 2310 and 2510; however, these boats have a more sharply V’ed hull form and are designed for higher speeds.|$|R
60|$|It is a {{difficult}} matter to fit a new plank into the <b>rounded</b> <b>bilge</b> of a boat, particularly when one is provided with inadequate appliances. One requires a good eye for curves, for the planks need much shaping. They must also be driven into position by force. Two or three stout shores were firmly wedged {{against the side of}} the boat, and these encumbered Vane in the free use of his arms. His face was darkly flushed and he panted heavily and now and then flung vitriolic instructions to the Siwash inside the craft. Carroll, watching him with quiet amusement, was on the whole content that the tide was rising, for his comrade had firmly declined to stop for dinner, and he was conscious of a sharpened appetite. It was comforting to reflect that Vane would be unable to get the plank into place before the evening meal, for if there had been any prospect of his doing so, he would certainly have postponed his dinner.|$|R
