First, we consider an economy with exogenous population {{and study the}} effects of a change in the individual preference for old-aged services that causes a <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> between sectors on per capita income. Then, we compare the results with the standard Diamond (1965) style one-sector economy. Second, we endogenise fertility founding that a <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in favour of the services sector causes an additional beneficial effect on per capita income with respect to the model with exogenous population. Third, we further introduce endogenous lifetime through public health investments, showing that multiple regimes of development may exist.

40|$|The <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> {{is one of}} the key {{functions}} of labour markets. The large scale turnover of workers called the churn means that this is a huge task. This reallocation is not instantaneous and straightforward because of trading frictions in the labour market. Reallocation matters in a number of ways including for the rate of unemployment and the efficient use of production opportunities. This paper contributes to this research programme by examining the relationship between the churn and the cycle, specifically, aggregate unemployment. There are two important links highlighted in the literature between reallocation, and unemployment and the cycle. In both these views, unemployment plays a positive role in facilitating the <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> We argue that this is misleading. In this paper we analyse the <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in Britain using theory and evidence. The context has two key components: continuous productivity shocks (so that reallocation is always required) and matching frictions (so that it is not trivial). We calibrate a search and matching model, and use it to explore the relationship between reallocation and the tightness of the labour market using simulations. Turning to the empirical part of the paper, we use data on around 364, 000 workers in Britain from the LFS over the period 1993 - 2001. We analyse reallocation and unemployment, and show a clear negative relationship...|$|E

30|$|Lesson 3 is {{that not}} the level but the {{volatility}} of house-prices is the variable to worry about. The cost of house-price slumps (and of austerity for that matter, they are similar, see Lesson 2) is the <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> from construction and domestics to tradables. This reallocation leads to a loss in industry specific human capital and unemployment. Good macro policy, therefore, stabilizes house-prices as to avoid prolonged periods of high unemployment. The main reason why high house prices are a {{problem is that they}} increase the likelihood of future house-price slumps and hence a <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> away from construction and domestics.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the fundamental {{role played by}} factor accumulation in explaining the extraordinary postwar growth of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Participation rates, educational levels and (with the exception of Hong Kong) investment rates have risen rapidly in all four economies. In addition, there have been large intersectoral <b>reallocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> with (again, excepting Hong Kong) non-agricultural and manufacturing employment growing {{one and a half}} to two times as fast as the aggregate working population. Thus, while the growth of output per capita in these economies has averaged 6 % to 7 % per annum over the past two and a half decades, the growth of output per effective worker in the non- agricultural sector of these economies has been only 3 % to 4 % per annum. If one then allows for the doubling, tripling and even quadrupling of the investment to GDP ratio in these economies, one arrives at total factor productivity growth rates, both for the non- agricultural economy and for manufacturing in particular, which are well within the bounds of those experienced by the OECD and Latin American economies over equally long periods of time. While the growth of output and manufacturing exports in the newly industrializing economies of East Asia is virtually unprecedented, the growth of total factor productivity in these economies is not. ...|$|R
40|$|We set up {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model, in which offshoring to a low-wage country can lead to job polarisation in the high-wage country. Job polarisation {{is the result of}} a <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> across firms that differ in productivity and pay wages that are positively linked to their profits by a rent-sharing mechanism. Offshoring involves fixed and task-specific variable costs, and as a consequence it is chosen only by the most productive firms, and only for those tasks with the lowest variable offshoring costs. A reduction in those variable costs increases offshoring at the intensive and at the extensive margin, with domestic employment shifted from the newly offshoring firms in the middle of the productivity distribution to firms at the tails of this distribution, paying either very low or very high wages. We also study how the <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> across firms affects economy-wide unemployment. Offshoring reduces unemployment when it is confined to high-productivity firms, while this outcome is not guaranteed when offshoring is also chosen by low-productivity firms...|$|E

The analysis focuses on family support policies that create large effective tax burdens on female labour supply, by means testing the support on family income, or selectively on the second income. Examples include Family Tax Benefit Part A and Part B, the Medicare Levy and the Medicare Safety Net. The analysis draws on household survey data to show that female labour supply is strongly positively associated with household saving, the purchase of private health insurance and spending on family health generally. Policies that inhibit female labour supply therefore have the effect of reducing the tax base for funding public pensions and health care, while simultaneously reducing the capacity of families to fund them privately. 1...|$|R

40|$|The author {{studies the}} effects <b>of</b> capital <b>reallocation</b> (the flow <b>of</b> {{productive}} capital across firms and establishments mainly through changes in ownership) on aggregate labour productivity.

40|$|Traditional trade theories, {{such as the}} Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models, posit that {{comparative}} advantage determines a country’s industrial structure in a liberalized trade environment. However, developments in contemporary trade theory challenge the central tenants of this approach. Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models assume that industries are comprised of homogeneous firms that can be modeled using a representative firm. Under this conception, industrial evolution is driven by {{comparative advantage}}s. However, empirical evidence of post-liberalisation industrial change indicates that industrial performance is significantly more variable than predicted by traditional models. Even within industries, firms exhibit markedly divergent performance. The new trade theory of heterogeneous firms thus argues that there are fundamental differences between firms, even within narrowly defined industries, and these differences drive a post-liberalisation churning process that results in the <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> capital and <b>labour</b> within an industry.

30|$|The {{key factor}} for {{understanding}} the underperformance of the Dutch economy is the interaction between fiscal policy and a house price slump. The pressure on house prices had three causes. The first cause is the fall in GDP relative to its pre-crisis trend. Cerra and Saxena (2008) and Teulings and Zubanov (2013) {{have shown that the}} fall in output after a financial crisis is largely permanent, in the order of magnitude of 5 to 10 % of GDP. Hence, consumers loose life time wealth and therefore have to reduce their consumption of housing services. The second cause is the stress in the banking system due to financial crisis. This reduces their willingness to provide credit for buying houses. However, both causes have affected Germany and The Netherlands alike, and hence they cannot by themselves explain the difference in performance between both countries. A third factor was specific to the Netherlands. The country ran an extremely generous system of tax deductibility of mortgage interest rates, costing about 2 to 3 % of GDP in terms of lower tax revenues. This system has been perceived as unsustainable by organisations like IMF, OECD, and EU, but more importantly, also by the Dutch public. When the crisis hit, the system lost its credibility. These factors lead to a fall in house prices, which will be shown to be equivalent to a transfer of wealth from current to future generations. The former lose, since they get a lower price for their property. The latter gain since they have to pay less. This wealth transfer tightens the lifetime budget constraint of the current generation. In response to this, they reduce their consumption to compensate these losses. Only as current generations gradually die, having solved their financial stress by lowering consumption, and are replaced by new generations that have not experienced a loss of wealth, consumption will pick up again. During this transition, reduced consumption has a profound effect on the distribution of employment between industries. In a small open economy, the main option for a country to save is to export to other countries. Hence, employment in the export industry has to grow while the domestic sector and construction have to shrink. Relocation of employment between industries is costly. Workers have specific human capital for a particular industry. Small <b>reallocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> between industries can be accommodated by incumbent workers retiring and new cohorts choosing to work in different industries. However, this mechanism is too slow for large shifts in demand. Then, incumbent workers have to change industries. This requires retraining of workers who have already acquired their industry specific human capital. The old human capital has to be written off. The larger is the fall in consumption, the greater is the shift in employment, and hence, the larger the value of human capital to which this applies.|$|R

40|$|Key words: Environmental degradation, intrahousehold labour allocation, intrahousehold welfare. Rural south Pare {{highlands}} in Tanzania {{experience a}} deteriorating environmental situation. Of particular importance is {{the disappearance of}} forests and woodlands. The consequence are declining amounts and reliability of rainfall, declining amounts of water levels and loss of biodiversity. Deterioration of environmental resources increases costs of collecting environmental products, which in many respects have no feasible close substitutes. One of the major components of the increased costs is labour time allocated by household members to collecting environmental products and/or grazing activities. This study presents an empirical investigation of the impact <b>of</b> this <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> intra-household <b>labour</b> resources on livelihood for different members of a household. We used the cross-sectional data. To analyse how variations in the environmental degradation affect intra-household labour allocation, three types of areas are distinguished: severely-degraded, medium-degraded, and non-degraded environments. Our findings show that (1) the environmental products collection and/or grazing activities are gender biased with husbands specializing in grazing while wives and children working mainly on fetching water and fuel wood; and that the labour time allocation is significantly influenced by environmental condition; (2) environmental degradation is limiting the production and consumption potentials {{in the area and}} that a limited adoption of agricultural modernization further aggravates this problem; (3) factors like school crowdedness, illness, bad weather, poor school quality, and school absenteeism due to street vending contribute much negatively to the probability of primary school attainment for a child apart from the environmental degradation situation; and that (4) subjective welfare and well-being of the household members are affected by the quality of the environment.

Successes in agricultural front with high production levels, especially in food grains have indeed been achieved. But more energy in the form of mineral fertilizers, chemical pesticides and farm machinery are required every year to produce the same quantity of farm products. Historically, women have been the managers of natural resources as they are dependent on them for their livelihood and their family’s needs. The consequences of over exploitation of these resources have rendered them scarce. The rural women collect over 28 % of all energy consumed in India in the form of firewood. Most of the 140 million tonnes of firewood burnt annually come from forests. Poverty and unemployment in rural areas have resulted in large-scale migration to urban areas. Women are being forced to take up more drudgerous jobs as a source of livelihood as most of the migrants are absorbed into the construction sector. Women form the largest work force in agricultural sector. Caring for livestock comes naturally to women. The most drudgerous jobs in livestock production like cleaning of the cattle sheds, feeding the cattle, collection of fodder etc. always fall on the woman. Care for young animals and backyard livestock is also largely done by women. In caring for sick young animals women have evolved several ethno veterinary practices.
