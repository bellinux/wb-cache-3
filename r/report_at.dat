5|$|On July 17, 2012, Prague Municipal Court's {{panel of}} three judges headed by judge Luboš Vrba {{overturned}} the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million (~ US$ 400,000). After this, the State Attorney challenged {{the conditions of}} release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to <b>report</b> <b>at</b> a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August 2, 2012, the appellate court rejected the State Attorney's second complaint and ordered Blythe's immediate release. Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day, claiming {{in an interview with}} TV Nova that he would return for the trial.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final <b>report</b> <b>at</b> Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|While in the USSR, Willkie {{urged the}} opening of a second front against the Germans; when reporters asked Roosevelt about those comments, the {{president}} responded flippantly by saying that he had read the headlines but had not considered the speculative comments worth the reading. This angered Willkie, and on his return from his 49-day trip, he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his <b>report</b> <b>at</b> the White House.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses {{consistency}} in self-reports of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} testing using two waves of longitudinal data from a large, national probability survey, the National AIDS Behavioral Survey. Of those <b>reporting</b> <b>at</b> Wave I {{that they had been}} tested for reasons other than blood donation, 18 percent <b>reported</b> <b>at</b> Wave 2 that they had never been tested. Of those <b>reporting</b> <b>at</b> Wave I that they had been tested when they donated blood, 29 percent <b>reported</b> <b>at</b> Wave 2 that they had never been tested. Inconsistent responses may be due to poor recall and to high self-presentation bias, that is, a desire to provide socially acceptable answers. Poor recall may be exacerbated by passive conditions such as blood donation. The authors conclude with recommendations for reducing measurement error in surveys of testing behavior...|$|R
5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection <b>report</b> <b>at</b> the end of the 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee <b>report</b> <b>at</b> the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hastings became {{involved}} in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Miss Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to <b>report</b> <b>at</b> once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} {{was first}} sighted on 3September as it swept past Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts, and Antigua, drifting toward the west-northwest and soon approaching Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm reached the Bahamas while turning northward on 4September, nearing the northern Floridan coast by 6September. It remained offshore on 7September, gradually approaching the coast throughout the day, and eventually made landfall that evening along {{the coasts of}} Georgia and South Carolina. Observations in Savannah, Georgia, indicated north-to-northeast winds throughout 8September, though other reports recorded northeast-to-easterly gusts; at Charleston, South Carolina, however, winds, initially northeast-to-east, curved southeastward later in the storm. Little information exists on the hurricane's whereabouts between North Carolina and New England, with a single <b>report</b> <b>at</b> Norfolk, Virginia of east-northeasterly winds veering east-to-east-southeast from 7to 9September, suggesting the disturbance's passage west of there. A severe gale arrived in New England on 11and 12September, though the long pause between {{the departure of the}} hurricane from the Carolinas and its arrival in the northeastern United States evidences the possibility that the two systems may have been unrelated.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol, built from stone and brick, was constructed in the castle grounds. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was very critical of the facility. In particular he complained about the castle's underground dungeon, accessed down a flight of 26 steps; the room was circular, 18 feet (5.5 m) across, and guarded by an iron grill. Worcester conducted extensive work after the <b>report</b> <b>at</b> a cost of £3,431 (£364,000 at 2009 prices), and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women, in addition to the dungeon and the sick-rooms. Nevertheless, it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard's inspection, with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell, sleeping together on the floor. Like other prisons of the time, Worcester Castle was run as a private enterprise, in this case by a local butcher, who was paid £150 a year (£15,400) to run the facility. The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever, which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility.|$|E
5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The members of the committee were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were: that the committee <b>report</b> <b>at</b> the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate be limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House preside over the joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought the provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them despite the opposition.|$|E

5|$|While at Deraa on 21 September {{during his}} {{withdrawal}} from Nazareth to Damascus, Liman von Sanders ordered the Fourth Army to withdraw. They were to move {{without waiting for}} the II Corps/Southern Force, which had also begun to withdraw north from Ma'an and the southern Hejaz railway. The army was in general moving northwards from Amman along the railway towards Deraa by 22 September, where they were ordered to form a rearguard line from Deraa to Irbid. Aerial reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Ottoman army withdrawal from Amman towards Deraa. Ottoman units in the hills to the south west, and a column of all arms, were seen moving from the Es Salt area towards Amman. The aircraft bombed and machine gunned this column, then flew back to <b>report</b> <b>at</b> Ramleh.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, Frederick {{commanded}} 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, {{for a total}} of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited <b>report</b> <b>at</b> first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.|$|E
