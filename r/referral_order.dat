40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{government}} has introduced youth justice policy which claims {{to draw on the}} philosophy of restorative justice as an alternative to punitive sanctions. <b>Referral</b> <b>orders</b> were implemented nationally in 2002 and purportedly represent a significant policy commitment to restorative justice. Rather than incarcerating offenders or deterring them through punishment, <b>referral</b> <b>orders</b> aim to encourage them to understand the consequences of their behaviour, make amends and re-join the law abiding community. This is purportedly achieved through a youth offender panel (panel meeting) run by lay members of the local community along with a member of staff from the youth offending team (YOT). The panel meeting aims to provide a forum away from formal court proceedings to discuss the offence and to agree and construct a contract that the offender must follow. <b>Referral</b> <b>orders</b> therefore present a useful arena in which to explore young offenders’ experiences of restorative justice and to compare this with their experience of the more formal court process. Research has revealed that fair procedures are important in securing people’s compliance with the law and that offenders view restorative processes as fairer than court. However, the majority of research in this area has been done with adults and there is comparatively little research that focuses on young offenders’ perceptions of criminal justice processes. For children, procedural safeguards largely relate to the manner in which adults interact with them. My research therefore explores young people’s experiences with a range of authority figures including: teachers, police officers, magistrates, lay panel members and staff at the YOT. In doing this I aim to consider both how young people perceive the restorative elements of <b>referral</b> <b>orders</b> and more broadly, {{the way in which they}} form judgements of different criminal justice processes and sources of authority...|$|R

40|$|<b>Referral</b> <b>orders</b> were {{introduced}} in 2002 as part of New Labour's first youth justice reforms, for young offenders pleading guilty at their first appearance before the court. The thesis evaluates whether <b>referral</b> <b>orders</b> are, firstly, a genuinely restorative disposal and, secondly, 'successful'. It accomplishes this by: (1) providing a critical {{review of the literature}} on restorative justice and considering how this fits with historical and current approaches to youth crime and the punishment/welfare debate; (2) reporting on the author's empirical findings from 41 panel observations and 55 interviews with 41 young offenders. The thesis finds that although <b>referral</b> <b>orders</b> utilise some restorative processes by the use of panel meetings, inclusion of reparation in the contract and attempt to involve victims in the process, there are significant barriers to truly restorative outcomes. These include lack of court and YOT discretion in utilisation, low victim involvement and few hours of reparation being undertaken. The concept of success in relation to <b>referral</b> <b>orders</b> is found to incorporate three main strands: (1) achieving New Labour's aim of preventing offending; (2) achieving New Labour's goals for restorative justice, defined as 'restoration, reintegration and responsibility'; (3) achieving the more finely-nuanced aspirations for restorative processes and outcomes, as defined by restorative justice proponents. Although the transformative results achieved by restorative justice in other jurisdictions impressed New Labour, which made a genuine attempt to incorporate restorative practices into the criminal justice system, the government missed much of the strength and potential of restorative justice ideology. The thesis argues that restorative justice requires more than including a few, restorative processes into an existing punitive system, reducing offending or even repairing harm. It argues that restorative justice should be perceived in a broader sense, and as a transformative approach to youth crime, which introduces proactive approaches to the significant and deep-rooted personal, welfare and educational needs of young people via social and community interventions.

40|$|From Labour's {{promise to}} be 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime' through to the White Paper and new {{criminal}} justice legislation, controlling crime and reforming {{the criminal justice system}} {{has been one of the}} government's key priorities. Among the many radical changes proposed are two central concerns - developing a more flexible sentencing regime which fits the punishment to the criminal rather than the crime, with a far greater emphasis on community based punishment rather than short jail sentences for non violent offenders; and to restore public confidence in a legal process which many feel rewards the guilty by playing into the hands of skilful defence lawyers, by introducing such measures as the abolition of the 'double jeopardy rule' and reducing the number of jury trials. This book brings together a team of academics and senior criminal justice practitioners to examine some of the broader issues underlying these proposed reforms as well as the past record of the Labour government, focussing on ways of dealing with particular kinds of crime and offenders as well as the broader social and legal context influencing the nature of reform.

Referral strategies, such as automatic referral, have been advocated to improve CR utilization. In this Review, we evaluate the effects of referral strategies on rates of CR referral and enrollment. Referral strategies are categorized as ‘automatic’ (the use of electronic health records or systematic discharge order sets), as ‘liaison’ (discussions with allied healthcare providers), or as ‘other’ (for example, the use of motivational letter to patients). The highest rates of CR referral have been achieved in studies implementing automatic <b>referral</b> <b>orders,</b> whereas {{the highest rates of}} CR enrollment have resulted from a combination of automatic and liaison methods.

40|$|Responsibility is an {{increasingly}} important concept within both political and academic debates about youth justice. As an alternative approach to youth crime, restorative justice ideology has contributed to this debate. Restorative justice {{emphasizes the importance of}} repairing harm by encouraging offenders to address past behaviour and to become responsible for future actions. This article reflects on empirical findings from the author's research with 41 young offenders who were the subjects of <b>Referral</b> <b>Orders,</b> a purportedly restorative disposal. It considers how successfully the English youth justice system has adopted this approach, arguing that there is a significant differ- ence between the theory of restorative justice and its use in practice. To some extent, New Labour's emphasis on the criminal justice system has missed the point behind the ideology of restorative justice and the wider opportunities it offers for a proactively restorative society...|$|R

40|$|Victims’ {{position}} is increasingly acknowledged {{in the criminal}} justice system across the world.

Several programs are highlighted such as victim-offender mediation, family group conferences, reparative <b>orders</b> and <b>referral</b> <b>orders</b> in this article. Findings from several studies support the effectiveness of the programs on both the victims and the offenders in terms of several measurements such as satisfaction and recidivism. Looking at this revolution, Malaysian academicians and professionals are beginning to recognize restorative justice as a possible revolution to its criminal justice system, but Malaysian criminal justice system first needs to strengthen or build components that support victims of crime, as this is one of the main principles of restorative justice. Currently, Malaysia still focuses on offenders and their relationship with legal system, but not much with their own victims (physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of the crime). Several possible issues before formal implementation of restorative justice are discussed. The issues (culture, training, and attitude of Malaysian people, including the victims, offenders, and those who work with them) can influence the efficiency of restorative justice programs if not identified systematically. These issues can also be the possible research areas to be ventured in the future as these researches can help in implementation. </em...|$|R
