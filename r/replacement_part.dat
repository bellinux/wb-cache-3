5|$|While {{performing}} a test run prior to the park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck {{near the top of}} the lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

25|$|On 2–3 July 2005, American adventurer Steve Fossett and {{co-pilot}} Mark Rebholz recreated {{the flight}} in {{a replica of}} the Vickers Vimy aeroplane. They did not land in the bog near Clifden, but a few miles away on the Connemara golf course. They had to call on the services of a local motor mechanic to fabricate a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> from materials at hand.|$|E

500|$|Kelly and {{his crew}} {{delivered}} the pressurized module for Kibo to the ISS. The module is the largest component of the Kibo laboratory and the station's largest habitable module. Discovery also delivered Kibo's Remote Manipulator System. Perhaps {{the most important part}} they delivered was a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> for the station's toilet. The single toilet on the ISS had been malfunctioning for a week, creating a potentially serious problem for the crew. When Kelly first entered the station, he joked, [...] "You looking for a plumber?", referring to the broken toilet.|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E
2500|$|The P7K3 is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the P7 (inspired by the HK4 pistol) that uses straight blowback for operation. This version has a removable barrel and uses a sealed hydraulic recoil buffer {{in place of a}} gas cylinder. After swapping out the barrel and magazine it can use [...]380 ACP (9×17mm Short) or [...]32 ACP (7.65×17mm Browning SR) pistol cartridges and after replacing the slide, magazine and barrel (with floating chamber insert)—it {{can also be used to}} fire [...]22 LR (5.6mm Long Rifle) ammunition. The hydraulic recoil buffer of the P7K3 is prone to wear and causes a serious problem to operate the gun when it is worn down. Heckler & Koch does not make a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> for the buffer. However, there are some commercial buffers available. When the [...]22 LR slide and barrel are installed, the buffer is not engaged.|$|E

5000|$|Economically, {{there is}} a {{tradeoff}} between the cost of ordering a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> {{and the cost of}} repairing a failed part.

Analysis of economic tradeoffs is formally evaluated using Level of Repair Analysis (LORA).|$|E
