50|$|The {{debate that}} has {{dominated}} Marxism between disproportionality theories, underconsumptionist theories, and falling rate of profit theories of crisis {{has really been}} a red herring. A crisis arises when capitalists face a fall in their <b>realised</b> <b>profit</b> which can arise for all manner of reasons, but the precipitating cause of any particular crisis is inconsequential. Although all three aspects of disproportionality, underconsumptionist and the tendency for the rate of profit to fall {{play a role in}} determining the vulnerability of capitalism to crisis, the underlying cause of all crises remains the fundamental contradiction on which the capitalist mode of production is based, the contradiction between the production of things and the production of value, and the subordination of the former to the latter.|$|E
50|$|Investment {{banks that}} offer this product usually take a riskless {{position}} by hedging the client's {{position with the}} underlying asset. For example, the client may trade a swap - say Vodafone. The bank credits the client with 1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45. The bank pays the return on this investment to the client, but also buys the stock in the same quantity for its own trading book (1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45). Any equity-leg return paid to or due from the client is offset against <b>realised</b> <b>profit</b> or loss on its own investment in the underlying asset. The bank makes its money through commissions, interest spreads and dividend rake-off (paying the client less of the dividend than it receives itself). It may also use the hedge position stock (1,000 Vodafone in this example) {{as part of a}} funding transaction such as stock lending,repo or as collateral for a loan.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} carried-out to analyse {{the effect of}} high {{corporate}} tax rate on the profitability of corporate organizations in Nigeria. The related literatures were reviewed. The population of study comprises the selected corporate organizations while the sample size {{of the study is}} fourty one (41). Taro Yamane sampling technique was adopted because it ensures a satisfactory degree of representativeness and un-biasness. A number of statistical tools including tables and Regression were used to analysed the data and test the hypothesis formulated. Our analysis of data revealed that, the study depicts a direct positive relationship between corporate tax rate and <b>realised</b> <b>profit.</b> It is therefore, recommended that, the Nigeria corporate tax rate of 30 % should be reduce below OECD average corporate tax rate of 25. 32 % to avert the negative economic effects of high corporate tax rate on the long-run and also the Nigerian tax system should be change from classical system to imputation system to avoid economic double taxation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{interaction}} between profits and efficiency {{in a sample of}} 17 Irish banks, for the years 1988 - 1991 inclusive. By contrast with previous techniques used for assessing economic models of efficiency, the method employed allows for a finer decomposition of profit loss. This loss can be attributed to allocative or technical inefficiency, and these can be derived both for inputs and outputs. Relying on the use of shadow prices, as it does, this technique allows us to make some interesting observations about the relative availability of firm-specific data in different research regimes. The results of the modelling process indicate that there is a substantial degree of loss arising in the Irish banking system. This is estimated as being an amount equal to approximately 20 per cent of the total <b>realised</b> <b>profit.</b> Most of the loss arises from input technical inefficiency i. e. poor planning on the input side of the production process. A by-product of the process is a new test for economies of scope; there is no evidence from the data that there are economies of scope for Irish banks. This is in line with previous findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to present a model of a dairy cattle production system for the derivation of economic values and their standard deviations for both production and functional traits under Danish production circumstances. The stochastic model used is dynamic, and simulates production and health in a dairy herd. Because of indirect effects between traits, the phenotypic levels of (related) traits can change as a result of genetic changes. Economic values for milk production and body weight were 0. 28 and - 0. 76 euro/kg per cow-year respectively. For incidence of milk fever, mastitis, retained placenta and laminitis economic values were - 402. 1, - 162. 5, - 79. 0 and - 210. 2 euro/incidence per cow-year. The economic values for involuntary culling rate, stillbirth and conception rate were - 6. 66, - 1. 63, and 1. 98 euro/% per cow-year, respectively and the economic value for days from calving to first heat was - 0. 94 euro/day per cow-year. Standard deviations of economic values expressing variation in <b>realised</b> <b>profit</b> of a farm before and after a genetic change were computed using a linear Taylor series expansion. Expressed as coefficient of variation, standard deviations of economic values based on 1000 replicates ranged between 0. 07 (milk production) to 16 (retained placenta...|$|E
30|$|Concerning {{access to}} market information, {{only about half}} of the {{participants}} attributed the services to business incubators. This implies that most women food processors do not receive the needed market information, which is a pre-requisite to compete in a strong competitive market environment and to <b>realise</b> <b>profits</b> in the presence of their counterpart producers of similar products (Kyaruzi & Hales, 2009). Consequently, we argue that the contextualisation of the incubators’ services could make a stronger difference for most of the incubatees when providing access to market information.|$|R
40|$|The term {{cultural}} industries indicates the combined processes of creation, mass {{production and distribution}} of cultural goods and services on an industrial- commercial level, that is to say, {{on a large scale}} with the main goal of <b>realising</b> <b>profits.</b> This notion generally includes text, music, television and cinema production and marketing, as well as architecture, design, the visual and performing arts, sport, advertising and tourism.

50|$|Until {{payment from}} sales is received, it is {{uncertain}} {{how much of the}} surplus-value produced will actually be <b>realised</b> as <b>profit</b> from sales. So, the magnitude of <b>profit</b> <b>realised</b> in the form of money and the magnitude of surplus-value produced in the form of products may differ greatly, depending on what happens to market prices and the vagaries of supply and demand fluctuations. This insight forms the basis of Marx's theory of market value, prices of production and the tendency of the rate of profit of different enterprises to be levelled out by competition.|$|R
40|$|Tight oligopolies are oligopolies {{the market}} {{characteristics}} of which facilitate the realisation of supranormal profits {{for a substantial}} period of time. We entangle the link between market structure {{and the possibility of}} welfare reducing behaviour by firms. A useful distinction can be made between ‘unilateral effects' (oligopolistic firms <b>realise</b> supra-normal <b>profits</b> without co-ordinating their strategies) and ‘co-ordinated effects' (oligopolistic firms <b>realise</b> supra-normal <b>profits</b> by co-ordinating their strategies). The study develops a ‘diagnostic approach', a tool that helps policy makers find proportionate remedies to tight oligopolies: (1) ‘prevent' a market from becoming a tight oligopoliy; (2) ‘cure' a currently tight oligopoly by changing the market structure; and (3) treat the symptoms of an established tight oligopoly. We apply this diagnostic approach to six cases of (potentially) tight oligopolies. ...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the concept}} of "adaptively {{rational}} equilibrium", Brock and Hommes establish a simple present discounted value asset-pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs. Agents adapt their beliefs over time by choosing from different predictors or expectations functions, based upon their past performance as measured by <b>realised</b> <b>profits.</b> As the intensity of choice to switch predictors increases, they have observed several bifurcation routes to complicated asset-price fluctuations. In this paper we extend this model to incorporate different risk attitudes {{of different types of}} investors and allow for more sophisticated learning schemes. Using both bifurcation theory and numerical analysis, we investigate the effects on the dynamics of the model of different risk aversion coefficients and different learning schemes. We also systematically investigate the effect of external noise on the system. We find that the resulting dynamical behaviour is considerably enriched and has some significant differences compared to the original Brock-Hommes analysis. ...|$|R

We investigate the role of pricing in the importers', exporter's or a third currency in a simple model with pre-set prices. The firm of study is a risk neutral monopolist exporter who faces a linear demand curbe. Expected prices, quantities and profits depend on the price setting currency chosen.

25|$|The {{holder of}} an American style call option can sell his option holding {{at any time}} until the {{expiration}} date, and would consider doing so when the stock's spot price is above the exercise price, especially if he expects {{the price of the}} option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can <b>realise</b> an immediate <b>profit.</b> Alternatively, he can exercise the option — for example, if there is no secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock, <b>realising</b> a <b>profit.</b> A trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the exercise price is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the spot price of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the procedures used to set up the subsidy prices and evaluate the prices and quantity allocations given to distributors in order to measure their impact on the financial performances of the distributors. Two fertilizer trading companies, MIs Tanzania Fertilizer Company Ltd and MIs Premium Agro Chern Ltd were taken as case studies. The data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using tables, ratios and trend analysis. Excel computer program was used to analyse the data and illustrating them by using figures and graphs. The findings indicated that the distributors' businesses will not <b>realise</b> <b>profits</b> and attain growth unless the subsidy prices set by the government are equal or higher than their commercial prices, and that the quantities allocated to them are equal to their budgeted sales volumes or are above their break-even volumes. The researcher recommends a review of the current price setting procedures and quantity allocation criteria to improve the distributors' financial performances and to achieve the government {{objective of}} the scheme. The researcher also recommends a country importation schedule, standards for subsidy fertilizer distributors and having own fertilizer plant. While the policy of subsidizing fertilizers to our farmers is good for the country's food security programmes and increase in foreign exchange earnings, the recommended measures would streamline the administration of the scheme, ensure reliability in fertilizer supplies, provide feedback and facilitate policy analysis...|$|R
