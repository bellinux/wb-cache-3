Subsequently, the temperature variation characteristics of the solar cell module were accurately modeled and simulated by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. Compared to the results of test samples, the solar cell module described here guaranteed effective output as well as good heat insulating ability, effectively improving the feasibility of the stratospheric airship design. In addition, the simulation model can effectively simulate the temperature variation characteristics of the solar cell, which, therefore, provides technical support for the engineering application...|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} STS-109 was {{to service the}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It was Columbia's first flight {{following}} an extensive {{two and a half}} year modification period (its most recent mission being STS-93). During the mission the crew installed a new science instrument, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), new <b>rigid</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> (SA3), a new Power Control Unit (PCU) and an experimental cryocooler for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). Columbia also reboosted HST to a higher orbit.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuing}} development of microsatellites and nanosatellites for low Earth orbits requires {{the collection of}} sufficient power for instruments onboard a low-weight, low-volume spacecraft. Because the overall surface area of a microsatellite or nanosatellite is small, body-mounted solar cells cannot provide enough power. The deployment of traditional, <b>rigid,</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> necessitates larger satellite volumes and weights, and also requires extra apparatus for pointing. One solution to this power choke problem is the deployment of a spherical, inflatable power system. This power system, termed the "PowerSphere," has several advantages, including a high collection area, low weight and stowage volume, {{and the elimination of}} <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> pointing mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{footage from}} {{the third day of}} the STS- 109 mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) begins with the {{grappling}} of the HST by the robotic arm of the Columbia Orbiter, operated by Mission Specialist Nancy Currie. During the grappling, numerous angles deliver close-up images of the telescope which appears to be in good shape despite many years in orbit around the Earth. Following the positioning of the HST on its berthing platform in the Shuttle bay, the robotic arm is used to perform an external survey of the telescope. Some cursory details are given about different equipment which will be installed on the HST including a replacement cooling system for the Near Infrared Camera Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) and the Advanced Camera for Surveys.

He answers {{questions about his}} lifelong desire to become an astronaut and his career path, which included becoming a zoo veterinarian. He gives details on the Columbia Orbiter mission, which has as its main purpose the maintenance and augmentation of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). As MS 3, his primary role in the mission pertains to EVAs (Extravehicular Activities) 1, 3, and 5. During EVA 1, Linnehan and another crewmember will replace one of two flexible solar arrays on the HST with a smaller, more efficient <b>rigid</b> <b>solar</b> <b>array.</b> The second solar array will be replaced on EVA 2 by other crewmembers. EVA 3 will involve {{the replacement of the}} Power Control Unit (PCU), and will require the first complete powering down of HST since its deployment.

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{advancement of}} microsatellites and nanosatellites for space application has identified {{a need for}} an innovative, simple, low mass, and low packing volume <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> system for this class of satellites. As microsatellites and nanosatellites become more capable, their demand for power also increases. The result of decreasing satellite size, thus surface area, and increasing power demand is the inevitable problem of “power choke ” on satellite systems with body-mounted solar cells. The use of traditional, <b>rigid,</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> necessitates larger stowage volume and mass, and also requires gimbals for pointing. In previous studies, the “PowerSphere ” <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> system {{has been identified as}} one of the solutions to this “power choke” problem. This power system has several advantages over the traditional system, including lower mass, lower stowage volume, and the elimination of the pointing mechanism. The development of PowerSphere multifunctional ultraviolet-rigidizable (UV-rigidizable) inflatable structures will be beneficial not only to micro- and nanosatellites; it will enable the advancement of Gossamer type structures. Given the requirements of PowerSphere to be low mass, low packing volume, and low power for deployment, ultraviolet (UV) cured composite (i. e. UV-rigidizable) materials have been identified as the optimal candidate for this application. In conjunction with UV-rigidizable material, these structures incorporate thin film flex-circuit to make them multifunctional. Two multifunctional structures in the PowerSphere system will utilize the UV-rigidizable material, namely the inflatable hinge and the inflatable isogrid center column. The PowerSphere team, which is assembled collaboratively from Aerospace, ILC Dover, Lockheed Martin, and NASA Glenn, has made significant advancements in the development of multifunctional UV rigidizable inflatable structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of {{a significant number of}} spacecraft has been impacted negatively by attitude disturbances resulting from thermally-induced motions of flexible structures. Recent examples of spacecraft affected by these disturbances include the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). Thermally-induced structural disturbances occur as the result of rapid changes in thermal loading typically initiated as a satellite exits or enters the Earth's shadow. Temperature differences in flexible appendages give rise to structural deformations, which in turn result in disturbance torques reacting back on the spacecraft. Structures which have proven susceptible to these disturbances include deployable booms and <b>solar</b> <b>arrays.</b> This paper investigates disturbances resulting from thermally-induced deformations of <b>rigid</b> panel <b>solar</b> <b>arrays.</b> An analytical model for the thermal-structural response of the <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> and the corresponding disturbance torque are presented. The effect of these disturbances on the attitude dynamics of a simple spacecraft is then investigated using a coupled system of governing equations which includes the effects of thermally-induced deformations. Numerical results demonstrate the effect of varying <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> geometry on the dynamic response of the system...|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Disturbance Verification Test (DVT) was {{conducted}} to characterize responses of the Observatory's new set of <b>rigid</b> <b>solar</b> <b>array's</b> (SA 3) to thermally induced 'creak' or stiction releases. The data acquired in the DVT were used in verification of the HST Pointing Control System on-orbit performance, post-Servicing Mission 3 B (SM 3 B). The test simulated the on-orbit environment on a deployed SA 3 flight wing. Instrumentation for this test required pretest simulations in order to select the correct sensitivities. Vacuum compatible, highly accurate accelerometers and force gages were used for this test. The complexity of the test, {{as well as a}} short planning schedule, required a data acquisition system that was easy to configure, highly flexible, and extremely robust. A PC Windows oriented data acquisition system meets these requirements, allowing the test engineers to minimize the time required to plan and perform complex environmental test. The SA 3 DVT provided a direct practical and complex demonstration of the versatility that PC based data acquisition systems provide. Two PC based data acquisition systems were assembled to acquire, process, distribute, and provide real time processing for several types of transducers used in the SA 3 DVT. A high sample rate digital tape recorder was used to archive the sensor signals. The two systems provided multi-channel hardware and software architecture and were selected based on the test requirements. How these systems acquire and processes multiple data rates from different transducer types is discussed, along with the system hardware and software architecture...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the design of <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> {{substrate}} for a geostationary satellite. The design of deployable <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> substrate is realized based on the requirements which are provided by BILUZAY (Bilkent University Space Technologies Research Centre). This array is going to empower a telecommunication satellite which will be operating in a geostationary orbit during 15 years. The main work presented in this thesis consists of two principal directions: <b>solar</b> cell <b>array</b> area dimensioning and structural design and analysis of its substrate under launch loads. First of all, based on the power requirements of the satellite, total area of the <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> is calculated considering eclipse time, worst case scenarios for voltage and power output.

40|$|A {{brief summary}} is {{presented}} of a NASA study contract and in-house investigation on Growth Space Station missions and appropriate nuclear and solar space electric power systems. By the year 2000 some 300 kWe {{will be needed}} for missions and housekeeping power for a 12 to 18 person Station crew. Several Space Station configurations employing nuclear reactor power systems are discussed, including shielding requirements and power transmission schemes. Advantages of reactor power include a greatly simplified Station orientation procedure, greatly reduced occultation of views {{of the earth and}} deep space, near elimination of energy storage requirements, and significantly reduced station-keeping propellant mass due to very low drag of the reactor power system.
