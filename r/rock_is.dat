5|$|Psychedelic <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> {{a diverse}} style of rock music inspired, influenced, or {{representative}} of psychedelic culture, which is centred around perception-changing hallucinogenic drugs. Psychedelic <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> intended to replicate {{and enhance the}} mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often used indiscriminately.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> greywacke, {{followed}} by other types of sandstones and shales. Landslides and mass wasting are common in this region due to erosion as well as earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|Siliciclastic {{sedimentary}} <b>rocks,</b> <b>are</b> dominantly {{composed of}} silicate minerals. The sediment {{that makes up}} these <b>rocks</b> <b>was</b> transported as bed load, suspended load, or by sediment gravity flows. Siliciclastic sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> subdivided into conglomerates and breccias, sandstone, and mudrocks.|$|R
50|$|Pyroclastic <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{the product}} of {{explosive}} volcanism. They are often felsic (high in silica). Pyroclastic <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> often the result of volcanic debris, such as ash, bombs and tephra, and other volcanic ejecta. Examples of pyroclastic <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> tuff and ignimbrite.|$|R
50|$|Pawnee <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1874. It was named from the {{historic}} landmark Pawnee Rock nearby. Pawnee <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> incorporated in 1887.|$|R
5|$|Alongside their {{critical}} acclaim and strong {{success in the}} charts, Editors have consistently enjoyed sold-out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. Their brand of dark indie <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> commonly compared {{to the sound of}} bands such as Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Interpol, The Chameleons and U2.|$|E
5|$|Hard <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> a loosely defined subgenre of {{rock music}} {{that began in}} the mid-1960s, with the garage, {{psychedelic}} and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, The <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> listed No. 5 on Entertainment Weekly's Top 12 Entertainers of the Year. In 2000, on an Access Hollywood’s prime-time special, The <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> ranked {{number six}} in the Top 10 Celebrities Of 2000. <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> also listed in Forbes Celebrity 100 that year and People Magazine's 25 Most Intriguing People.|$|R
50|$|Sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> further {{classified}} by {{whether they are}} siliciclastic or carbonate. Siliciclastic sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> then subcategorized based on their grain size distribution and the relative proportions of quartz, feldspar, and lithic (rock) fragments. Carbonate <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> classified with the Dunham or Folk classification schemes according to the constituents of the carbonate rock.|$|R
40|$|This <b>rock</b> cycle unit <b>was</b> {{designed}} {{to be used with}} a college course in physical geography. From this module, students learn to distinguish between minerals and <b>rocks,</b> how <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> classified, and how <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> constantly recycled providing raw materials for other <b>rocks.</b> Igneous <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> discussed on the basis of being intrusive or extrusive, sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> divided into clastic and non-clastic, while the metamorphic <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> described as being foliated or non-foliated and common examples are cited for each classification. The processes and conditions of <b>rock</b> formation <b>are</b> also discussed. The module contains a study guide and outline notes, study questions, and a practice quiz. One feature of the module is a web exploration section with links to fifteen outside sites that augment the instruction. Educational levels: High school, Middle school, Undergraduate lower division...|$|R
5|$|The Rock was {{the first}} wrestler to win the WWF/E Championship six times, then seven times. Rock's Intercontinental Championship's reign in 1997–98 lasted 265 days and is the longest {{intercontinental}} title reign of the modern era (the last 24 years). <b>Rock</b> <b>is</b> the only wrestler to introduce a different design of both the Intercontinental Championship (shortly after WrestleMania XIV) and the WWE Championship (on February 18, 2013 episode of Raw).|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{program is}} {{considering}} {{options for the}} siting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal, and for low & intermediate level wastes. Construction of a repository is not foreseen until well into this century. Research on sedimentary rock (especially Opalinus Clay) is carried out at the Swiss Mont Terri rock laboratory; the Grimsel Test Site, an older facility in crystalline <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> also still active.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It {{is well suited}} for the foundations of tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat <b>Rock</b> <b>is</b> one rather large example.|$|E
50|$|Volcano <b>Rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{no longer}} {{available}} and information on the original candy is scarce and often misleads some to believe Pop <b>Rocks</b> <b>are</b> a viable substitute.|$|R
50|$|Three {{major groups}} of <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> defined: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The {{scientific}} study of <b>rocks</b> <b>is</b> called petrology, which is {{an essential component of}} geology.|$|R
50|$|While {{businesses}} in Black <b>Rock</b> <b>are</b> located primarily along Fairfield Avenue, {{most of the}} 2,628 properties in Black <b>Rock</b> <b>are</b> for residential use. Residences comprise 86% of properties in Black <b>Rock,</b> 10% <b>is</b> commercial, and only 4% are industrial or other property classes.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} rock {{constituents}} of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important {{exceptions to this}} and their total amount in any <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.|$|E
5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as may {{be seen on the}} Orkney Mainland, where a narrow strip of the older <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again on the small island of Graemsay.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{takes place}} in the three mountainous regions at 45 {{distinct}} coal beds near Mesozoic basins. Over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, sand, or gravel, were also mined in Virginia in 2012. The state's carbonate <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism. 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region.|$|E
50|$|Arthur and Toni Rembe <b>Rock</b> <b>are</b> another big-time donor to TFA. The <b>Rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{listed as}} Champion Donors on the organization's website, having donated more than $5 million.|$|R
50|$|In 1948-49 <b>Rocks</b> <b>were</b> drawn home to Thornbury Town in the G.F.A Senior Amateur Cup, {{there were}} 400 spectators {{at the game}} but <b>Rocks</b> <b>were</b> firmly beaten 4-0.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the exposed}} {{shoreline}} Malmesbury <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> steeply dipped, and weathered to form sharp edged ridges where more resistant layers stand {{out among the}} softer strata. The <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> generally dark in colour where fresh <b>rock</b> has <b>been</b> exposed by erosion, and may be finely laminated.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its limited}} {{distribution}} and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, {{little is known}} of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> covered with thin soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), {{also known}} by his ring name The <b>Rock,</b> <b>is</b> an American actor, {{producer}} and professional wrestler. Johnson {{was a college}} football player for the University of Miami, where he won a national championship on the 1991 Miami Hurricanes team. After being cut from the Calgary Stampeders of CFL two months into the 1995 season, Johnson began training {{for a career in}} professional wrestling, {{following in the footsteps of}} various family members, including his grandfather and his father, Rocky Johnson, from whom he inherited Canadian citizenship in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero III: Legends of <b>Rock</b> <b>is</b> a music rhythm game, {{the third}} main {{installment}} in the Guitar Hero series, {{and the fourth}} title overall. The game was published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane. It is the first game in the series to be developed by Neversoft after Activision's acquisition of RedOctane and MTV Games' purchase of Harmonix, the previous development studio for the series. The game was released worldwide for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 in October 2007, with Budcat Creations assisting Neversoft on developing the PlayStation 2 port and Vicarious Visions solely developing on the Wii port respectively. Aspyr Media published the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X versions of the game, releasing them later in 2007.|$|E
50|$|At a {{granular}} level, <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{composed of}} grains of minerals, which, in turn, are homogeneous solids formed from a chemical compound that is arranged {{in an orderly}} manner. The aggregate minerals forming the <b>rock</b> <b>are</b> held together by chemical bonds. The types and abundance of minerals in a <b>rock</b> <b>are</b> determined by {{the manner in which}} the <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> formed. Many <b>rocks</b> contain silica (SiO2); a compound of silicon and oxygen that forms 74.3% of the Earth's crust. This material forms crystals with other compounds in the rock. The proportion of silica in <b>rocks</b> and minerals <b>is</b> a major factor in determining their name and properties.|$|R
50|$|Castle <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1874 when the eastern Douglas County border was redrawn to its present location. Castle <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> {{chosen as the}} county seat because of its central location.|$|R
50|$|In 1831 the Town of Little <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> {{incorporated}} and Dr. Matthew Cunningham won {{the first}} mayoral election. In 1835 Little <b>Rock</b> <b>was</b> incorporated as the first City in the Arkansas Territory. The Little <b>Rock</b> Police Department <b>was</b> established in 1866 and in 1892 the first paid Little <b>Rock</b> Fire Department <b>was</b> created.|$|R
5|$|Hard <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar {{works in conjunction with}} the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Table Rock area for at least 15,000years, based on the age of Clovis points that were {{discovered}} nearby. The region surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as acorns and tarweed seeds, and caught salmon in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing. They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani ("rock above"), Titanakh ("little Indian plums"), and possibly Kwenphunkh. The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table <b>Rock</b> <b>is</b> unknown, however the first recorded use was by mountain man James Clyman in 1845.|$|E
5000|$|The Fortuna <b>Rocks</b> (...) <b>are</b> a {{small group}} of rocks {{extending}} across {{the east side of the}} entrance to Fortuna Bay along the north coast of South Georgia. These <b>rocks</b> <b>were</b> indicated on a chart by the Second German Antarctic Expedition under Wilhelm Filchner, who examined Fortuna Bay in 1911-12. The name Fortuna <b>Rocks</b> <b>was</b> in use prior to 1920 and derives from nearby Fortuna Bay.|$|R
5000|$|Right Whale <b>Rocks</b> (...) <b>is</b> a {{group of}} rocks 0.25 {{nautical}} miles (0.5 km) north of Barff Point, at {{the east side of}} the entrance to Cumberland Bay, South Georgia. The name Merton <b>Rocks</b> <b>was</b> used for this feature on a chart of Cumberland Bay by personnel of HMS Sappho in 1906, but the name Right Whale <b>Rocks</b> <b>is</b> retained because of wider and more recent acceptance.|$|R
25|$|Igneous <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} Bukit Timah and Woodlands and Pulau Ubin island. Granite {{makes up the}} bulk of the igneous <b>rock.</b> Gabbro <b>is</b> also found in the area and is found in an area called Little Guilin named for its {{resemblance}} to Guilin in Southern China.This area is in Bukit Gombak. Sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> found on the western part of Singapore and is mainly made of sandstone and mudstones. It also includes the southwestern area. Metamorphic <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> found in the northeastern part of Singapore and also on Pulau Tekong off the east coast of Singapore. The <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> mainly made up of quartzite and also make up the Sajahat Formation.|$|R
