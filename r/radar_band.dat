2500|$|Most recently, the President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST) {{advocated}} {{the sharing of}} (uncleared) federal radio spectrum when unused at a place and time provided it does not pose undue risks. [...] Following PCAST's recommendations, President Obama made shared spectrum {{the policy of the}} United States on 14 June 2013 Shared Spectrum. [...] As of Dec 2014 the FCC was extending the limited success of television band spectrum sharing (TV white space) into other bands, significantly into the 3550-3700 MHz US Navy <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> via a three tier licensing model (incumbent, priority, and general access) while Europe has been pursuing an authorized shared access (ASA) licensing model.|$|E
50|$|Their {{characteristics}} are {{defined in the}} ITU-R Recommendation M.824, Technical Parameters of Radar Beacons (RACONS). Racons usually operate on the 9320 MHz to 9500 MHz marine <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> (X-band), and most also operate on the 2920 MHz to 3100 MHz marine <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> (S-band). Modern racons are frequency-agile; they have a wide-band receiver that detects the incoming radar pulse, tunes the transmitter and responds with a 25 microsecond long signal within 700 nanoseconds.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} nanoparticle composite NiFe 2 O 4 {{has traditionally}} been studied for high-frequency microwave absorption with marginal performance towards low-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>bands</b> (particularly L and S bands). Here, NiFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles and nanohybrids using large-diameter graphene oxide (GO) sheets are prepared via solvothermal synthesis for low-frequency wide bandwidth shielding (L and S <b>radar</b> <b>bands).</b> The synthesized materials were characterized using XRD, SEM, FTIR and microwave magneto dielectric spectroscopy. The dimension of these solvothermally synthesized pristine particles and hybrids lies within 30 - 58 nm. Microwave magneto-dielectric spectroscopy was performed in the low-frequency region in the 1 MHz- 3 GHz spectrum. The as-synthesized pristine nanoparticles and hybrids {{were found to be}} highly absorbing for microwaves throughout the L and S <b>radar</b> <b>bands</b> (4 GHz) with limited selective bandwidth...|$|R

5000|$|P band is {{sometimes}} used for Ku Band. [...] "P" [...] for [...] "previous" [...] was a <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> {{used in the}} UK ranging from 250 to 500 MHz and now obsolete per IEEE Std 521.|$|E
50|$|The IEEE {{defines the}} UHF <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> as {{frequencies}} between 300 MHz and 1 GHz. Two other IEEE radar bands overlap the ITU UHF band: the L band between 1 and 2 GHz and the S band between 2 and 4 GHz.|$|E
50|$|A radar gun, {{typically}} used {{for measuring the}} speed of cars or balls in sports, is usually calibrated with tuning forks. Instead of the frequency, these forks are labeled with the calibration speed and <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> (e.g. X-Band or K-Band) {{for which they are}} calibrated.|$|E
50|$|They are {{wide-band}} beacons which transmit either {{continuously or periodically}} on the <b>radar</b> <b>bands.</b> The transmission forms a line of Morse {{characters on}} a plan position indicator radar display which radiates from {{the centre of the}} display to its edge.|$|R
25|$|Originally, the AN/SPY-3 active {{electronically}} scanned array primarily X <b>band</b> <b>radar</b> was to {{be married}} with Lockheed Martin's AN/SPY-4 S <b>band</b> volume search <b>radar.</b> Raytheon's X-band, active-array SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar (MFR) offers superior medium to high altitude performance over other <b>radar</b> <b>bands,</b> and its pencil beams give it an excellent ability to focus in on targets. SPY-3 will be the primary radar used for missile engagements. A 2005 report by Congress' investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), questioned that the technology leap for the Dual <b>Band</b> <b>Radar</b> would be too much.|$|R
50|$|Ramarks are {{wide-band}} beacons which transmit continuously on the <b>radar</b> <b>bands</b> {{without having}} to be triggered by an incoming radar signal. The transmission forms a line of Morse characters on the display radiating from {{the centre of the}} display to its edge. They are not used in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The main knob {{also allows}} users to enter the custom {{programming}} menu, {{not mentioned in the}} user's manual.

5000|$|The Russian Nakidka {{camouflage}} kit {{was designed}} to reduce the Optical, Thermal, Infrared, and Radar signatures of a tank, so that acquisition of the tank would be difficult. According to Nii Stali, the designers of Nakidka, Nakidka would reduce the probabilities of detection via [...] "visual and near-IR bands by 30%, the thermal band by 2-3 fold, <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> by 6 fold, and radar-thermal band to near-background levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} stealth coating were the materials called Sumpf and Schornsteinfeger, a coating {{used by the}} German navy during World War II for the snorkels (or periscopes) of submarines, to lower their reflectivity in the 20-cm <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> the Allies used. The material had a layered structure and was based on graphite particles and other semiconductive materials embedded in a rubber matrix. The material's efficiency was partially reduced {{by the action of}} sea water.|$|E

50|$|There is also {{a surface}} <b>radar</b> SPS-702, X <b>band,</b> {{the latest version of}} a type which has been quite {{successful}} and with all solid-state electronics. Finally there is a navigation <b>radar,</b> with X <b>band,</b> in the forward tree.|$|R
50|$|By August 1942 U-boats {{were being}} fitted with radar {{detectors}} {{to enable them}} to avoid sudden ambushes by radar-equipped aircraft or ships. The first such receiver, named Metox after its French manufacturer, was capable of picking up the metric <b>radar</b> <b>bands</b> used by the early radars. This not only enabled U-boats to avoid detection by Canadian escorts, which were equipped with obsolete radar sets, but allowed them to track convoys where these sets were in use.|$|R
50|$|The WP-3Ds are {{equipped}} with three weather <b>radars,</b> C <b>band</b> <b>radars</b> in the nose and on the lower fuselage, and an X-band radar in the aircraft's tail. They are also equipped {{with the ability to}} deploy dropsondes into storm systems, and have onboard temperature sensors, and other meteorological equipment. The aircraft are not specially strengthened for flying into hurricanes, however their decks were reinforced to withstand the additional equipment load.|$|R
5000|$|Microwaves are {{a form of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter; with frequencies between 300 MHz cm and 300 GHz cm. [...] Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave) bands. A more common definition in radio engineering is the range between 1 and 100 GHz (300 and 3 mm). [...] In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum. Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> designations: S, C, X, Ku, K, or Ka band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the market}} the RWR system is {{designed}} for, {{it can be as}} simple as detecting the presence of energy in a specific <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> (such as police radar detectors). For more critical situations, such as military combat, RWR systems are often capable of classifying the source of the radar by the signal's strength, phase and waveform type, such as pulsed power wave or continuous wave with amplitude modulation or frequency modulation (chirped). The information about the signal's strength and waveform can then be used to estimate the most probable type of threat the detected radar poses. Simpler systems are typically installed in less expensive assets like automobiles, while more sophisticated systems are installed in mission critical assets such as military aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Shrike's {{limitations}} are characterized {{primarily in the}} fact that subvariants abound, each tuned to a different <b>radar</b> <b>band.</b> Angle gating, used to prioritize targets, was included in every subvariant of the AGM-45A and B after the A-2 and B-2. It was also slow and the lack of punch in the warhead made it difficult for bomb damage assessment, as well as inflicting any damage to the Fan Song Radar vans beyond a shattered radar dish, an easy item to replace or repair. The short range, combined with its lack of speed (compared to the SA-2 SAM) made for a difficult attack. The missile had to be well within the range of the SAM and if a SAM was fired the SAM would get to the aircraft first. Also the missile had few tolerances and had to be launched no more than + or − 3 degrees from the target. Many pilots in Vietnam did not like the Shrike because of its limitations and its success rate of around 25%.|$|E
40|$|An extratropical cyclone {{associated}} with the subtropical jet stream and the interaction of continental polar and maritime tropical air masses originated in the subtropics and moved northeastward off the East Coast of the United States. The storm moved first parallel to, and then briefly over {{the center of the}} Gulf Stream. As it moved over the warmest water of the Gulf Stream, its inner core appeared on radar to be similar to a tropical cyclone. There was a strong correlation between the <b>radar</b> <b>banding</b> and weather resembling that experienced in the spiral bands of hurricanes...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the passive and active protection systems the T-90 is also fitted with nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection equipment, KMT mine sweeps and an automatic fire suppression system. The EMT-7 electromagnetic-counter mine system can also be installed on the T-90. EMT-7 emits an electromagnetic pulse to disable magnetic mines and disrupt electronics before the tank reaches them. The Nakidka signature reduction suite is also available for the T-90. Nakidka is designed to reduce the probabilities of an object to be detected by Infrared, Thermal, Radar-Thermal, and <b>Radar</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel two-port, {{dual-band}} square-ring {{microstrip antenna}} element for wide-angle scanning planar phased array is proposed. The two ports {{are used to}} operate the antenna array over the L and S <b>radar</b> <b>bands.</b> Microstrip square-ring radiators are chosen due to their smaller dimensions compared to the conventional microstrip patch. To extend operational bandwidth, the square rings placed into a single layer are fed by small coupling patches. The antenna elements demonstrate consistent radiation patterns and sufficient bandwidths in both operational bands. Due to its dimensions, the element is well-suited for application to wide-scan phased arrays. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{utility of}} radar scatterometers for {{discrimination}} and characterization of natural vegetation was investigated. Backscatter measurements were acquired with airborne multi-frequency, multi-polarization, multi-angle radar scatterometers over a test site {{in a southern}} temperate forest. Separability between ground cover classes was studied using a two-class separability measure. Very good separability is achieved between most classes. Longer wavelength is useful in separating trees from non-tree classes, while shorter wavelength and cross polarization are helpful for discrimination among tree classes. Using the maximum likelihood classifier, 50 % overall classification accuracy is achieved using a single, short-wavelength scatterometer channel. Addition of multiple incidence angles and another <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> improves classification accuracy by 20 % and 50 %, respectively, over the single channel accuracy. Incorporation of a third <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> seems redundant for vegetation classification. Vertical transmit polarization is critically important for all classes...|$|E
40|$|Millimeterwave radar sensors are netted {{to cover}} a {{sufficient}} region of an airport and deliver as well information on position as classification of debris. To be able to miniaturize the antenna assembly, which is critical for the vicinity of a runway, the 220 -GHz <b>radar</b> <b>band</b> is used. Use of this band also allows to achieve a wide signal bandwidth and consequently a high range resolution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The flood plains {{along the}} major rivers of West Africa are a {{potentially}} important agricultural resource. Satellite-based radar imagery {{can be used}} for characterization of flood patterns. Using dry and wet season Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-C) imagery, flood plain elements were classified as gallery-forests, open water, water with reeds, and non-flooded areas. The <b>radar</b> <b>bands</b> used are also available on other satellites (JERS and Radarsat). An error analysis based on histograms shows the results are good despite the lack of real time ground data. Key words flood plains; multi-frequency analysis; radar; SIR-C; West Africa; wetland...|$|R

50|$|FuG 223: A {{family of}} passive {{airborne}} receivers tuned to various <b>radar</b> <b>bands</b> such as Freya and Würzburg. Designed to allow night fighters to home onto bombers fitted with jammers against those radars. The Fug223 was a version build from surplus FuG 227 components that detected reflected energy from an aircraft being illuminated by a ground radar. In this {{way it was}} an example of an early semi-active radar homing system. In order to work it seems that the radar beam had to illuminate the target and the night fighter so that the two receivers could be synchronized. Used by one test and development squadron {{at the end of the}} war.|$|R
