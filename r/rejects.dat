5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently <b>rejects,</b> as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he <b>rejects</b> Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally <b>rejects</b> Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E

40|$|The driver gap {{acceptance}} and rejection behavior during mandatory lane changes on a multilane freeway are analyzed in this paper. Gaps are accepted or <b>rejected</b> based on comparison {{with a minimum}} value generally defined as the critical gaps. Critical gaps are estimated based on the accepted and <b>rejected</b> gaps observed in the field. Driver behavior can be classified as consistent or inconsistent {{on the basis of}} gap rejection. For consistent driver behavior, it is assumed that the <b>rejected</b> gaps are shorter than the accepted gaps. This paper focuses on the estimation of critical gaps values and its distribution for consistent driver behavior. Critical gap, for consistent driver behavior is defined as the minimum value of gap above which the lane changer does not <b>reject</b> a gap to execute a lane change. Several gaps may be <b>rejected</b> prior to a gap being accepted, therefore, different types of <b>rejected</b> gaps can be utilized to estimate critical gaps. To systematically evaluate <b>rejected</b> gaps and propose the most suitable <b>rejected</b> gaps for use in estimating the critical gaps, <b>rejected</b> gaps were analyzed using the mean <b>rejected,</b> median <b>rejected,</b> and the largest <b>rejected</b> gaps less than the accepted gaps (LRLA). To model the consistent gap acceptance behavior of drivers i. e. th...|$|R
