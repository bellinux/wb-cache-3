25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of <b>round-cornered</b> rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Type D {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on downward extensions of the inner interplane struts. The mounting was strengthened with two diagonal struts on each side, one {{from the base of the}} forward interplane strut to the upcurved tip of the lower member and the other from the rear interplane strut to the junction of the lower member and its first vertical cross member. [...] Each of these lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members reduced the landing run. There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member with a pair of <b>round-cornered</b> rectangular rudders above it.|$|E

The dashboard dials were built by Newson's Ikepod watch company and the steering wheel was reminiscent of his 1997 Alessi coat hook.|$|E
50|$|The first castle {{was built}} in either the late 14th or in early 15th century, perhaps begun by Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin (c. 1345 - 1400).The Sinclair, or St Clare, family were of French origin, and have held Roslin since 1280. The castle was built on a rocky {{promontory}} {{near the site of}} the Battle of Roslin, where the Scots defeated the English in 1303. Henry's son Henry, 2nd Earl of Orkney (c. 1375-1422) built a new rectangular, <b>round-cornered</b> keep at the south-west corner.The courtyard was entered via a drawbridge over an artificial ditch, giving access to a pend in the small north range.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the early}} models {{released}} in 1946 (called [...] "woodies" [...] for their uncovered wooden cabinets), {{the first big}} series of amplifiers were built in 1948. These were known as Tweed amps because they were covered {{in the same kind}} of cloth used for luggage at the time. At first the cabinets had relatively small <b>round-cornered</b> speaker apertures, known as [...] "TV fronts;" [...] they were replaced in 1953 by top and bottom [...] "wide-panels" [...] and those in 1955 by the [...] "narrow-panels." [...] The original tweed amp lineup comprised the Champion/Champ, Princeton, Deluxe, Professional/Pro and Super.

50|$|Anomalocaris was a mainly soft-bodied {{swimming}} predator {{which was}} gigantic for its time (up to 70 cm = 2¼ feet long; some later species were 3 times as long); the soft, segmented body {{had a pair}} of broad fin-like flaps along each side, except that the last 3 segments {{had a pair of}} fans arranged in a V shape. Unlike Kerygmachela and Pambdelurion (see above), Anomalocaris apparently had no legs, and the grooved patches which are thought to have acted as gills were at the bases of the flaps, or even overlapping on to its back. The two eyes were on relatively long horizontal stalks; the mouth lay under the head and was a <b>round-cornered</b> square of plates which could not close completely; and in front of the mouth were two jointed appendages which were shaped like a shrimp’s body, curved backwards and with short spines {{on the inside of the}} curve.

40|$|In this article, {{a simple}} and compact dual band-notched (DBN) super {{wideband}} (SWB) printed monopole antenna (PMA) has been proposed. The proposed antenna composed of a circular PMA, which is connected through a 50 -Ω triangular tapered microstrip fed line (TTMFL) and a <b>round-cornered</b> finite ground plane (RCFGP). It exhibits a very wide frequency band from 1. 6 – 25 GHz (ratio band¬width of 15. 63 : 1) with a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) ≤ 2. By employing a U-shaped parasitic element (USPE) near the RCFGP and a T-shaped protruded stub (TSPS) inside the radiating patch, a single band-notched (SBN) characteristic in the frequency band of 3. 2 – 4. 4 GHz (WiMAX/C-band) is generated. In order to realize the sec¬ond band-notched function for X-band satellite communication systems (7. 2 – 8. 4 GHz), a U-shaped slot (USS) has been inserted in the RCFGP. The overall dimension of the proposed antenna is 24 x 30 x 0. 787 mm 3 and occupies a relatively small space compared to the existing DBN an¬tennas.

40|$|Surface {{dielectric}} barrier discharges (DBDs) {{are used}} to delay flow separation behind a bluff body in atmospheric pressure air. The bluff body is made by connecting a flat plate to a half cylinder tangentially as a <b>round-cornered</b> trailing edge. Four DBD plasma actuators are attached along {{the surface of the}} half cylinder. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is utilized for studying the velocity field of the flow. In {{the first part of the}} study, flow alteration effects of two different discharge sources – a conventional alternating current (AC) discharge and an ultra short repetitively pulsed plasma discharge (USRD) - are compared for identical surface DBD configurations. It is found that, at an identical discharge power (~ 25 W), the AC discharge shows higher ability for flow alteration than the USRD. In the second part, the flow alteration effect of the AC DBD is investigated for varying free stream flow speeds, surface roughness, Reynolds number (Rex), and electrode configuration. The flow speed ranges from 10 m/s to 25 m/s and the corresponding Rex are from 5 × 104 – 5 × 105. In this flow regime, the separation point behind the bluff body can be moved downstream in the presence of the AC DBD. However, it is found that, as the flow speed increases, the separation delay effect decreases. The flow alteration effect also decreases with rougher surfaces and higher Rex. Finally, skewed electrodes and reversed electrodes relative to the flow direction are utilized as two different electrode configurations. It is seen that the skewed electrode provides a positive effect on separation delay while the reversed electrode induces earlier flow separation. I...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} silicon-based {{polygonal}} microdisk resonators with laterally coupled waveguides. We experimentally demonstrate the first waveguide-coupled octagonal microdisk channel add-drop filters. We also propose and demonstrate laterally waveguide-coupled <b>round-cornered</b> octagonal microdisk resonators with significantly improved add-drop filter characteristics {{from those of}} sharp-cornered octagonal microresonators. Octagonal microresonators belong to the class of polygonal microdisks that have the uniqueness of multiple pairs of flat sidewalls for lateral input- and output-coupling. It {{has been shown that}} waveguide-coupled polygonal microdisks exhibit much fewer coupled modes compared with waveguide-coupled circular microdisks of the same size. Our finite-difference time-domain simulations and Fourier analysis of the simulated field patterns suggest that waveguide coupling to flat sidewalls in polygonal microresonators enable directional wavevectors, which are critical to the coupling of single or few resonance modes. Our experiments on silicon waveguide-coupled 50 -μm-sized octagonal microresonators demonstrate only two dominant modes, with a Q of about 104 and an extinction ratio of about 15 dB. Integrating the silicon-based waveguide-coupled optical microresonators with metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors, we propose an accumulation-type electro-optic octagonal microresonator-based modulator. The principle is that lightwaves circulating in the microresonator and spatially overlapping with the selectively embedded MOS capacitor interface experience a phase shift due to the plasma dispersion effect, and thus result in a resonance blueshift. The simulations revealed a high-extinction-ratio, high-speed, and low-power modulation. Using free-carrier-plasma-dispersion electro-optic effect in silicon, we experimentally demonstrate silicon microring carrier-injection-based modulators/switches with waveguide cross-coupling. The modulator extinction ratio can be tuned by forward-biasing either the microring or cross-coupled waveguide p-i-n diode, while modulating the other. We also demonstrate OR-logic switching functionality by simultaneously applying two different electrical data streams across the microring and cross-coupled waveguide diodes. Moreover, we analyze, fabricate and characterize silicon coupled-microring resonators-based electro-optic switching using injection-type p-i-n diodes...|$|E
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of evolutionary psychology, neoteny entails the specific appearance and traits of babies that tend to trigger protective behaviors by adults. Based on Lorenz (1970), five dimensions of neotenic cues were examined. The following exploratory {{study was designed to}} identify whether those determinants of perceived cuteness could be applied to abstract geometric forms. Participants were asked to design a cute rectangle by adjusting the size, proportion, roundness, rotation, and color of the figure. The outcome figures indicated a propensity toward forms that were relatively small, <b>round-cornered,</b> slightly tilted, and light-colored. Findings support the idea that smallness, roundness, tiltedness, and lightness of color can serve as determinants of perceived cuteness in artifact design. However, the evaluation of neotenic designs was mediated by the meaning of cuteness, and this pattern was supported by data collected in two countries, the United States and Korea. This cultural difference can be accounted for by an attitude toward youthfulness. Furthermore, cultural differences in aesthetic judgment of cuteness in design and its influence on product choice were investigated. The asymmetric dominance paradigm was adapted to understand how the cuteness of a product influences choice behavior among consumers. The study examined whether the introduction of a cute product would trigger an attraction, a compromise, or a polarization effect on existing products. The findings suggest a cultural dependence based on how cuteness is evaluated: the attraction effect of a cute decoy was reversed – i. e., in the U. S., the cute decoy seemed to attract the choice share of the cute product, while in Korea, the cute decoy contributed to an increase in the choice share of the non-cute product rather than the cute dominating product. The attraction, compromise, and polarization effects were more pronounced in the U. S. where cuteness was more negatively evaluated...|$|E
