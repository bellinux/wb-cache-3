The MULTI OUT connector (later used on the Nintendo 64 and GameCube) can output composite video, S-Video and <b>RGB</b> <b>signals,</b> as well as RF with an external RF modulator. Original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover {{on the bottom of the}} unit and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back; the redesigned models output composite video only, requiring an external modulator for RF.|$|E
50|$|Some {{versions}} of legacy consoles such as Sega's Master System, Genesis and Nintendo's SNES {{are capable of}} outputting <b>RGB</b> <b>signals,</b> and many older home computers (Amstrad CPC, later ZX Spectrum models, MSX, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes, etc.) output RGB with composite sync suitable for SCART use, but most used varying non-standard DIN plugs.

50|$|Typically, <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> are {{transmitted}} over the camera cable. The CCU will usually convert these to SDI, YUV or composite for interfacing to other video equipment.|$|E
50|$|Cathode ray tube {{displays}} {{are driven}} by red, green, and blue voltage signals, but these <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> are not efficient as a representation for storage and transmission, since {{they have a lot}} of redundancy.|$|E
50|$|SCART {{connections}} generally {{offer the}} best quality video at standard-definition, due {{to the use of}} pure <b>RGB</b> <b>signalling</b> (although composite and S-Video may alternatively be offered over a SCART connector). SCART provides video and audio in one connection.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} an IF 1 F 2 color space for describing colors in microscopic images. Unlike the classical color spaces that treat the R, G, and B (RGB) {{components of a}} pixel’s color as independent elements, the proposed color space treats RGB as a sampled spectral <b>signal,</b> called a <b>RGB</b> <b>signal.</b> Then, based on the Fourier spectrum analysis of the <b>RGB</b> <b>signal,</b> the 1 -D discrete Fourier transform is introduced to describe the color features of microscopic images. K-means clustering experiments on two microscopic image datasets validate {{the superiority of the}} proposed IF 1 F 2 color space compared with the classical RGB and HSV (hue, saturation, and value) color spaces.|$|R

These ports are commonly found there on consumer TVs, DVD players, VCRs and game consoles sold there. Although the UK uses the higher-quality <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> transmission scheme provided by European Standard SCART, SCART ports are seldom found in Hong Kong equipment.|$|R

50|$|Sync-on-composite: The {{connector}} {{carries a}} standard {{composite video signal}} along with the RGB components, for use with devices that cannot process <b>RGB</b> <b>signals.</b> For devices that do understand RGB, the sync component of that composite signal is used along with the color information from the RGB lines.

50|$|Video-capable sensors such as radars, FLIR, or video-guided {{missiles}} {{often provide}} a STANAG 3350 video output. STANAG3350 video is supplied {{as a component}} <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> with timing similar to a corresponding civilian composite video standard such as NTSC, PAL, or RS-343. Only the vertical and carrier frequency of the signal are defined by the standard, the horizontal resolution can vary from one implementation to another and still satisfy the STANAG 3350 standard.|$|R
50|$|Sync on composite, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with composite sync, is commonly used on devices that output both composite video and RGB over SCART. The <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> is used for color information, while the composite video signal is only used to extract the sync information. This is generally an inferior sync method, as this often causes checkerboards to appear on an image, but the image quality is still much sharper than standalone composite video.|$|R

50|$|All {{of the new}} PS/2 {{graphics}} systems (whether MCGA, VGA, 8514, {{or later}} XGA) used a 15-pin D-sub connector for video out. This used analog <b>RGB</b> <b>signals,</b> rather than four or six digital color signals as on previous CGA and EGA monitors. The digital signals limited the color gamut to a fixed 16 or 64 color palette with no room for expansion. In contrast, any color depth (bits per primary) can be encoded into the analog <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> so the color gamut can be increased arbitrarily by using wider (more bits per sample) DACs and a more sensitive monitor. The connector was also compatible with analog grayscale displays. Unlike earlier systems (like MDA and Hercules) this was transparent to software, so all programs supporting the new standards could run unmodified whichever type of display was attached. (On the other hand, whether the display was color or monochrome was undetectable to software, so selection between application displays optimized for color or monochrome, in applications that supported both, required user intervention.) These grayscale displays were relatively inexpensive {{during the first few}} years the PS/2 was available, and they were very commonly purchased with lower-end models.|$|E
50|$|VGA to SCART {{converter}} {{that passes}} through color information is possible, because VGA — SCART <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> are electrically compatible, except for synchronization. Modern graphics adapters {{are able to}} widely modify their signal in software, including refresh rate, sync length, polarity and number of blank lines. Particular issues include whether or not interlacing is supported as well as if the resolution can be set to 720×576 in PAL countries. Under these strict conditions, a simple circuit to combine the VGA separate synchronization signals into SCART composite sync may suffice.|$|E
50|$|Digital-based {{standard}} {{designed for}} displays such as flat-panel displays (LCDs, plasma screens, wide high-definition television displays) and video projectors. In some rare cases high end CRT monitors also use DVI. It avoids image distortion and electrical noise, corresponding each pixel {{from the computer}} to a display pixel, using its native resolution. It {{is worth noting that}} most manufacturers include a DVI-I connector, allowing (via simple adapter) standard <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> output to an old CRT or LCD monitor with VGA input.|$|R
50|$|A SuperGun {{contains}} {{the inner workings}} of a standard arcade videogame cabinet inside a small plastic or metal box. A SuperGun plugs in a JAMMA board and usually provides at least RGB output (the native output of arcade games) sometimes through an SCART connector. Since the SCART connector is not common on televisions in North America, frequently a supergun will also convert the <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> into NTSC composite video, S-video, Component Video or VGA signals, with varying degrees of quality.|$|R
3000|$|... where X(0) is the low {{frequency}} (zero frequency) component of X and X(2) {{is the high}} frequency component of X. μ is a scaling parameter used to scale I into a proper numerical range for specific image processing applications, abs(X(0)) is the complex magnitude of X(0), real(X(2)) is the real part of X(2), and imag(X(2)) is the imaginary part of X(2). Since the <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> only has three samples, we use 3 -point DFT to calculate its discrete Fourier spectrum. For a 3 -point DFT, X(1) and X(2) both belong to the high frequency components. The magnitudes of X(1) and X(2) are equivalent, while their phases are different. Therefore, we can either choose X(1) or X(2) as the chromatic component of the proposed color space. If two colors are slightly different, the major difference between them {{may be caused by}} how the RGB values of each color vary. In the methodology of frequency spectrum analysis, the high frequency component of a signal’s Fourier spectrum represents the differences between the signal’s samples, and these differences, to some extent, describe how the signal’s samples vary. Therefore, we use the high frequency component of the <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> to describe the color features of microscopic images in this paper.|$|R

50|$|Instead, the <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> are {{converted}} into YUV form, where the Y signal represents the lightness and darkness (luminance) {{of the colors}} in the image. Because the rendering of colors {{in this way is}} the goal of both black and white (monochrome) film and black and white (monochrome) television systems, the Y signal is ideal for transmission as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture in black and white, where a given color is reproduced by a shade of gray that correctly reflects how light or dark the original color is.|$|E
5000|$|A scaled {{version of}} the transformation, {{sometimes}} called YCoCg-R (where the [...] "-R" [...] refers to reversibility), can be implemented efficiently with a reduced bit depth. The scaled version uses a lifting scheme to make it exactly invertible while minimizing the bit depth of the three color components. For <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> with bit depth n, the bit depth of the Y signal when using YCoCg-R will be n and the bit depth of Co and Cg will be n+1, as contrasted with ordinary YCoCg which would need n+2 bits for Y and Cg and n+1 bits for Co.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, CBS Laboratories invented {{an early}} color system that {{utilized}} a wheel, containing six color filters, rotated {{in front of}} a single video camera tube to generate the <b>RGB</b> <b>signal.</b> Called a field-sequential color system, it used interlaced video, with sequentially alternating color video fields to produce one complete video frame. That meant that the first field would be red, the second blue, and the third field green — matching the color filters on the wheel and also in a different order than NTSC. This system was both simpler and more reliable than a standard three-tube color camera, and more power-efficient.|$|R
25|$|As was {{the case}} with {{black-and-white}} television, an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like Baird's. The obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional Iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an <b>RGB</b> <b>signal.</b> Using three separate tubes each looking at the same scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames, so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes. Each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} color sensitive pi-i-i-n diodes based on amorphous silicon. The detectors are developed {{with respect to the}} mu r (carrier mobility x lifetime) product and the band gap of the individual i-layers resulting in a voltage controlled spectral sensitivity. Since the linear independence of the spectral response and a linear response of the photocurrent on the incident light intensity is a prerequisite for the generation of a red-green-blue (<b>RGB)</b> <b>signal,</b> the effect of additional bias illumination on the spectral sensitivity is measured. To gain insight into the optoelectronic properties of these devices we carried out numerical simulations and compared them with experimentally determined spectral sensitivities.

For <b>RGB</b> <b>signals</b> with bit depth n, either the resulting signals would then be rounded to n bits or would ordinarily be n+2 bits when processing data in this form (although n+1 bits would be sufficient for Co).|$|E
50|$|The <b>R,G,B</b> <b>signals</b> in the {{receiver}} {{needed for the}} display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It {{can be seen that}} in the combining process, the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full resolution picture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a novel receiver {{in visible light}} communication system based on RGB LEDs. It contains three major parts the collimating lens, the spectro-device and the photodetector. The mixed <b>RGB</b> <b>signal</b> lights are captured, separated and received by the collimating lens the spectro-device and the photodetector respectively. Through the adjustment of the collimating lens, the receiver can receive enough light even if {{the distance between the}} signal light source and the receiver is changed. The receiver has the advantages of strong mobility and strong ability of receiving signal light. Based on the designed receiver the high-speed visible light communication system using RGB wavelength division multiplexing technology can have better performance...|$|R
5000|$|In Europe (but {{not most}} other PAL areas), SCART {{connectors}} are typically used, which can carry composite and analog <b>RGB</b> interlaced video <b>signals</b> (<b>RGB</b> can be progressive, {{but not all}} DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C (S-Video), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog <b>RGB</b> component <b>signal</b> offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to YPbPr component video. However, analog <b>RGB</b> and S-Video <b>signals</b> can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.) ...|$|R
50|$|Separating <b>RGB</b> color <b>signals</b> into luma and {{chrominance}} {{allows the}} bandwidth of each {{to be determined}} separately. Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by chroma subsampling.|$|R
