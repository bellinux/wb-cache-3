40|$|Abstract. <b>Reclaiming</b> {{subsided}} {{land with}} fly ash {{is an effective}} reclamation method in China. The paper studied spatial-temporal variation of the <b>reclaimed</b> soil filled with fly ash. <b>Reclaimed</b> soil samples were collected from Anhui Province. This research was conducted on four different <b>reclaimed</b> lands with different reclamation years (1, 4, 8 and 12 years) for their temporal variation. Samples from different profiles were chosen for their spatial variation analysis. The results indicated the significant difference of {{physical and chemical properties}} between <b>reclaimed</b> soil and normal soil. Water infiltration of <b>reclaimed</b> soil was lower than that of normal soil, but their water infiltration increased with reclamation years. Bulk density of <b>reclaimed</b> soil was higher than that of farmland, but it was improved with time. The 12 -year-old <b>reclaimed</b> soil had the most similar value of bulk density to normal soil. It was helpful to plant growth. The pH of <b>reclaimed</b> soil was higher than normal soil because of fly ash. The pH value of <b>reclaimed</b> soil was decreased after 12 years.

40|$|The reuse of treated {{wastewater}} (<b>reclaimed</b> water) {{for irrigation}} {{is a valuable}} strategy to maximise available water resources, but the often marginal quality of the water can present agricultural challenges. Semi-structured interviews were held with Jordanian farmers to explore how they perceive the quality of <b>reclaimed</b> water.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, ground tire rubber (GTR) was mechano-chemically <b>reclaimed</b> at ambient {{temperature}} using two-roll mills. Road bitumen and styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) -modified bitumen at variable content (in range: 2. 5 - 20 phr) were applied as reactive plasticizers to enhance <b>reclaiming</b> of GTR. For better understanding the plasticizing effect of bitumen {{on the quality of}} obtained <b>reclaimed</b> rubber, mechano-chemically <b>reclaimed</b> GTR has been compared with GTR after thermo-mechanical <b>reclaiming</b> via low temperature extrusion (120 °C), which allows generation of high shear forces on GTR. <b>Reclaiming</b> process was evaluated by oscillating disc rheometer measurements, followed by mechanical, physical, thermal, and morphological properties analyses performed on vulcanized <b>reclaimed</b> rubber. The obtained results showed that application of bitumen during mechano-chemical <b>reclaiming</b> of GTR improves processing and prevents oxidation of <b>reclaimed</b> GTR through enhancement of physical and chemical interactions between GTR and bitumen. On the other hand, high shear forces acting on GTR during thermo-mechanical <b>reclaiming</b> caused effective scission of cross-linking bonds, {{while at the same time}} an adverse oxidative degradation of GTR occurs. Noticeably, the type of bitumen strongly affected the nature of the interfacial interactions between GTR and bitumen.
