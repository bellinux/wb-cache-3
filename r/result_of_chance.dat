25|$|The {{belief that}} self-ordering by {{spontaneous}} generation was impossible begged for an alternative. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. John Desmond Bernal, a pioneer in X-ray crystallography, suggested that earlier theories such as spontaneous generation were based upon an explanation that life was continuously created as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>chance</b> events.|$|E

In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle saw {{chance and}} {{necessity}} as opposite forces.

He viewed randomness as a genuine and widespread part of the world, but as subordinate to necessity and order.

He considered the outcome of games of chance as unknowable.|$|E

TIPs generally cover large areas (up to a thousand kilometers across) for up to five years.

2500|$|In the {{approach}} of Ronald Fisher, the null hypothesis H0 will be rejected when the p-value of the test statistic is sufficiently extreme (vis-a-vis the test statistic's sampling distribution) and thus judged unlikely to be the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>chance.</b> In a one-tailed test, [...] "extreme" [...] is decided beforehand as either meaning [...] "sufficiently small" [...] or meaning [...] "sufficiently large" [...] – values {{in the other direction}} are considered not significant. In a two-tailed test, [...] "extreme" [...] means [...] "either sufficiently small or sufficiently large", and values in either direction are considered significant. For a given test statistic there is a single two-tailed test, and two one-tailed tests, one each for either direction. Given data of a given significance level in a two-tailed test for a test statistic, in the corresponding one-tailed tests for the same test statistic it will be considered either twice as significant (half the p-value), if the data is in the direction specified by the test, or not significant at all (p-value above 0.05), if the data is in the direction opposite that specified by the test.|$|E
2500|$|That Wellington's {{principal}} Roman Catholic Cathedral {{is today}} a small, but quite perfect, Romano-Grecian temple is entirely the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>chance.</b> The Sacred Heart Basilica, now a cathedral, was originally designed and {{conceived as a}} church to mark {{the site of the}} fire-gutted St Mary's Cathedral. Petre had strong family connections to the site, as it and an adjacent plot, now the site of St Mary's College, had been given to the Roman Catholic Church by his father and grandfather. The original cathedral, a grand Gothic structure complete with flying buttresses, had been built in 1850 but was destroyed by fire in 1898. Within two days Petre had been asked to design a new church on the site. A decision was taken, however, to build the new Cathedral nearer the more densely populated areas of Wellington, Te Aro and Newtown. Petre later published plans for this Cathedral in 1903, describing his proposed structure as [...] "Roman, bordering on to Florentine Renaissance, treated liberally". This cathedral project never came to fruition, but what was quickly constructed was the Church, or Basilica, of [...] "The Sacred Heart" [...] on the razed cathedral site.|$|E

When popular discontents are prevalent, something has generally been found amiss in the constitution or the administration. [...] "The people have no interest in disorder. When they go wrong, it is their error, and not their crime."

60|$|In another volume M. de Gasparin {{demolished}} the tales, but he {{was only}} {{at the beginning of}} his subject. The historical and anthropological evidence for the movement of objects without contact, not under his conditions, is very vast in bulk. The modern experiments are sometimes more scientific than his own, and the evidence for the most startling events of all kinds is quite as good as that on which he relies for his prodigies, themselves sufficiently startling. His hypothesis, at all events, of will directing a force or fluid, by no means explains phenomena quite as well provided with evidence as his own. So M. de Gasparin disposes of the rival miracles as the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>chance,</b> imposture, or hallucination, the very weapons of his scientific adversaries. His own prodigies he has seen, and is satisfied. His opponents say: 'You cannot register your force sur l'inclinaison d'une aiguille'. He could not, but Home could do so to the satisfaction of a scientific expert, and probably M. de Gasparin would have believed it, if he had seen it. M. de Gasparin is horrified at the idea of 'trespassing on the territory of acts beyond our power'. But, if it were possible to do the miracles of Home, it would be possible because it is not beyond our power.

60|$|There is {{good reason}} to believe {{in the case of the}} dog, ox, pig, and of some other animals, that several of our races are descended from {{distinct}} wild prototypes; nevertheless the belief in the multiple origin of our domesticated animals has been extended by some few naturalists and by many breeders to an unauthorised extent. Breeders refuse to look at the whole subject under a single point of view; I have heard it said by a man, who maintained that our fowls were descended from at least half-a-dozen aboriginal species, that the evidence of the common origin of pigeons, ducks and rabbits, was of no avail with respect to fowls. Breeders overlook the improbability of many species having been domesticated at an early and barbarous period. They do not consider the improbability of species having existed in a state of nature which, if they resembled our present domestic breeds, would have been highly abnormal in comparison with all their congeners. They maintain that certain species, which formerly existed, have become extinct, or are now unknown, although formerly known. The assumption of so much recent extinction is no difficulty in their eyes; for they do not judge of its probability by the facility or difficulty of the extinction of other closely-allied wild forms. Lastly, they often ignore the whole subject of geographical distribution as completely as if it were the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>chance.</b>|$|E

If he should lake this course, and succeed, what would be the consequence? Who would put sufficient faith in the story of a simple seaman, like Robert Betts, and send a ship to look for Mark Woolston? In these later times, the government would doubtless despatch a vessel of war on such an errand, did no other means of rescuing the man offer; but, {{at the close of the}} last century, government did not exercise that much of power. It scarcely protected its seamen from the English press-gang and the Algerine slave-driver; much less did it think of rescuing a solitary individual from a rock in the midst of the Pacific. American vessels did then roam over that distant ocean, but it was comparatively in small numbers, and under circumstances that promised but little to the hopes of the hermit. It was a subject he did not like to dwell on, and he kept his thoughts as much diverted from it as it was in his power so to do.|$|E
