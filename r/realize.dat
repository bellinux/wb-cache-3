40|$|Yes. We use intraday data {{to compute}} weekly <b>realized</b> variance, {{skewness}} and kurtosis for individual equities and assess whether this week?s <b>realized</b> moments predict next week?s stock returns in the cross-section. We sort stocks each week {{according to their}} past <b>realized</b> moments, form decile portfolios and analyze subsequent weekly returns. We ?nd a very strong negative relationship between <b>realized</b> skewness and next week?s stock returns, and {{a positive relationship between}} <b>realized</b> kurtosis and next week?s stock returns. We do not ?nd a strong relationship between <b>realized</b> volatility and stock returns. A trading strategy that buys stocks in the lowest <b>realized</b> skewness decile and sells stocks in the highest <b>realized</b> skewness decile generates an average weekly return of 43 basis points with a t-statistic of 8 : 91. A similar strategy that buys stocks with high <b>realized</b> kurtosis and sells stocks with low <b>realized</b> kurtosis produces a weekly return of 16 basis points with a t-statistic of 2 : 98.

Further, the <b>realized</b> range, as a competitor for <b>realized</b> variance or daily returns, is employed in the <b>realized</b> GARCH framework. Further, sub-sampling and scaling methods are applied to both the <b>realized</b> range and <b>realized</b> variance, to help deal with inherent micro-structure noise and inefficiency. An adaptive Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is developed and employed for estimation and forecasting, whose properties are assessed and compared with maximum likelihood, via a simulation study. Compared to a range of well-known parametric GARCH, GARCH with two-sided Weibull distribution and <b>realized</b> GARCH models, tail risk forecasting results across 7 market index return series and 2 individual assets clearly favor the <b>realized</b> GARCH models incorporating two-sided Weibull distribution, especially models employing the sub-sampled <b>realized</b> variance and sub-sampled <b>realized</b> range, over a six year period that includes the global financial crisis.

40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{availability}} of high-frequency financial market data modeling <b>realized</b> volatility has become a new and innovative research direction. The construction of “observable” or <b>realized</b> volatility series from intra-day transaction data {{and the use of}} standard time-series techniques has lead to promising strategies for modeling and predicting (daily) volatility. In this article, we show that the residuals of commonly used time-series models for <b>realized</b> volatility and logarithmic <b>realized</b> variance exhibit non-Gaussianity and volatility clustering. We propose extensions to explicitly account for these properties and assess their relevance for modeling and forecasting <b>realized</b> volatility. In an empirical application for S&P 500 index futures we show that allowing for time-varying volatility of <b>realized</b> volatility and logarithmic <b>realized</b> variance substantially improves the fit as well as predictive performance.

One advantage of this particular model over classic autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) -type models is that it enables us to estimate simultaneously the dynamics of stock returns using both <b>realized</b> volatility and daily return data. Another advantage is that this model adjusts for the bias in <b>realized</b> volatility caused {{by the presence of}} market microstructure noise and non-trading hours, and therefore, it can be apply to any <b>realized</b> measure. The analysis also examines whether <b>realized</b> GARCH models using the <b>realized</b> kernels proposed by Bardorff-Nielsen et al. [2008] improve the performance of option pricing by comparing the results with those obtained using <b>realized</b> volatility as the simple sum of the squares of the intra-day returns.
