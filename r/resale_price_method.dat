40|$|Marine Food {{group is}} active within the marine foodservice {{industry}} and is established in Finland, Sweden, USA and Singapore. The group both sells galley equipment and spare parts {{as well as}} carrying out installation of the marine foodservice areas in both new build vessels and in vessels where an old galley is changed into a new one. The group also provides its customers with turnkey deliveries, which are when the supplier has the overall responsibility for the delivery of a marine foodservice area. Marine Food group transfers goods and services between the enterprises situated in Finland, Sweden and the US and has not established a transfer pricing system for these transactions. The company located in Singapore was recently established and any intra-group transactions have not been conducted yet. This master’s thesis aims at developing a transfer pricing system that could be applicable on these transactions and acceptable to the tax authorities in Finland, Sweden and the US. The elements that should be included when developing a transfer pricing system is functional analysis, economic analysis, an analysis of transactions, selection of transfer pricing method and comparables. The Marine Food group is therefore analyzed based on these elements {{in order to be}} successful in developing a transfer pricing system. Furthermore, the transfer pricing rules in Finland, Sweden and USA is examined in order to develop a transfer pricing system that is acceptable to the tax authority in respective country. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are another significant source that are examined when establishing a transfer pricing system for Marine Food group. Spare parts are transferred between the Swedish company, Marine Food AB and the US based company, Marine Food LLC. The transfer pricing method that should be applied in Sweden is the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> <b>method</b> since Marine Food LLC operates like a reseller for the spare parts. Internal comparables exist and comparability for the purposes of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> <b>method</b> can be established with reference to both internal and external data. In the US, the comparable profit method should be applied given that it meets the best method rule. The transactions from the Finnish Company, Marine Food Oy and the Swedish company, Marine Food AB consist of installation works and stainless steel furniture. Hence, the transactions both involve goods and services and should be looked at separately. The transfer price for the installation works should be set by using the transactional net margin method. In order to determine the transfer price under the transactional net margin method both internal and external comparables can be used in this case. The transfer price for the stainless steel furniture should on the other hand be established using the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> <b>method.</b> In order to determine comparability external comparables are used due to lack of internal data. Marine Food AB sells galley equipment and spare parts to Marine Food Oy. The transfer pricing method that should be applied on these transactions is the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> <b>method</b> since the least complex party in the transaction, Marine Food Oy, act like a reseller of the galley equipment and spare parts. Comparability is to be established with reference to external comparables since internal comparables do not exist...|$|E
40|$|PROTECTION OF COMPETITION - BLOCK EXEMPTIONS The {{main purpose}} of my thesis is to {{describe}} and analyze one aspect of a block exemption regulation for vertical agreements, namely <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. The thesis is composed of six parts, one of them dealing with block exemptions {{in general and the}} rest of them focusing on <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. Chapter one introduces the topic of block exemptions and explains the features of block exemptions that are common to all of them. Chapter two presents the definition of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance and describes the difference between fixed, minimum, maximum and recommended prices. Chapter three describes economic theories, which have influence on legal treatment of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. The chapter is divided into three subchapters, whereas the first one explicates pro-competitive effects of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance, the second one focuses on its anticompetitive effects and the third one summarizes the economic theories of impact of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. Chapter four examines the legal framework of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance in European law. Firstly, it describes the treatment of fixed, minimum, recommended and maximum prices.

40|$|From 1911 until 2007, minimum <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> {{maintenance}} {{agreements between}} manufacturers and resellers were illegal under federal antitrust law. This handicapped manufacturers {{which sought to}} exert control over how their products were priced and promoted through the distribution channel. In June 2007, the United States Supreme Court [...] via the Leegin case [...] ruled that bilateral minimum <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance agreements {{would no longer be}} automatically illegal. Rather, they would be legal if their net impact is pro-competitive, and illegal only if the net impact is anti-competitive.

40|$|International audiencePurposeThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a novel {{perspective}} on <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchising, i. e. from a franchisee perspective, by combining legal and managerial considerations in the European context. The objective is to assess franchisee perceptions regarding <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in their chains. Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopt a qualitative approach and use 46 in-depth interviews with franchisees covering retail and service industries in the French market. FindingsMany of the interviewed franchisees believe that joining a franchise chain involves respecting the recommended <b>resale</b> <b>prices.</b> For some of the franchisees, in link with the chain uniformity, imposing uniform <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> throughout the chain represents a strength, because customers who visit different stores within the franchise chain expect to find consistent pricing. Moreover, many franchisees consider that their franchisors have some know-how that they use to set correct <b>resale</b> <b>prices,</b> taking into account the profit margin. Research limitations/implicationsThis research contributes to the literature on <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchising, as well as the franchising literature in general, by combining legal and managerial considerations, adopting a franchisee perspective, covering retail and service industries and focusing on French and European markets. Practical implicationsThis research can be viewed by franchise experts, franchisors, franchisees and franchisee candidates as a synthesis of resale price-related legal aspects, adopted practices and potential conflicts in franchise chains in the French market. It also highlights price-related practices to be avoided to prevent potential conflicts.

40|$|In {{large part}} {{for fear that}} it will foster and {{maintain}} manufacturers' or retailers' cartels, <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance is strictly forbidden {{in a number of}} countries. Moreover economic theory has allowed for {{a better understanding of the}} motivations and outcomes of this practice and has made possible a revision of the strict prohibition. This thesis first outlines the theories explaining the use of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. What emerges from these theories is that <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance is far from being an unequivocably deleterious form of conduct. Indeed, a manufacturer may seek to reach some results that are pro-competitive. Having outlined the arguments for and against the practice, an approach is proposed for detecting <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance that is likely to damage the consumers' interest. In fact, the problem arises only in cases of cartellization, or abuse of market power. The second part of the thesis is devoted to an analysis of four legislative regimes: those of the United States of America, Canada, Switzerland and the European Community. Three of these regimes include a strong prohibition against <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance, whereas the fourth, the Swiss cartel law, treats the practice as per se legal. Despite the diverging legal status reserved to this practice, the comparative law study will demonstrate first the consistency of an economic approach to each situation, and the weakness of the legal reasoning within this area. The analysis of these regimes serves to affirm the conclusions, that <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance constitutes a real danger only in the case where there is a cartel or abuse of market power. Since these cartel or abuse of market power abuse are themselves usually prohibited, the additional prohibition against <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance is redundant, and prevents some manufacturers from achieving possible pro-competitive results...|$|R
