50|$|The simple, single-slope {{run-down}} is slow. Typically, the <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> {{is measured}} in clock ticks, so to get four digit resolution, the rundown time may {{take as long as}} 10,000 clock cycles. A multi-slope run-down can speed the measurement up without sacrificing accuracy. By using 4 slope rates that are each a power of ten more gradual than the previous, four digit resolution can be achieved in roughly 40 or fewer clock ticks—a huge speed improvement.|$|E

Construction began in late 2005 with the levelling of the land and, as of June 2016, 1,309 homes have been built {{and the construction of}} the final phase (known as the Lexington Quarter and consisting of 339 further units) is under way.|$|R

50|$|Campanella's 1946 season {{proceeded}} largely without racist incidents, and in {{one game}} Campanella assumed the managerial duties after manager Walter Alston was ejected. This made Campanella the first African-American to manage Caucasian players of an organized professional baseball team. Nashua was three <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>time</b> Campanella took over. They came back to win, {{in part due to}} Campanella's decision to use Newcombe as a pinch hitter during the seventh inning; Newcombe hit a game-tying two-run home run.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{implementation}} of the spatial and spectral imaging (S 2) technique for modal analysis of multimode optical fibers. It utilizes a continuously scanning tunable laser source with an InGaAs camera operating at 500 Hz along with inline data processing to increase the measurement repetition rate, by reducing the <b>run</b> up/run <b>down</b> <b>time</b> between two successive scans (about 27 times faster {{as compared to the}} previous state of the art). This allows real-time mode content monitoring of a multimode fiber. We illustrate the potential of this tool by collecting an 110, 000 wavelength S 2 spectrogram of a 5 mode-group fiber in minutes, and tracking, in real-time, the four LP 11 modes of the same fiber as the launch polarization is rotated...|$|R

Then there was Jack Pumpkinhead, whose head was a real pumpkin with the face carved upon it; and Professor Wogglebug, who had {{the shape of an}} enormous bug but was dressed in neat fitting garments. The Professor was an interesting talker and had very polite manners, but his face was so comical that it made Cap'n Bill smile to look at it. A great friend of Dorothy and Ozma seemed to be a machine man called Tik-Tok, who <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> several <b>times</b> during the evening and had to be wound up again by someone before he could move or speak.|$|R
50|$|The {{family did}} not live at Clayton Hall, {{as it was a}} little <b>run</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>time.</b> They had a new Hall built on the present site as newlyweds. In order to provide more private grounds Clayton Lane was moved to its present position, however, it {{originally}} ran through the College grounds. The Hall appeared to be occupied by the family by November 1841. Their elder daughter planted a tree near the drive, and there is still a plaque there now. The family was not living in the Hall {{at the time of the}} April 1841 Census. John Ayshford Wise and his wife were wealthy landowners and had three children.|$|R

Act II reached No. 39 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.

5000|$|Balgowlah's main {{commercial}} area {{is located on}} Condamine Street and Sydney Road. Major businesses in Balgowlah are Harvey Norman and Bunnings Warehouse. Stockland Balgowlah is a shopping centre located on Condamine Street. The centre opened on 15 July 2009. Its main majors are Coles, Fitness First and 62 other retailers. Stockland Balgowlah is built on the historic Totem Centre, which opened in 1959. The name Totem {{was based on the}} North American model. The centre had 33 shops, a bowling alley and a huge Woolworths store. In 2007 the Totem Centre was demolished, the centre was <b>run</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>time</b> of its demolition and the Totem name was not continued. [...] However the centre is still colloquially referred to as [...] "Totem" [...] in the area.The nearest major shopping centre is Westfield Warringah Mall, located 2 kilometres north of the suburb.|$|R
6000|$|... "'The {{thing is}} so easily arranged. A man before he starts from Ostend or Hamburg, or {{the mouth of}} the Seine, sends a line to his friends here, at Rochester or Limehouse or Leigh, [...] "Shall sail to-night. Expect to come up the south channel on Monday evening." [...] The {{bargeman}} or fisherman <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>time</b> arranged, and five or six miles below the Nore brings up and shows a light. He knows that the craft he expects will not be up before that time, for if the wind was extremely favorable, and they made the run quicker than they expected, they would bring up in Margate Roads till the time appointed. If they didn't arrive that night, they would do so the next, and the barge would lay there and wait for them, or the fishermen would go into Sheerness or Leigh and come out again the next night.|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{transmission}} {{depends on}} the continued availability of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SVs) for triggered release from presynaptic boutons. Surprisingly, small boutons in the brain, that already contain comparatively few SVs, are thought to retain {{the majority of these}} SVs in a “reserve” pool that is not mobilized under physiological conditions. Why such a scarce synaptic resource is normally inaccessible has been a matter of debate. Here, we readdress this issue by developing an electrophysiological approach for counting SVs released from boutons formed by a single, isolated neuron on itself (“autapses”). We show that, after treatment with Bafilomycin A 1 to prevent reloading of discharged SVs with glutamate, each SV is counted only once on first-time release. Hence, by integrating all autaptic currents as they <b>run</b> <b>down</b> over <b>time,</b> we can estimate the total number of SVs released by a single neuron. This total can be normalized to the number of boutons on the neuron, giving the mean number of SVs released per bouton. We estimate that up to ≈ 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over ≈ 10 min of stimulation at 0. 2 Hz. This number of vesicles represents a substantial proportion {{of the total number of}} SVs (100 – 200) that have been counted in these boutons by using electron microscopy. Thus, mild electrical stimulation, when maintained for sufficient time, causes the eventual release of many of the SVs in a bouton, including those in the putative reserve pool. This result suggests that SVs are functionally homogeneous in that the majority can contribute to basal synaptic transmission...|$|R
