This study aimed to identify and quantify many of the factors contributing to overall consumption, through extensive surveys of four widely differing dense medium mineral separation plants, and associated laboratory experiments. Particular attention was given to the effect of operating density on medium loss. It was concluded that quite modest increases in operating density significantly increased loss from all sources. Density should therefore be minimised, commensurate with process requirements. There is also unequivocal evidence that consumption increases significantly with plant downtime, probably due to housekeeping wastage and overloading of <b>regeneration</b> <b>circuits</b> during the return of dumped medium to circuit.

40|$|The {{most recent}} efforts in {{developing}} the Dense Medium Separation (DMS) technology have been particularly directed towards {{the treatment of the}} fines (in the range 0. 5 to 0. 1 / 0. 3 mm), the separation at high density, the high sharpness separation and the use of multistage dynamic separation system. To this end, the control of the rheological properties of the suspensions used in dense medium separation is of primary importance. This means that: (a) a knowledge of the influence of the operating media composition on the rheological properties is necessary; (b) the medium cleaning circuits have to be properly designed in order to obtain the required composition of the medium. This implies the need of a model for describing the rheological behaviour of dense media. The model has been developed after test programmes conducted on suspensions of magnetite, ferrosilicon and various non-magnetic contaminants, under different conditions of volume concentration, proportion of components of the solid phase and shear rate. Basic data for using the model are the rheological properties of media made up of pure components or corresponding to selected compositions. In this paper the model has been checked for suspensions of ferrosilicon containing different types of contaminants. The principles underlying the design of medium <b>regeneration</b> <b>circuits</b> in modern dynamic DMS plants are highlighted.

40|$|During {{several years}} of {{operation}} in Europe, South Africa and other locations, the Tri-Flo process has demonstrated substantial improvements in dense-medium dynamic-separation systems. The reasons for this improvement are: • a high-sharpness separation due to the multistage system {{and the application of}} new concepts {{in the design of the}} <b>regeneration</b> <b>circuit</b> and in the control of the medium Theology, and • the possibility of performing two cuts at different densities using a single separation device and a single <b>regeneration</b> <b>circuit.</b> This paper discusses the above points in detail with particular reference to the multistage technology (based on the circuit analysis theory) and to the control of the medium rheology (based on recent work in the modeling and simulation of the rheological behavior of dense suspensions). Concerning the multidensity separation, information is given on the new three-stage separator where the high-density separation is performed by the first stage and the low-density separation is performed by the second and third stages. This configuration (already realized in two operating plants) was selected because no particular sharpness was required at the high-density separation, while high sharpness was required at the low-density separation. However, the configuration can be inverted or a fourth stage can be added (at very low additional cost) to provide two stages for each separating density. The importance of achieving a high sharpness separation is related to minerals (industrial minerals in particular) where the density difference of the phases to be separated is very low (as in processing of lithium ores, feldspar- and others). Information is provided on plants operating in South Africa and Canada, for the beneficiation of lithium minerals and on a plant under construction in Italy for the beneficiation of feldspar. Finally, the importance of making the separation at two densities is emphasized with particular reference to coal; i. e., producing a low-ash premium coal and recovering, in the middling, a by-product without losing heating value. Also, very important for some minerals is the production of a high-grade concentrate (at the first stage) suitable for sending directly to metallurgy (e. g., chromite ores) and the production of a low-grade concentrate that can be further treated. In this way, a higher overall recovery of the valuable mineral can be achieved, and, at the same time, a reduction of the treatment costs can be obtained. All of the above applications were once considered impossible...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of all-optical signal processing techniques and circuits has attracted particular interest {{over the last}} decades, aiming at the enhancement of optical networks transparency and the exploitation of the huge bandwidth, being made available by the optical fiber as a transmission line. One of the most preferable options {{for the implementation of}} this type of circuits is the use of nonlinear fibers, and in general of nonlinear Kerr media, mainly due to their potential for high-speed operation that originates from the nature of the Kerr effect itself and the practically instantaneous response of the Kerr nonlinearity. Within this framework, the thesis focuses on the study, development and experimental demonstration of novel, nonlinear fiber-based, all-optical signal processing subsystems that exhibit a high-degree of network functionality and compatibility with novel modulation formats, and additionally verify further characteristics of the fiber-based processors, such as their capability of multi-wavelength operation and thus, of simultaneous processing multiple WDM channels. In this sense, the present doctoral thesis represents a complete and well-defined research effort, complementary to other efforts over the last decade that have been aiming at implementing simpler concepts at increasingly high data rates and with the use of advanced Kerr media and integrated circuits. Within the framework of the thesis, four particular circuits were studied and experimentally demonstrated for the first time. These include a multi-wavelength <b>regeneration</b> <b>circuit</b> for on-off keying (OOK) signals, a clock recovery circuit for ultra-short, synchronous or asynchronous optical packets, a circuit for regeneration of optical differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals and a feedback circuit for rate multiplication of pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS). The multi-wavelength <b>regeneration</b> <b>circuit</b> is based on the implementation of a carefully designed dispersion map that allows for the elimination of the nonlinear interaction between the WDM channels and for their simultaneous regeneration by means of the self-phase modulation effect. The clock recovery circuit is based, in turn, on the use of a Fabry-Perot filter (FPF) and a subsequent optical power limiter, which drastically suppresses the intense amplitude modulation of the FPF output and delivers the high-quality signal of the recovered clock. The DPSK regenerator relies on the decoding of the input data streams and the phase re-modulation of a new optical carrier using a nonlinear fiber-based Sagnac interferometer. The concept exploits the nonlinear transfer function of the Sagnac gate and offers the possibility for suppressing both the phase- and the amplitude-noise of the input signals, thus resulting in their regeneration. Finally, the all-optical feedback circuit exploits the feedback topology and the functionality of an optical OR gate to achieve the data rate multiplication of PRBS with higher flexibility, favorable scaling laws and higher operation quality as compared to the conventional, linear techniques. The optical implementation of the OR gate relies again on the nonlinear fiber-based Sagnac interferometer. All four circuits were experimentally demonstrated at 40 Gb/s data rate range, but the capability of extending their operation at higher data rates is given. Their practical significance refers to their potential for deployment in first-, second- and third-generation optical communication networks, as well as in test & measurement systems for the performance evaluation of a variety of optical elements, circuits, subsystems and systems...|$|E

40|$|Mesoangioblasts (MABs) are vessel-associated {{stem cells}} that express pericyte marker genes and {{participate}} in skeletal muscle <b>regeneration.</b> Molecular <b>circuits</b> that regulate the myogenic commitment of MABs are still poorly characterized. The critical role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling during proliferation and differentiation of adult myogenic precursors, such as satellite cells, has recently been established. We evaluated whether BMP signalling impacts on the myogenic potential of embryonic and adult MABs both in vitro and in vivo. Addition of BMP inhibited MAB myogenic differentiation, whereas interference with the interactions between BMPs and receptor complexes induced differentiation. Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Smad 8 in Smad 1 / 5 -null MABs or inhibition of SMAD 1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation with Dorsomorphin (DM) also improved myogenic differentiation, demonstrating a novel role of SMAD 8. Moreover, using a transgenic mouse model of Smad 8 deletion, we demonstrated {{that the absence of}} SMAD 8 protein improved MAB myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, once injected into α-Sarcoglycan (Sgca) -null muscles, DM-treated MABs were more efficacious to restore α-sarcoglycan (αSG) protein levels and re-establish functional muscle properties. Similarly, in acute muscle damage, DM-treated MABs displayed a better myogenic potential compared with BMP-treated and untreated cells. Finally, SMADs also control the myogenic commitment of human MABs (hMABs). BMP signalling antagonists are therefore novel candidates to improve the therapeutic effects of hMABs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{conventional}} Matrix Converter {{has been considered}} for aerospace applications because of its compactness in weight and size due to absence of a DC-Link capacitor. In addition the Matrix Converter is capable of producing a variable output voltage with unrestricted input and output frequency. This is useful in aerospace applications which require {{a wide range of}} input frequency, sometimes from 360 Hz to 900 Hz. These key features are only obtained from the Matrix Converter without using any large passive components. The Matrix Converter has an inherent regeneration capability. However, the avoidance of the regeneration may be vital in many aerospace applications, such as aircraft surface actuation systems. According to current aircraft power quality specifications regeneration is not allowed and must be dissipated with in the Matrix Converter drive itself. This thesis proposes two novel methods which allow regeneration from the Matrix Converter motor drive to be avoided. These are the Bi-Directional Switch (BDS) method and Input Power Clamp (IPC) method. In order to detect regeneration in the Matrix Converter motor drive two techniques are used. These are the Power Comparison (PC) technique and Input Voltage Reference (IVR) technique. Finally, to validate the proposed methods a Matrix Converter has been designed and built with a <b>Regeneration</b> Control <b>Circuit</b> (RCC).

Performance and simulation are studied for the PLL. It is found that by an appropriate choice of the tracking loop parameters, the transmitter clock can be regenerated with minimal jitter and delay...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSubventricular zone (SVZ) {{neurogenesis}} continuously provides new GABA-and dopamine (DA) -containing interneurons for the olfac-tory bulb (OB) in most adult mammals. DAergic interneurons {{are located}} in the glomerular layer (GL) where they participate in the processing of sensory inputs. To examine whether adult neurogenesis might contribute to <b>regeneration</b> after <b>circuit</b> injury in mice, we induce DAergic neuronal loss by injecting 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in the dorsal GL or in the right substantia nigra pars compacta. We found that a 6 -OHDA treatment of the OB produces olfactory deficits and local inflammation and partially decreases the number of neurons expressing the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) near the injected site. Blockade of inflammation by minocycline treatment immediately after the 6 -OHDA administration rescued neither TH ϩ interneuron number nor the olfactory deficits, suggesting that the olfactory impairments are most likely linked to TH ϩ cell death and not to microglial activation. TH ϩ interneuron number was restored 1 month later. This rescue resulted at least in part from enhanced recruitment of immature neurons targeting the lesioned GL area. Seven days after 6 -OHDA lesion in the OB, we found that the integration of lentivirus-labeled adult-born neurons was biased: newly formed neurons were preferentially incorporated into glomerular circuits of the lesioned area. Behavioral rehabilitation occurs 2 months after lesion. This study establishes a new model into which loss of DAergic cells could be compensated by recruiting newly formed neurons.

In this study, we ablated olfactory sensory neurons with methimazole and followed the anatomical and functional recovery of circuits expressing genetic markers for I 7 and M 72 receptors (M 72 -IRES-tau-LacZ and I 7 -IRES-tau-GFP). Our results show that 45 days after methimazole-induced lesion, axonal projections to the bulb of M 72 and I 7 populations are largely reestablished. Furthermore, regenerated glomeruli are re-formed within the same areas as those of control, unexposed mice. This anatomical regeneration correlates with functional recovery of a previously learned odorant-discrimination task, dependent on the cognate ligands for M 72 and I 7.

Here, we present procedures to analyze effects of substances on fiber outgrowth based on organotypic slice co-cultures of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in combination with biocytin tracing and tyrosine hydroxylase labeling and subsequent automated image quantification. Selected phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) were studied to identify their potential growth-promoting capacities. Immunohistochemical methods were used to visualize developing fibers in the border region between ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra co-cultivated with the striatum {{as well as the}} cellular expression of PDE 2 A and PDE 10. The quantification shows a significant increase of fiber density in the border region induced by PDE 2 -Is (BAY 60 - 7550; ND 7001), comparable with the potential of the nerve growth factor and in contrast to PDE 10 -I (MP- 10). Analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers indicated a significant increase after treatment with BAY 60 - 7550 and nerve growth factor in relation to dimethyl sulfoxide. Additionally, a dose-dependent increase of intracellular cGMP levels in response to the applied PDE 2 -Is in PDE 2 -transfected HEK 293 cells was found. In summary, our findings show that PDE 2 -Is are able to significantly promote axonal outgrowth in organotypic slice co-cultures, which are a suitable model to assess growth-related effects in neuro(re) generation...|$|R

It aims to partial restoration of the neural functions by circuit remodeling {{rather than by the}} <b>regeneration</b> of damaged <b>circuits.</b> The core hypothesis of the present paper is that – in stroke – brain machine interfaces (BMIs) can be designed to target neural repair instead of rehabilitation. To support this hypothesis we first review existing evidence on the role of endogenous or externally applied electric fields on all processes involved in CNS repair. We then describe our own results to illustrate the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of BMI-electrical stimulation on sensory deprivation-related degenerative processes of the CNS. Finally, we discuss three of the crucial issues involved in the design of neural repair-oriented BMIs: when to stimulate, where to stimulate and – the particularly important but unsolved issue of – how to stimulate. We argue that optimal parameters for the electrical stimulation can be determined from studying and modeling the dynamics of the electric fields that naturally emerge at the central and peripheral nervous system during spontaneous healing in both, experimental animals and human patients. We conclude that a closed-loop BMI that defines the optimal stimulation parameters from a priori developed experimental models of the dynamics of spontaneous repair and the on-line monitoring of neural activity might place BMIs as an alternative or complement to stem-cell transplantation or pharmacological approaches, intensively pursued nowadays...|$|R

Here, we describe a simple, robust technique for monitoring the activity of neural circuits in unfettered, freely behaving zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish respond to unexpected tactile stimuli with short- or long-latency escape behaviors, which are mediated by distinct neural circuits. Using dipole electrodes immersed in the aquarium, we measured electric field potentials generated in muscle during short- and long-latency escapes. We found that activation of the underlying neural circuits produced unique field potential signatures that are easily recognized and can be repeatedly monitored. In conjunction with behavioral analysis, we used this technique to track changes in the pattern of circuit activation {{during the first week of}} development in animals whose trigeminal sensory neurons were unilaterally ablated. One day post-ablation, the frequency of short- and long-latency responses was significantly lower on the ablated side than on the intact side. Three days post-ablation, a significant fraction of escapes evoked by stimuli on the ablated side was improperly executed, with the animal turning towards rather than away from the stimulus. However, the overall response rate remained low. Seven days post-ablation, the frequency of escapes increased dramatically and the percentage of improperly executed escapes declined. Our results demonstrate that trigeminal ablation results in rapid reconfiguration of the escape circuitry, with reinnervation by new sensory neurons and adaptive changes in behavior.

Three drugs, vincristine, vinblastine, and podophyllotoxin, administered semiweekly by ip injection, each inhibited regeneration at doses that did not impair maintenance of response. Similar results were previously reported for ip colchicine. Vincristine was several times more potent than podophyllotoxin or colchicine and 25 times more potent than vinblastine. Picropodophyllotoxin, an isomer of podophyllotoxin which has low affinity for tubulin, did not inhibit regeneration. The io experiments showed that maintenance of vision was reversibly inhibited by a single {{injection of}} 0. 05 [mu]g/g of colchicine but unaffected by 0. 01 [mu]g/g, and that administration of the lower dose immediately following optic nerve crush inhibited regeneration. Intraocular lumicolchicine, a colchicine photoisomer which has low affinity for tubulin, did not inhibit maintenance or regeneration. In contrast, an io dose of vincristine sufficient to inhibit visual recovery also blocked maintenance of vision. Thus regeneration and maintenance effects could not be dissociated for io vincristine suggesting its mechanism of action on retinal cells is different.

Therapies {{that lead to}} cessation of the de-generative process still leave the brain riddled with deteriorated neural circuits and reduced neuron number. The discovery of neurogenesis in the adult brain and the regenerative potential of neural stem cells holds the promise for restoration of neural populations and <b>regeneration</b> of neural <b>circuits</b> necessary for cerebral function. While the regenerative potential of neural stem cells is great, so too is the challenge of delivering neural stem cells to the brain. Basic science analyses and human trials indicate that constituents of microenvironments within the brain determine the neurogenic potential, pheno-typic differentiation of neural stem cells and magnitude of the neural stem cell pool. Multiple analyses have documented that dentate neurogenesis is regulated by multiple growth factors which are abundant during development and which dra-matically decline with age. While the cause(s) of age-associated decline in neurogenesis remains to be fully determined, loss in growth factors, FGF- 2, IGF- 1 and VEGF, in the microenvironment of the subgranular zone (SGZ) are prime con-tributors to the reduced neurogenic potential. The decline in dentate neurogenesis can be observed as early as middle age. In the aged and AD brain, both the pool of neural stem cells and their proliferative potential are markedly diminished. In parallel, the level of potential regenerative factors is diminished in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to age-matched controls.

To understand the impact of injury on both sympathetic and parasympathetic components of this nerve supply, we performed an experimental surgical and immunohistochemical study on adult male rats, where the structure of this complex part {{of the nervous system}} has been well defined. We performed unilateral transection of pelvic or hypogastric nerves and analysed relevant regions of lumbar and sacral spinal cord, up to four weeks after injury. Expression of c-Jun, the neuronal injury marker activating transcription factor- 3 (ATF- 3), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were examined. We found little evidence for chemical or structural changes in substantial numbers of functionally related but uninjured spinal neurons (e. g. in sacral preganglionic neurons after hypogastric nerve injury), failing to support the concept of compensatory events. The effects of injury were greatest in sacral cord, ipsilateral to pelvic nerve transection. Here, around half of all preganglionic neurons expressed c-Jun within one week of injury, and substantial ATF- 3 expression also occurred, especially in neurons with complete loss of ChAT-immunoreactivity. There {{did not appear to be}} any death of retrogradely labelled neurons, in contrast to axotomy studies performed on other regions of spinal cord or sacral ventral root avulsion models. Each of the effects we observed occurred in only a subpopulation of preganglionic neurons at that spinal level, raising the possibility that distinct functional subgroups have different susceptibility to trauma-induced degeneration and potentially different regenerative abilities.
