5|$|While the {{government}} brought in foreign experts (yatoi) during {{the building of}} the country's modern infrastructure, the high seismicity in Japan proved to be an ideal laboratory setting during the establishment of the new science of seismology. In 1876, John Milne came from England to teach at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Following the earthquake of February 22, 1880, Milne's attention turned to seismology as a primary area of study. That earthquake also triggered the formation of the Seismological Society of Japan, which was an organization to help foreign scientists stay coordinated in their efforts. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese had their own organization (the Japan Meteorological Agency) that had taken control of an earthquake <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> that was initially created by Milne. Ultimately, the system and the 1891 earthquake provided data by which seismologist Fusakichi Omori developed a law of decay for aftershocks.|$|E

The current paper describes the ESGE's viewpoints on the requirements for high-quality endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> in GI endoscopy. Recommendations 1 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> must be electronic. 2 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> should be integrated into hospitals' patient record <b>systems.</b> 3 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> should include patient identifiers to facilitate data linkage to other data sources. 4 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> shall restrict the use of free-text entry to a minimum, and be based mainly on structured data entry. 5 Separate entry of data for quality or research purposes is discouraged. Automatic data transfer for quality and research purposes must be facilitated. 6 Double entry of data by the endoscopist or associate personnel is discouraged. Available data from outside sources (administrative or medical) must be made available automatically. 7 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> shall facilitate the inclusion of information on histopathology of detected lesions, patient satisfaction, adverse events, and surveillance recommendations. 8 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> must facilitate easy data retrieval {{at any time in}} a universally compatible format. 9 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> must include data fields for key performance indicators as defined by quality improvement committees. 10 Endoscopy <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> must facilitate changes in indicators and data entry fields as required by professional organization...|$|R

5|$|Most {{countries}} place {{dietary supplements}} {{in a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event <b>Reporting</b> <b>System</b> to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for dietary supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} toxic player behavior, which is unacceptable behavior by players in online communities, within Smite {{has been studied}} through analyzing Hi-Rez Studios player behavior initiatives {{and the effectiveness of}} their Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> in an attempt to fully understand which factors, which can be influenced by policy, determine the effectiveness of the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> so that recommendations on how to improve the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> can be provided in order to combat toxic player behavior within Smite. Prior to evaluating the effectiveness of the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> Hi-Rez Studios’ Player Behavior policy was examined to determine what mechanisms that underlie the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> could determine the effectiveness of the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System.</b> To determine how well developed Hi-Rez Studios’ Player Behavior policy is the Player Behavior policy of two other games got examined. Further, the Player Behavior policy of these other games was used to provide Hi-Rez Studios with recommendations on how to increase the effectiveness of the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System.</b> The effectiveness of Smite’s Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> has been analyzed by comparing the current effectiveness of the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> with the desired effectiveness of the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System.</b> This research showed that the current Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> is ineffective in suspending the desired percentage of players that had exhibited suspension worthy toxic player behavior. Furthermore, {{this research}} showed that number of reports can be used as an indicator of whether a player has exhibited toxic player behavior, that it is inconclusive whether the Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> is effective in altering the behavior of those players who have been suspended, and that the more competitive/serious players are more likely to exhibit toxic player behavior than the more casual players. The factors, which can be influenced by policy, that determine the effectiveness of Hi-Rez Studios Player Behavior policy regarding the reduction of toxic player behavior are the number of cases that are reviewed, the amount of toxic player behavior that is exhibited and reported, whether reports are filed against players who exhibit toxic player behavior, the number of games of Smite a player has played, and the number of hours per game a player has played Smite. The recommendations provided can be sorted into two categories: proactive policy options, and retroactive policy options. The proactive policy options focus on preventing suspension worthy toxic player behavior to be exhibited, and the retroactive policy options focus on punishing those players who have exhibited suspension worthy toxic player behavior. The policy options that were recommended are: a player behavior alert system, communication restrictions, behavioral guidelines, an automated suspension/ban system for second- and third degree offenses, implementing a suspension notification, simplifying the Customer Support team case review tool, and possibly expanding the Customer Support team as well as increasing the amount of time they can spend on reviewing cases on a daily basis...|$|R
