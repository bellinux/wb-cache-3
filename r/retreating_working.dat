50|$|Wilberforce and Babington {{spent much}} time at the Rothley <b>retreat</b> <b>working</b> on {{the text of the}} bills, and on the {{analysis}} of the Select Committees enquiries into the trade. Babington was instrumental in rescuing his wifes young brother, Zachary Macaulay, from the mental trauma of working as an overseer on a Jamaican slave plantation, when Zachary came to recuperate at Rothley Temple. Zachary was restored, and with a new Christian faith, went on to a lifetime devoted to the anti-slavery cause, and to have a posthumous bust in his honour placed in Westminster Abbey. Zachary returned often to Rothley, and on one long visit in 1800 his wife Selina (née Mills) gave birth to poet, historian and Whig politician Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay.|$|R

5|$|Before the 18th century, {{the land}} along which Euston Road runs was fields and farmland. Camden Town was a village <b>retreat</b> for Londoners <b>working</b> in the city. Euston Road was {{originally}} part of New Road, promoted by Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton and enabled by an Act of Parliament passed in 1756. Construction began in May that year, {{and it was}} open to traffic by September.|$|R

Since 1971, VCCA has offered residencies {{of two weeks}} to two months for international artists, writers, and composers at its <b>working</b> <b>retreat</b> {{in the foothills of}} Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. VCCA is among the nation's largest artist residency programs, and since 2004, has also offered workshops and retreats at its studio center in Southwest France, Le Moulin à Nef.|$|R
50|$|Hedgebrook is a rural {{retreat for}} women writers on Whidbey Island, Washington, founded in 1988. Hedgebrook's artist-in-{{residence}} program accepts 40 writers each year, who spend {{two to six}} weeks in residence working on their diverse writing projects. Each writer stays in her own hand-crafted cottage. Room and board are provided {{at no cost to}} the writers-in-residence. The <b>retreat</b> is a <b>working</b> farm, offering organic produce for the writers, and communal dinners each night prepared by in-house chefs.|$|R
5000|$|Chateau Ste. Michelle is {{the oldest}} winery in Washington state. It was founded as the American Wine Company, a 1954 merger of the National Wine Company (NAWICO), founded in 1934, and the Pomerelle Wine Company. (For years, {{there was a large}} neon sign {{advertising}} NAWICO in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood.) The French-style chateau is located on 87 acre of land with mature trees that once belonged to lumber baron Frederick Stimson, who used it as a hunting <b>retreat</b> and rural <b>working</b> farm called the Hollywood Farm.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Whidbey, {{master of}} the Discovery during the 1791-95 Vancouver expedition, found Icy Strait, {{at the south end}} of Glacier Bay, choked with ice in 1794. Glacier Bay itself was almost entirely covered by one large tidewater glacier. In 1879 naturalist John Muir found that the ice had retreated almost all the way up the bay, a {{distance}} of around 48 mi. By 1916 the Grand Pacific Glacier was at the head of Tarr Inlet about 65 miles (105 km) from Glacier Bay's mouth. This is the fastest documented glacier retreat. Not all of the park's glaciers are in retreat. Two examples are the Johns Hopkins Glacier which, according to observations in 2012, has been advancing at the rate of 10 to 15 ft per day, and the Margerie Glacier which is stable, neither advancing nor <b>retreating.</b> Scientists <b>working</b> in the park and preserve hope to learn how glacial activity relates to climate change.|$|R

In {{a speech to}} the Quebec Electric Industry Association he bluntly called the whole electric business an [...] "unbelievably costly mess". The minister then toured the province in order to reassure the population and refute the arguments of the Shawinigan Water & Power Company, the main opponent of the proposed takeover. On September 4 and 5, 1962, Lévesque finally convinced his liberal cabinet colleagues {{to go ahead with the}} plan during a <b>working</b> <b>retreat</b> at a fishing camp north of Quebec City. The issue topped the liberal agenda during a snap election called two years early, and their chosen theme, [...] "Maîtres chez nous" [...] (in English: [...] "Master in our Own Homes"), had a strong nationalist undertone.|$|R
50|$|Whiteley met {{his wife}} Helen Riaboff Whiteley while at the University of California, Berkeley. She {{established}} {{a career as a}} microbiologist credited with prompting the University of Washington to revise its rules against employing both members of a married couple as faculty. The Whiteleys were committed to environmental conservation; Arthur was active in promoting restrictions on fishing in Puget Sound and other local environmental causes. He served for many years as president of the Marine Environmental Consortium and spent a year as chair of the San Juan Nature Institute. Arthur founded the Helen Riaboff Whiteley Center at Friday Harbor Laboratories in his wife's memory; the center serves as a <b>working</b> <b>retreat</b> for scientists, scholars, and artists.

5000|$|The main convent at 82 West Main Street, Mendham, New Jersey, {{includes}} a retreat house for guests {{and also the}} community's historic church, all set in over 20 acres of land. The convent building was constructed as the Mother House of the American community in 1913. The sisters then closed down the Mother House at 233 E. 17th St. in Manhattan and moved permanently to Mendham in 1915. The Convent building {{was added to the}} American National Register of Historic Places (reference number 07000356) in 2007. [...] The architects of the main convent were Durr Friedley and William W. Cordingly. St. Marguerite's Retreat House in Mendham, Built in 1908 in the 'Tudor Revival' style, was a home and school for girls until after World War II, and is now a <b>working</b> <b>retreat</b> house for all denominations. Its architects were James Layng Mills and John C. Greenleaf.|$|R
30|$|In Moscow, {{it seems}} he had been granted artistic freedom {{and for a time}} was immune to {{political}} censure. This immunity was short lived and it is evident that his style was to change drastically upon his return. He was expected to produce art accessible by the common man, which was representative of Soviet realism. Although he had not felt any censure upon his return, all modern composers were being denounced and removed from programs (The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2001 f, p. 295). Dimitri Shostakovich was publicly denounced and this was when Prokofiev <b>retreated</b> and began <b>working</b> on many small pieces, some for children. This is when the opus 65, Music for Children, and opus 68, Three Children’s Songs were written. Other larger works exhibiting the stylistic shift to a more lyrical genre were Romeo and Juliet and Peter and the Wolf (The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2001 f, p. 295). Stanley Krebs suggests that work with children was often assigned to political offenders and this is why so often Prokofiev worked with youth until his death (Krebs, 1970 e, p. 163).|$|R
5000|$|In college, Anastasio studied {{composition}} under {{composer and}} arranger Ernie Stires. [...] "Guelah Papyrus", featured on Phish's major label debut A Picture of Nectar, includes a Stires-influenced fugue instrumental section called [...] "The Asse Festival" [...] {{as a bridge}} between verses. In {{the early years of}} Phish, many of Anastasio's compositions were through-composed, intricate and detailed in conception (for example, [...] "The Divided Sky", [...] "You Enjoy Myself", [...] "The Asse Festival", [...] "The Squirming Coil", [...] "Reba", [...] "Fluff's Travels"). Anastasio has used improvisation as the driving force behind simplified songwriting, particularly in the music he has written for his touring and recording projects apart from Phish.Tom Marshall, a New Jersey computer systems professional and friend of Anastasio since his Princeton childhood, has been his primary songwriting collaborator, acting as lyricist. Anastasio has often pulled lyrics for his music from large notebooks of poems and prose kept by Marshall, and the pair have taken <b>working</b> <b>retreats</b> during which they wrote and/or recorded demos of new material. One such demo, Trampled By Lambs and Pecked by the Dove, has been commercially released, and many of the songs included on this release were reincarnated into Phish's 1998 album The Story of the Ghost. Anastasio also writes a number of his own lyrics, including all of the lyrics on his first release with Columbia Records, 2005's Shine.|$|R
30|$|The {{importance}} of symmetry {{is illustrated in}} Fig.  5. The axes show, for each party, the expected net benefits from cooperation over future periods that are put at risk by breach compared with the potential gains in the current period. Higher ratios reflect greater investments in firm-specific skills and knowledge, such as result from on-the-job problem-solving and learning. The 45 degree line shows where these are symmetrical between the parties, and where the two systems are most robust because both are equally ready to punish breaches. A displacement from this represents a disadvantage to the party with the higher ratio, reflecting Stinchcombe’s principle of lesser interest, and if it persists, that party would be more secure by moving to a lower level, for example, by retreating to narrower jobs with more specific task obligations. 19 When the ratio falls below unity, net gains from breach exceed punishment costs, so the temptation to play Hawk or Dove is too great for a viable employment relationship, and a sales contract which specifies task obligations in advance will be preferred. The figure illustrates how the <b>retreat</b> from flexible <b>working</b> need not be sudden and dramatic. It {{is more likely to}} emerge as the quality of cooperation degrades, and workers disengage from the additional activities related to their jobs, in a process analogous to method drift under incentive pay systems (Schmiede and Schudlich 1976). Active use of voice channels provides an alternative solution.|$|R
50|$|In 1889 {{architect}} Ehrick Rossiter (1854-1941) {{who was an}} 1871 {{graduate of}} The Gunnery in Washington, Connecticut purchased 100 acre along the Shepaug River to save it from logging. The area included several miles of SL&N tracks. In 1893 philanthropists Edward I. and Mary Lawrence McLane Van Ingen built Holiday House south of Washington Depot following plans drawn up by Rossiter. Holiday House served as a country hotel or <b>retreat</b> for young <b>working</b> women from New York City. It was a non sectarian effort run by St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York (then on 42nd street). Although Holiday House stopped operating as a retreat by 1918 and was torn down shortly thereafter, vestiges of it including stone walkways and stone foundations for a pedestrian suspension bridge that allowed train passengers to disembark and {{make their way to}} the retreat still stand in the Steep Rock revervation.In 1925 Rossiter donated his land to a group of trustees so that it could be preserved in its wooded state. In 1929 the Steep Rock Association trustees purchased the rounded oxbow encircled hill known as the Clam Shell and added it to the preserve. The floods of 1955 removed the remnants of the SL&N bridge over the river near the Clam Shell. Over the years additional land in separate parcels was donated to the trust and it currently conserves more than 2700 acre. Several kilometers of former SL&N track right of way form hiking and bridle trails within the Steep Rock Association preserves today.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} western German women {{who wish to}} work has {{increased}} continuously since the mid-sixties irrespective of the economic development. In eastern Germany it remained {{at a high level}} in spite of continuously high unemployment. With the crisis on the labour market in the early nineties, however, it also became increasingly difficult for western German women to realise their wishes regarding employment, and in eastern Germany the competition on the labour market intensified {{at the expense of the}} women. The result was a stagnating labour force participation of women in western Germany compared with the 1980 s, with an increasing shift from full-time to part-time work, high unemployment, and the decline in the employment of women in eastern Germany almost to the level in western Germany. These are the results of a survey carried out by the IAB in 1995 which included 4, 059 women in western Germany and 2, 683 in eastern Germany. In addition it could be seen that the higher labour force participation of better qualified women which was ascertained as early as the 1980 s stabilised in all age groups in western Germany in the 1990 s. As a result of the above-average sudden drops in employment among women without a vocational qualification and among those with skilled or semi-skilled worker qualifications, the employment opportunities of eastern German women were even more strongly determined by the level of vocational qualifications. The consequence of this was that eastern German women from lower income groups, whose financial necessity to work is the highest, succeed less and less in finding employment again. With the improved basic legal conditions since the beginning of 1991, the number of women on childcare leave increased clearly, especially in western Germany. The 'voluntary' <b>retreat</b> from <b>working</b> life in this phase of life was, however, frequently of a temporary nature: the vast majority of western German women and virtually all eastern German women wished to return to work following the period of childcare leave. Whereas to a large extent western German women succeeded in returning to work after childcare leave, more than a quarter of the eastern German women who gave up work between 1990 and 1992 in order to care for children were unemployed or seeking work at the time of the survey. Women in western Germany also more frequently had possibilities to maintain contact to their company via part-time or temporary work during their childcare leave than did women in eastern Germany.
