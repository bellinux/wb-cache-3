40|$|In TMP-refining processes, the {{stabilization}} of the fiber pad inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> requires a new control approach. Specific energy control {{tends to be}} complex and most often affected {{by a number of}} disturbances not so well specified in traditional MPC-concepts. To describe the dynamics in such nonlinear processes is difficult, tedious and requires significant maintenance support. This paper focuses on two important issues related to modeling in mechanical pulping processes: measurements of internal states inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> and in particular natural decoupling to find a model suitable for future process optimization and improved control concepts of complete refiner lines. The idea is to show how this complex process, with serially linked refiners or refining zones, can be modeled and controlled using a simplified process description. In this series of papers, data from a commercial Twin-refiner and a CD-refiner are available as inputs. As an example of internal state measurements, <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature profiles and estimated distributed consistency in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> are used.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} energy usage {{has become a}} key issue in all industrial sectors. In the energy demanding production of mechanical pulps many efforts have focused on design development, but regarding control of refiners, {{there is still a}} potential for improvements. The possibilities of improved control performance are enhanced by reliable process measurements and here, <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature measurements are considered. This thesis includes two parallel paths. One path considers first-principles modeling of TMP refining processes. An entropy approach is applied when deriving estimates of the irreversible work associated with refining. Results show that this irreversible work, as well as the reversible thermodynamic work related to steam generation, are distributed over the refining plates forming characteristic profiles. Moreover, the entropy model can estimate material flows and pulp concentration as functions of the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> radius and this is made possible by measuring of temperature profiles. The entropy model provides an extensive description of important process phenomena that can be useful in relation to process design as well as process control. The other path considers refiner control. Firstly, it shows how unfortunate process design can restrict operational performance in a TMP production process. It is shown how the presence of internal interconnections could complicate control tasks and produce intricate disturbance patterns. Secondly, traditional control strategies are challenged by classifying specific energy as an integrated measure unable to reflect local phenomena inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> Models for pulp quality variables, derived using a system identification approach, shown that no significant dynamic contribution is given by the specific energy, besides what is already given by the inputs production rate, dilution water flow and hydraulic pressure. It is, however, concluded that the models were significantly improved by the introduction of <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature measurements. Finally, the two parallel paths of this thesis meet in a discussion of control strategies involving different decoupling schemes. Besides a more general work considering simplified decoupling, a decoupling-based approach that utilizes the nature of refining processes is presented. This approach, referred to as natural decoupling, is enabled by the availability of <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature measurements and the increased process knowledge obtained during this project...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been carried out with the goal of {{improving}} pulp quality control in TMP refining processes without a deeper understanding about the physical conditions inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> The refiner is thereby considered as a black box where the chips are defibrated to fibers. In this paper, a non-linear model for the estimation of thermodynamic and defibration/fibrillation work is presented. It is shown that the model requires temperature measurements to span the energy balances and obtain reliable pressure gradients inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> Based on process data from a single disc refiner, it is shown that the defibration/fibrillation work varies substantially along the radius of the refining segments, even though the total work, i. e. the motor load, is almost the same over the specific time sequences. This is a consequence of variations in the concentration of the fiber pad built up inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> Moreover, it is shown that the commonly used control concept, where the traditional specific energy is used as a control variable should be reconsidered.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that plate gaps are {{sometimes}} unequal in two-zoned low consistency refiners and that unequal gaps render unevenly refined pulp. It is also known that optimisation of plate gap in low consistency refining leads to improved energy efficiency. In this work, trials were made in mill scale in a modern TMP line equipped with a prototype 72 inch TwinFlo low consistency refiner in second stage. The study was designed to investigate the development of pulp properties from different rotor positions by means of altering the outlet flow rate ratio. The specific energy consumption was calculated for each <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> and setting, based on flow rate and temperature increase. In order to produce homogenous pulp, it was found that uneven plate gaps need to be compensated in low consistency refiners with dual refining zones. Results from the different flow rate adjustments indicated that the control setting with similar plate gap gave the most homogenous pulp. However, further studies are needed to find an adequate rotor control strategy. The temperature increase in each <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> seems to correlate well with the applied specific energy consumption in each <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> I Stefan Anderssons Licentiatavhandling ingår den inskickade versionen av artikeln</p...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of papers {{presenting}} the development of a comprehensive multiscale model with focus on fiber energy efficiency in thermo mechanical pulp processes. The fiber energy efficiency is related to the defibration and fibrillation work obtained when fibers and fiber bundles interact with the refining bars. The fiber energy efficiency differs from the total refining energy efficiency which includes the thermodynamical work as well. Extracting defibration and fibrillation work along the radius in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> gives information valuable for fiber development studies. Models for this process must handle physical variables as well as machine specific parameters at different scales. To span the material and energy balances, spatial measurements from the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> must be available. In this paper, measurements of temperature profile and plate gaps from a full-scale CD-refiner are considered as model inputs together with a number of process variables. This enables the distributed consistency in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> as well as the split of the total work between the flat zone and the CD-zone to be derived. As the temperature profile and the plate gap are available in the flat zone and the CD-zone at different process conditions it is also shown that the distributed pulp dynamic viscosity can be obtained. This is normally unknown in refining processes but certainly useful for all fluid dynamic models describing the bar-to-fiber interactions. Finally, it is shown that the inclusion of the machine parameters will be vital to get good estimates of the refining conditions and especially the split between the thermodynamical work and the defibration/fibrillation work...|$|E
40|$|In control {{strategies}} for thermomechanical pulp refiners, {{the relation between}} energy consumption and production rate, often called specific energy, {{has been used as}} a key variable for decades. The importance of controlling the specific energy and thereby indirectly the pulp quality, has been an indisputable axiom for most engineers engaged in the pulp and paper industry. Recently, another competing concept based on <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature measurements has been presented as an alternative for improved pulp quality control, but so far no comparison between these two concepts has been made. In this study, the two concepts are compared based on a system identification procedure using “Auto Regressive Moving Average eXogenous” (ARMAX) models. The identification procedure adopted creates dynamic models that can provide predictions of the commonly used pulp quality variables Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF) and Mean Fiber Length (MFL). These predictions are all based on the traditional process variables, i. e. production rate, dilution water flow, and hydraulic pressure, in combination with information of either the specific energy and or the temperature profile. The results show that it is not motivated to use the specific energy for predictions of CSF and MFL, as it gives limited dynamic information of the refining process besides what already is given by the three traditional process variables. Whereas, using the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature measurements as inputs to the ARMAX models results in a significant improvement of the ability to predict the pulp quality variables.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on an {{experimental}} study of the pressure conditions in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> of high-consistency refiners used in paper making. The work presents the findings from two different mill-scale experiments in addition to results obtained from a pilot refiner study. The experiments have been performed using two different types of pressure sensors: • Fibre-optic pressure sensors based on extrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer (EFPI). • Piezoresistive temperature and pressure transducers. This study has shown {{that it is possible to}} establish high-frequency pressure measurements in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> of high-consistency refiners. Data have been collected at rates up to 20 million samples per second. The fibre-optic sensors seem to be preferable to the piezoresistive transducers as the fibre-optic sensors were working well after long exposure to the harsh environment inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> Reliable measurements were still obtained after 1000 operating hours. On the other hand, the piezoresistive sensors suffered from problems caused by the wet environment inside the refiner as well as from the electrical dependent circuits and transmission cables. However, in the pilot refiner under less harsh environment, the piezoresistive transducer functioned well. The main focus in this thesis has been related to the second mill-scale experiment which used fibre-optic pressure sensors. The results obtained from this experiment are considered to be more valuable than those from the first mill-scale experiment which used combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducers. Furthermore, pulp samples were collected during the second mill-scale experiment allowing an even more comprehensive analysis. However, the results from the first mill-scale experiment are shown as a comparison and in order to demonstrate the challenge of selecting the appropriate technology. Results from a successfully test performed in the pilot refiner, which also used a combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducer, are shown as well. In addition, as a supplement to the results from the mill-scale experiment with fibre-optic sensors, an experiment which employed external accelerometers for measuring the high-frequency vibrations in the mill refiner is discussed. Another supplement was made through an experiment measuring the deviation of the rotational speed of the refiner shaft. The main objective of this study has been to find out how to make high-frequency pressure measurements in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> of a mill-scale high-consistency TMP refiner. The study has particularly focused on the signal analyses and the reliability of the pressure measurements. Since the investigations have been focused on the experimental issues, assessments are primarily made regarding the recorded data and the related process observations. One of the challenges was to find suitable technology for use in a harsh environment. Obtaining and selecting an appropriate sensor was extremely important. A fast responding sensor was prerequisite. It was of particular interest to investigate the pressure pulses generated from the squeezing of wood particles between the sensor surface and the bars on the opposite disc. In addition, the dimension of the sensor surface had to be small so that the peak pressures could be determined. The size should preferably be smaller than a width of a bar. Especially the fibre-optic sensors met this criterion as they had a surface diameter of approximately 1 mm. The piezoresistive sensors had a surface diameter of 3. 8 mm. Mill-scale experiments were conducted to test the sensors in a realistic environment. The design of the experiments was important in the assessment of the performance of the sensors during different controlled conditions. Collecting of pulp samples to assess the pulp quality of the primary refining in comparison to the process behaviour and the pressure signals were matters of additional interest. The analyses of the experiment should give conclusions about the reliability of the sensors. A goal of the present work has also been to examine the behaviour and the properties of the pressure signals, and investigate the origin of the pressure pulses. Most of the results are from high-frequency measurements of pressure in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> of a high-consistency TMP refiner. Combined temperature and pressure measurements are shown from the test in the pilot refiner. The fast development within sensor and computer technology has made it possible to achieve measurements that have not been performed earlier. The use of fibre-optic sensor technology in chip refiners has not been reported earlier. The high-frequency recordings using sample rates of up to 20 MSamples/s suffered from the lack of demodulation technology such that the accuracy of the absolute pressure readings is limited. However, this study indicates average pressures between 20 and 30 bar in the intermediate zone. Even more interesting is the fast pressure changes obtained using frequency analysis. Common frequencies indicating vibrations in the discs appearing from the pressure pulses when the pulp is squeezed between the bars of the stator and rotor disc have been observed. This observation was supported by vibration analysis using external accelerometers. It is claimed that there is a relationship between vibrations in the refiner discs and the pressure pulses that are generated from the squeezing of pulp between bars on the rotor and stator disc. However, nobody has investigated this particular relationship although this study strongly indicates that this relationship exists. Furthermore, it is shown that the pressure sensors were not affected by vibrations operating in resonance. This strongly supports the conclusion that the fibre-optic pressure sensors were solely measuring the activities in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> The frequency analysis of the different recordings gave firm evidence of the process related influences of the pressure readings. The reliability of the performance of the sensors was clearly visible through this analysis technique. Several analyses found that the shift in the bar crossing frequencies was directly proportional to and caused by fluctuations in the rotational speed of the refiner. However, local bar crossing frequencies were generally not as clear as expected. The measurements indicated that some specific radial positions determined by the tapered plate pattern, dominated the responses. Among the most dominating frequencies were periodicities associated with the rotational speed of the refiner, the number of bars in the breaker bar and coarse zones as well as the transition zone between the intermediate and fine bar zones. When the plates were new, a 25. 2 kHz periodicity that arose from a bar-to-bar passage in the fine bar zone dominated the pressure readings. These pulses probably propagated in the disc so that the whole disc vibrated. It is not assumed that these vibrations generated large plate gap variations. However, these fluctuations were predominant compared with the local generated pressure pulses. The pressure variations probably propagated through the steam and pulp pad as pressure waves. Thus the pulp and steam flow through the whole <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> was affected. The local bar crossing frequencies were suppressed and only visible to a minor extent. It is conceivable that the steam and pulp interacts through a two-phase flow. Thus the steam may have a repressive effect on the interaction between the pulp pad and the bar patterns on the discs. Recordings during different controlled operating conditions were used to study the reliability of the sensors. The relationship between the pressure signals and the process variables has been investigated as well. The most reliable relationship was obtained when changing the chip flow to the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> after 1000 hours of operating time. The motor load and acceleration variables were strongly correlated with the pressure readings. No strong correlations were found between the data from the pressure sensors and the process variables shortly after start-up using new plates. The pulp samples that were collected and analysed did not give a good relationship between the pressure signals and the quality data. However, during this period other process disturbances affected the conditions in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> more than the randomized manipulation of the control variables. This was observed as time dependent variations in the pressure recordings as well as several process variables. The most probable disturbance was the amount of chips fed to the refiner and subsequent changes of the plate gap. Further indications imply that the pressure sensors were sensitive to variations in the incoming stream of chips. Besides the successful test when changing the chip flow to the <b>refining</b> <b>zone,</b> frequency analyses have showed that the sensors also were affected by periodicities in the pulp flow that were related to the inner part of the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> and the breaker bar section. This was shown both as sideband effects as well as plain peak frequencies. Sideband effects are interpreted as periodic waves of pulp flow propagated through the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> This study indicates that the average pressure in the intermediate zone of the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> of the mill-scale TMP refiner was as high as 20 - 30 bar. This was somewhat higher than expected from the theoretical considerations. However, the theoretical calculations have some limiting factors, which there are some disagreement in the literature. The area where the energy is applied in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> as well as the tangential friction coefficient is not clearly determined. Both are included in one of the theoretical approaches. Thus there are some uncertainties associated with the models. However, some uncertainties are related to the determination of the pressure levels for the measurements using the fibre-optic sensors as well. This is mainly due to the lack of well-established demodulation techniques for the sinusoidal relation between the sensor signal and the pressure. This is the greatest weakness in this part of the investigation. The pressure levels obtained using the piezoresistive sensors were to some extent agreeable with the fibre-optic measurements. However, there was greater uncertainty in the piezoresistive measurements due to probable disturbances related to electromagnetic noise or moisture having a detrimental influence on electric circuits in the sensors. The most interesting results obtained using the piezoresistive sensors in the mill-scale experiment have been observations of process relevant periodic signal patterns. Stable average pressures between 2 and 4. 5 bar were found in the atmospheric pilot refiner during normal operating conditions. Since the local bar crossing frequency did not dominate the periodicities obtained from these recordings it is assumed that the steam affected the pressure conditions in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> This is assumed despite the fact that the refiner was atmospheric. Pressure peaks above 10 bar were observed frequently. When the plate gap decreased, the pressure pulses were considerably higher. Pressure peaks up to 60 bar were observed during operation with a small plate clearance. The local bar crossing frequency was clearly visible under such conditions, not otherwise. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

This has {{a direct impact on}} the distributed force in the refining zones obtained when the bars hit the fibers or fiber bundles.

40|$|The {{central issue}} of the thesis is {{modeling}} {{and control of the}} Thermomechanical Pulp (TMP) process in which large refiners are used to produce pulp for newsprint. The TMP process {{is one of the most}} complex and versatile, electricity consuming industrial processes today. In this thesis, modeling has been addressed from many different perspectives, timescales and levels of detail, to enable a more thorough understanding of the process. The theories comprise mill-wide energy modeling, dynamic modeling and control of a refiner line and modeling of the refiner zone process. The modeling theories are verified using measurements from a full-scale refiner line and include measurements of temperatures and high-frequency pressure fluctuations inside the refining zones. In this thesis, a complete model describing the TMP process from an energy perspective is presented. As the steam produced in the refiners is used at the paper mill together with additional steam from a power plant, a reduction in energy consumption in the TMP-plant does not necessarily imply lower overall energy usage. With the derived mill-wide energy model, a complete energy optimization can be performed. The refiner line is a complex dynamic system where the internal interconnection, the dynamics of the unit operations, the production rate and possible stiction in control valves determine the major part of the plant's dynamic behavior. To illustrate this, a dynamic model of the refiner line has been included in the thesis and has also been implemented on-line parallel to the true refiner line. Moreover, a theory for control of the refiner has been derived as a 3 x 3 decoupling strategy using load, consistency and temperature at a certain radius in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> as outputs. This relatively complex control structure appears to be a reasonable solution, but sensitive to model uncertainties. It is shown that a more robust choice for control would therefore be a 2 x 2 decoupling control, or exchange an output, preferably the load to another, possibly a soft sensor, output. The physical models of the defibration process presented in this thesis use temperatures and pressure measurements in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> The consistency estimation routine has proven to be faster than the online measurements and more accurate than a pure energy balance of the refiner. The principal contribution is, however, the increased understanding of the refining process as it gives plausible explanation to the refining mechanism, most notably of the refining work distribution in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> and the transfer of macroscopic motion to inner energy via viscous dissipation. Finally, the measured pressure signals presented are shown to be the generated dynamic pressure as bars pass over the sensor. It is also concluded that the pressure measurements, and thereby the defibration, differ between the two refining zones in the specific refiner studied. The energy content in important frequency peaks are also found to vary with operation point...|$|E

Magnetic arc oscillation and weld pool inoculation were implemented to <b>refine</b> the fusion <b>zone</b> microstructure in iron aluminide alloy FA- 129 weldments. Magnetic arc oscillation effectively <b>refined</b> the fusion <b>zone</b> microstructure, and slow strain rate tensile tests showed fine-grained microstructures to be less susceptible to hydrogen cracking. However, magnetic arc oscillation {{was found to be}} suitable only for well-controlled fabrication environments. Weld pool inoculation offers a potentially more robust refinement method. Titanium inoculation was also shown to effectively <b>refined</b> the fusion <b>zone</b> microstructure, but weldment properties were not improved using this refinement method. The effect of titanium on the size, shape and distribution of the second phase particles in the fusion zone appears to be the cause of the observed decrease in weldment properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{successful}} {{control strategy}} for a thermomechanical pulp (TMP) production line {{must deal with}} continuous operation as well as uniform high-quality product aspects. The ability to formulate a control strategy of this kind can be considerably enhanced by the availability of relevant process models. In this work, modeling has been performed in two different time frames and a new refiner monitoring system, including sensor arrays for temperature measurements in the <b>refining</b> <b>zones,</b> has been used, in combination with traditional process variables for model validation. A dynamic first-principle model, describing the work {{carried out in the}} refiner, has been derived. The model derives both thermodynamic work and defibration work, i. e. both reversible and irreversible phenomena, and pin-points the entropy change in the system. The model shows that the total energy input is distributed over the refining plates, forming a characteristic profile along the radius with the highest energy input in the defibration zone. Although the total work profile was fairly uniform, significant changes in the division between defibration work and thermodynamic work may occur. Consequently, a constant motor load does not necessarily indicate constant pulp defibration. Moreover, the capability of the models to deliver residence time and consistency estimates was also demonstrated. An overall model structure for the TMP production line, including all the internal interconnections, has been derived as well. Simulation results show that the model structure reflects the characteristics of the interconnected process and that the nature of the disturbance pattern arises from {{the fact that so many}} internal interconnections are present. Moreover, it is shown that the temperature profiles in the <b>refining</b> <b>zones</b> provide a range of process outputs with individual responses to input changes depending on the spatial location. The internal interconnections of the TMP production line influence the production performance, as well as the system controllability, which demonstrates the importance of considering control aspects at the process design stage...|$|R
40|$|Worner {{established}} in the 60 s that highly refined steel could be produced continuously from iron in an integrated smelting and refining furnace. Whilst this work demonstrated the potential of continuous steelmaking, the technology was never built beyond pilot scale. Of particular concern was tbe perceived low productivity {{of the process and}} the related concern, that increasing productivity through such a furnace would result in decreasing the refining capability of the process. This balance between productivity and refining {{has been the subject of}} recent studies at the University of Wollongong, using cold modelling techniques to evaluate the effect of mixing on dispersion in a refining launder. These studies have shown that there should be no impediment to achieving high intensity with a high degree of refining. Recent research has been directed at examining the possibility of marrying a high intensity melting zone with a less stirred <b>refining</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper that {{knowledge}} of the spatially measured temperatures inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> in TMP refiners is essential in describing non-linear dynamics of high consistency refining. By expanding the pulp and handsheet properties using piece-wise linear functions into the time domain, an auto-regressive model {{can be applied to}} verify that the tempera-ture and the consistency profiles, in combination with the motor load and production rate, are key input candidates when modeling changes in different pulp properties. The model accuracy is analyzed using process information captured at different time and operating conditions. It is also shown that it is more complex to estimate and validate the tensile index than the mean fiber length and Somerville shives content, especially close to refiner operating limits where a shift in the process gain may occur. This type of switched dynamics in tensile index estimation at a specific consistency is related to non-linear behaviors where the fiber pad distribution most likely undergoes a local collapse...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the power needs and impedance-matching techniques involved when heating small charges of relatively high-resistivity semiconductor materials. Topics of discussion also include a brief section on the theoretical basis for zone refining, relative merits of resistance and induction heating, travel mechanism requirements, and work coil design. Considerable emphasis is placed on the efficiency of coupling between the induction heater and the load. Different methods of coupling the power into loads of silicon and germanium are indicated. The discussion on coupling centers around two work coil designs, a single-turn coil and impedance-matching transformer, and a five-turn coil, which is connected in series with the tank-circuit coil. An induction heater capable of delivering 4 kw output power was found sufficient for melting a zone 2 cm long in a 1. 5 cm diameter ingot. The system developed is capable of zone <b>refining,</b> <b>zone</b> leveling, or crystal growing with either silicon or germanium...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} TMP has been {{investigated}} for a CD 82 chip refiner both with respect to normal variations {{and as a result}} of step changes of production rate, dilution water feed rates and plate gaps. A given level of tensile index was reached over a wide range in specific energy input. The energy efficiency with respect to tensile index decreased if the pulp consistency in the blow line exceeded 55 %. The extended entropy model applied on the refiner showed that the calculated pulp consistency after the flat zone could be extremely high, leading to lower energy efficiency. This was not possible to detect by the measured values for the pulp consistency in the blow line. The short time variations in tensile index correlated more strongly with the model based total residence time in the two <b>refining</b> <b>zones</b> than with the motor load...|$|R
