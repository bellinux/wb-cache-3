Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like Velociraptor did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low <b>resting</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate,</b> making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the <b>resting</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E

25|$|Assessment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> is {{complicated}} by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> at <b>rest</b> and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly.

40|$|For many species, {{distribution}} and abundance {{is driven by}} a trade-off between abiotic and biotic stress tolerance (i. e. physical stress versus competition or predation stress). This trade- off {{may be caused by}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> differences in species such that slow <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> increase abiotic tolerance but decrease biotic tolerance. I investigated how <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> differences were responsible for an abiotic-biotic tolerance trade-off in brown mudfish (Neochanna apoda) and banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus), that drives the allopatric distribution of these fish in podocarp swamp-forest pools. Brown mudfish and banded kokopu distribution across 65 forest pools in Saltwater forest, Westland National Park, New Zealand was almost completely allopatric. Mudfish were restricted to pools with extreme abiotic stress including hypoxia, acidity and droughts because of kokopu predation in benign pools. This meant the mudfish realised niche was {{only a small fraction of}} their large fundamental niche, which was the largest out of sixteen freshwater fish species surveyed in South Island West Coast habitats. Thus mudfish had a large fundamental to realised niche ratio because of strong physiological stress tolerance but poor biotic stress tolerance compared to other fish. A low metabolic capacity in mudfish compared to kokopu in terms of <b>resting</b> and maximum <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and aerobic scope explained the strong mudfish tolerance to extreme abiotic stress, but also their sensitivity to biotic stress by more powerful kokopu in benign pools, and hence their allopatric distribution with kokopu. Despite being restricted to extreme physical stress, mudfish populations were, in fact, more dense than those of kokopu, because of low individual mudfish <b>resting</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> which would cause resources to be divided over more individuals. Distribution and abundance in mudfish and kokopu were therefore driven by an abiotic-biotic tolerance trade-off caused by a physiological trade-off between having slow or fast <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively. The negative relationship between species <b>resting</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and their tolerance to abiotic stress provides a way of estimating the impact of human induced environmental change that can either increase or decrease habitat harshness. Thus species with low <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> like mudfish, will be negatively affected by human induced environmental change that removes abiotic habitat stress and replaces it with benign conditions. My evidence shows that extreme stressors provide a protective habitat supporting high mudfish biomass with significant conservation value that should be maintained for the long-term persistence of mudfish populations...|$|R
