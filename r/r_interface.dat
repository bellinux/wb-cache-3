50|$|Backfit GAMs were {{originally}} {{provided by the}} `gam' function in S , now ported to the R language as the `gam' package. SAS proc GAM also provides backfit GAMs. The R recommended package for GAMs is `mgcv' (mixed gam computational vehicle) {{which is based on}} the reduced rank approach with automatic smoothing parameter selection. SAS proc GAMPL is an alternative implementation. There are many alternative packages. Examples include R package `mboost' implements a boosting approach, `gss' provides the full spline smoothing methods, `VGAM' provides vector GAMs, while package `gamlss' provides Generalized additive model for location, scale and shape. `BayesX' and its <b>R</b> <b>interface</b> provides GAMs and extensions via MCMC and penalized likelihood methods. The `INLA' software implements a fully Bayesian approach based on Markov random field representations exploiting sparse matrix methods.|$|E

30|$|The MRs are {{wireless}} access point (APs) with routing and cognitive capabilities equipped with three standard Wi-Fi radio <b>interfaces</b> (i.e., <b>R</b> 1, R 2, and R 3). Each radio interface is tuned {{to one of the}} Wi-Fi channels in the ISM band. The R 1 and <b>R</b> 2 <b>interfaces</b> are used to receive or transmit data packets produced by applications, while the <b>R</b> 3 <b>interface</b> is tuned to a common control channel (CCH) for exchanging control messages required for network management, routing, and channel (re-)configuration. More specifically, the <b>R</b> 1 <b>interface</b> is used to receive ingoing traffic from other mesh nodes and is tuned to a semi-dynamic channel that is decided based on the PN activity and on the mesh internal network traffic load. The <b>R</b> 2 <b>interface</b> is used to transmit ongoing traffic toward other mesh nodes and thus, dynamically switches among the available channels with a predefined switching interval (e.g., 40 ms), which can adapt based on the traffic load for forwarding. The wireless communication among MRs is implemented as follows. When a MR, e.g., MR A of Fig. 1, needs to forward data to another MR, e.g., MR B of Fig. 1, then A must tune its <b>R</b> 2 <b>interface</b> to the channel used by the <b>R</b> 1 <b>interface</b> of node B (that is channel 6 considering the example of Fig. 1). Through the utilization of two radios for sending and receiving, Urban-X can preserve the network connectivity, while expanding the network capacity by allocating interfering MRs on different channels.|$|R

40|$|Summary: Although the R {{platform}} and the add-on packages of the Bioconductor project {{are widely used}} in bioinformatics, the standard task of multiple sequence alignment has been neg-lected so far. The msa package, for the first time, provides a unified <b>R</b> <b>interface</b> to the popular mul-tiple sequence alignment algorithms ClustalW, ClustalOmega and MUSCLE. The package requires no additional software and runs on all major platforms. Moreover, the msa package provides an <b>R</b> <b>interface</b> to the powerful package shade which allows for flexible and customizable plotting of multiple sequence alignments.

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>r</b> <b>interface</b> {{model on}} a hard wall. The hydrodynamic large scale space-time limit for this model is discussed with periodic boundary by Funaki et al. (2000). This paper studies uctuations of the height variables around the hydrodynamic limit in equilibrium in one dimension imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. The uctuation is nonGaussian when the macroscopic interface {{is attached to the}} wall, while it is asymptotically Gaussian when the macroscopic interface stays away from the wall. Our basic method is the penalization. Namely, we substitute in the dynamics the reection at the wall by strong drift for the interface when it goes down beyond the wall and show the uctuation result for such massive <b>r</b> <b>interface</b> model. Then, this is applied to prove the uctuation for the <b>r</b> <b>interface</b> model on the wall. 1. Introduction and main result. This paper concerns uctuations of an interface on a wall.
