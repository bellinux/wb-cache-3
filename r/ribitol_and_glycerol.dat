Two major structures, 1, 5 -poly(ribitol phosphate) and 1, 3 -poly(glycerol phosphate), with the latter partially substituted by 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-α-galactopyranose (13 %) and 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-α-glucopyranose (6 %) on position O- 2, were found. A minor component was established to be a polymer of → 3 -O-(2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-β-glucopyranosyl) - 1 → 4 -ribitol- 1 -OPO 3 →. The ratios of the three components were 56, 34, and 10 mol%, respectively. The Sh 18 CWP was covalently bound to carrier proteins, and the immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates was evaluated in mice. Two methods of conjugation were compared: (i) binding of 1 -cyano- 4 -dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate-activated hydroxyl groups of the CWP to adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) -derivatized protein, and (ii) binding of the carbodiimide-activated terminal phosphate group of the CWP to ADH-derivatized protein.

The addition of ribitol to basal (malt-yeast extract) medium enhanced the relative growth rates of all three LFF. R. farinacea (CH 050010), R. far-inacea (40403) and R. fastigiata (H 06127) showed 35. 3 %, 29. 0 % and 29. 3 % higher growth rates, respectively, compared to the control. IBA (indole- 3 -butyric acid) and TIBA (2, 3, 5 -tridobenzoic acid) also increased growth rates of the LFF by 34 to 64 % and 7 to 28 %, respectively, compared to the control. The combination of ribitol with IBA or TIBA synergistically increased the growth of all LFF. For example, <b>ribitol</b> <b>and</b> IBA treatments increased growth rates of R. farinacea (CH 050010), R. farinacea (40403) and R. fastigiata (H 06127) by 79. 4 %, 40. 3 % and 72. 8 % in, respectively, compared to those grown on the basal medium. The stimulating effect of <b>ribitol</b> <b>and</b> IBA on the LFF growth induced vertical development of the fungal mass in culture.

40|$|A mutant {{strain of}} Klebsiella aerogenes was {{constructed}} and, when incubated anaerobically with L-fucose <b>and</b> <b>glycerol,</b> synthesized <b>and</b> excreted a novel methyl pentitol, 6 -deoxy L-talitol.

Such mutants were found to be constitutive for the synthesis of <b>ribitol</b> dehydrogenase <b>and</b> were thus capable of oxidizing 6 -deoxy L-talitol to L-fuculose.

Based on utilization of I-erythritol, D-glucitol, i-myo-inositol, D-mannitol, <b>and</b> <b>ribitol</b> <b>and</b> susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, the 58 isolates were separable into four groups.

NarI- and HaeIII-derived RFLP patterns clearly differentiated each of the four biochemically defined taxa. These four groups were also distinguishable by using the chromogenic substrates in Dade MicroScan test panels. By high-performance liquid chromatography, these isolates exhibited the same unique mycolic acid-ester elution patterns that differed from those of all other clinically significant nocardiae. Gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of fatty acids also produced similar patterns for all isolates that distinguished them from all other Nocardia taxa, but did not differentiate the four taxa within the complex.
