5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils when the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E

25|$|Four {{days after}} the battle, the Free Syrian Army backtracked on their initial death toll of 200, saying it had been overblown because many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wounded were counted as dead, and reduced <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> those {{confirmed}} killed to 68-103 names.

5|$|Soft tissue was {{apparently}} preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was {{a layer of}} smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in the abdominal region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged soft tissue are no longer available, {{it is impossible to}} verify these interpretations.|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} pairs of cranial nerves emerge {{directly}} from the brainstem. The brainstem also contains nuclei of many cranial and peripheral nerves, as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing, control of eye movements and balance. The reticular formation, a network of nuclei of ill-defined formation, is present within and {{along the length of}} the brainstem. Many nerve tracts, which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> pass through the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
50|$|Oxygen supplementation {{is common}} in <b>the</b> {{treatment}} <b>of</b> hypoxemia, an abnormally low level <b>of</b> oxygen in <b>the</b> blood. Hypoxemia can further cause tissue hypoxia as blood is not supplying sufficient oxygen to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> tissues and organs, resulting in {{the need for further}} supplementation of oxygen. It is estimated that the annual need for supplemental oxygen is around 800,000 individuals with a cost of 1.8 billion dollars.|$|R

5|$|Additional {{excavations}} since 1998 {{have revealed}} additional skeletal elements belonging to Eolambia. It {{is now the}} most completely-known iguanodont from between the Cenomanian and Santonian stages. Nearly every single skeletal element belonging to the taxon is represented by multiple fossils across existing collections. At least twelve individuals, including at least eight juveniles, were discovered in a quarry south {{of the town of}} Emery, including parts from both the skull and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> The quarry is known as the Cifelli #2 Eolambia caroljonesa Quarry, or more formally CEUM locality 42em432v. Another quarry south of the town of Emery – the Willow Springs 8 quarry, or CEUM locality 42Em576v – preserves at least four juveniles. Material from these quarries was described in 2012 by Kirkland along with Andrew McDonald, John Bird, and Peter Dodson, who also provided an updated diagnosis for Eolambia based on this material.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and of the individual.|$|E
50|$|Glomerular {{capillaries}} have {{a continuous}} glycocalyx layer {{in health and}} the total transendothelial filtration rate of solvent (Jv) to the renal tubules is normally around 125 ml/ min (about 180 litres/ day). Glomerular capillary Jv is more familiarly known as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> capillaries, Jv is typically 5 ml/ min (around 8 litres/ day), and the fluid is returned to the circulation via afferent and efferent lymphatics.|$|R

5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|Some other {{anatomical}} distinction {{exists between}} the larvae of the Nematocera and the Brachycera. Especially in the Brachycera, little demarcation is seen between the thorax and abdomen, though the demarcation may be visible in many Nematocera, such as mosquitoes; in the Brachycera, {{the head of the}} larva is not clearly distinguishable from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and few, if any, sclerites are present. Informally, such brachyceran larvae are called maggots, but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general. The eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion, decaying detritus, or host tissues surrounding endoparasites. Nematoceran larvae generally have well-developed eyes and antennae, while those of Brachyceran larvae are reduced or modified.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus {{of different ages}} found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. On the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E
