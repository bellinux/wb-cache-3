50|$|Already in May 1938, after cracks {{had been}} {{discovered}} in the conventional armour of the M36 vehicles, the ministry of defence had asked DAF whether their type, using untried welding techniques, could also be prone to cracking; {{in the summer of}} 1938 the commander of the 1e Eskadron Pantserwagens while testing the demonstrator vehicle had also expressed his concerns on this matter. Despite the warnings by Addink, Van Doorne pretended that he was unconcerned. Nevertheless the May 1939 contract had contained a warranty clause, instructing DAF to weld all connections tension-free and making DAF liable for all defects of this nature. Late March 1940 during cleaning it was discovered that on three of the six vehicles the welds of the machine gun mounts were cracking. One vehicle was sent to DAF that rewelded the crack and reinforced the glacis by riveting a steel plate behind it. Soon however, it transpired that next to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plate</b> a new crack had appeared. In April the number of cars showing cracks had risen to five and on some of these the welds between the glacis and bottom plates were starting to crack also. According to DAF the defects had been caused by attaching the mounts after the vehicles had been largely finished. The Comissie Pantserautomobielen concluded that, as war was imminent, DAF should be allowed to quickly repair the cracks by rewelding and fitting reinforcement plates but that ultimately the armour plates had to be completely replaced.|$|E

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of civil concrete infrastructures {{has increased dramatically}} in recent years. The majority of recent {{studies have focused on}} the use of fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials to strengthen or reinforce decayed concrete structures by bonding the FRP plate externally onto the damage surface. These studies have concentrated on the shear and peel-off effects of the adhesive material rather than the failure mechanisms of the concrete itself. However, the stress intensity factor, K sub I, at the crack-tip of the strengthened cracked concrete structures, cannot be overlooked. Numerical and experimental investigations have prove that K sub I of the strengthened structure is highly influenced by the modulus and geometry of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>plate.</b> Therefore, the failure of the strengthened specimen may be due to a high K sub I value in the concrete material. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to estimate the value of K sub I with different <b>reinforced</b> <b>plate</b> properties for a strengthened concrete beam using a simple superposition method. The results from the proposed method compare well with the numerical solutions obtained from the finite-element method. Both results show that the steosintensity value, of the beam decreases as the modulus and thickness of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>plate</b> increase, while the closing force of the beam, induced by the <b>reinforced</b> <b>plate,</b> increases...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{version of}} the {{boundary}} element method (BEM) is developed to model the stationary dynamic response of <b>reinforced</b> <b>plate</b> structures, such as reinforced panels in buildings, automobiles, and airplanes. The dynamic stationary fundamental solutions of thin plates and plane stress state are used to transform the governing partial differential equations into boundary integral equations (BIEs). Two sets of uncoupled BIEs are formulated, respectively, for the in-plane state (membrane) and for the out-of-plane state (bending). These uncoupled systems are joined to form a macro-element, in which membrane and bending effects are present. The association of these macro-elements is able to simulate thin-walled structures, including <b>reinforced</b> <b>plate</b> structures. In the present formulation, the BIE is discretized by continuous and/or discontinuous linear elements. Four displacement integral equations are written for every boundary node. Modal data, that is, natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of <b>reinforced</b> <b>plates,</b> are obtained from information contained in the frequency response functions (FRFs). A specific example is presented to illustrate the versatility of the proposed methodology.

40|$|Concrete beams can be {{retrofitted}} by bonding a {{steel or}} composite plate to its bottom. The failure of such members is usually {{due to the}} delamination of the plate from the beam. Delamination can occur either {{at the end of}} the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plate</b> or at the location of a crack in the concrete beam. This paper will focus on the analysis of delamination initiated at the mouth of a flexural crack. When loading is applied, a flexural crack tends to open at the bottom of the beam, inducing high shear stress which may result in delamination. The increment of interfacial shear stress with applied moment is affected by many material and geometric parameters. In this study, the bridging stress in the bonded plate and the maximum interfacial shear stress (tau sub max) are first related to the crack mouth opening. A fracture mechanics based analysis is then carried out to obtain the crack mouth opening and tau sub max for given applied moment. Through a systematic parametric analysis, the effect of various parameters on tau sub max, which reflects the likelihood of delamination, can be deduced. It is believed that the present analysis can provide insight into the prevention of delamination failure in retrofitted concrete beams...|$|E

40|$|Steel plate shear {{walls are}} lateral load {{resisting}} systems consisting of vertical steel plate infills {{connected to the}} surrounding beams and columns. One of the parameters affecting the behavior of steel plate shear wall system under lateral load is characteristic of surrounding members. Since {{there are lots of}} experimental and analytical studies on steel plate shear walls with I-shaped surrounding members, this research is an experimental study carried out on a one-third scale steel plate shear wall system with box-shaped columns along with further analytical studies.

40|$|The {{guidelines}} for the installation and management of roadway safety features, revised in November 2012, is regulating the standard performance test for roadside longitudinal barriers to be implemented on an embankment instead of a flatland. Furthermore, the post installed on an embankment should have the resisting force of a construction site higher than 90 % of that of a test site. In this study, a variety of post reinforcement methods were investigated in order to strengthen the lateral resisting force of the post installed on an embankment. When increasing the post embedded depth to 1. 7 m from a non-reinforced post with an embedded depth of 1. 4 m, an increase of 33 % in resisting force occurred. For the case of having a small cross section and a small flexure length of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plate</b> wrapping a post, out of various forms of reinforcing plates, the constructability was excellent and the resisting force increased by 70 % approximately.

40|$|Abstract. Aircraft {{engineers}} {{in the design}} phase often use practical solutions and results of the elementary theory of structures under the classical hypotheses assumed for shear, torsion and bending behaviour of structural elements that can be studied as "beams". This assumption, very powerful in general, under particular situations (for example: the modification of loading conditions {{in the development of}} new aircraft versions) can be inadequate to represent real distributions of stress and strain. This is particularly true when local behaviour of structures depends on secondary phenomena such as warping produced by non-uniform bending and torsion acting on structural elements with variable stiffness along their flexural axis. In this paper the results of analytical and experimental studies carried out for a metallic tail rotor blade of a helicopter are summarised; this research activity was born during a collaboration between the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Pisa and an aeronautical industry. Local strain distributions under real loading conditions have been obtained by means of finite element analyses and by means of strain gauge measurements. To describe warping mechanisms accurately, also caused by the presence of a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plate</b> of the blade structure, sub-modelling technique has been used and during a fatigue test, the blade was instrumented with an appropriate number of rosettes. Numerical and experimental results show, with a good agreement, that local geometry of the blade and the severe loading condition produce a considerable increase of strains that elementary theory can not predict; moreover, numerical results and above all strain measurements have proved that local yielding of the material can occur during the service life with detrimental effects on the fatigue endurance of the tail rotor blade...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of emerging fitness-for-service standards {{in conjunction with}} advanced modeling and ultrasonic thickness (UT) inspection is demonstrated with the recent assessment and repair of a CO 2 absorber vessel. UT inspection discovered four regions of localized metal loss on the internal surface of a CO 2 absorber vessel shell. Of the four regions, two were directly adjacent to major structural discontinuities, including two nozzles, one of which contained a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plate</b> or repad. In order to define the critical locations of metal loss and estimate a corrosion rate, thickness data for the regions of metal loss was provided {{in the form of}} 1 inch by 1 inch equally-spaced, rectangular thickness grid from two separate inspection dates. Based on the estimated corrosion rate, and the specified operation interval, the rate of metal loss was determined to be significant enough to require repair. This conclusion was {{based on the fact that}} in certain locations, the metal loss was estimated to grow through-wall before the end of the specified operation interval. Computational analysis using guidelines per API 579 - 1 /ASME FFS- 1 [1] was used to evaluate an appropriate repair procedure. This included evaluation of repair plate placement and sizing using advanced modeling techniques including elastic-plastic material behavior and contact interaction. The effect of future metal loss was included based the estimated corrosion rate. The result of this assessment was a repair design that provided sufficient protection against excessive plastic deformation and allowed for continued operation through the specified operating interval. Thus, repairing the vessel based on fitness-for-service (FFS) criteria allowed for continued use of the vessel and avoided costly replacement.

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{solution}} is {{developed for the}} problem of time-history response of reinforced underground cavity subjected to dynamic disturbances of the underground environment. The cavity can be of any shape, reinforced by either rock bolts or any elastic liner, with bending stiffness taken into consideration. Available methods that can solve the cavity problem are examined and an available computer programme (plane stress) modified. Introduction of a new <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plate</b> element necessitated development of two new subroutines and the extension of a third one along with certain modifications in the other subroutines and the main programme for matching requirements. The modifications enable the determination of displacements and the internal forces - time histories of the liner. [...] A quantitative study of the following parameters that affect {{the response of the}} cavity reinforcement and the surrounding medium is carried out: 1) cavity reinforcement, 2) cavity shape, 3) isolation of the entire structure from the surrounding medium by a soft, energy absorbing material and 4) properties of the filling material in the cut-and-cover structural type. The modified computer programme has applications to problems outside the field of two-dimensional rock-structure interaction such as the dynamic analysis of beams, plane frames and arches. [...] A finite element model is developed to simulate the dynamic analysis of infinite space. The results of the study indicate that reinforcing the cavity by a steel liner decreases the stresses in the medium by about 10 % while the use of a rock bolting pattern with about 80 % of the amount of steel required in a reinforcing liner decreases the stresses around the cavity by 25 % and more. The horseshoe shape proves to be the best among the various shapes considered decreasing the stresses by 10 - 15 %. Large reductions (of the order of 80 %) in shell (liner) membrane forces and bending moments are reached by isolating the entire structure from the surrounding medium by a soft, energy absorbing material, which agree with the results from another investigation. It is also pointed out that a proper selection of the properties of the filling material in the cut-and-cover structure can reduce the internal forces in the structure and the stresses in the adjacent medium. It is shown that a significant reduction cannot be achieved by a single property variation but only through a proper combination of different properties (Figs. 33 to 36). The results obtained from the new model indicate the need for further modelling work in the solution of earthquake interaction problems for underground cavities...|$|E

Apart from the most known reinforcement fibres, like glass or carbon, natural fibres can be seen as an economical alternative. However, some mistrust is yet limiting the use of such materials, being one of the main reasons the inconsistency normally found in their mechanical properties. It should be noticed that these materials are more used for their low density than for their high stiffness. In this work, two different types of <b>reinforced</b> <b>plates</b> were compared: glass <b>reinforced</b> epoxy <b>plate</b> and sisal <b>reinforced</b> epoxy <b>plate.</b> For material characterization purposes, tensile and flexural tests were carried out.
