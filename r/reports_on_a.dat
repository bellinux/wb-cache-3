5|$|On {{the morning}} of the fifth day, the Pokémon News Flash <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{breaking}} news story: a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Bros. was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite {{on their way to the}} show's broadcasting studio. After obtaining a lamp from a friendly Duskull in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc pops out. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called Meowth's Party.|$|E

Palahniuk also includes some non-fiction factoids within his fictional works {{and according to the}} author, these are included in order to further immerse the reader in his work.

500|$|Soon after, Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann at the RAE {{published}} {{a series of}} <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new wing planform, known in the UK as the [...] "slender delta" [...] concept. The team, including Eric Maskell whose report [...] "Flow Separation in Three Dimensions" [...] contributed {{to an understanding of}} the physical nature of separated flow, worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortexes on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack. The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1919, while {{recovering}} from a serious pulmonary condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, William Percival Crozier, that he should watch some cricket at Old Trafford and, if he felt able, write <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> few matches. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to {{the first day of}} Lancashire's match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: [...] "I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair... and I fitted myself into the idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919". Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper's regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line [...] "Cricketer", a position he held for 20 years.|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
