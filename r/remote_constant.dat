40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we derive {{the crack}} opening {{displacement}} of a penny-shaped crack embedded in an infinite isotropic elastic medium {{and subjected to}} a <b>remote</b> <b>constant</b> stress gradient. The solution is derived {{by taking advantage of}} the solution of the equivalent ellipsoidal inclusion problem subjected to a linear polarization. The case of the penny-shaped crack is thereafter investigated by considering the case of a spheroidal cavity which has one principal axis infinitesimally small compared to both others. The derivation of the explicit solution for the inhomogeneity subjected to a remote stress gradient raises the problem of the inversion of a sixth order tensor. For the problem having a symmetry axis (including the case of penny shaped crack), this problem can be tackled by using a decomposition oin the canonical basis for transversely isotropic sixth order tensors...|$|E

The loads steps (compression, and next monotonically increasing shear loads) lead to the main contact problem with an unknown stick-slip boundary determined by the Amonton-Coulomb law. It is reduced to a Cauchy-type singular inte-gral equation for the tangential displacement jump in the unknown sliding region. Its size is derived from an additional condi-tion of finiteness of shear stresses {{at the edges of the}} slip zone. Considerations are carried out for some general shape of the recess. Analytical results with the characterization of the considered contact are given and illustrated for the certain form of the initial recess. 1...|$|E

40|$|For a {{crack in}} an {{anisotropic}} elastic body subjected to remote inclined load under a plane stress condition, the energy release rate {{at the onset of}} crack kinking is analyzed by numerical analysis. The analysis is based on the path-independent E-integral using the finite element method. The E-integral gives the energy release rate at the onset of crack kinking for hyperelastic bodies. The eight-noded and six-noded isoparametric finite elements are used and the integral paths lie along the sides of the finite element. The numerical integration of the E-integral formula can be evaluated directly by using the nodal forces and nodal displacements. After the path independency is examined in an isotropic elastic body subjected to the <b>remote</b> <b>constant</b> tension stress, it is shown that the results for inclined loads agree very well with the results by Wu (1978). For the anisotropic bodies, in the cases of different planes of symmetry, the energy release rate is computed first under the perpendicular loading to the carck surface and then under the inclined loading. For the former, the results agree well with the perturbation solutions by Gao and Chiu (1992). For the inclined load, the direction of the maximum energy release rate is more sensitive to the direction of loading than the direction of the plane of symmetry...|$|E
40|$|At high temperatures, {{polycrystalline}} materials often suffer {{creep fracture}} under prolonged loading conditions. Microstructural examinations reveal that nucleation, propagation and linkage of interfacial cracks normal {{to the principal}} stress directions {{are responsible for the}} premature failure. To simulate service conditions, a semi-infinite crack is considered to grow, in steady state, along a grain boundary via a coupled process of surface and grain-boundary diffusion within an elastic bi-crystal subjected to a <b>remote</b> <b>constant</b> applied stress. Governing equations based on equilibrium and Hooke’s law obeyed within the adjoining grains, and matter conservation and Fick’s diffusion laws prevailing at both crack surfaces and the interface are employed to derive the singular integro-differential equation for the normal stress distribution along the interface ahead of the moving crack tip. Using the Mellin transformation, the integral equation is first converted to a functional-difference equation (a Carleman boundary-value problem), and then solved analytically via an approach based on the theory of the Riemann–Hilbert problem on a curve. Asymptotic behaviours of the stress solutions at both ends (that is, near the crack tip {{as well as in the}} far field) are provided. Excellent agreement is reached when the full analytical solutions are compared with the existing numerical solutions. The stress solutions permit the far-field loading intensity to be connected with the boundary conditions containing the parameter of crack velocity at the crack tip, thereby making it possible to predict the crack-growth rate for a given applied stress. The stress solutions in analytical form have the merit, over the numerical form, that they will facilitate the future solution scheme when the analysis is extended to tackle crack growth in the transient creep stage wherein both stresses and near-tip crack shapes are changing continuously with time...|$|E

We {{report the}} superior amide and peptide bond-hydrolyzing {{activity of the}} same heavy and light chain V domains expressed in the IgM constant domain scaffold compared with the IgG scaffold. The superior catalytic activity of recombinant IgM was evident using two substrates, a small model peptide that is hydrolyzed without involvement of high affinity epitope binding, and HIV gp 120, which is recognized specifically by noncovalent means prior to the hydrolytic reaction. The catalytic activity was inhibited by an electrophilic phosphonate diester, consistent with a nucleophilic catalytic mechanism. All 13 monoclonal IgMs tested displayed robust hydrolytic activities varying over a 91 -fold range, consistent with expression of the catalytic functions at distinct levels by different V domains.

40|$|Obesity {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious and {{dangerous}} nutritional diseases around the world. Usually, people develop patterns of unhealthy eating that lead to increased body weight and accumulation of fat in the body. This mass happens due to an imbalance between the energy intake from food and energy consumed in the body. One of the primary treatments for this serious health risk include diets, physical activity, weight-loss training and adoption of health programs that promote healthy eating. As such, reliable mechanism to prevent and control the obesity levels is vital. It led many experts and researchers who are interested in the health sector to explore more solutions that help to combat the obesity phenomenon. This paper presents a mobile health application intended to increase the awareness levels of parents and children about the obesity risks and help them to sustain balanced and healthy eating lifestyle.

On these features, we train a manually crafted algorithm {{as well as a}} machine-learned decision tree. By conducting several measurement runs and training in cross-validation rounds, we aim to create models that generalize well and do not overfit our training data. We find both models to exceed 99 % precision in train and test performance. We validate scalability by classifying 149 k siblings in a large-scale measurement of 371 k sibling candidates. We argue that this methodology, thoroughly cross-validated and likely to generalize well, can aid comparative studies of IPv 6 and IPv 4 behavior in the Internet.

40|$|The Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet volumes {{over the}} last 3 Ma were {{simulated}} using the LLN 2 -D model. The forcings were both insolation and CO 2 concentration. Different atmospheric CO 2 scenarios were used {{because of a lack}} of CO 2 reconstruction over this <b>remote</b> past. With <b>constant</b> CO 2 concentrations, the simulated ice volume does not show any gradual increase as recorded in the marine sediments. Moreover, its spectrum changes according to the chosen value of CO 2 : when CO 2 is fixed at 220 ppmv, the simulated ice volume is dominated by the similar to 100 ka period; if a pre-industrial CO 2 concentration of 280 ppmv is used, the simulation is dominated by the similar to 41 ka period. By using a linearly decreasing CO 2 concentration going from 320 ppmv at 3 Ma BP to 200 ppmv at present, the simulated changes in the power spectrum are in agreement with those obtained from the sedimentary records: roughly before 1 Ma BP the dominating period is similar to 41 ka, afterwards the similar to 100 ka period becomes dominant. This transition is accompanied by a gradual increase of the ice volume. Potential mechanisms for this transition are discussed. Using cyclic CO 2 fluctuations {{over the last}} 0. 6 Ma does not change significantly the spectral characteristics of the simulated ice volume, but amplifies the amplitude of its variations.

40|$|Abstract. A 2 -dimensional, elastic-plastic {{finite element}} model has been {{developed}} to simulate plasticity induced crack closure in slanted and deflected cracks growing outside the small scale yielding (SSY) regime. The {{finite element model}} allows for contact between deformable surfaces to capture the complex contact interaction between the crack faces. Coulomb’s friction law {{has been used to}} model friction between the crack faces and has been incorporated in the finite element model. This paper examines the mode I and mode II behavior of slanted cracks subjected to <b>remote</b> mode I, <b>constant</b> amplitude cyclic loading. Two possible types of mode II crack face interaction have been identified: (a) complete slip in mode II before mode I opening and, (b) mode I crack opening before the crack faces undergo mode II displacements. Both types of interactions were observed in slanted cracks. The finite element study also reveals a clear dependence of mode I and mode II crack opening levels for a slanted crack on R ratio and maximum stress, Smax/σ 0. The crack opening levels for a slanted crack are found to be significantly higher than the stable opening values for a straight crack growing in pure mode I. The mode I and mode II crack opening levels are also found to depend on the friction between the crack faces. A four-fold increase in friction coefficient resulted in almost 50 % increase in normalized mode I and mode II opening values. This paper also describes the effect of crack deflection on closure. Deflection of a fatigue crack from 45 ◦ inclination to pure mode I caused a decrease in mode I opening level, but, an increase in mode II opening level. This differenc...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 's <b>remote</b> sensing enable <b>constant</b> {{monitoring}} of land cover and land use, which are considered {{as the most}} crucial environmental data. Obtaining this information at global, regional and local scales, became the goal of many research and application programs and has allowed for the {{deeper understanding of the}} entire Earth system. In December 1999 NASA launched the EOS Terra Satellite, followed in 2002 by Aqua, both equipped with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Thanks to its technical specification and free distribution of the majority of its products, MODIS is considered {{to be the most important}} sensor for the global vegetation mapping. Although has been originally designed for large-scale analysis, MODIS is also used in many regional research programs. This paper presents results of two approaches of multi-temporal land cover classification of MODIS data. For the study polygon of 22100 square kilometres, situated in the western Poland, four single day surface reflectance data sets, of spatial resolution of 250 m and 500 m, were collected for the year 2007 - one for spring and autumn, and two for summer. In the first approach supervised land cover classification was conducted for each set of single day data separately. On the basis of obtained results, final classification was elaborated as an effect of analyse of the sequence of changes for each pixel. In second approach, independent classification was conducted for the aggregation of all possessed data. The accuracy of all classifications' results was checked against Corine Land Cover 2000 database using 4200 randomly distributed points. Obtained statistics show that comparing with single-day classifications as well as with classification of aggregated data, multi temporal approach based on the analysis of sequence, enabled crucial improvement of accuracy of the classification.

40|$|The first spaceflight {{was several}} decades ago, and yet {{extraterrestrial}} exploration is {{only at the}} beginning and has mainly been carried out by robotic probes and rovers sent to extraterrestrial planets and deep space. In the future human extraterrestrial exploration will take place and to get ready for long periods of permanence in space, astronauts are trained during long duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS). To prepare for such endeavours, team training activities are performed in extreme environments on Earth, as isolated deserts, base camps on Antarctica, or stations built {{on the bottom of the}} sea, trying to simulate the conditions and operations of space. Space agencies are also particularly interested in the search of signs of life forms in past or present extreme natural environments, such as salt lakes in remote deserts, very deep ocean habitats, submarine volcanic areas, sulphuric acid caves, and lava tubes. One natural environment that very realistically mimics an extraterrestrial exploration habitat is the cave. Caves are dark, <b>remote</b> places, with <b>constant</b> temperature, many logistic problems and stressors (isolation, communication and supply difficulties, physical barriers), and their exploration requires discipline, teamwork, technical skills and a great deal of behavioural adaptation. For this reason, since 2008 the European Space Agency has carried out training activities in the subterranean environment and the CAVES project is one of those training courses, probably the most realistic one. CAVES stands for Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills, and is meant as a multidisciplinary multicultural team exploration mission in a cave. It has been developed by ESA in the past few years (2008 - 2011) and is open for training of astronauts of the ISS Partner Space Agencies (USA, Russia, Japan, Canada, and Europe). Astronauts are first trained for 5 days to explore, document and survey a karst system, then take on a cave exploration mission for 6 days underground. A team of expert cave instructors, a Human Behaviour and Performance facilitator, scientists and video reporters, ensure that all tasks are performed in complete safety and guides all these astronauts 2 ̆ 7 activities. During the underground mission the astronauts 2 ̆ 7 technical competences are challenged (exploring, surveying, taking pictures), their human behaviour and decision-making skills are debriefed, and they are required to carry out an operational programme which entails performing scientific tasks and testing equipment, similarly to what they are required to do on the ISS. The science program includes environmental and air circulation monitoring, mineralogy, microbiology, chemical composition of waters, and search for life forms adapted to the cavern environment.

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{structures}} {{is a growing}} concern within the oil and gas industry. One of the most severe cases of corrosion is that of the internal surface of steel transmission pipelines. Such structures are constantly in contact with crude oil, unrefined natural gas and production fluids such as produced waters and brines. Certain corrosive compounds can be naturally found in such matrices such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and organic acids. The most cost effective means of preventing internal pipeline corrosion is the use of chemical corrosion inhibitors (CIs). These will form an impermeable barrier between the pipeline surface and the flowing matrix by adhering to the already corroded pipeline. In most instances, transmission pipelines are located in <b>remote</b> areas where <b>constant</b> monitoring of the rate of corrosion is impossible. This has led to the need of developing an offline detection method for the exact quantification of un-adsorbed CIs in all oilfield production fluids at sub ppm concentrations. To achieve this, a model CI formulation comprising of four quaternary ammonium species, four imidazoline based species, one aminopropionic acid and two pyridine based corrosion inhibitors was prepared in methanol and used for qualitative and quantitative analysis using high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS(/MS)) and ultra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPSFC-MS(/MS)). Use of UHPLC and UHPSFC as the methods of chromatographic separation, coupled with positive ion electrospray ionisation (+ve ion ESI) tandem mass spectrometry have afforded sub parts per million (ppm, < 0. 5 ppm) detection limits for all corrosion inhibitors in neat solvent. The UHPSFC and UHPLC methods have decreased the analysis times by a factor of 4 when compared to HPLC. Furthermore, using UHPSFC has eliminated the need of a complex sample preparation step prior to analysis, {{especially in the case of}} crude oil. CIs in produced water can also be quantified by UHPLC-MS in the sub ppm levels, since it was shown that the high salt concentrations found in produced waters would not affect the chromatographic behaviour of the CIs. The combination of the two modern chromatographic methods will allow the rapid determination of residual corrosion inhibitors in the oil flow, so dosing can be adjusted; but also give a real-time calculation of the discharged corrosion inhibitors in produced waters. It was also shown that, by altering the position of the UHPLC autosampler injector, it was possible to analyse both the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases when found in the same chromatographic vial. Using this approach, an initial effort was made to determine the partition behaviour of the CIs of interest when added to a 1 : 1 mixture of surrogate oil and simulated brines. It was found that the size of the hydrophobic ‘tail’ will determine the partition behaviour of each CI. A form of synergism with respect to the partition behaviour of CIs having the same ‘tail’ was also observed. Furthermore, a novel atmospheric pressure ion source called UniSpray was compared to the standard Waters ESI ion source on the UHPLC and UHPSFC instruments. Positive ion ESI and UniSpray mass spectra were recorded for all experiments irrespective of the nature of the sample matrix. The sensitivity of a novel ion source was compared to that of a standard Waters ESI ion source. Using the UniSpray ion source introduces approximately a 6 -fold increase in sensitivity compared to ESI if UHPLC is used. A 60 -fold increase in sensitivity can be achieved when the UniSpray ion source is coupled with UHPSFC. </p...|$|R
