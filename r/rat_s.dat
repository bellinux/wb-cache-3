In order to express <b>rat</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 4 functionally and identify its biological activity following purification, an S 100 A 4 gene fragment was opti-mized and fully synthesized via overlapping polymerase chain reaction. The gene was inserted into the prokaryotic expres-sion vector, pBV 220, with phage λ PRPL promoters following confirmation by DNA sequencing. The pBV 220 -S 100 A 4 plasmid was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli DH 5 α. Following temperature induction, <b>rat</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 4 was overexpressed and the protein was observed to {{be located in the}} supernatant of the lysates, which was ~ 30 - 40 % of the total protein within the host.

In fact, insulin resistance is an inherited genetic trait that precedes and eventually co-exists with salt-sensitive hypertension in Dahl S, but not salt-resistant (R) Dahl rats. Owing to the critical role of salt in accelerating and exacerbating hypertension in Dahl <b>S</b> <b>rats,</b> researchers have investigated the role of salt in enhancing and/or sustaining insulin resistance in Dahl <b>S</b> <b>rats.</b> Confl icting data in the literature are available regarding the role of salt in insulin resistance in Dahl <b>S</b> <b>rats.</b> Therefore, this commentary is meant to address in depth some of the possible and relevant interpretations to some of the major fi ndings published in the fi eld of dietary salt contribution to insulin resistance.

After in vitro transduction experiments to generate 9 L murine cells producing GM-CSF (9 LmGM-CSF cells), we found that {{with the exception of one}} <b>rat</b> subcutaneously (<b>s.</b> c.) grafted with 108 9 LmGM-CSF cells, syngenic <b>rats</b> <b>s.</b> c. injected (dorsal route) with 106 - 108 viable 9 LmGM-CSF cells did not develop s. c. 9 L gliosarcomas, while <b>rats</b> <b>s.</b> c. grafted with the same number of naive 9 L cells died between 25 and 45 days postgraft.

Since minermlocorticolds stimulate urinary kallikrein excretion, these results are inconsistent. This inconsistency was {{explained by the fact}} that, while R rats responded normally to treat-ment with deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by an Increase in urinary kallikrein excretion, <b>S</b> <b>rats</b> showed no change in urinary kallikrein even when treated with 10 mg of DOC/day for 24 days. <b>S</b> and R <b>rats</b> responded iden-tically to DOC with changes in muscle electrolytes and relative hypertrophy of the renal distal tubule. Other measures of chronic mlneralocorticoid response in <b>S</b> <b>rats</b> beside kallikrein were, therefore, intact. It was found that <b>S</b> <b>rats</b> were capable of responding to Na deficient diet with an increase in urinary kallikrein comparable to R rats. It was argued, therefore, that mineralcocorticoid receptor mechanisms and distal-tubular cell respon-siveness are intact in <b>S</b> <b>rats.</b> Mild glomerular and tubular scarring was found in <b>S</b> <b>rats</b> and the severity of renal lesions was increased by DOC treatment in <b>S</b> <b>rats.</b> These lesions correlated well with blood pressure and pro-telnuria.
