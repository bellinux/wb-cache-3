5|$|The {{dominant}} {{features of}} the valleys of the Cam and Wellow Brooks are remnants of coal mining from the 18th-20th centuries. In both valleys there are frequent shafts and batches together with {{the remains of the}} railway and tram lines that connected the mines to the Avon Valley. Remains of the Somersetshire Coal Canal are also significant <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> this coal mining history in this area.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane is {{attempting}} {{to pay homage to}} victims of slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves. Like Gorée and Saint-Louis, Carabane places great importance on its cultural heritage. The architectural <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist Louis-Vincent Thomas posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved, and this question continues to be relevant. The local people suggest that the entire Diogue–Nikine–Carabane area needs saving.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish West India Company {{established}} a colony on the Delaware River in 1638, naming it New Sweden. A small, short-lived colonial settlement, New Sweden contained {{at its height}} only some 600 Swedish and Finnish settlers (Finland being part of Sweden). It was lost to the Dutch in New Netherland in 1655. Nevertheless, {{the descendants of the}} original colonists maintained spoken Swedish until the late 18th century. Modern day <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the history of New Sweden are reflected {{in the presence of the}} American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Fort Christina State Park in Wilmington, Delaware, and The Printzhof in Essington, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. homes by the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural ice on a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, but by the end of the 20th century there were very few physical <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the trade.|$|E

5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Loop {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} highway {{running through}} Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique reassurance markers—the signs that serve as regular <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the name and number of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector496 for inventory purposes. The highway follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The First World War, {{which took}} place between 1914 and 1918, saw the {{extensive}} use of artillery, particularly on the Western Front. Technical advances, combined with the relatively static nature of trench warfare, made these guns {{a key element of}} the conflict: over half the casualties in the war were caused by artillery. Artillery guns and their crews were themselves targets, however, and 49,076 members of the Royal Artillery died during the conflict. In the years after the war, many former servicemen, including gunners, found the scale of the losses difficult to deal with, or felt that the events challenged their trust in the political leadership that had led them into the war. Visual <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the conflict were often avoided: mutilated servicemen, for example, were banned in the 1920s from joining in veterans' marches, and those with facial injuries often hid them in public.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the period}} {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the USSR, crews on Mir experienced occasional <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the economic chaos occurring in Russia. The initial cancellation of Spektr and Priroda was the first such sign, followed by the reduction in communications {{as a result of the}} fleet of tracking ships being withdrawn from service by Ukraine. The new Ukrainian government also vastly raised the price of the Kurs docking systems, manufactured in Kievthe Russians' attempts to reduce their dependence on Kurs would later lead to accidents during TORU tests in 1997. Various Progress spacecraft had parts of their cargoes missing, either because the consumable in question had been unavailable, or because the ground crews at Baikonur had, in desperation, looted them. The problems became particularly obvious during the launch of the EO-14 crew aboard Soyuz TM-17 in July; shortly before launch there was a black-out at the pad, and the entire power supply to the nearby city of Leninsk failed an hour after launch. Nevertheless, the spacecraft launched on time and arrived at the station two days later. All of Mirs ports were occupied, and so Soyuz TM-17 had to station-keep 200 metres away from the station for half an hour before docking whilst Progress M-18 vacated the core module's front port and departed.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1937, Danville {{resident}} Emma Weisiger {{donated the}} land that comprises Constitution Square Historic Site to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in memory of her brother, John. The state made the land into a state park; it was originally called Old Public Square, then Constitutional Square. Using a combination {{of state and local}} funds, the Danville Chamber of Commerce and the local chapter of the American Legion began constructing replicas of the jail, courthouse, and meetinghouse that originally occupied the square. At the time of the park's dedication on April 20, 1942, it was dubbed the John G. Weisiger Memorial State Park. Later, the name was changed to Constitution Square State Shrine. At the time of the dedication ceremony, all non-essential construction projects in the U.S. had been halted by the War Production Board due to the country's entry into World War II, and renovations to the park's attractions had consequently ceased. Dedication speeches by Governor Keen Johnson and Centre College president Robert L. McLeod, Jr. contained <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the ongoing war and praise for the ideals of democracy. In addition, a plaque honoring the framers of the first Kentucky Constitution was dedicated by Louisville judge Lafon Allen and unveiled by Johnson's daughter, Judith, and Louise McDowell, a descendent of Judge Samuel McDowell, who presided over all ten constitutional conventions {{that took place in the}} original Constitution Square courthouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E
