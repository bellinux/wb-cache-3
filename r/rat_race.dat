5000|$|Goal {{progress}} {{is a measure}} of advancement toward accomplishment of a goal. [...] Perceptions of progress often impact human motivation to pursue a goal. Hull (1932, 1934) developed the goal gradient hypothesis, which posits that motivation to accomplish a goal increases monotonically from the goal initiation state to the goal ending state. Hull developed the goal gradient hypothesis when observing <b>rats</b> <b>racing</b> to receive a food reward (Hull, 1932). Using sensors to assess the rat's motion, Hull observed that the rats level of effort increased as the proximal distance to the food reward decreased.

40|$|The upward geotropic {{orientation}} (angle θ) {{of adult}} <b>rats</b> (<b>race</b> A) has been measured {{as a function}} of slope of substratum.

The fraction of the total observable variation of performance (θ) which is controlled by the intensity of excitation (56 per cent) is identical with that found for young rats of the same strain, although the total variation is a little greater. Injection of adrenin distorts the θ vs. α graph in a manner quite concordant with the effect obtained in young rats. With the adults the absolute magnitudes of the variations of θ, at corresponding intensities of excitation, are not affected by the action of adrenin, and, as with the young, the proportion of modifiable variation of θ is not altered.

40|$|In {{his book}} What about me? The {{struggle}} for identity in a market-based society, clinical psychologist and psychotherapist Paul Verhaeghe tries to elucidate {{the link between}} neo-liberal society, identity, and mental health. Verhaeghe starts from the observation that our identity is shaped by the norms and rules of the society we live in; in short, “our self is…of external origin” (page 22). What kind of identity do people acquire in modern western society? According to Verhaeghe, a competitive, meritocratic society that is focused on maximizing material consumption confers the ideal of individual success and perfection on people, combined with an individual responsibility to achieve these goals. In his view, this combination is toxic for mental health. The <b>rat</b> <b>races</b> that we are exposed to from the earliest school days and throughout our work lives {{have only a few}} winners, but many losers. Moreover, individualized notions of responsibility for success and perfection put the burden of failure firmly on the individual. In the past, people might have been worse off in many ways, but expectations and interpretations of success in terms of individual effort lead to novel “disorders,” often directly defined in terms of failure to perform according to standards of success (e. g., ‘attention deficit’). Subsequently, as Verhaeghe argues, current ideology attempts to lift this burden by falsely interpreting many of these disorders in genetic or biological terms. In contrast, Verhaeghe claims that these disorders display abnormality only {{from the vantage point of}} neo-liberal norms of success and responsibility, which he describes as the new “Social Darwinism in economic guise” (page 119) ...|$|R

After 3 & 6 months 3 animals of each group were selected and hormonal parameters were determined by CLIA method, Hb and HCT was measured by common Med. Lab. Kits and blood cells counted by H 1 equipment. Finally, results were processed by one-side variance and tukey's test. Results: The results indicated that white blood cells counting show meaningful dose dependent decreasing in number of these cells. No tangible change was seen on counting of red blood cells and the level of hemoglobin and hematocrit parameters. Also blood cortisol & T 4 level of dependent dose decreased and Testosterone increased meaningfully. Water uptake index increasing happened in meaningful and dose dependent manner. Ketone bodies appeared in rats' urine that had eaten high doses of silver nano. Conclusion: WBC count decreasing after oral consumption of silver nano particles show cell apoptosis and immunity lowering. Also the particles have no effect on bone marrow function indexes. On the other hand, lowering the function of adrenal gland, hypothyroidism, increasing in sexual hormone level are side effects of these particles consumption. In addition, increasing in Water Uptake Index and urine volume can be for high blood pressure or kidney failure caused by these particles...|$|R

40|$|The {{intraperitoneal}} injection of standard young <b>rats</b> of <b>race</b> A with 2 / 5 cc. of adrenalin chloride 1 : 50, 000 results in increased speed of geotropically oriented creeping upon an inclined surface. It {{was expected that}} the effect of such increased frequency of stepping must be analogous to that due to imposition of added loads carried by the rats during geotropic progression. This is verified. The curve connecting θ with log sin α is distorted, under adrenalin, so as to be comparable to that obtained with an added mass of approximately 2. 5 gm. upon the young rat's saddle; the threshold slope of surface for orientation is accordingly lowered, from α = 20 ° to α = 12. 5 °; at the new threshold slope of surface the mean orientation angle θ is the same as in the absence of adrenalin at the corresponding threshold slope of surface. The total variation of performance is significantly increased in the injected rats, and at given slope of surface the variation is slightly increased. The proportionate modifiable variation of response is quite unaffected by the distortion of the θ – α curve, and is the same as in standard young A rats untreated or carrying additional loads. It is pointed out that for the consideration of the problem as to whether a given experimental treatment, or a given natural situation, affects in any way the variation of performance of a living system, it is necessary to obtain indices of variability which involve the expression of variation of performance as a function of measured conditions governing the performance...|$|R
