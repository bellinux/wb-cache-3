Thermophilic bacilli are the dominant contaminants of modern spray-dried milk powders and the 1907 milk powder allows a comparison {{to be made of}} contaminating strains in roller-dried and spray-dried powders. Samples of milk powder obtained from Shackelton's Hut at Cape Royds had low levels of thermophilic contamination (< 500 cfu ml− 1) but the two dominant strains (Bacillus licheniformis strain F and Bacillus subtilis) were typical of those found in spray-dried powders. Soil samples from the floor of the hut also contained these strains, whereas soils distant from the hut did not. Differences in the RAPD profiles of isolates from the milk powder and the soils suggest that contamination of the milk from the soil was unlikely. It is significant that the most commonly encountered contaminant strain in modern spray-dried milk (Anoxybacillus flavithermus strain C) was not detected in the 1907 sample...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{usefulness}} of weaning foods {{to meet the}} nutrient needs of children is well recognized, {{and most of them}} are precooked <b>roller</b> <b>dried</b> mixtures of cereal and/or legume flours which posses a high viscosity and bulk when reconstituted. The objective of this study was to formulate composite weaning foods using cereals, malted legumes and vegetable powders and analyze them for nutrients, functional properties and sensory attributes. Selected legumes (green gram and lentil) were germinated, dried and dehulled. Roasted wheat, rice, carrot powder and skim milk powder also were used. All the ingredients were mixed in different proportions to get four formulations, made into 30 % slurry and <b>dried</b> in <b>roller</b> <b>drier.</b> The products were analyzed for proximate principles, mineral content, functional and sensory qualities. The results of analysis showed following range of constituents per 100 g of formulations on dry weight basis, protein, 18. 1 - 18. 9 g; fat, 0. 78 - 1. 36 g; iron, 5. 09 - 6. 53 mg; calcium, 265 - 310 mg. The lowest water absorption capacity was in case of wheat green gram based and the highest was in rice lentil based sample.

These changes in crushing strength endorse the need to standardize the time between tablet ejection and strength measurement.

40|$|The {{consolidation}} and compaction {{properties of}} granule fractions prepared by dry granulation (slugging) of alpha-lactose monohydrate and <b>roller</b> <b>dried</b> beta-lactose, respectively, were studied. The {{results showed that}} the compactibility of the granule fractions was determined by the type of lactose used and the granule size. The tablets compacted from the granule fractions show a lower compressibility resulting into almost equal crushing strength but a higher specific BET-surface area as compared to the surface area of the slugs. Influence of granule size on tablet strength points to a relation between outside surface area of granules and tablet strength. Obviously, granule particles sustain their integrity to some extent during compaction. Air permeability and mercury porosimetry showed that in tablets with equal strength different pore systems can exist. Generally, tablets compacted from fine granule size fractions exhibited finer pore sizes and higher strengths compared to the tablets compacted from coarse size fractions. Furthermore, mercury porosimetry revealed that the whole pore system determines tablet strength. This means that granule particles deform during consolidation. The influence of the starting materials on tablet strength can not be explained by permeametry surface area measurements and mercury porosimetry. It is suggested that differences in the internal structure between the granules of the two lactose types are responsible...|$|R
40|$|A new lactose crystal {{was formed}} at Massey University in 1997 while {{studying}} {{the effects of}} superheated steam on the production of β-lactose. The crystal typically had 50 - 52 % β-lactose content and an X-ray diffraction pattern that did not match with either β-lactose or β-lactose monohydrate, {{and so it was}} thought to be an entirely new lactose crystal. Preliminary work was then done at Massey University to determine the conditions under which the crystal could be produced. The new crystal was produced in a batch process in a superheated steam environment between the temperatures of 125 °C to l 55 °C and at very fast drying rates. The present work attempts to develop a continuous process to produce this new lactose crystal. During the late stages of the project it was found that a similar crystal was already documented in the literature and its crystal structure defined. So the crystal found at Massey University could not be termed as a new crystal. The crystal found in the literature was formed by a high thermal treatment to solid-state β-lactose monohydrate and amorphous lactose and had a β/α anomeric ratio of 1 : 1. The present work attempts to develop a continuous process to produce the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal from a liquid state and in a superheated steam environment. A <b>roller</b> <b>drier</b> was thought to be the best option to produce the new crystal in a continuous process. Different arrangements were developed to create the required conditions under which it was expected that the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal would be produced. Lactose solution sprayed on the <b>roller</b> <b>drier</b> using spray nozzles at temperatures of 125 °C to 155 °C and flow rates in the range of 1 lOml/min to 40 ml/min with varying drum speeds consistently produced 85 % β-lactose. Lactose solution was smeared on the drum surface which also produced about 80 % β-lactose. Lactose solution that was sprayed over a tray which was designed to allow only small amount of the solution (about 3 ml/min) to pass through produced about 58 % β-lactose. X-ray diffraction showed that the crystal was a mixture of 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal and β-lactose crystal. This confirmed that, to produce the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal very low flow rates were required (1. 5 ml to 3 ml/min flow rate). It was observed that the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal was formed when the lactose solution formed a rubbery amorphous lactose solution and then quickly crystallized in the superheated steam environment. To confirm this hypothesis, spray dried amorphous lactose was crystallised over the <b>roller</b> <b>dried</b> inside the superheated steam environment at 125 °C, 135 °C and 145 °C. The resulting product was a mixture of the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal and β-lactose crystal. To produce an amorphous phase from the solution, the solution was injected in air for a few seconds before introducing it into the superheated steam environment. Lactose solution at 90 °C injected onto the roller with a temperature of 145 °C for 10 sec in air and 15 minutes in superheated steam produced a crystal having a structure different to that of a β-lactose crystal or α-lactose crystal and it had a similar X-ray diffraction pattern to that of the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal documented in the literature and the crystal formed at Massey in 1997. It was also shown that in the absence of superheated steam, β-lactose crystals were formed. It was clearly shown that a noticeable amount of the 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystals are formed in products having β-lactose contents below 60 %. The formation of 1 : 1 β/α mixed lactose crystal was found to be very problematic and thus the results were not repeatable. Further investigation should be carried out with better control of all the parameters. Moisture content (mc) was thought to be a contributing factor that needs to be investigated further...|$|R

40|$|Lactose granulations (125 - 250 mu m) were {{prepared}} {{from two different}} alpha-lactose monohydrate powders and one <b>roller</b> <b>dried</b> beta-lactose powder respectively, by wet granulation with only water as a binder. As an effect of the granulation process, the flow properties improved, but the compactibility decreased. Moreover, the lubricant sensitivity of the granule fractions was higher than found for the starting materials. The compactibility of the granule fractions {{was found to be}} dependent on the type of lactose, the surface area of the starting powder and the granule bulk density. For lubricated lactose granulations, the lubricant sensitivity, expressed as Lubricant Sensitivity Ratio (LSR), increased with an increase of bulk density. The beta-lactose content of roller-dried beta-lactose is hardly affected by the granulation process, which explains the good compactibility of the granule fractions prepared from this type of lactose. On the other hand, anhydrous alpha-lactose present in the roller-dried beta-lactose starting material is converted into alpha-lactose monohydrate during the granulation process, which improves tablet disintegration. The compaction properties of commercially available lactose granulations have been compared with those of the experimental granulations and with a free flowing sieved alpha-lactose monohydrate. As an effect of the higher powder surface area and the relatively low bulk density, Tablettose(R) has a better compactibility than alpha-lactose monohydrate 100 Mesh. The excellent compactibility of another commercially available lactose granulation, Pharmatose(R) DCL 15, was attributed to the presence of more beta-lactose, providing strong intergranular cohesion...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the bulk density and the compactibility of lactose granulations was studied. The granulations were prepared from different alpha-lactose monohydrate and <b>roller</b> <b>dried</b> beta-lactose powders by wet granulation, using different techniques with only water as a binder, or by slugging. The results demonstrate that {{by the process of}} granulation of one lactose powder, granules with different bulk densities and different compactibilities can be prepared. In addition to the type of lactose used, the compactibility of the granule fractions is dependent on the bulk density of the granule fraction. Generally, with an increase of the bulk density, the compactibility of a granule fraction decreases. Little variation is observed between the intergranular porosities of the granule fractions. More differences are found between the intragranular porosities of the granule fractions. However, the compactibility of granule fractions of one lactose type is mainly determined by the total porosity of the granule powder bed. Mercury porosimetry determinations on tablets compacted from the granule fractions show a {{relationship between}} the tablet pore system and the compact strength: compression of granulations with a low bulk density results into tablets with a small average pore diameter and a high crushing strength. Obviously, the possibility to deform a granule fraction during compression, the deformation potential, is determined by the total porosity of the powder bed. A high deformation potential, i. e., a high compactibility, can be obtained by using a granulation procedure in which granulations with a low bulk density are produced...|$|R

Granulation process transforms fine powders into free-flowing, dust-free granules that are easy to compress. Nevertheless, granulation poses numerous challenges due to high quality requirement of the formed granules in terms of content uniformity and physicochemical properties such as granule size, bulk density, porosity, hardness, moisture, compressibility, etc. together with physical and chemical stability of the drug. Granulation process can be divided into two types: wet granulation that utilize a liquid in the process and dry granulation that requires no liquid.

40|$|Background: In {{an effort}} to reduce the {{prevalence}} of protein-energy malnutrition among Ghanaian infants after the period of exclusive breastfeeding when complementary food (CF) is introduced, Weanimix, which is a blend of non-dehulled maize, groundnut and non-dehulled soyabean/cowpea, was introduced in Ghana, in 1987 through collaboration between the Nutrition Division, Ministry of Health, Ghana and the United Nations Children’s Fund. Weanimix is an improvement over traditional maize-, millet-, or sorghum-only porridge in protein and energy densities, but it is high in phytate. Phytate limits the bioavailability of nutrients such as iron and zinc, and probably calcium and some proteins. Also, unless fortified, Weanimix is low in β-carotene (vitamin A precursor) as the white maize is the commonly consumed variety in Ghana. Additionally, cereal-based CF (example, Weanimix) forms a very thick porridge that requires dilution with water to get the desirable viscosity, leading to “energy and nutrient thinning” (that is, the reduction of energy and nutrient densities). Thus, the widely used unfortified cereal-based CF could be a major contributing factor to the persistently high occurrence of vitamin A, iron and zinc deficiencies among infants in sub-Sahara Africa. Purpose: The main focus {{of this study was to}} develop a CF using locally accessible ingredients in Ghana that will be low in phytate, contain measurable levels of β-carotene and forms a low viscous porridge, which could be produced at home or industrially. Method: A computer-assisted programme (Nutrition Calculator) obtained from Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition- Infant and Young Child Nutrition Programme was used to formulate composite flours containing sweetpotato, soyabean and fish powder from anchovies or skim milk powder to meet the protein, fat and energy specifications in the Codex standards (CAC/GL 8 and STAN 074 - 1981, Rev. 1 - 2006) for CF. The household-level ComFa formulation with fish powder as an ingredient was toasted in an oven and denoted oven-toasted ComFa, while the industrial-level formulations (roller-dried ComFa and extrusion-cooked ComFa) had skim milk powder (a common ingredient in industrial-processed dry infant cereal) as a component and were produced using a <b>roller</b> <b>drier</b> or an extruder. The nutritional, functional and consumer acceptance analyses of sweetpotato-based CFs were carried out and compared with enriched Weanimix. In this research, Weanimix was slightly modified by using dehulled maize and soyabean flours, and further addition of 17 % fish powder and 0. 50 % sugar to the basic formulation, and referred to as enriched Weanimix. Additionally, the stability of β-carotene in the oven-toasted ComFa was evaluated under simulated average temperature of 32 °C and 85 % relative humidity, mimicking the ambient conditions of Ghana. Results: The ComFa formulations and the enriched Weanimix met the stipulated energy and fat values specified in the Codex standards. However, the protein content of the industrial ComFa formulations was lower by 17 %, but the oven-toasted ComFa and enriched Weanimix met the protein specification. The sweetpotato-based formulations had total dietary fibre that was about twice the Codex specification of less than 5. 0 %, but was likely to be partly soluble fibre and, thus beneficial. The phytate content in all the ComFa formulations was approximately a quarter of the level of 0. 80 g/ 100 g in the enriched Weanimix. Only the sweetpotato-based infant foods contained measurable levels of β-carotene, resulting in significantly higher vitamin A content of the oven-toasted ComFa compared with enriched Weanimix (28. 80 vs. 1. 20 μg retinol equivalents/ 100 kcal). Most of the β-carotene in the oven-toasted ComFa was retained for up to eight weeks when stored in containers with a good moisture barrier under simulated ambient conditions of Ghana. Oven-toasted ComFa, roller-dried ComFa and enriched Weanimix, using an estimated daily ration of 40 g (dry weight), contained less than half of the World Health Organization recommended levels for calcium (400 mg/day), iron (9. 3 mg/day) and zinc (4. 1 mg/day) from CFs processed for 6 to 8 month-old breastfeeding infants, with the exception of the oven-toasted ComFa, which contained 60 % of the recommended calcium level. The two selected ComFa formulations are likely to be less inhibitory regarding calcium, iron and zinc absorption by infants than the enriched Weanimix based on the phytate: calcium, iron and zinc molar ratios, and the level of β-carotene to predict relative availability of these essential minerals. All the CFs had phytate: calcium molar ratios lower than the maximum recommended ratio of 0. 17, but their phytate: iron molar ratios exceeded the maximum recommended ratio of 1. 0. However, the phytate: zinc molar ratio of the oven-toasted ComFa and roller-dried ComFa were approximately lower by 24 % than the recommended ratio of 15. In contrast, the phytate: zinc ratio of enriched Weanimix was higher by 53 % compared to the recommended ratio. Also, the ComFa formulations and enriched Weanimix, had levels of total polyphenols (84. 70 and 76. 96 mg/meal, respectively), which may inhibit iron absorption. On average, sweetpotato-based formulations were higher in maltose (26 times), sucrose (5 times), free glucose (19 times) and fructose (7 times) than levels in enriched Weanimix, but the ComFa formulations contained significantly less starch (10 - 13 vs. 47 g/ 100 g). The high simple sugar and low starch levels in the ComFa formulations could explain the lower apparent viscosity (9 -, 13 - and 20 -times, for peak, “consume” and final viscosities), higher water solubility index (7 times), and higher consumer acceptance compared with the maize-based formulation. Conclusion: On the basis of the compositional, functional and sensory findings of this study, the sweetpotato-based formulations have significant advantages as complementary food compared with Weanimix due to the low level of phytate, the high levels of endogenous β-carotene and low viscosity. Importantly, the ingredients used to produce the household-level ComFa formulation could be easily accessed by caregivers in Ghana. However, there is a need to conduct field trial and consumer acceptance studies in Ghana before substantive recommendations on the use of the sweetpotato-based infant formulation could be made. Limitation: The conclusions made are based on compositional, functional and consumer acceptance studies but not on any in vivo experiment or randomised feeding trial among Ghanaian infants. However, because the comparisons were made between the ComFa formulations and Weanimix, the conclusions drawn in this thesis are relevant...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of tablet is often overlooked. A simple compressed mass of active and inactive ingredients hides the complex relationship between achieving the desired drug potency, the tablet {{strength and the}} tablet dissolution. The resulting tablet properties, particularly the tablet strength, are driven by the wet granulation process, an up-stream particle size enlargement process. Studies {{on the influence of}} the wet granulation process on the tablet properties show that there is still confusion over the influence of the wet granulation on the final tablet strength {{due to the lack of}} investigation in the direct impact between wet granulation and tabletting, which paves the path for the objective of this thesis. The influence of the wet granulation process on the final tablet strength was investigated by conducting wet granulation case studies looking at the effects of the liquid level, wet massing time, impeller speed and binder flow rate on a standard formulation of 1 : 1 lactose and microcrystalline cellulose granulated with polyvinyl pyrrolidine polymer in various solutions. A model called the “Unified Compaction Curve” was adopted from the <b>dry</b> <b>roller</b> compaction process and applied to the wet granulation case studies to see the feasibility of the model and understand how the model bridges the relationship between the wet granulation operating conditions and the final tablet strength. To understand this, granules from selected granulation batches were analysed to determine the granule properties including the circularity factor, surface roughness and granule porosity. The effect of the wet massing process, presence of moisture, liquid binder acidity and the presence of hydrogen-bonding in the granule liquid bridges on the microcrystalline cellulose properties was also investigated. The Unified Compaction Curve model was also extended to investigate the effect of the granulator scale on the final tablet strength to explore the possibility of a new up-scale guideline. The results demonstrate that the wet granulation process can have a direct effect on the subsequent tablet strength. As the liquid level, wet massing time and impeller speed increases, the tablet strength decreases from a maximum tablet hardness of approximately 45 kp (from direct compaction) to lowest tablet hardness of 23. 5 kp after 10 minutes of wet massing time. Therefore there is a “loss of compactability” when the formulation is exposed to processing conditions in wet granulation and even in <b>dry</b> <b>roller</b> compaction (Kochhar et al., 1995; Bultmann, 2002; Freitag and Kleinebudde, 2003; Shi et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2011). The loss of compactability in the formulation by the processing compaction forces sets up the fundamental conditions for the Unified Compaction Curve model to be applied. The Unified Compaction Curve model was found to be a feasible model for the wet granulation process in which the model was able to translate the wet granulation compaction curves for various liquid levels, wet massing times, impeller speeds and binder flow rates and overlap them onto the master direction compaction curve, which allows the prediction of the resulting tablet strength. The Unified Compaction Curve is able to quantify the amount of compaction pressure exerted on the granules during wet granulation through the “effective wet granulation compaction pressure”, PWGC. When the PWGC is coupled with the cumulative number of impeller revolutions, the liquid level, wet massing time, impeller speed and binder flow-rate wet granulation data all coincide onto a first-order exponential curve. This makes the Unified Compaction Curve a potentially powerful tool in visually seeing the magnitude of deterioration in the tablet strength by the wet granulation process, which allows the prediction of the final tablet strength. The deterioration in the tablet strength with increasing wet granulation processing time is attributed to the decrease in the granule surface and rounding of the granule structure. This was evident by the increase in the circularity factor with increasing number of impeller revolutions and SEM images. The granulator impeller consolidates the granules, consequently destroying the granule surface roughness and decreases the granule porosity. If the granule porosity is seen as a function of the cumulative number of impeller revolutions, it can be seen that the relationship is the inverse relationship of the PWGC and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. This demonstrates that the granule porosity is one of the main driving factors for the deterioration of the tablet strength with increasing residence time in the granulator. The transition of the granule morphology and porosity during wet granulation can be attributed to the irreversible plastic deformation of microcrystalline cellulose particles, which wrap and encase the lactose particles during the consolidation and densification of the granules during the wet granulation process. This destroys the mechanical inter-locking ability of the granules during the tabletting process, hence leading to the “loss of compactability” and reduction in the final tablet strength. However, the Unified Compaction Curve model will only be valid for granulation formulations comprising at least 30 % liquid level and with at least 50 % microcrystalline cellulose in the formulation used in this study, to effectively translate the kinetic forces from the impeller into compaction forces for significant deformation to occur. This was evident in granulation case studies where a liquid level less than 30 % leads to the compaction data not conforming to the Unified Compaction Curve model. A recent study into the Unified Compaction Curve model found that a formulation comprising of 49 % of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel Ph- 101) was not successful for the model to be valid (Dave and Dudhat, 2013). Investigations into the presence or absence of intra-granular hydrogen bonding in the granule liquid bridges can influence the final tablet. When hydrogen bonding is present (by using water-based liquid binder) between the granules, the granule strength increases which in turn compromises the table strength. The inverse trend was found for the absence of hydrogen-bonding (by using an ethanol-based liquid binder). Therefore strength of the liquid bridges can play a part in controlling the final tablet strength. The exploration of the effect of the liquid binder on the microcrystalline cellulose properties revealed that microcrystalline cellulose swells upon exposure to liquid binder. The swelling of the cellulose would increase the bonding area and confer strength to the tablet. The acidity of the liquid binder appears to influence the crystallite size of microcrystalline cellulose granules. The crystallite size was found to be larger for granulation experiments using a liquid binder with a neutral pH level (such as calcium oxide liquid binders), compared to the crystallite size in granules produced with more acidic liquid binders (such as PVP or hydrochloric acid). The wet massing time did not have any significant effect on the crystalline or amorphous regions of microcrystalline cellulose. The effects of the wet granulator scale was also investigated which revealed that Unified Compaction Curve demonstrates different mixing intensities between the 1 litre and 5 litre granulator bowls in the relationship between the wet granulation compaction pressure (denoted as χ) and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. The compaction pressure per revolution was found to be greater for the 1 L granulator in comparison to the 5 L granulator scale. This formed the basis for the proposal of a new wet granulation scale-up rule which looks at maintaining ‘constant compaction pressure’ during the wet granulation scale-up process. This scale-up rule is a function of the compaction pressure per revolution and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. The compaction pressure per revolution, χ, is able to compensate for the differences in the granulator bowl geometry and impeller design between the two granulator scales. The proposed rule is anticipated to be a useful tool to help maintain constant granule properties during wet granulation scale-up but also to target the desired tablet. The studies in this thesis will allow a deeper insight into the mechanisms in the relationship between the wet granulation process and the final tablet strength, which would enable the wet granulation to be tailored for optimisation and target tablet specifications, make trouble-shooting easier to carry out and reduce resources for wet granulation case studies. This is of great importance and benefit to the pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
