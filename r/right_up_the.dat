25|$|If {{one looks}} at the fields around the Deserted Village and <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E
25|$|From Ennerdale Bridge, or the car parks {{near the}} outflow of the lake, the lane to Crag Farm {{can be used}} to give access onto the fell. A good path makes for Crag Fell and this can be {{followed}} as far as Ben Gill before turning <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hillside. The Coldfell road provides another starting point, a track heading eastward from near the Kinniside Stone Circle. This was once the road to the Crag Fell Iron Mines and crosses the initial ridge between Heckbarley and Blakeley Raise. It then contours along the southern flank of Grike, just above the trees.|$|E
25|$|In Texas, {{citizens}} {{voted to}} join the Confederacy; anti-war Germans were hanged. Local troops took over the federal arsenal in San Antonio, with plans to grab the territories of northern New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, and possibly California. Confederate Arizona was created by Arizona citizens who wanted protection against Apache raids after the United States Army units were moved out. The Confederacy then sets its sight {{to gain control of}} the New Mexico Territory. General Henry Hopkins Sibley was tasked for the campaign, and together with his New Mexico Army, marched <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Rio Grande in an attempt to take the mineral wealth of Colorado as well as California. The First Regiment of Volunteers discovered the rebels, and they immediately warned and joined the Yankees at Fort Union. The Battle of Glorieta Pass soon erupted, and the Union ended the Confederate campaign and the area west of Texas remained in Union hands.|$|E

500|$|With {{a second}} counter-thrust having been beaten {{back again and}} the loss of Sattelberg, Katagiri decided to fall back to the north, to form a {{defensive}} line around Wareo to wait for the Australians to follow up their victories with a further advance. By this time, Katagiri's forces were suffering from a manpower shortage {{due to a lack of}} reinforcements and the supply situation had still not been rectified. The Australian commander, Wootten, was keen to regain the initiative and he decided to resume the advance in the north with a view to securing the remainder of the Huon Peninsula. The first stage of Wootten's plan involved advancing north and securing a line along a ridge that ran between Gusika, on the coast, and Wareo, which was [...] inland. It was to take place in two main drives: the 26th Brigade, having secured Sattelberg, would advance to Wareo on the left, and the 24th Brigade would advance on the <b>right,</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast to secure Gusika and two large water features about [...] inland near the head of the Kalueng River, known collectively to the Australians as [...] "the Lakes". A third, minor advance would take place in the centre to Nongora and the Christmas Hills, responsibility for which was given to the 20th Brigade.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Bernhardt {{made her}} last {{tour of the}} French provinces, lecturing about theater and reciting the poetry of Rostand. Later that year, she {{produced}} a new play by Rostand, La Gloire, and another play by Verneuil, RÃ©gine Arnaud in 1922. She continued to entertain guests at her home. One such guest, French author Colette, described being served coffee by Bernhardt: [...] "The delicate and withered hand offering the brimming cup, the flowery azure of the eyes, so young still in their network of fine lines, the questioning and mocking coquetry of the tilted head, and that indescribable desire to charm, to charm still, to charm <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gates of death itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several towns were {{historically}} {{divided between}} counties, including Banbury, Burton upon Trent, Newmarket, Peterborough, Royston, Stamford, Tamworth, Todmorden and Warrington. In Newmarket and Tamworth the county boundary ran <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} high street, and in Todmorden, the historically fractious border between Lancashire and Yorkshire (the river known as Walsden Water) had had Todmorden Town Hall built {{right on top of}} it on a culvert tunnel, dividing the hall down the middle between the two counties [...] a division reflected in its architecture. The 1888 Act ensured that every urban sanitary district would be considered {{to be part of a}} single county. This principle was maintained in the 20th century: when county boroughs such as Birmingham, Manchester, Reading, Sheffield and Stockport expanded into neighbouring counties, the area added became associated with another county.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} desired {{collectibles}} involves the episodes introducing Catwoman ("The Purr-fect Crime" [...] / [...] "Better Luck Next Time"), which were {{the subject of a}} View-Master reel & booklet set in 1966 (Sawyers Packet # B492). While the series was first-run on ABC, packet cover indicia reflected the [...] "Bat Craze" [...] cultural phenomenon by referring to the booklet as a Batbooklet, Dynamically illustrated. By the time the television series was cancelled in 1968 and GAF had taken over the View-Master product, Batbooklet was removed in favor of then-standard View-Master packaging for all future releases in the decades to follow, <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> period when the standard packet line was discontinued. The first season's superimposed fight onomatopoeias were not used for the View-Master's scenes of fights. Instead, black-lined [...] "blast" [...] balloons (transparent inside), and series-like onomatopoeias were illustrated and superimposed over fight images.|$|E
