40|$|We {{describe}} an infectious-center in situ plaque hybridization procedure which quantitates simian virus 40 (SV 40) nonhomologous recombination {{in terms of}} the number of recombinant-producing cells in the DNA transfected cell population. Using this assay to measure the efficiency of recombination with SV 40 DNA in permissive monkey BSC- 1 cells, we found that: (i) over a range of DNA concentrations, polyomavirus DNA (which is partially homologous to SV 40 DNA) cannot be distinguished from nonhomologous phi X 174 <b>RF</b> 1 <b>DNA</b> with respect to its ability to recombine with SV 40 DNA; (ii) at defined DNA concentrations, polyomavirus and phi X 174 <b>RF</b> 1 <b>DNA</b> compete with each other for recombination with SV 40 DNA; (iii) virtually all segments of the phi X 174 genome recombine, apparently at random, with SV 40 DNA; (iv) the frequency of recombinant-producing cells, among the successfully transfected (virion-producing) cells, depends upon the input SV 40 DNA concentration in the transfection solution; and (v) replication-defective SV 40 mutant DNAs compete with wild-type SV 40 DNA for recombination with phi X 174 <b>RF</b> 1 <b>DNA.</b> From these observations, we conclude that the efficiency of recombination with SV 40, in the system under study, is unaffected by nucleotide sequence homology and that a limiting stage in the recombination pathway occurs before SV 40 DNA replication. Comparison of the dependency of recombination on initial SV 40 DNA concentration with the dependency on initial phi X 174 <b>RF</b> 1 <b>DNA</b> concentration indicates that SV 40 DNA sequences are a controlling factor in the nonhomologous recombination pathway...|$|R

Excision-repair was measured a) by physico-chemical methods, i. e. by {{determination of the}} conversion of <b>RF</b> I <b>DNA</b> into <b>RF</b> II <b>DNA</b> by UV-endo and by the subsequent conversion of <b>RF</b> II <b>DNA</b> ligase, b) by biological methods i. e. by measuring {{the ability of the}} reaction product to form phages upon incubation with spheroplasts from the appropriate strains of E. coli. Using the first method, we have shown, that more than 90 % of the pyrimidine dimers can be repaired in vitro; with the latter method we have shown, that the molecules which are repaired as defined by method a) have regained full biological activity. Exonuclease III was found to be not essential for excision-repair in vitro and also did not stimulate repair. From this result we conclude that UV-endo generates 3 'OH endgroups, in agreement with results obtained by Hamilton et al. (1974). The usefulness of the method presented in this paper with regard to the study of excision-repair is discussed...|$|R

The EcoRI-B fragment, containing the left end of the RF molecule, appears to be a replication terminus by its labeling characteristics for both RF and progeny DNA synthesis.

We observed that phiK <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> replication continued at normal rates in both dnaB and dnaC mutant hosts under conditions in which {{the activities of the}} dnaB and dnaC gene products were shown to be markedly reduced.

In control experiments we observed markedly reduced rates of phiK <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> replication in temperature-sensitive dnaG and dnaE host mutants, indicating that the products of these genes are essential. Thus, the mechanism of DNA chain initiation in vivo on the duplex <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> templates of isometric phages such as phiK apparently is different from that on the similar templates of isometric phages such as phiX 174.

Oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce single or double base mismatches, an insertion or a deletion (each of 16 bases) were annealed to M 13 phage derivatives. Double stranded closed circular <b>DNA</b> (<b>RF</b> IV) containing phosphorothioate internucleotidic linkages in the (-) strand was prepared enzymatically from these templates.

Repolymerisation of the DNA after the gapping reaction, followed by transfection into E. coli cells gave mutational efficiencies of up to 95 %.

A complementation analysis of RF synthesis of ts 14 and a viable defective H- 1 virus, DI- 1, or wild-type H- 3 indicates that the defective <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis of ts 14 is cis-acting. ts 14, unlike wild-type H- 1, causes a multiplicity-dependent inhibition of DI- 1 or H- 3, but not LuIII, <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis. Mixed infections of cells with two parvoviruses also exhibited a cross-interference for viral protein synthesis that was multiplicity dependent, ts 14 inhibited infectious virus production of H- 1 or H- 3, but not LuIII.

H- 3 and H- 1 showed similar interactions with ts 14, and H- 3 DNA was more homologous to H- 1 than was LuIII by comparative physical mapping studies.

40|$|The {{replication}} of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of parvovirus LuIII was studied in synchronized HeLa cells. After {{infection of the}} cells in early S phase, synthesis of a replicative form (<b>RF)</b> <b>DNA</b> became detectable as early as 9 h postinfection, i. e., after display of the cellular helper function(s) indispensable for the {{replication of}} LuIII virus.

Moreover, replication of LuIII DNA obviously includes a further replicative intermediate DNA which sedimented in front of <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> and bore single-stranded side-chains. Newly synthesized DNA disappeared from pools containing both <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> and replicative intermediate DNA within 5 min and reappeared in progeny virions only after 15 min.

We present evidence that the <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> of a similar rodent parvovirus, Kilham rat virus (KRV), also has covalently bound protein. NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified, 125 I-labeled <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> shows that proteins of 68 - 72, 66, 64, and 55 kDa copurify with the DNA during velocity and equilibrium sedimentation {{in the presence of}} detergents and 4 M guanidine HCl.

The latter polypeptides also appear to associate with protease-treated <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> when mixed with uninfected cell extract. Following removal of these proteins by electrophoresis in NaDodSO 4 /agarose gels, two proteins (called RF TP- 90 and RF TP- 40), of about 90 and 40 kDa, become evident.

40|$|Replication of the {{single-stranded}} DNA parvovirus H- 1 {{involves the}} synthesis of a double-stranded DNA replicative form (RF). In this study, the metabolism of <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> was examined in parasynchronous hamster embryo cells. The initiation of <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> replication was found to occur late in S phase, as was {{the synthesis of}} the DNA upon which subsequent viral hemagglutinin synthesis is dependent. Evidence is presented which indicates that initiation of RF replication requires proteins synthesized in late S phase, but that concomittant protein synthesis is not required for the continuation of RF replication. The data also suggest a requirement for viral protein(s) for progeny strand synthesis. Incorporation of 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BUdR) into viral DNA resulted in an “all-or-none” inhibition of viral hemagglutinin and viral antigen synthesis. BUdR inactivation of viral protein function was used to explore the time of synthesis of viral DNA serving as template for viral RNA synthesis {{and the effect of}} viral protein on RF replication and progeny strand synthesis. Results {{of this study suggest that}} parental <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> is synthesized shortly after infection, and that viral mRNA is transcribed from only a few copies of the viral genome in each cell. They also support the conclusion that viral protein is inhibitory to <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> replication.

40|$|Two murine parvoviruses with genomic {{sequences}} differing only in 33 nucleotides (8 amino acids) in {{the region}} coding for the capsid proteins show different host cell specificities: MVMi grows in EL 4 T lymphocytes and MVMp 3 grows in A 9 fibroblasts. In this study we compared the courses of infections with these two viruses in EL 4 cells in order to investigate at which step(s) the infection process of MVMp 3 is interrupted. The two viruses bound equally well to EL 4 cells, and similar amounts of MVMi and MVMp 3 input virion DNA appeared in the nuclear fractions of EL 4 cells 1 h after infection. However, double-stranded replicative-form (<b>RF)</b> <b>DNA</b> of the two viruses appeared at different times, at 10 h postinfection with MVMi and at 24 h postinfection with MVMp 3. The amount of MVMp 3 <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> detected at 24 h was very small because it was produced only in a tiny subset {{of the population of}} EL 4 cells that proved to be permissive for MVMp 3. Replication of double-stranded viral DNA in EL 4 cells was measured after transfection of purified <b>RF</b> <b>DNA,</b> cloned viral DNA, and cloned viral DNA with a mutation preventing synthesis of the capsid proteins. In each of these cases, DNA replication was comparable for MVMi and MVMp 3. Production of virus particles also appeared to be similar after transfection of the two types of <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> into EL 4 cells. Conversion of incoming 32 P-labeled single-stranded MVM DNA to 32 P-labeled double-stranded <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> was detected only after <b>RF</b> <b>DNA</b> amplification, indicating that few molecules serve as templates for viral DNA amplification. We showed that extracts of EL 4 cells contain a factor which can destabilize MVMi virions but not MVMp 3 by testing the sensitivity of viral DNA to DNase and by CsCl gradient analyses of viral particles. We therefore conclude that the MVMp 3 life cycle is arrested after the transport of virions to the nucleus and prior to the replication of <b>RF</b> <b>DNA,</b> most likely at the stage of viral decapsidation...|$|E

Biological characteristics typical of Mastreviruses; such as, the appearance and leafhopper transmissibility of streak symptoms on infected plants, the presence of 18 x 30 nm geminate particles in electron micrographs of leaf-dip preparations, {{and the presence of}} single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in Southern blot tests of infected plant DNA extracts, indicated that the RF-DNAs in pKom 500, pSet 100 and PanSV-Kar represent the entire genomes of MSV-Kom, MSV-Set and PanSV-Karrespectively. The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of the genome of MSV-Set was determined and characterised, and compared with those of MSV-Kom and PanSV-Kar. The genome sizes of MSV-Kom, MSV-Set and PanSV-Kar are 2701, 2690 and 2705 nt respectively, and all share Mastreviral genomic features. Phylogenetic analyses on the nt sequences and the putative amino acid sequences of the movement, coat and replication-associated proteins (MP, CP and Rep respectively) indicate that MSV-Set is grouped with, yet distinct from the MSV group of viruses isolated from maize. MSV-Set shares a 78 % nt sequence identity with MSV-Kom which shares a > 96 % nt sequence identity with other MSVs. The PanSV-Kar genome shares a 60 % nt sequence identity with the MSV group and 89 % with the Kenyan PanSV-Ken. PanSV-Kar causes mild non-persistent streak in Jubilee sweetcorn. MSV-Kom (previously isolated from maize in Komatipoort, Mpumalanga) and MSV-Set (previously isolated from a Setaria species in Mt. Edgecombe, Kwazulu/Natal) have different pathogenicities, and have overlapping, but non-identical, host ranges. Leafhopper transmission tests determined that MSV-Kom and MSV-Set generally cause severe and moderate streak in maize cultivars, or mild and severe streak in wheat cultivars respectively...|$|R
40|$|Spermidine-condensed phi X 174 {{replicative form}} (<b>RF)</b> II <b>DNA</b> was digested with micrococcal {{nuclease}} to yield seven identifiable DNA bands forming an arithmetic fragment-length series. The DNA monomer unit length {{was found to}} be 780 +/- 80 base pairs. This result is most consistent with a proposed model for micrococcal nuclease cleavage of a DNA torus organized by the unidirectional, circumferential wrapping of B-geometry DNA. By a topological consideration, the blunt-end-rod-fusion model for torus formation [Eickbush, T. H. & Moudrianakis, E. N. (1978) Cell 13, 295 - 306] is shown to be inconsistent with our empirical solution results. We propose a continuous, circumferential DNA wrapping model in which a significant fraction of the collapsed circular phi X 174 RFII DNA molecules form regular toruses comprised of seven complete, unidirectional double-helical wraps...|$|R
40|$|Viral single strands (SS) are {{converted}} to the duplex from (RF) by a soluble enzyme fraction uninfected Escherichia coli [Schekman et al. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5859 - 5865]. When reactions were supplemented with a soluble enzyme fraction from phi X 174 -infected cells, replication of phi X 174 superhelical <b>RF</b> I <b>DNA</b> was observed. The activity supplied by infected cells was absent in cells treated with chloramphenicol or in cells infected with a phi X 174 phage mutant in cistron A (cis A). A host function coded by the rep gene, essential in vivo for RF replication (but not for SS leads to RF), was supplied by enzyme fractions from either infected or uninfected cells. Based on complementation assays, the cisA-dependent and the rep-dependent proteins have each been purified about 1000 -fold. The synthetic {{products of the}} enzymatic reaction were identified as RF I and RF II in which viral (+) and complementary (-) strands were newly synthesized...|$|R
