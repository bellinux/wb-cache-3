Admiral William Sims charged after the war that in April, 1917, only ten percent of the Navy's warships were fully manned; the rest lacked 43% of their seamen. Only a third of the ships were fully <b>ready.</b> <b>Light</b> antisubmarine ships were few in number, as if no one had noticed the u-boat factor that had been the focus of foreign policy for two years. The Navy's only warfighting plan, the [...] "Black Plan" [...] assumed the Royal Navy did not exist and that German battleships were moving freely about the Atlantic and the Caribbean and threatening the Panama Canal. [...] His most recent biographer concludes that, [...] "it is true that Daniels had not prepared the navy for the war it would have to fight." ...|$|E

Now leave us, all of you, for {{if you look}} too long upon {{the face of the}} Yellow God she will ask a sacrifice, and it is not lawful that you should see where she hides herself away." ...|$|E
50|$|Neither camera {{could use}} the DX-1 {{viewfinder}} of the F3AF body. Contacts in mirror housing were configured differently than a regular F3 series camera. On an F3P and F3 Limited, they were used for flash synch and <b>ready</b> <b>light</b> purposes. On an F3, F3/T, and F3AF, {{they were used to}} communicate the exposure meter display information to the LCD inside the DX-1 viewfinder.|$|E
60|$|A {{little way}} down the passage was a niche in which stood three lamps <b>ready</b> <b>lighted.</b> One of these she took and gave the others to us. Then we {{followed}} her down a steep incline of many steps, till at length we found ourselves in a hot and enormous hall hewn from the living rock and filled with blackness.|$|R
60|$|But {{she made}} no sign. A husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his {{slippers}} laid out too conveniently near nor a match <b>ready</b> <b>lighted</b> for his cigar. There must be expiation, explanation, and possibly execration. A little purgatory, and then, maybe, if he were properly humble, he might be trusted with a harp and crown. And so {{she made no}} sign that she knew or suspected.|$|R
60|$|But she {{was soon}} calm. Rising to her feet, {{she opened a}} secret panel in the wall, and {{revealed}} a slow-match <b>ready</b> for <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
50|$|James Ready Brewing Co. is a Canadian beer brand brewed at Moosehead Brewery. The brand {{has five}} types of lagers, {{each with a}} varying alcohol by volume value. These five types of beer from lightest to darkest are the James Ready Lager, the James <b>Ready</b> <b>Light,</b> the James Ready Original Ale, the James Ready 5.5, and the James Ready 6.0.|$|E
50|$|A minimal {{amount of}} {{photographic}} flash automation was provided. With a compatible dedicated flash, the camera {{would be set}} automatically to the 1/60 second X-sync speed, and a <b>ready</b> <b>light</b> in the viewfinder would blink when the flash was charged. The photographer did have to set the correct aperture for flash photography according to subject distance; a guide was available {{on the back of}} Minolta's flashes.|$|E
5000|$|The 7.6 t flywheel, located {{outside the}} station and {{adjacent}} to the loop, {{is attached to a}} clutch and cable system, which in turn connects to a small four-wheeled catch car known as a [...] "bob". On the front of the bob is a launch pin that seats in a socket {{in the back of the}} train. Once the bob is seated, the operators receive the <b>ready</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
60|$|When all was <b>ready,</b> Jonas <b>lighted</b> {{the end of}} {{the slender}} roll in the lamp, and plunged it {{carefully}} into the tumbler. It went out immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... (Candida comes in, well aproned, with {{a reading}} lamp trimmed, filled, and <b>ready</b> for <b>lighting.</b> She {{places it on}} the table near Morell, ready for use.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{his career}} was spent in B films, as [...] "the archetypal spiv, {{unreliable}} boyfriend, unscrupulous blackmailer, the smoothie ever <b>ready</b> to <b>light</b> a lady's cigarette".|$|R
50|$|Since {{the radio}} would not {{transmit}} unless the <b>ready</b> <b>light</b> was lit, checking output power, frequency, or deviation {{on the bench}} or outside the system coverage area required the technician to attach a test box. The box bypassed the radio trunking logic so adjustments could be made in a conventional single-channel mode. Antenna forward and reflected power in a vehicle on a working system was typically checked by bringing up a talk channel and transmitting normally. Once a channel was brought up it could be 'held' for up to 3 minutes (the limit of the system carrier control timer).|$|E
50|$|A 4L's four status LEDs {{will also}} light in unusual {{patterns}} to indicate service requirements; for example, a lit error {{light and a}} lit <b>ready</b> <b>light</b> would indicate a fuser problem (usually just needs to be reseated - most 4L problems can be resolved by simply disassembling the printer, cleaning it, then reassembling it). This was much more cryptic than the alphanumeric display of earlier models like the II/IID, III/IIID, IIP, and IIIP, as {{it was impossible to}} determine the meaning of the patterns of LEDs without comparing them against a manual (or having their meaning memorized, which some technicians exposed to them often might actually do, intentionally or not). Interestingly, the 4L used early light pipes, with surface-mounted LEDs on the control board {{on the left side of}} the printer, and plastic channels to conduct light from the lit status LEDs to the top of the printer. The LaserJet 4/4 Plus/4M/4M Plus retained an alphanumeric display, and in fact upgraded from the LCD displays of earlier models by using a 16-character alphanumeric dot-matrix vacuum fluorescent display. To this day, professional-grade LaserJets retain more comprehensive displays.|$|E
5000|$|In 1915 Daniels {{set up the}} Naval Consulting Board {{headed by}} Thomas Edison to obtain the advice and {{expertise}} of leading scientists, engineers, and industrialists. It popularized technology, naval expansion, and military preparedness, and was well covered in the media. Daniels and Benson rejected proposals to sendobservers to Europe, leaving the Navy {{in the dark about}} the success of the German submarine campaign. Admiral William Sims charged after the war that in April, 1917, only ten percent of the Navy's warships were fully manned; the rest lacked 43% of their seamen.

60|$|Indeed my plight seemed {{either to}} have called out or else {{repressed}} her true nature. But {{who had ever}} fathomed her nature! There was none of her treacly volubility. There were none of her “dear young gentlemans” and “poor little hearts” and references to sin. In breathless silence she ran about the house getting my room <b>ready,</b> <b>lighting</b> fires and gas-jets and even hauling at me to help me up the stairs. Yes, she did lay hands on me for that charitable purpose. They trembled. Her pale eyes hardly left my face. “What brought you here like this?” she whispered once.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{research}} into unmanned and autonomous vehicles has greatly increased. With applications ranging from science and exploration to humanitarian and military efforts, the rising need for autonomous vehicles demands constant innovation and growth. The Intelligent Dependable Embedded Architectures (IDEA) {{lab at the}} University of Kentucky is continually launching research oriented programs [1]. A few key projects focus {{on the development of}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Through this research, at the University of Kentucky, the need to develop a reliable, lightweight, node based hardware for use in light UAVs and other unmanned and autonomous vehicles became apparent. This paper addresses the design and implementation of a network processing node for light UAVs. This system utilizes a Controller Area Network (CAN) noise tolerant communications bus, a low power ZigBee Wireless Network for expanded inner plane communications and Silicon Laboratories C 8051 F 041 microcontrollers to provide the necessary inputs/output and data processing. The final result will be a flight <b>ready</b> <b>light</b> UAV featurin...|$|E

60|$|It made Dorothy shudder {{to see a}} huge iron kettle {{suspended}} by a stout chain {{in the middle of}} the place, and underneath the kettle a great heap of kindling wood and shavings, <b>ready</b> to <b>light.</b>|$|R
60|$|These {{could be}} made <b>ready</b> for <b>lighting</b> in a few seconds, since it was {{proposed}} only to knock in the heads, pour out half the contents to prevent {{the possibility of an}} explosion, and set fire to the remainder.|$|R
60|$|George {{did as he}} was bidden, and {{sat down}} again limply when he reached an opening in the wood where a pile of branches, with a kettle {{suspended}} over them, had been laid <b>ready</b> for <b>lighting.</b> Presently the others rejoined him.|$|R

60|$|Morel danced {{a little}} nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist to strike. William put his fists <b>ready.</b> A <b>light</b> {{came into his}} blue eyes, almost like a laugh.

6000|$|... "That isn't very nice, either," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "Well, our {{goods are}} on the way, and by Thursday we'll be {{independent}} of any one.

One tolerably big bonfire has been waiting some time <b>ready</b> for <b>lighting.</b> I had only to send the message. I think you know why I didn't." ...|$|R
60|$|Straight for the Admiral's great ship, the Encarnacion, did Wolverstone {{head the}} sloop; then, lashing down the helm, he kindled from a match that hung <b>ready</b> <b>lighted</b> beside {{him a great}} torch of thickly plaited straw that had been steeped in bitumen. First it glowed, then as he swung it round his head, it burst into flame, just as the slight vessel went {{crashing}} and bumping and scraping {{against the side of}} the flagship, whilst rigging became tangled with rigging, to the straining of yards and snapping of spars overhead. His six men stood at their posts on the larboard side, stark naked, each armed with a grapnel, four of them on the gunwale, two of them aloft. At the moment of impact these grapnels were slung to bind the Spaniard to them, those aloft being intended to complete and preserve the entanglement of the rigging.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} the [...] "devil" [...] was <b>ready,</b> and a <b>light</b> applied; it blazed furiously for half a minute, sending volumes of light smoke up the shaft.|$|R
6000|$|The men became stingy. Never {{was there}} such economy. They refused to buy {{anything}} more from the slopchest. Old rags had to last, and they sewed patch upon patch, turning out what are called [...] "homeward-bound patches" [...] {{of the most amazing}} proportions. They saved on matches, even, waiting till two or three were <b>ready</b> to <b>light</b> their pipes from the same match.|$|R

Miss Elizabeth had this put in when she made the house over fifteen years ago. It was a big, old-fashioned fireplace where you could have roasted an ox. Many's the time I've sat here and spun yarns, same's I'm doing tonight." ...|$|R
