The Spanish highways started during the 60 s around Madrid, Barcelona and Galicia. In the following decade, the corridors linking Catalonia with the Basque Country and the Mediterranean corridor, connecting Catalonia with Valencia were built. In 1990, many <b>radial</b> <b>highways</b> linking Madrid with the remaining provincial capitals were already in place, and this <b>radial</b> system of <b>highways</b> was fully completed by 2000. In the following decade, there was an attempt to connect provincial capitals, resulting in a more meshed configuration of high capacity roads.|$|R

50|$|The region {{containing}} {{the capital city}} of Spain, Madrid ranks the 3rd community by population, and {{is by far the most}} densely populated. Even though it contains the centre of the national <b>radial</b> <b>highway</b> system, the Madrid regional government (traditionally more committed to the expansion of the Metro system) has dedicated vast resources during the last decade to upgrade the regional road network and, where necessary, create new high-capacity roads that both complement the national system and vertebrate zones of the community not covered by the national network.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{of a new}} <b>radial</b> <b>highway</b> {{linking the}} city centre with the M9 highway — the Krasnopresnensky Avenue — was started in 2000s, and {{it was decided to}} have it pass under the Serebryany Bor forests via the new North-Western Tunnel that would combine auto traffic on upper level and Metro tracks from Krylatskoye to Strogino on lower level. Necessitated by safety measures, a {{provision}} for a new station, , was left between the combined tunnel and Strogino, to be completed once a new housing massif is established there. The original project for [...] station, which was to be a two-storied station, was abandoned in favour of a single-vault one, with a provision to build a neighbour when and if another line finally reaches Strogino.

50|$|Expressways {{and major}} {{arterial}} roads {{in and around}} Greater Boston are laid out with two circumferential expressways: Interstate 495 and Route 128. The circumferential routes are bisected by several <b>radial</b> <b>highways</b> that were planned to start in downtown Boston and proceed outward from the city. In reality, the Central Artery {{was the only one}} of these radial expressways that was fully completed. The freeway revolt of late 1960s prompted the governor of Massachusetts to halt construction on all remaining expressways within the Route 128 beltway, several of which were eventually replaced by rail lines.|$|R
25|$|Interstate 66 was {{originally}} conceived {{to be part}} of a much more massive interstate highway complex, of which it was to be one of several <b>radial</b> <b>highways</b> departing Washington in all directions. In addition, the capital city was to be surrounded by three beltways, of which only the proposed middle one and portions of an inner one were built. Construction of Interstate 66 caused Falls Church to lose one of its most highly prized homes—the Pope-Leighey House, which was threatened with destruction but moved to Woodlawn Plantation in southern Alexandria. Ironically, its original homesite on Locust Street was untouched, but falls within the interstate highway's right-of-way.|$|R

50|$|The eastern {{segment of}} Nebraska Highway 64 begins at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Highway 77 south of Fremont. It then proceeds east through farmland, then briefly north near Leshara. After meeting Nebraska Spur 78J, it turns east, crosses the Platte River, then turns northeast and meets the U.S. Highway 275 freeway northwest of Valley. The two highways run concurrent until just northwest of Waterloo. They separate, and NE 64 goes east as a divided highway past the Elkhorn River into increasing areas of {{residential and commercial}} development and meets Nebraska Highway 31 in the Elkhorn neighborhood of Omaha. The road continues east on a divided highway which is called West Maple Road. Between 108th Street and 102nd Street in Omaha, NE 64 meets Interstate 680. The highway then becomes Maple Street, passing by the Colonial Apartments, home of Wikipedia editor Carey Hughes. It continues east and shortly past 72nd Street, becomes a two lane road as it passes through the Benson neighborhood. East of the Benson business district, at an intersection with Nebraska Link 28K, NE 64 becomes divided highway again, and goes east, then south along Northwest <b>Radial</b> <b>Highway,</b> then east along Cuming Street, and terminates at a freeway interchange with U.S. Highway 75 near Creighton University.|$|E

40|$|To {{make our}} cities {{sustainable}} {{is one of}} today's major challenges. The complexity of this task requires suitable planning tools. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a hierarchical modelling approach to assess the effects of transport and land use projects and instruments. First a brief definition of the overall objective sustainability is given. This is followed by the description of the suggested hierarchical approach. A strategic, dynamic land use and transport interaction model builds the basis and is linked to models on a different spatial and functional level. A case study covering the Spanish region of Madrid ('Comunidad de Madrid') was selected to demonstrate the applicability. In particular the effects of the public transport infrastructure projects, the extension of the metro line number 9 and bus lanes on all <b>radial</b> <b>highways,</b> should be assessed. It is demonstrated that the suggested approach is applicable and suitable. The overall effect of the metro line extension and the bus lanes is positive. Nevertheless their contribution to a sustainable urban region is limited. Comprehensive strategies are needed to achieve the objective of sustainability.

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates how {{the extent}} and {{configuration}} of recently expanded Chinese highway and railroad networks have influenced urban form in Chinese cities over the past 20 years.

In this context, we find that each <b>radial</b> <b>highway</b> displaces 4 to 5 percent of central city population to surrounding regions {{and the existence of}} a ring road displaces an additional 20 percent. While railroads have no effect on the spatial distribution of population in urban areas, each radial railroad displaces 26 percent of industrial GDP from central cities to surrounding regions. We find no effect of radial highways on the spatial distribution of GDP in urban regions, though the existence of a ring road decentralizes large amounts of industrial GDP beyond the amounts decentralized by the existence of railroads.

40|$|Sustainability {{is one of}} today's major challenges. A widely {{accepted}} definition of sustainability is based on intergenerational equity {{and a set of}} sub objectives. Numerous studies provide evidence that cities worldwide do not fulfil the requirements of sustainability. The work presented here investigates whether transport policies of the municipality of Madrid contribute to the high level objective of sustainability. The "Comunidad de Madrid 2 ̆ 01 d is situated in the heart of Spain. It covers an area of 8, 000 km 2. About 5 million people live within the whole region. The city of Madrid itself has about 2. 9 million inhabitants. The situation is characterised by a rapid development of housing and businesses in the surroundings of the city. Traffic is characterised by a high share of people commuting into the core city. Although Madrid has an efficient metro line system, this results in a high level of peak hour congestion. As well the land use as the transport system do not fulfil the requirements of sustainability. Different measures were realised and proposed to remedy the current situation. One of these measures is a bus and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane. The HOV lane covers a 16 kilometres long stretch of the highway N-VI and was opened in the year 1995. The strategic, dynamic land use and transport interaction model MARS (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator) will be used to assess the effects of the HOV lane. MARS covers the whole "Comunidad de Madrid 2 ̆ 01 d. Effects on land use and regional travel patterns are predicted with this model. Observed data are used to validate the model results.

40|$|This Project {{analyses}} Melbourne 2 ̆ 7 s CityLink {{in terms}} of the amount that needs to be charged to consumers for investors to make a profit. INTRODUCTIONCityLink is a 22 km road scheme in two sections. The Western Link upgrades an existing freeway to eight lanes and adds a six-lane elevated road and bridge crossing over the River Yarra. The Southern Link upgrades an arterial roadway to five and six lanes, and provides two three-lane tunnels (of 3. 4 km and 1. 6 km in length) under the Yarra. It opened in 2000. Toll charges are collected through an electronic system developed as part of the project. The project is associated with the redevelopment of unused docklands between the central business district and the Yarra, and the expansion of container traffic through the port. BACKGROUNDThe primary objective of the project was to relieve congestion in the city centre, by linking the existing <b>radial</b> <b>highways</b> and bypassing the centre’s urban and residential streets. This in turn would improve the urban environment and provide better access for industry to port, rail and airport facilities. The project was supported by a variety of national and state government policy statements relating to transport and urban development between 1987 and 1992. The decision to seek private sector involvement was announcd in 1992, based on guidelines issued by the State government in 1991. The scheme was initially developed by the state road agency, VicRoads, but in 1995 the core team from VicRoads was transferred to the newly established Melbourne City Link Authority. Public consultation took place in 1992, highlighting issues about potential economic, social and environmental impacts, and leading to the publication of an environmental effects statement in 1994. CHARACTERISTICSThe cost was estimated at AUD 1. 776 bn (at 1993 prices) (USD 2. 80 bn at 2010 pricesi) in Transurban’s 1996 prospectus. The design and construct contract accounted for 65...|$|R

40|$|Highway {{concessions}} {{are becoming}} quite popular {{all around the}} world as a means to promote private participation in the management and financing of public infrastructure. The congestion problems caused by the limited capacity of the road infrastructure networks in many metropolitan areas are prompting public authorities to adopt the concession approach to improve highway capacity, {{while at the same time}} implementing a congestion pricing approach. This paper describes and assesses the case study of a toll highway concession program, recently implemented in the city of Madrid, to build four <b>radial</b> toll <b>highways</b> intended to reduce congestion and at the same time to raise revenues to fund the new infrastructure. The concessions, which started their operations in 2003 and 2004, have not worked as well as expected. There are several reasons for this. The most important one is that they managed to capture only a small share of the traffic in the corridor. This has caused serious financial problems to the concessionaires, who are now on the verge of bankruptcy. This paper analyses both the reasons behind the government’s adoption of the concession approach, and the reasons why this approach ultimately proved unsuccessful. On the basis of the results of this case study, we offer a set of recommendations for policy makers when considering the use of toll highway concession contracts in metropolitan area...|$|R
30|$|For {{the period}} between 1980 and 1990 and 1990 – 2000, {{accessibility}} changes were lower due to a modest population increase, especially in most accessible Spanish provinces. On the other hand, during this period the contribution from transport infrastructure outweighs the contribution from population and partly compensates the negative population growth in provinces such as Orense and Vizcaya. If we compare the interannual infrastructure contribution {{with the number of}} kilometres constructed in every decade (Table 2), we can conclude that the highest contributions do not fully correspond with the highest investment periods. Instead, transport infrastructure has had the highest impacts in years of network structural changes, such as 1970 – 1980 when the <b>radial</b> system of <b>highways</b> started to emerge, and during 1990 – 2000 when this radial structure led to a denser configuration of highways.|$|R
