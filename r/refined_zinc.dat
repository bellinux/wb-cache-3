5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although <b>refined</b> <b>zinc</b> production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E

In the same year, the US exported 669,000 tons of zinc in concentrated ore, mostly from the Red Dog Mine in Alaska, and imported 2,550 tons of zinc in ore concentrates for the zinc smelter at Clarksville, Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|The Smee cell used amalgamated zinc {{instead of}} pure zinc; {{the surface of}} amalgamated zinc has been treated with mercury. Apparently amalgamated zinc was less prone to {{degradation}} by an acidic solution than is pure zinc. Amalgamated zinc and plain zinc electrodes give essentially the same voltage when the zinc is pure.

By the late 18th century, Bagillt had become a centre of mineral extraction and manufacturing. Hundreds of men laboured in eleven collieries that surrounded the village.

50|$|Since cadmium {{compounds}} {{are often}} found in association with zinc ores, cadmium oxide is a common by-product of <b>zinc</b> <b>refining.</b> It is produced by burning elemental cadmium in air.
