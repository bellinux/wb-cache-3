40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ] in Kenya to {{determine the influence of}} photoperiod and temperature on flowering. Variation in temperature was achieved by planting six genotypes at four locations varying in altitude where temperature decreased with increase in altitude and variation in photoperiod was achieved through artificial lighting (about 12. 6 h - natural day length, 14. 5 h and 16. 0 h). The genotypes used in the study were carefully selected to represent different duration types (extra-short-, short-, medium- and long-duration) and major pigeonpea production regions. Equations that describe the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> development (1 /f) were used to determine <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> each genotype towards flowering as influenced by temperature and photoperiod. For photoperiods below 13 h, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> towards flowering were influenced by temperature in five genotypes (ICPL 90011, ICPL 87091, ICP 7035, ICP 6927 and ICEAP 00040).

The effects <b>of</b> photoperiod on <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> towards flowering were investigated only under sub-optimal temperatures.

The Japanese counter-attacked the next day, and as fighting continued through to 6 November, Major General George Vasey, the new divisional commander, sent the 25th Brigade and the 2/1st Battalion on a successful attack against the Japanese rear at Gorari.

The Battle of Attu was only the third American amphibious operation of the war, and was carried through to a costly success under difficult conditions.

He now prepared Operation Cottage, the much larger invasion of Kiska. This was carried out as planned, but the invaders found that the Japanese had already evacuated the islands. In September 1943, Kinkaid was replaced by Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Repetitive and intrusive thought about unattained goals ('rumination') {{is a common}} mental response to problems in everyday living that has been implicated in both psychopathology and adaptive functioning. Although rumination is hypothesised to be instigated by poor perceived <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> towards personal goals (the self-regulatory theory of rumination), few studies have directly tested the relationship between goal motivation and ruminative thinking. This research will test the hypothesis that rumination is increased when individuals have problems reducing discrepancies within personal goal systems. This will be accomplished by assessing motivational structures via personal goal systems (Study 1), by sampling rumination and goal discrepancies as they fluctuate in everyday life (Study 2), and by examining the accessibility of autobiographical memories relating to goal discrepancies (Study 3). The following predictions will be tested: ruminators will report more conflicting relationships between goals, more abstract goals and more avoidance-oriented goals than non-ruminators; everyday rumination will be associated with discrepancies between perceived and expected <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> on current goals, particularly for goals that are more abstract and relevant to important higher-level goals; ruminators will retrieve more specific autobiographical memories relating to failures to achieve goals than non-ruminators...|$|R

The way to guard against the exceptional case of human failure of the kind which occurred at Harrow does not lie in making the regulations more restrictive, with consequent adverse effect on traffic movement, but in reinforcing the vigilance of drivers by apparatus which provides a positive link between the wayside signals and the footplate. The report considered a system warning drivers that they had passed a signal at caution or danger would have prevented ten percent of the accidents (and 28% of the consequent deaths) in the previous forty-one years, thereby saving 399 lives, including the 112 at Harrow.
