500|$|The oldest {{stand at}} Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was {{completed}} in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box {{is located at the}} rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier [...] The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating [...] "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually {{he escaped}} {{into the jungle}} where he survived for months by himself. [...] "I {{followed}} monkeys and ate whatever they ate. I fished with my hands and ate fruits, and killed monkeys, too." [...] In late 1980 he crossed the border into Thailand and a Thai Soldier {{took him to the}} Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp. There he met the Reverend Peter L. Pond. [...] "He weighed about 60 pounds and he was very sick," [...] Reverend Pond later recalled, [...] "He had cerebral malaria and he was really close to death...This sick little child <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> touched me, and said in English, 'Hello.' That...was Arn Chorn from the very first, reaching out and touching." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the battles}} with Villa, Obregón had {{his right arm}} blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he {{attempted}} to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. [...] The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined {{in the search for}} his missing arm. [...] "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying [...] "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold azteca [...] was elevated; it <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> grasped it in its fingers--lovingly--That {{was the only way to}} get my lost arm to appear." [...] The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|In one of WCW's {{most brutal}} matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a Texas Death match at Halloween Havoc. Race won the match for Vader {{by using a}} cattle prod on Cactus, {{knocking}} him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader {{had one of the}} most infamous matches in wrestling history in Munich, Germany. Foley began a hangman—a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. [...] Foley freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring. [...] When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. [...] During this time, Vader <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> grabbed Foley's ear, and ripped it off. [...] The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. [...] Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan were scheduled to win the tag team titles at Slamboree in 1994. Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW's reluctance to work a storyline around losing his ear.|$|E

50|$|Round 4: Later in {{the game}} midway through the final quarter, Nathan Jones would kick the ball long towards Melbourne's attacking 50.

60|$|I {{glanced up}} to find the great orb still {{motionless}} {{in the center of}} the heaven. And such a sun! I had scarcely noticed it before.
