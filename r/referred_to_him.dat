5|$|Thor {{remained}} pictured as a red-bearded figure, as evident by the Danish rhyme {{that yet}} <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Thor med sit lange skæg ("Thor {{with the long}} beard") and the North-Frisian curse diis ruadhiiret donner regiir! ("let red-haired thunder see to that!").|$|E
5|$|Friends {{and colleagues}} remembered Crawford as a cantankerous and {{irritable}} individual. His contributions to British archaeology, including in Antiquity and aerial archaeology, {{have been widely}} acclaimed; some have <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{as one of the}} great pioneering figures in the field. His photographic archive remained of use to archaeologists into the 21st century. A biography of Crawford by Kitty Hauser was published in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to cofound the {{spin-off}} {{private equity}} investment firm, Bain Capital. He had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain's offer to head the new venture, until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure {{so that there was}} no financial or professional risk to Romney. Bain and Romney raised the $37million in funds needed to start the new operation, which had seven employees. Romney held the titles of president and managing general partner. Though he was the sole shareholder of the firm, publications also <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as managing director or CEO.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} name Naa Gbanwah and Gbewah can be used interchangeably, the {{difference}} being that Mamprusis <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as gbanwah and dagombas <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as gbewah. It is just a difference in pronunciations.|$|R
50|$|Raphael's {{work are}} all {{published}} under his sole first name. Some websites <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Raphael Decosterd (or Décosterd) {{but it seems}} to be his Swiss-born wife's last name. The Kahua Institute's website <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Raphael F. Sharpe.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release from Görlitz in May 1941, Messiaen was {{appointed}} a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire, where he taught {{until his retirement in}} 1978. He compiled his Technique de mon langage musical ("Technique of my musical language") published in 1944, in which he quotes many examples from his music, particularly the Quartet. Although only in his mid-thirties, his students described him as an outstanding teacher. Among his early students were the composers Pierre Boulez and Karel Goeyvaerts. Other pupils included Karlheinz Stockhausen in 1952, Alexander Goehr in 1956–57, Tristan Murail in 1967–72 and George Benjamin during the late 1970s. The Greek composer Iannis Xenakis was <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in 1951; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music.|$|E
5|$|When Sarria {{was around}} ten years old, {{he asked his}} mother {{how much money they}} had in the bank. Maria, who gave her money to her {{employer}} Mr. Jost to invest, asked to see the books. She discovered that Jost had been embezzling from her and from the other women whom she had <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Jost was arrested, convicted and deported. Maria sued Jost's corporate partners and received a settlement but never recovered the bulk of the money. Unable to afford her house payments, Maria moved José and the Millen family to Redwood City in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Leofric was {{probably}} born in Cornwall, {{and his parents}} were English. Because canon law required that a bishop be 30 years old when consecrated, {{it is likely that}} Leofric was born before 1016. The medieval chronicler Florence of Worcester <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as a Brytonicus, which presumably meant that he was a native of Cornwall. He had a brother, Ordmaer, who acted as his steward and administered the family estates. Leofric was educated in Lotharingia, and may have been brought up abroad. Leofric may have gone into exile either in 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark invaded England or in 1016, when Sweyn's son Cnut became king of England. His education possibly took place at the church of St Stephen's in Toul, where the future Pope Leo IX was a canon from 1017 to 1024 and bishop after 1027.|$|E
50|$|Sources {{that focus}} on his role as Abbot of St. Gallen {{sometimes}} <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Ulrich III of St Gallen. In 1086 he was also appointed Patriarch of Aquileia, in respect of which sources may <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Ulrich I of Aquileia.|$|R
50|$|The place-name Saint-Maclou also <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{recurring}} theme in previous albums was Danger insulting Bradshaw by forgetting his current rank, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Sergeant Bradshaw, when Bradshaw had {{been promoted to}} Lieutenant. In this album Bradshaw is the District Attorney, but Danger still <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by his police rank.|$|R
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks {{of the year in}} Albania, there was no {{fighting}} since the Ottomans did not normally engage in battle during the winter. But Krujë was still under siege and Ottoman garrisons in other areas remained. Life became harder for the population after the destruction of crops and villages and the masses of refugees. By November 22, news came to Venice about the campaigns of Sinan bey against Albania Veneta in order to pressure the Republic to accept a peace or a ceasefire. The Signoria was slow {{to come to terms with}} Mehmed due to the pressure put on it by Pope Paul, Hungary, and Naples to remain at war. The attempt to sway the Venetians failed and the campaign was cancelled. This had an adverse effect for the Ottomans since Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's ally in northern Albania, decided to work without reservation with Skanderbeg against the Ottomans. In Rome, the pope continued to hold Skanderbeg and would only give him 300 ducats to support his stay. On Christmas Eve, Paul invited Skanderbeg to a ceremony where he was awarded with a sword and helmet and <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Alexander, king of the Epirotes. By 7 January 1467, a consistory convened where Skanderbeg and the pope were present. According to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the pope's appeal to fund Skanderbeg with only 5,000 ducats was heard and when the Cardinals responded that the fund was minimal, Paul explained that he would send more once Italy was pacified. Paul's decision led to a fierce debate on Italy's future which left Albania's fate undiscussed. A second consistory was called on 12 January but did not result in anything favorable for Skanderbeg. Contemporaries were critical of the pope's delays but he explained that he was waiting to see what Ferdinand of Naples was willing to offer before offering anything himself, in order not to waste funds.|$|E
25|$|Béla Magyarized {{his birth}} surname, Kohn, to Kun in 1904, {{although}} the almanac of the University of Kolozsvár still <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in print by his former name {{as late as}} 1909. There is no archival evidence as to the exact date the name was legally changed, although {{it is clear that}} from 1904 all those around him <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Béla Kun rather than Kohn, and he likewise made the Magyar variant his signature.|$|E
50|$|Vernet {{was born}} in Hamburg but later claimed a French birthplace {{in his effort to}} have the French Government intercede with the British Government on his behalf. As a result, some sources <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> a native of Hamburg, while others <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as French born.|$|R
5000|$|The Marquis St. Evrémonde is <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as [...] "Monseigneur" [...] and [...] "Monsieur."

25|$|Curtis rarely mixed {{socially}} {{with his}} fellow band members, preferring his own company. He was widely {{thought to be a}} genius. George Harrison <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as 'Mad Henry' but John Lennon indulged him.|$|E
25|$|Jones's {{first serious}} {{relationship}} was with Loe Kann, a wealthy Dutch émigré <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in 1906 {{after she had}} become addicted to morphine during treatment for a serious kidney condition. Their relationship lasted until 1913. It ended with Kann in analysis with Freud and Jones, at Freud's behest, undergoing analysis with Sándor Ferenczi.|$|E

25|$|Vinu Patel {{was born}} in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India on 13 September 1933. His parents, Manibhai Naranbhai Patel and Dahiben Patel were both {{followers}} of Shastriji Maharaj and the Akshar Purushottam Upasana. Shastriji Maharaj visited the newborn a few days post-birth and named the child Keshav, although his family <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by his nickname, Vinu.|$|E
25|$|William Hay {{graduated}} from the United States Military Academy in 1886, and was a classmate of John J. Pershing. Hay was 22 years old when admitted to West Point, older than all his classmates by several years. As a result, his fellow cadets <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as “Dad,” the nickname by which he continued to be known.|$|E
25|$|James B. Hickok {{used the}} name William Hickok from 1858 and William Haycock during the Civil War. He was arrested while {{using the name}} Haycock in 1865. He {{afterward}} resumed using his given name, James Hickok. Most newspapers <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as William Haycock until 1869. Military records after 1865 list him as Hickok but note that he was also known as Haycock.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} years of his {{military}} career Campbell was also a successful amateur National Hunt jockey, winning a number of major races; foremost amongst these was the Grand National of 1896, on The Soarer, which gave him his nickname in subsequent years (though his divisional staff <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Barbara, for reasons now lost). He continued riding in military meets until the end of his army service. He was also a keen cricketer and polo player.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Twin Peaks began the trend of {{accomplished}} cinematography now commonplace in today's television dramas. Lynch and Frost maintained tight control over the first season, handpicking all of the directors, including some Lynch had known from his days at the American Film Institute (e.g., Caleb Deschanel and Tim Hunter) and some <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by those he knew personally. Lynch and Frost's control lessened in the second season, corresponding with what is generally regarded as {{a decrease in the}} show's quality once the identity of Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed.|$|E
25|$|A lifelong Gilbert and Sullivan fan, in 1975, Wilson {{joined the}} Board of Trustees of the D'Oyly Carte Trust at the {{invitation}} of Sir Hugh Wontner, who was then the Lord Mayor of London. At Christmas 1978, Wilson appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special. Eric Morecambe's habit of appearing not to recognise the guest stars was repaid by Wilson, who <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> throughout as 'Morry-camby' (the mis-pronunciation of Morecambe's name made by Ed Sullivan when the pair appeared on his famous American television show). Wilson appeared on the show again in 1980.|$|E

5000|$|David Bowie as Emperor Maltazard (also {{known as}} the Evil M, Maltazard the Evil, or Malthazar the Cursed), antagonist. Although the film <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Malthazar, {{his name in the}} book was Malthazard and some film {{versions}} <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as Maltazard. For the Japanese release, he is voiced by Gackt who is also a singer and actor.|$|R
