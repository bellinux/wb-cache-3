The hydraulic pumping machinery, propelling the river water {{to the top of the}} hill that borders the Seine, was constructed across from the left arm of the river, a little below the small village of La Chaussée, downstream of Bougival. A dam at Bezons on the right arm creates a hydraulic head measuring 3.1 meters (10 feet 2 inches) high to power the wheels of the Machine de Marly. The upper <b>pumping</b> <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> (demolished) was located next to the Château des Eaux (1700) and pumped water to the top of the Louveciennes aqueduct, which fed the Louveciennes and Marly reservoirs, near the site of the Château de Marly (demolished).|$|R

The original design called for 12 <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> with 4 <b>pumps</b> each, but <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 5 held in reserve. <b>Pump</b> <b>Stations</b> 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min).

This paper mainly {{introduces}} {{that the}} overall simulation and numerical calculation model which includes the system of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> and groundwork is built to study the concrete structure of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> with 3 -D finite element software Marc. By undertaking a study on stress and deformation of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> structure and combining the living example, {{the root cause of}} cracks is raised. By calculating and studying, the overall strength and displacement of structure can be reflected more intuitively and accurately with the method of 3 -D finite element. 1 Raise the question <b>Pumping</b> <b>station</b> as an essential part of water project has been widely applied in the agriculture and industry and water conservancy projects. It can be expected that <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> will be more widely used in the different areas of national economy with the modernization of industrial and agricultural production. However, with the multistage <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> <b>pumping</b> water, flood control and industrial needs of the business process, requirements on the safety and reliability of <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> project is also rising.

40|$|In {{the thesis}} we {{displayed}} an automation of an industrial facility on {{an example of}} a water <b>pumping</b> <b>station.</b> We described the structure of a typical automated system and presented it's key components. We designed a water <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> with three main components – a water pump, a reservoir and a drain. The proposed water <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> could be used for suplying water to a small settlement, in case the settlement had access to a water source with adequate capacity in it's vicinity. As part of the thesis we developed a programme for Allen-Bradley's CompactLogix 5370 controller, which operates the <b>pumping</b> <b>station.</b> We built a supervisory system, which communicates with the controller through OPC standards and records the key parameters of the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> to the database. Finally we created a report system that shows the operation of the water <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> within a selected time frame. We tested the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> with an all-day simulation and analysed it's results at the end of it...|$|R
