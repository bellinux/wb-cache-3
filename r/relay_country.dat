50|$|There {{are various}} bands on which {{televisions}} operate {{depending upon the}} country. The VHF and UHF signals in bands III to V are generally used.

Band II is used for FM radio transmissions. Higher frequencies behave more like light and do not penetrate buildings or travel around obstructions well enough to be used in a conventional broadcast TV system, so they are generally only used for MMDS and satellite television, which uses frequencies from 2 to 12 GHz.
