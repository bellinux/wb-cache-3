40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present a proof of [Corollary 11. 3, P 1], which is stated in the {{following}} theorem. Theorem 1 In dimension 2 round spheres are the only orientable κ-solutions. Conse-quently, <b>round</b> projective <b>planes</b> are the only nonorientable 2 -dimensional κ-solutions. This result plays an important role in analysing structures of 3 -dimensional κ-solutions and hence blow-up singularities of the Ricci flow in dimension 3, as presented in [P 1] and [P 2]. Namely, splitting occurs in various arguments in [P 1] and [P 2] regarding 3 -dimensional κ-solutions, and hence 3 -dimensional κ-solutions lead to 2 -dimensional κ-solutions. On the other hand, in dimension 3, rescaled limits of a solution of the Ricci flow near a blow-up singularity are κ-solutions. In other words, in dimension 3 blow-up singularities of the Ricci flow are modelled by κ-solutions. The proof in [P 1] of [Corrolary 11. 3, P 1] is incomplete. It refers to [H 1] for the statement “round sphere is the only non-flat oriented nonnegatively curved gradient shrinking soliton in dimension two”. But [H 1] discusses only the case of compact surfaces. This paper has been available at the author’s website (www. math. ucsb. edu/∼yer/ 2 dkappa. pdf) and through the website and notes of B.

His followers manifestly did not mean either to upset or shoot him, but inexorably they drove him down, down. At last he was curving and flying a hundred yards or less over the level fields of rice and maize. Ahead of him and dark against the morning sunrise was a village with a very tall and slender campanile and a line of cable bearing metal standards that he could not clear. He stopped his engine abruptly and dropped flat. He may have hoped to get at the bombs when he came down, but his pitiless pursuers drove right over him and shot him as he fell.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{measurements}} in turbulent, single-phase, reacting flows are reviewed. Attention {{is confined}} to nonpremixed flows at the fast reaction limit, which is defined as conditions where rates of reaction are fast enough to maintain local equilibrium. Reactant combinations considered include: hydrogen/air, carbon monoxide/air, hydrogen/fluorine, nitric oxide/ozone, acid/base (in liquids) and the dissociation of nitrogen tetroxide in warm air. Criteria for the fast-reaction limit, {{as well as the}} laminar flamelet concept, are discussed in some detail. Other aspects of measurements in these systems are also discussed, e. g. effects of initial and boundary conditions; types of averaging; and the interpretation of velocity, temperature and other scalar property measurements. Existing measurements in <b>round</b> free jets, <b>plane</b> free shear layers and wall boundary layers are summarized and discussed. Experimental difficulties in controlling hydrodynamic and reaction variables are substantial, even in these relatively simple flows; therefore, no existing data set is completely satisfactory for r definitive evaluation of methods of analyzing turbulent reaction processes at the fast-reaction limit. Recent measurements in round, free-jet, hydrogen/air diffusion flames, using optical diagnostics for structure measurements, come closest to this ideal; therefore, these results are discussed in detail and sources of tabulated data for use during model evaluation are cited...|$|R
