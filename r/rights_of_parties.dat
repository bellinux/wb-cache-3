25|$|Poole v. Fleeger, 36 U.S. 185 (1837) is a 7-to-0 {{ruling by}} the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the states of Kentucky and Tennessee had {{properly}} entered into an agreement establishing a mutual border between the two states. The plaintiffs in the case were granted title to property improperly conveyed {{by the state of}} Tennessee north of this border. In the ruling, the Supreme Court asserted the fundamental right of states and nations to establish their borders regardless of private contract, and made a fundamental statement about the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> to object to a trial court ruling under the rules of civil procedure.|$|E
500|$|The Act {{completely}} {{abolished the}} [...] "Case Stated" [...] procedure {{and other forms}} of judicial interference, replacing it with a limited system of appeal to the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales; it also allowed for exclusion agreements limiting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> to arbitration to appeal to the courts, and gave arbitrators the ability to enforce interlocutory orders. Academics met the Act with a mixed response; while some praised it for bringing English law more into line with that of other nations, others criticised the wording used as unnecessarily complex and hazy. The Act did, in the eyes of some commentators, lead to a shift in judicial policy away from legal certainty and towards a system focused on speed and finality. Having been repealed in its entirety by Section 107(2) of the Arbitration Act 1996, the Act is no longer in force.|$|E

5000|$|International {{humanitarian}} law (IHL) {{is the law}} that regulates the conduct of war (jus in bello). It is that branch of international law which seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict by protecting persons who are not participating in hostilities, and by restricting and regulating the means and methods of warfare available to combatants. IHL is inspired by considerations of humanity and the mitigation of human suffering. [...] "It comprises a set of rules, established by treaty or custom, that seeks to protect persons and property/objects that are (or may be) affected by armed conflict and limits the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> to a conflict to use methods and means of warfare of their choice". It includes [...] "the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions, as well as subsequent treaties, case law, and customary international law." [...] It defines the conduct and responsibilities of belligerent nations, neutral nations, and individuals engaged in warfare, in relation {{to each other and}} to protected persons, usually meaning non-combatants. It is designed to balance humanitarian concerns and military necessity, and subjects warfare to the rule of law by limiting its destructive effect and mitigating human suffering.|$|E
50|$|Habeas corpus {{still remains}} {{a problem for}} the convicts who need to {{participate}} in the hearings on civil jurisdiction. Addressing this issue, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine passed a ruling on 12.04.2012 in the case on constitutional appeal of the citizen A.Troyan concerning official interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of Ukraine. (The case re: equality of parties to the trial). Mr.Troyan approached the CCU seeking official interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of Ukraine concerning the right of an incarcerated convict to be brought to court to participate in the hearing of civil jurisdiction (the equal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> to the lawsuit). The Court responded that “personal participation of a convict serving his/her sentence in a penitentiary institution, as a party to the trial, meets the requirement of complete, comprehensive, objective and un-biased hearing. This participation of a convict, as a party to the cases heard in the courts of all jurisdictions, specializations and instances should be ensured by the respective procedural law. Decision on a convict’s participation as a party to the trial should be made by a court in the order and under conditions determined by the respective procedural law.” Hence the convict has “the equal right to protection of his rights and freedoms in court and to participation in the hearing of his case in the order defined by the respective procedural law in the courts of all jurisdictions, specializations and instances”. So, on the one hand the Court ruled that the convict has the right to participate in the hearing on his case, but only in accordance with the order established by the respective procedural law. But the very core of the problem {{lies in the fact that}} neither civil procedural, nor administrative procedural law properly regulates this matter. That is why the CCU Decision, instead of improving the situation, provided formal grounds for depriving the convicts of their right to participate in the hearings on their cases until the respective procedural law is passed.|$|E
