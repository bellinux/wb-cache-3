40|$|The survey makes five main recommendations, as follows: 1. Develop a {{globally}} comprehensive {{early warning}} system, rooted in existing {{early warning system}}s and capacities A global early warning system will require long-term sustained action by diverse players, strong political commitment to engender public action and to make early warning a core task of national policy and disaster risk reduction strategy, strong international support and coordination, with clear roles and responsibilities and wide participation of NGO, private sector and regional organisations. 2. Build national people-centred early warning systems Country-based early warning systems are needed {{for the protection of}} citizens and also provide the building blocks of the global early warning system. The recommendation includes calls for a national multi-party roundtable on early warning, a national plan based on a survey of capabilities, a warning dissemination strategy, community-based approaches, public education and mock exercises. 3. Fill the main gaps in global early warning capacities The recommendation highlights gaps and opportunities that deserve immediate concerted action, including for tropical cyclones, floods and tsunamis for the most ill-protected populations, agreements and networking for drought, food security and wildland fire, a global survey and mobile monitoring facility for volcanoes and a major early warning project in each least-developed country. 4. Strengthen the scientific and data foundations for early warning The scientific and technical recommendation seeks action on a long-term global data plan, upgraded telecommunications, an agreement on basin-wide data exchange for floods, a pan-African project to fill major data gaps, improved hazard and vulnerability mapping, an early warning science and technology agenda and an internet portal for natural hazards, <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>warnings.</b> 5. Develop the institutional foundations for a global early warning system This recommendation addresses the needs for underpinning mechanisms of international and regional governance, coordination and support, starting with a call for the UN system to affirm the goal of a global early warning system and including requests for various UN and international agencies in technical, humanitarian and development fields to undertake specific governance and support roles.

40|$|Background Stroke {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death globally. Awareness of stroke {{modifiable}} <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs are important for stroke prevention. Objectives To assess hypertensive patients’ knowledge regarding lifestyle <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs of stroke. Method A descriptive study was conducted on 114 hypertension patients who attended chronic disease center in Sulaimani city. The study was carried out for the period of February to April 2015. A questionnaire has been used to collect relative data about patients’ characteristics and knowledge regarding lifestyle <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs of stroke. Data were analysed through SPSS 20, and descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage and mean) and inferential statistics (F-test and t-test), the figure of p > 0. 05 was considered as the statistical significant. Result Patients’ knowledge regarding stroke lifestyle <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> stroke <b>warning</b> signs were low of 55. 3 and 76. 3 % respectively. Physical inactivity has lower (17. 5) percentage among lifestyle risk factors. The patients’ knowledge was influenced by patients’ age, gender, education levels and duration of hypertension (p > 0. 05). Conclusions Hypertensive patients complained from lack of knowledge regarding stroke lifestyle <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs. Physical inactivity was less identified risk factors. Young, female, high level of education and longer duration of disease tended to have higher knowledge.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the level of}} knowledge regarding <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs for stroke and heart attack among White and African American adults in Michigan and to quantify racial disparities. METHODS: Knowledge of stroke <b>and</b> heart attack <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs was assessed by {{using data from the}} 2004 Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. Prevalence estimates of knowledge were generated, and statistical differences in knowledge between Whites and African Americans were assessed. Adequate knowledge was defined as knowing 3 correct warning signs or risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to quantify the racial disparity in knowledge while controlling for potential confounding. RESULTS: Whites had substantially higher levels of adequate knowledge of risk factors (stroke: 31. 6 % vs 13. 8 %; heart attack: 52. 6 % vs 24. 3 %) <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> signs (stroke: 30. 0 % vs 17. 2 %; heart attack: 29. 3 % vs 13. 8 %) compared with African Americans (all observed differences were significant at P <. 05).

40|$|Purpose: Stroke {{education}} modules {{have been}} added to medical school curriculums to improve stroke knowledge in graduate physicians, and this has resulted in positive outcomes. These findings suggest that similar strategies may be successful in graduate programs such as Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of multiple stroke-related education opportunities on students enrolled in CSD programs. Methods: Seventy-six first and second year students enrolled in a Communication Sciences and Disorders program completed a survey of stroke <b>risk</b> factors <b>and</b> early <b>warning</b> signs of stroke. Results: Risk factor knowledge - 97 % identified smoking as a risk factor; 61 % identified diabetes; 90 % identified high cholesterol; 84 % identified age, and 90 % identified physical inactivity. Students varied in their recognition of diabetes as a stroke risk factor based on their level of instruction. Early <b>warning</b> signs <b>and</b> first response knowledge - 83 % recognized sudden confusion or trouble speaking; 100 % recognized sudden facial, arm or leg weakness; 83 % recognized sudden vision loss; 76 % recognized sudden trouble walking; and 75 % recognized sudden headache as early warning signs of stroke. Seventy-nine percent recognized calling 9 - 1 - 1 as the appropriate first action. Students varied in their recognition of sudden trouble walking and severe headache as an early warning sign of stroke based on their level of instruction.

With {{the development of new}} and enhanced technology, weather forecasting skills have improved significantly in the United States and internationally (NRC, 1999 and 2003). However, weather forecasting is a probabilistic science and many uncertainties still remain (see NSF, 2002). Indeed, despite significant improvements in our ability to predict the weather in the short- and long-term, recent experiences with natural hazards show that we continue to confront important challenges regarding lead times, false alarm rates, the accuracy and reliability of the information that is being communicated, and our ability to elicit the appropriate response from the public. As lead time in issuing severe weather warnings to threatened populations increases with improvements in weather monitoring, detection, and mass communication technology, the social and organizational features of integrated warning systems become paramount as key factors in saving lives and reducing damages to property. There is a need to continue to expand our knowledge regarding how people and organizations perceive and react to weather forecasts <b>and</b> <b>warnings.</b> This knowledge must be integrated with other technical information on weather forecasts already available so as to make weather information more useful to society. This paper explores the role of technology, the media, and interdisciplinary research in the communication of <b>warnings,</b> <b>risk,</b> <b>and</b> disaster information. We also focus on how researchers can communicate the importance, value, and contribution of hazard and disaster research to the end-user community, including emergency management organizations and the general public.

The Suicide Behaviours Questionnaire – Revised (SBQ-R; see Appendix C) was used to group participants as suicide-risk or non-suicidal. 401 participants were identified as suicide-risk. Analyses investigated group differences in <b>risk</b> perceptions <b>and</b> behaviours in suicide-risk <b>and</b> non-suicidal participants. <b>Risk</b> behaviour differences were also examined for participants who scored highly on an SBQ-R item relating to future suicidal intent, in order to identify potential proximal warning signs.

The tools available for the development of this discourse, for both flood warnings in real time and generalized FRM communications, are outlined. It is argued that the contested ownership of the articulation of uncertainties embedded in flood risk communications could be reduced by the development of a formally structured translational discourse between science and professionals in FRM, through which process “codes of practice” for uncertainty estimation in different application areas can be developed. Ways in which this might take place in an institutional context are considered...|$|R

In the strict orthodoxy of the efficient market theory, crashes must {{be due to}} sudden changes of the fundamental valuation of assets. However, detailed empirical studies suggest that large price jumps cannot be explained by news and {{are the result of}} endogenous feedback loops. Although plausible, a clear-cut empirical evidence for such a scenario is still lacking. Here we show how crashes are conditioned by the market liquidity, for which we propose a new measure inspired by recent theories of market impact and based on readily available, public information. Our results open the possibility of a dynamical evaluation of liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> early <b>warning</b> signs of market instabilities, and could lead to a quantitative description of the mechanisms leading to market crashes...|$|R
