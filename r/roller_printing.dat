50|$|Fancy fabrics {{in general}} are cheap, industrially {{produced}} imitations of the wax prints and are based on industry print. Fancy fabrics are also called imiwax, Java <b>print,</b> <b>roller</b> <b>print,</b> le fancy or le légos. These fabrics are produced for mass consumption and stand for ephemerality and caducity. Fancy Fabrics are more intense and rich in colors than wax prints and are printed on only one side.|$|R
50|$|Before {{printing}} it {{is essential}} to strain or sieve all colours in order to free them from lumps, fine sand, and other impurities, which would inevitably damage the highly polished surface of the engraved rollers and result in bad printing. Every scratch on the surface of a <b>roller</b> <b>prints</b> a fine line on the cloth, and too much care, therefore, cannot be taken to remove, as far as possible, all grit and other hard particles from every colour.|$|R
25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} <b>roller</b> <b>printing</b> over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect.|$|E
2500|$|Innovations in <b>roller</b> <b>printing</b> on {{textiles}} introduced {{new dress}} fabrics. [...] Rich colors {{such as the}} Turkey red of the 1820s were still found, but delicate floral prints on light backgrounds were increasingly popular. [...] More precise printing eliminated the need for dark outlines on printed designs, and new green dyes appeared in patterns of grasses, ferns, and unusual florals. [...] Combinations of florals and stripes were fashionable.|$|E

50|$|Check {{scanners}} {{are used}} by banks or business through remote deposit capture programs to take a digital image of the check and send {{the information to the}} bank for deposit. This is where the image of a check on your bank statement originates. If a check scanner is not properly cleaned financial institutions risk increased transaction failures, equipment malfunctions, personnel costs to reconcile poor images, equipment repair or exchange and non-compliance due to poor image quality. A cleaning card designed to clean a specific model of check scanner is run through the device the same way the operator would run a check through the device. The cleaning card makes contact with the optical lenses, micr reader, transport belts and <b>rollers,</b> <b>print</b> heads and clears the check path.|$|R

50|$|Böttcher America was {{established}} in 1982, when the German firm Felix Böttcher GmbH & Co. purchased Harrigan Rollers located in Baltimore, Maryland. Harrigan Rollers was a company dealing in <b>rollers,</b> <b>printing</b> blankets and maintenance products but without a plant of its own. Five years later, a Böttcher America production plant was built at a new site in Belcamp, Maryland. The company also set-up numerous sales offices throughout the continental United States. Building extensions {{were made to the}} Belcamp location in 1994 and 1996. Two more production plants were opened in Indianapolis and Tipton, Indiana in 1997. In 2003, the company opened another manufacturing facility in Yuma, Arizona. Since 2000, Böttcher America continues to expand its facilities with chemical manufacturing and blanket conversions. Böttcher America is also in charge of Böttcher Canada and Böttcher Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Böttcher America today {{manufactures}} {{and sells}} {{materials for the}} <b>printing</b> industry: <b>printing</b> <b>rollers,</b> <b>printing</b> blankets, and printing chemicals such as press washes, fountain solutions, and printing aids. These products {{can be used for}} a variety of markets (offset printing, rotogravure, flexography and digital printing).Böttcher America can supply rollers to customers as either “exchange” or “recover”. The “Roller Recover Program” allows customers to send Böttcher America used rollers to be recovered with new rubber. A customer can also order rollers through the “Exchange Roller Program” and a press-ready roller will be shipped. The customer is billed for the rubber only and has 60 days to return the core(s).Böttcher is the OEM roller supplier to the major sheet-fed press manufacturers including Heidelberg, MAN Roland, KBA, Komori and Mitsubishi.Böttcher America has won two awards for its products. In 1993, the company won a GATF award in recognition of the glaze free rollers technology (79 Series Rubber Compounds). In 2005, Böttcher America won a new PIA/GATF award for its Chameleon rubber roller compound which enables printers to switch freely among different inks (conventional, UV or hybrid) without changing <b>printing</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The perrotine is a block-printing machine {{invented by}} Perrot of Rouen in 1834, and {{practically}} speaking {{is the only}} successful mechanical device ever introduced for this purpose. For some reason or other it has rarely been used in England, but its value was almost immediately recognized on the Continent, and although block printing of all sorts has been replaced to such an enormous extent by <b>roller</b> <b>printing,</b> the perrotine is still largely employed in French, German and Italian works.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>printing</b> {{was highly}} productive, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being {{commonly}} printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine. It is capable of reproducing every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving to the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing with repeats from 1 in to 80 inches. It is precise, so each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place without faulty joints at the points of repetition.|$|E

The fabric is manufactured in various colours including the original indigo, chocolate brown and red, {{in a large}} variety of designs including florals, stripes, and diamond, square and circular geometric patterns. The intricate designs are made using picotage, a pinning fabric printing technique rarely used by contemporary fabric manufacturers due to its complexity and expense, although the design effects have been replicated using modern fabric printing techniques.|$|E

40|$|In {{the latest}} type of gravure {{printing}} machines {{referred to as}} the shaft-less drive system, each gravure <b>printing</b> <b>roller</b> is driven by an individual servo motor, and all motors are electrically synchronized. The register error is regulated by a speed difference between the adjacent <b>printing</b> <b>rollers.</b> In order to improve the control accuracy of register system, an accurate mathematical model of the register system should be investigated for the latest machines. Therefore, the mathematical model of the machine directional register (MDR) system is studied for the multicolor gravure printing machines in this paper. According to the definition of the MDR error, the model is derived, and then it is validated by the numerical simulation and experiments carried out in the experimental setup of the four-color gravure printing machines. The results show that the established MDR system model is accurate and reliable...|$|R

50|$|Vlisco Group {{was founded}} in 1846, when Pieter Fentener van Vlissingen bought an {{existing}} textile printing factory and named it P. Fentener van Vlissingen & co., aiming to produce and sell hand printed fabrics in- {{and outside of the}} Netherlands. Originally, production included handkerchiefs, bedspreads, chintz and furniture fabrics. In {{the second half of the}} 19th century, Fentener van Vlissingen started exporting imitation batiks to what was then called the Dutch East Indies after he was told by his uncle that there was a pressing need for affordable fabrics. Thanks to the invention of <b>roller</b> <b>printing,</b> it was possible to recreate the batik look a lot less labour-intensively, which meant that Fentener van Vlissingen could produce it quicker and sell it cheaper than local craftsmen could. This was also its only selling point, as the Indonesians did not care for the too even look of the imitation batiks.|$|E
