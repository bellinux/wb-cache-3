50|$|The DBRS {{short-term}} debt rating scale provides {{an opinion on}} the risk that an issuer will not meet its short-term financial obligations in a timely manner. Ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer and the relative <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> The R-1 and R-2 rating categories are further denoted by the subcategories “(high)”, “(middle)”, and “(low)”.|$|E
50|$|The DBRS {{long-term}} {{rating scale}} provides {{an opinion on}} the risk of default. That is, the risk that an issuer will fail to satisfy its financial obligations {{in accordance with the}} terms under which an obligations has been issued. Ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer, and the relative <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> All rating categories other than AAA and D also contain subcategories “(high)” and “(low)”. The absence of either a “(high)” or “(low)” designation indicates the rating {{is in the middle of}} the category. DBRS’s scale is similar to the ones used by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, though it uses (high) and (low) instead of “+” and “-“ symbols like S&P and Fitch use.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the (contractual) subordination <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in Belgian insolvency law. Based on the functional comparative law method (The Netherlands, France, UK and US), the research aims to qualify the subordination <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and to analyse its validity and enforceability vis-à-vis third parties. The research has demonstrated that: 1. A basic distinction {{needs to be made}} between subordination agreements that aim to modify the <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> the junior <b>claim</b> in insolvency proceedings and subordination agreements that create an order of payment outside insolvency proceedings without affectingthe <b>rank</b> <b>of</b> the junior <b>claim.</b> 2. The effects of subordination depend upon the structure of the subordination agreement. 3. Contractual subordination is valid and does not infringe the pari passu or paritas creditorum rule. 4. Third parties, i. e. other creditors who do not benefit from the subordination areheld to recognise the effects of the subordination between the junior and the senior; 5. In insolvency proceedings such as bankruptcy proceedings, the trustee or administrator is held to give effect to contractual subordination agreements. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The task {{of modern}} {{political}} economy is made more difficult by the confusion surrounding the <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> competing <b>claims</b> {{in the social}} order. This paper is about situating particular interests within the broader <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> society. Using Catholic social thought's universal access principle, overlapping claims for economic resources are weighed according to the unmet needs of the contending parties {{in the following order}} of importance: (1) as constitutive for physical survival and basic health, (2) as determinative of life prospects, and (3) as life-enhancing. The finer specification of superfluous income into this threefold tpology opens the door to a more nuanced application of distributive justivce where norms grow stricter and the tolerance for inequality becomes much narrower as the strength <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> grows in proportion to the urgency of unmet needs. The contribution of this paper lies in its refinement of the concept of superflkuous income by distingushing varying degrees of unmet needs through a typology that provides terms of reference that are specified in their function, in their theological warrants and in the strength <b>of</b> their <b>claims.</b> Catholic social thought, superfluous income, universal access principle, unmet needs, distributive justice,...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} as to whether aggrieved shareholders should rank equally with creditors in cases of insolvency involving illegal or misleading conduct sits at the crossroads of both insolvency and securities law. Important questions arise at this juncture concerning the fairness, certainty, transparency and efficiency of the treatment <b>of</b> such <b>claims</b> when in competition with creditor <b>claims.</b> In Sons <b>of</b> Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1 the High Court allowed shareholders to rank equally with unsecured creditors in insolvency cases involving illegal or misleading behaviour, flying in the face of traditional perceptions of the distinction between debt and equity, and the primacy historically accorded to creditors upon insolvency.

40|$|This {{demonstration}} presents Apollo, a new sensor {{information processing}} tool for uncovering likely facts in noisy participatory sensing data 1. Participatory sensing, where users proactively document {{and share their}} observations, has received significant attention {{in recent years as}} a paradigm for crowd-sourcing observation tasks. However, it poses interesting challenges in assessing confidence in the information received. By borrowing clustering and ranking tools from data mining literature, we show how to group data into sets (or claims), corroborating specific events or observations, then iteratively assess both claim and source credibility, ultimately leading to a <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> described <b>claims</b> by their likelihoold of occurrence. Apollo belongs to a category of tools called fact-finders. It is the first fact-finder designed and implemented specifically for participatory sensing. Apollo uses Twitter as the underlying engine for sharing participatory sensing data. Twitter is widely popular, can be interfaced to cell-phones that share sensor data, and comes with a powerful search API, as well as a publish-subscribe mechanism. We evaluate it using a participatory sensing application that collects and posts noisy vehicular traffic data on Twitter, as well as a set of 60, 000 (human) tweets collected during the Haiti tsunami and a set of 500, 000 tweets collected about Cairo during its recent unrest. Viewers of the demonstration will interact with Apollo for various fact-finding tasks...|$|R

40|$|In theory, {{information}} from the prices <b>of</b> bank <b>claims</b> {{could be used as}} a complement to off-site surveillance in bank supervision. Unfortunately, the vast majority of banks do not issue claims that are actively traded in secondary markets.

Indeed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) was designed to impose more of the cost of failures on this class of claimants. We construct an accounting proxy for the default premiums on jumbo CDs that we use to rank banks by the probability that they will experience serious financial problems during future periods. We compare the accuracy <b>of</b> this <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> banks to a <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> banks derived from a conventional early warning model.

40|$|Subordination {{agreements}} among creditors {{are common}} in financial transactions. When a company seeks additional credit, the new lender may insist on an agreement with existing creditors which provides that their right to payment will be subordinated to the full payment of the new loan. The existing creditors {{may be willing to}} sign such an agreement for the purpose of encouraging the new lender to provide the borrower with liquidity needed to continue the business as a profitable venture, thereby increasing the likelihood that the borrower will meet all future financial obligations. In addition, contractual subordination is used frequently in connection with the issuance of debt securities. The level of priority of the debt securities, whether senior or junior, will directly affect their interest rate and market price. In general, contractual subordination will be respected in the event the borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Section 510 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. ” Unless a bankruptcy court rearranges priorities based on equitable principles, known as equitable subordination, or the class of senior creditors effectively waives the benefits of the subordination agreement by voting to accept a chapter 11 plan in which they give up their rights to junior creditors, the subordination agreement controls the <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> prebankruptcy <b>claims</b> against the bankruptcy estate. In addition to using subordination agreements to achieve priority over other creditors with respect to the payment <b>of</b> their <b>claims,</b> senior creditors also use them to obtain other rights from junior creditors. In particular, subordination agreements have included provisions that give the senior creditor the right to cast the junior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s vote to either accept or reject a plan of reorganization in the event the borrower is in chapter 11. These provisions effectively give a senior creditor two votes; it may vote with respect to its own claim and may vote again with respect to the subordinated claim. Senior creditors have argued that these provisions should be enforceable as a matter of contract, but junior creditors, wishing to vote on a chapter 11 plan despite the contractual provision, have argued that the enforcement of these provisions would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code granting voting rights only to the holders <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> This article will examine how courts have dealt with these voting rights provisions found in subordination agreements...|$|R
