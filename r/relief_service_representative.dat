40|$|Funding of <b>Relief</b> <b>Services</b> for Handicapped Children in the Liberec Region The {{theoretical}} part, {{divided into}} eight chapters, defines the following concepts: {{family of a}} handicapped child and society, <b>relief</b> <b>services,</b> domestic public sources to fund <b>relief</b> <b>services,</b> care subsidy, European sources to fund the <b>relief</b> <b>service</b> projects in 2007 [...] 2013, funding <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> by corporate sponsors, funding <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> through foundations and foundation funds, other sources to fund <b>relief</b> <b>services.</b> The objective of the thesis is to summarize the system, possibilities and forms of funding of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> for handicapped children in the Liberec Region. Within my research, I applied the combination of semi-controlled interviews with the <b>relief</b> <b>service</b> providers and semi-controlled interviews with handicapped childrens parents. I also performed content analysis of documents. The semi-controlled interviews with the <b>relief</b> <b>service</b> providers showed that {{the current status of}} funding of the organizations providing <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> is not systematic. The results of the semi-controlled interviews with handicapped childrens parents indicate that the parents taking care of handicapped children in the Liberec Region barely use <b>relief</b> <b>services.</b> The interviewed parents do not distinguish between <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> and the other types of social services, do not know the organizations providing <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> in the Liberec Region and do not have even a vague idea of service costs. The research results lead to three hypotheses: the <b>relief</b> <b>service</b> providers in the Liberec Region must learn to utilize strategically both domestic and foreign financial resources. The <b>relief</b> <b>service</b> providers in the Liberec Region have the opportunity to start a long-term cooperation with corporate and individual sponsors. Handicapped childrens parents do not distinguish between <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> and the other types of social <b>services.</b> Keywords: <b>relief</b> <b>services,</b> social service providers, family, handicapped, handicapped child, Liberec Region, funding, financial resources...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} has been to propose a model <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> {{facility}} for senior citizens in the region Trhové Sviny {{on the basis of}} results of an analysis of the regions potential and needs. The current offer of services for seniors has been identified, including the possible necessity of extending this offer by facilities providing <b>relief</b> <b>services.</b> The non-governmental organisation Borůvka, Borovany providing <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> to families with handicapped children would welcome an expansion of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> and therefore {{it is likely that the}} project will be implemented in co-operation with this non-governmental organisation. In the theoretical part, the target group of the model facility is described first. Good knowledge of the recipients of the service [...] in this case senior citizens [...] is a basic prerequisite for creating adequate services. Furthermore, social services that are suitable for seniors are described in this part, with a special focus on <b>relief</b> <b>services.</b> The history of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> has been mentioned, including their models, forms and the contents of these services. The family and the senior are also described here. The practical part describes the current offer of services for seniors in the region Trhové Sviny. A SWOT analysis for the proposed facility has been processed in this part. Furthermore, the characteristics of the model facility and its operation are described in detail in the practical part so that the facility could be created. This part contains the details of the projects aim, sphere of activity, characteristics of the target group and specific description of individual services, methods and forms of work in the facility, staffing, possible sources of financing and expected expenses and the technical solution of the entire project. This thesis should serve as a manual for the implementing the new <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> facility, which should be created in the future in co-operation with the non-governmental organisation Borůvka, Borovany. Moreover, this thesis provides a complex overview of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> in general and it may serve as full information source for the general public...|$|R
