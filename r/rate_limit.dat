40|$|One {{class of}} worm defense {{techniques}} that received attention of late is to "rate limit" outbound traffic to contain fast spreading worms. Several proposals of <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> techniques {{have appeared in}} the literature, each with a different take on the impetus behind <b>rate</b> <b>limiting.</b> This paper presents an empirical analysis on different <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> schemes using real traffic and attack traces from a sizable network. In the analysis we isolate and investigate the impact of the critical parameters for each scheme and seek to understand how these parameters might be set in realistic network settings. Analysis shows that using DNS-based <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> has substantially lower error rates than schemes based on other traffic statistics. The analysis additionally brings to light a number of issues with respect to <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> at large. We explore the impact of these issues in the context of general worm containment...|$|R

2500|$|Initial {{figures for}} the rate cap of Leicester City Council would have {{required}} it to lower rates by 57%, a level which council leader Peter Soulsby described as [...] "savage treatment". However, later figures allowed the council to include an additional £3.7m in its budget. On 7 March 1985 the council approved a budget of £30,650,000 (significantly over the cap), but not a rate to go with it; the motion also told the Secretary of State that if the <b>rate</b> <b>limit</b> and grant penalties were withdrawn, the council could set a rate rise lower than the rate of inflation. Although this vote was unanimous, the Labour leadership soon decided {{that there was no}} point in holding out. The council came under pressure not to give in, with a letter from the 'West End Rate-Capping Campaign Group' sent to each councillor urging them to continue to set no rate, and a petition of 2,000 presented to the council opposing rate-capping by Mrs Megan Armstrong who urged the council to defy the Government even if it meant breaking the law. From the other side, the Conservative group on Leicestershire County Council attempted to get their authority to initiate a judicial review as Leicester collected and passed on its precept; the attempt failed as the Liberal group opposed it.|$|E

At first, a general survey about the problem is given. The state-of-the-art regarding the methods for prediction and alleviation of potential problems are presented. The established frequency domain criteria based on linear aircraft models are investigated. A method for calculation of nonlinear closed loop system describing functions is derived and applied to highly augmented aircraft with <b>rate</b> <b>limiting.</b> Based on these investigations a new design criterion is developed to predict Flying Qualities problems due to <b>rate</b> <b>limiting.</b> The criterion is verified by means of evaluating different characteristic aircraft configurations.

Finally, the application potential of the new criterion for optimising flight control systems considering <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> is demonstrated. (orig.)
