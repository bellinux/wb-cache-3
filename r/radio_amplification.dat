5000|$|In {{his long}} career, Everitt was a radar pioneer {{and author of}} basic texts on radio {{engineering}} and communication. He invented automatic telephone equipment, a [...] "time compressor" [...] to accelerate recorded speech, high-power <b>radio</b> <b>amplification,</b> a frequency modulation radio altimeter, and several antenna matching and feeding systems. His textbook Communications Engineering, first published in 1932, was a classic in the field.|$|E
5000|$|The Neutrodyne {{receiver}}, {{invented in}} 1922 by Louis Hazeltine, was a TRF receiver with a [...] "neutralizing" [...] circuit added to each <b>radio</b> <b>amplification</b> stage {{to cancel the}} feedback to prevent the oscillations which caused the annoying whistles in the TRF. [...] In the neutralizing circuit a capacitor fed a feedback current from the plate circuit to the grid circuit which was 180° out of phase with the feedback which caused the oscillation, canceling it. [...] The Neutrodyne was popular until the advent of cheap tetrode tubes around 1930.|$|E

30|$|RRHs {{transmit}} the RF signals to UEs, {{and they are}} responsible for <b>radio</b> frequency (RF) <b>amplification,</b> filtering, and A/D and D/A conversion. As most of the processing functions are executed in the BBU pool, RRHs are relatively simple and can be widely deployed in a cost-efficient manner.|$|R
50|$|Although the 807 is {{used for}} both audio amplification, (usually class AB, and <b>radio</b> {{frequency}} <b>amplification</b> in the 1-30 MHz range, (usually class C), this type was usually used for the latter.This tube/valve is a pentode with a 'directly heated cathode', meaning that the cathode consists of an emissive oxide coated filament. These features suggest the 4307A could predate and is contemporary with, the 807 which is a beam power tetrode, a more advanced design with a more linear transfer characteristic and a more complex 'indirectly heated cathode'.|$|R
50|$|The {{autodyne}} circuit was {{an improvement}} to <b>radio</b> signal <b>amplification</b> using the De Forest Audion vacuum tube amplifier. By allowing the tube to oscillate at a frequency slightly {{different from the}} desired signal, the sensitivity over other receivers was greatly improved. The autodyne circuit was invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong of Columbia University, New York, NY. He inserted a tuned circuit in the output circuit of the Audion vacuum tube amplifier. By adjusting the tuning of this tuned circuit, Armstrong was able to dramatically increase the gain of the Audion amplifier. Further increase in tuning resulted in the Audion amplifier reaching self-oscillation.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Optomechanical {{systems have}} enabled {{wide-band}} optical frequency conversion and multichannel all-optical <b>radio</b> frequency <b>amplification.</b> Realization of an on-chip silicon communication platform {{is limited by}} photodetectors needed to convert optical information to electrical signals for further signal processing. In this paper we present a coupled silicon microresonator, which converts near-IR optical intensity modulation at 174. 2 MHz and 1. 198 GHz into motional electrical current. This device emulates a photodetector which detects intensity modulation of continuous wave laser light in the full-width-at-half-maximum bandwidth of the mechanical resonance. The resonant principle of operation eliminates dark current challenges associated with convetional photodetectors. While the results presented here constitute a purely classical demonstration, the device can also potentially be extended to the quantum regime to realize a photon−phonon translator...|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, GE {{engineers}} {{added an}} NPN transistor companion to the 2N107. They designated it the 2N170, manufactured with the rate grown junction process originally developed by Bell Labs. It {{was designed for}} use in higher frequency applications, such as <b>radio</b> frequency (RF) <b>amplification,</b> while the 2N107 was for low frequency audio amplifier applications. The 2N170 was priced slightly higher than the 2N107. The 2N170 was a fallout from the 2N167, 2N168 and 2N169 transistor lines. In the 1950s, General Electric distinguished their PNP and NPN transistors by their case styles. PNP transistors had the round, black [...] "top hat" [...] style body, while NPN transistors had oval, black [...] "top hats".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an L-Band (f 0 = 1. 575 GHz) high power and efficient solid state power amplifier (SSPA) designed for the European satellite navigation system (i. e. Galileo). The amplifier, developed in the framework of the European Project named SLOGAN, exploits the GH 50 - 10 GaN technology available at United Monolithic Semiconductor foundry. The aim of the project is to offer, using as much as possible European technologies, a valid alternative to replace traveling wave tube amplifiers with more compact and reliable systems. All the SSPA functionalities, i. e. power supply, power conditioning and <b>radio</b> frequency <b>amplification,</b> are integrated in the developed architecture and accommodated in a single box with limited volume and mass. The required output power level is achieved by parallelizing several GaN die power bars of 12 and/or 25. 6 mm. In continuous wave operating mode, the overall SSPA delivers an output power higher than 250 W at less than 2 dB of gain compression in the whole E 1 -band. Moreover, the registered gain and efficiency are higher than 67 dB and 54 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on piezoceramic stack actuators, a stage (dimension of 50 × 50 × 11 mm) with a {{symmetric}} displacement magnifying {{mechanism is}} studied in this paper. FEM simulations {{are carried out}} to reveal {{the performance of the}} micropositioning stage and the <b>amplification</b> <b>radio</b> of the flexure hinge of the stage is 4. 76. The working mode of the flexure hinge is also simulated by finite element method, and its natural frequency is 3291 Hz. A series of tests about piezoceramic stack actuators have been done, including static, dynamic and temperature tests. The experimental results are identical to the theoretical analysis and give help to the application of piezoceramic stack actuators. It can also help the precise micropositioning stage driven by PZT to achieve higher positioning accuracy and resolution...|$|R
40|$|The possibiliry of {{observable}} reconlbination lines below 200 MHz {{is shown}} to be greatest for the case of negative absorption in low-density gas in front of strong <b>radio</b> sources. The <b>amplification</b> of background radiation can conceivably exceed 100 per cent, especially when the electron temperature is low; {{on the other hand}} if the temperature is sufficiently high, dielectronic recombination may give rise to detectable recombination lines from elements other than hydrogen. The optimum frequencies are in the range 50 - 200 MHz for the interstellar medium, and 1 - 100 MHz for such intergalactic matter as may exist. The effects of external radiation fields, thermal and nonthermal, are explored quantitatively and the rele- vant b,-factors computed for a 1000 -level atom; it is found that even the general galactic radiation field will significantly alter the atomic level populations. Obser- vations of these masing low-frequency lecombination lines would be useful in sorting out the hot and cold components of the interstellar medium, and in investigating their properties...|$|R
5000|$|American Piano Company (abbr. Ampico) was an American piano {{manufacturer}} eventually {{located in}} East Rochester, New York. The company {{was formed in}} a merger of Chickering & Sons of Boston, Wm Knabe & Co, of Baltimore and Foster Armstrong of Rochester, New York. It was formed {{in response to the}} increasing demand for player pianos, and, as well, the then current impetus towards larger economic entities and aimed at the achievement of economies of scale. The company was established in the period from 1907-1908 and in 1908 floated a prospectus and offering for shares under the name [...] "American Piano Company." [...] After the merger the individual units of the company, especially Chickering & Sons and Knabe continued production of their designs at their factories in Boston and Baltimore, along with lesser known lines. Design collaboration of the expertise of both factories, particularly, and, others as well, led to a refinement of designs and new products with more modern characteristics such as bent rims, more conventional actions, and, in general, more suitability for the addition of player mechanisms. In response to the increasing demand for smaller pianos Chickering had already been producing its line of [...] "quarter grands", introduced around 1902-3, enjoying robust sales of these lines as well. [...] The company flourished in the teens and early twenties, acquiring Mason & Hamlin in 1924, eventually, owning 9 piano factories scattered around {{the eastern part of the}} US and, building on the expertise of Chickering and Knabe, producing an impressive suite of modified designs, suitable for players. However, the demand for pianos began to rapidly weaken in the early twenties with the introduction of <b>radio</b> and electronic <b>amplification</b> of records, until then only of the acoustic, Victrola type. [...] Forseeing the ongoing collapse of the industry, the President of Ampico, a gentleman named Foster, sold his common stock to Bankers' Trust, retaining the preferred. Bankers' Trust installed its own president who altered the companies marketing plan. This substitution of the preexisting marketing approach, at that point sucessful, by the new one had a drastic effect, along with the contracting market, on sales, eventually resulting in bankruptcy for the company around 1928. These alterations are still considered in business schools to be a classic case of how to ruin a market franchise and still an example held up as a model of what not to do in business. [...] The company emerged from bankruptcy as the American Piano Corporation in 1929. As Foster's holdings were now only preferred stock he had a claim on the assets during the bankruptcy and was brought back to manage the company. Notwithstanding the crash of 1929, the company was profitable for the first two years of the new decade, but the complete crash of the economy as the depression depended forced it into bankruptcy again. A similar, large holding company producing pianos and players brought the company out of bankruptcy once more in a new entity known as the Aeolian-American Corporation and continued the process of consolidation of production in Rochester, New York. Aeolian-American continued in production until 1983 and was liquidated in a bankruptcy in 1985. From 1913 Ampico was one of the leading producers of reproducing pianos, the others being Duo-Art (1913) and Welte-Mignon (1905). The player piano and reproducing mechanism was designed by Charles Fuller Stoddard (1876-1958). A great number of distinguished classical and popular pianists, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943), Leo Ornstein (1892-2002), Winifred MacBride, and Marguerite Volavy (1886-1951), recorded for Ampico, and their rolls are a legacy of 19th and early 20th century aesthetic and musical practice. By 1929 Ampico was in essential economic difficulties and was finally taken over by the Aeolian Company, a manufacturer of player pianos and organs. The combined company, known as Aeolian-American Corp., went through several ownership changes before declaring bankruptcy in 1985.|$|R
