2500|$|The Tlingit {{who chose}} to return were allowed to reside {{in a part of}} the village just below the heavily guarded stockade on [...] "Blockhouse Hill" [...] (an area known as the <b>Ranche</b> until around 1965). Russian cannon were {{constantly}} trained on the natives as a reminder of their defeat at Shís'gi Noow. The Kiks.ádi supplied the Russians with food [...] and otter pelts, while the colonists introduced the Tlingit to the various aspects of Russian culture and the Russian Orthodox Church. Occasional acts of Tlingit aggression continued until 1858, with one significant uprising (though quickly quelled) occurring in 1855.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come, gentlemen," [...] {{said the}} host of the <b>ranche,</b> {{stepping}} forward, [...] "it's not worth while quarrelling about a miserable red-skin." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{less than}} two hours the {{travellers}} reached the second <b>ranche,</b> which was little better, in appearance or accommodation, than the one they had left. Having no funds, they merely halted to water their cattle, and then pushed forward.|$|E

6000|$|... "Put on your coat, Larry, and come, let's {{get ready}} for a start," [...] said Ned; [...] "you can't afford to fight till you've made your fortune at the diggings. How far is it to the next <b>ranche,</b> landlord?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} we shall require all our jollity and enthusiasm {{to keep up}} our spirits, if we don't reach the {{diggings}} to-morrow," [...] said Ned Sinton, as he busied himself in polishing the blade of a superb hunting-knife, which had been presented to him by a few college friends at parting; [...] "you all know that our funds are exhausted, and it's awkward {{to arrive at a}} <b>ranche</b> without a dollar to pay for a meal--still more awkward to be compelled to encamp beside a <b>ranche</b> and unpack our own provisions, especially if it should chance to be a wet night. Do you think we shall manage to reach the diggings to-morrow, Maxton?" ...|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} a {{detachment of}} Royalist troops coming to pacify the district, burnt the <b>ranche,</b> carried off the remaining horses and cattle, and having thus deprived {{the old people}} of all their worldly possessions, left them sitting under a bush in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dun know; but I {{was here}} last night, an' I'd take my davy, I saw the little gal in the <b>ranche</b> of a feller {{away in the}} plains, five hundred miles to the east'ard, two months ago. Her father, poor chap, {{was killed by a}} wild horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has a good}} plot; it abounds in action; {{the scenes}} are equally {{spirited}} and realistic, and we can only say we have read it with much pleasure from first to last. The pictures of life on a cattle <b>ranche</b> are most graphically painted, as are the manners of the reckless but jovial cow-boys."--Times.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, thin, ye've got a swate voice," [...] said Larry O'Neil, sarcastically, {{as he led}} his mule {{towards a}} post, to which Bill Jones was already {{fastening}} his steed. [...] "I say, Bill," [...] he added, pointing to a little tin bowl which stood on an inverted cask outside {{the door of the}} <b>ranche,</b> [...] "wot can that be for?" ...|$|E
60|$|His {{blood had}} stirred quickly {{at the mention}} of the Robles <b>Ranche,</b> but the rest of Susy's speech was too much in the vein of her old extravagance to touch him seriously. He found himself only {{considering}} how strange it was that the old petulance and impulsiveness of her girlhood were actually bringing back with them her pink cheeks and brilliant eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "W'en yer in difficulties," [...] remarked Bill Jones, slowly, as {{he entered}} the <b>ranche,</b> and {{proceeded}} to fill his pipe, [...] "git out of 'em, if ye can. If ye can't, why wot then? circumstances is adwerse, an' it's o' no use a-tryin' to mend 'em. Only my sentiments is, that I'll delay washin' till I comes to a river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take mine, and I'll trapse over on {{foot to the}} <b>Ranche</b> with Crosby--after a spell. You'll {{find him}} under that big madrono, if he has not already wound himself up with his lariat by walking round it. Those Mexican horses can't go {{straight}} even when they graze--they must feed in a circle. He's a little fresh, so look out for him!" ...|$|E
60|$|This cool {{attempt to}} turn the {{conversation}} was happily successful. The next <b>ranche,</b> he was told, was about ten miles distant, and the road comparatively easy; so, {{as it was a}} fine moonlight night, and he was desirous of reaching the first diggings on the following day as early as possible, the horses and mules were saddled, and the bill called for.|$|E
60|$|The ranchero, as {{the owner}} of such an {{establishment}} is named, was said to be an escaped felon. Certainly he might have been, as far as his looks went. He was surly and morose, but men minded this little, so long as he supplied their wants. There were five or six travellers in the <b>ranche</b> when our party arrived, all of whom were awaiting the preparation of supper.|$|E
60|$|The barking of {{the dogs}} about that man's <b>ranche</b> {{was the first thing}} that checked his speed. He had {{forgotten}} the dogs. He swerved sharply, and plunged into the palm-grove, as into a wilderness of columns in an immense hall, whose dense obscurity seemed to whisper and rustle faintly high above his head. He traversed it, entered a ravine, and {{climbed to the top of}} a steep ridge free of trees and bushes.|$|E
60|$|Captain Bunting and Bill Jones {{were unable}} {{to do more than}} sigh out their amazement and shake their heads, as they left the <b>ranche</b> and mounted their steeds; in doing which the captain accidentally, as usual, drove both spurs into the sides of his mule, which caused it to execute a series of {{manoeuvres}} and pirouettes that entertained the company for a quarter of an hour, after which they rode away over the plain.|$|E
60|$|On the <b>ranche</b> {{of another}} of these landholders {{you may find}} our old friend, the truck system, in full operation. Men live there, year in year out, to cut timber for a nominal wage, which is all {{consumed}} in supplies. The longer they remain in this desirable service the deeper they will fall in debt - a burlesque injustice in a new country, where labour should be precious, {{and one of those}} typical instances which explains the prevailing discontent and the success of the demagogue Kearney.|$|E
60|$|The country {{became more}} and more undulating and broken as they advanced, and beyond the second <b>ranche</b> assumed the {{appearance}} of a hill country. The valleys were free from trees, though here and there occurred dense thickets of underwood, in which Maxton told them that grizzly-bears loved to dwell--a piece of information that induced most of the party to carry their rifles in a handy position, and glance suspiciously at every shadow. Large oaks and bay-trees covered the lower slopes of the hills, while higher up the white oak and fir predominated.|$|E
60|$|These {{pleasant}} adventures with Dardo on {{the plain}} were suddenly {{put a stop to}} by the war. One morning a number of persons on foot and on horseback were seen coming to us over the green plain from the shepherd's <b>ranche,</b> and as they drew nearer we recognized our old Alcalde on his horse {{as the leader of the}} procession, and behind him walked Dona Nata, holding her son by the hand; then followed others on foot, and behind them all rode four old gauchos, the Alcalde's henchmen, wearing their swords.|$|E
60|$|Only a {{few days}} after I had seen M'Eckron, a message reached me in my cottage. It was a Scotchman who had come down {{a long way from the}} hills to market. He had heard there was a countryman in Calistoga, and came round to the hotel to see him. We said a few words to each other; we had not much to say--should never have seen each other had we stayed at home, {{separated}} alike in space and in society; and then we shook hands, and he went his way again to his <b>ranche</b> among the hills, and that was all.|$|E
6000|$|The {{proprietor}} was a brave old white-faced Swede. He {{had wandered}} this way, Heaven knows how, and taken up his acres--I forget {{how many years}} ago--all alone, bent double with sciatica, and with six bits {{in his pocket and}} an axe upon his shoulder. Long, useless years of seafaring had thus discharged him at the end, penniless and sick. Without doubt he had tried his luck at the diggings, and got no good from that; without doubt he had loved the bottle, and lived the life of Jack ashore. But at the end of these adventures, here he came; and, the place hitting his fancy, down he sat to make a new life of it, far from crimps and the salt sea. And the very sight of his <b>ranche</b> had done him good. It was [...] "the handsomest spot in the Californy mountains." [...] "Isn't it handsome, now?" [...] he said. Every penny he makes goes into that <b>ranche</b> to make it handsomer. Then the climate, with the sea-breeze every afternoon in the hottest summer weather, had gradually cured the sciatica; and his sister and niece were now domesticated with him for company--or, rather, the niece came only once in the two days, teaching music the meanwhile in the valley. And then, for a last piece of luck, [...] "the handsomest spot in the Californy mountains" [...] had produced a petrified forest, which Mr. Evans now shows at the modest figure of half a dollar a head, or two-thirds of his capital when he first came there with an axe and a sciatica.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} country through which they now ambled pleasantly. Undulating and partially wooded, with fine stretches of meadow land between, from which the scent of myriads of wild-flowers rose on the cool night air. The moon sailed low in a perfectly cloudless sky, casting {{the shadows of the}} horsemen far before them as they rode, and clothing hill and dale, bush and tree, with a soft light, as if a cloud of silver gauze had settled down upon the scene. The incident in the <b>ranche</b> was quickly banished, and each traveller committed himself silently to the full enjoyment of the beauties around him--beauties which appeared less like reality than a vision of the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you don't}} {{understand}} HER!" [...] retorted Susy sharply. [...] "Look here, Clarence Brant, you're right; I didn't ask {{you here to}} tell you--what you and everybody knows--that your wife is a Southerner. I didn't ask you {{here to tell you}} what everybody suspects--that she turns you round her little finger. But I did ask you here to tell you what nobody, not even you, suspects--but what I know!--and that is that she's a TRAITOR--and more, a SPY!--and that I've only got to say the word, or send that man Jim to say the word, to have her dragged out of her Copperhead den at Robles <b>Ranche</b> and shut up in Fort Alcatraz this very night!" ...|$|E
60|$|Before evening closed, the {{travellers}} {{arrived at}} one of the road-side inns, or, as they were named, ranches, which were beginning at this time to spring up {{in various parts of the}} country, for the accommodation of gold-hunters on their way to the mines. This <b>ranche</b> belonged to a man of the name of Dawson, who had made a few hundred dollars by digging, and then set up a grog-shop and house of entertainment, being wise enough to perceive that he could gain twice as much gold by supplying the diggers with the necessaries of life than he could hope to procure by digging. His <b>ranche</b> was a mere hovel, built of sun-dried bricks, and he dealt more in drinks than in edibles. The accommodation and provisions were of the poorest description, but, as there was no other house of entertainment near, mine host charged the highest possible prices. There was but one apartment in this establishment, and little or no furniture. Several kegs and barrels supported two long pine planks which constituted at different periods of the day the counter, the gaming-table, and the table d'hote. A large cooking stove stood in the centre of the house, but there were no chairs; guests were expected to sit on boxes and empty casks, or stand. Beds there were none. When the hour for rest arrived, each guest chose the portion of the earthen floor that suited him best, and, spreading out his blankets, with his saddle for a pillow, lay down to dream of golden nuggets, or, perchance, of home, while innumerable rats--the bane of California-- gambolled round and over him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{business}} {{of my life}} stands pretty nigh still. I work at my notes of the voyage. It will not be very like a book of mine; but perhaps none the less successful for that. I will not deny that I feel lonely to-day; but I do not fear to go on, for I am doing right. I have not yet had a word from England, partly, I suppose, because I have not yet written for my letters to New York; do not blame me for this neglect; if you knew all I have been through, you would wonder I had done so much as I have. I teach the <b>ranche</b> children reading in the morning, for the mother is from home sick.--Ever your affectionate friend, ...|$|E
60|$|But while I {{was thus}} {{wandering}} in my fancy, great feats had been transacted in the bar. Corwin the bold had fallen, Kelmar was again crowned with laurels, {{and the last}} of the ship's kettles had changed hands. If I had ever doubted the purity of Kelmar's motives, if I had ever suspected him of a single eye to business in his eternal dallyings, now at least, when the last kettle was disposed of, my suspicions must have been allayed. I dare not guess how much more time was wasted; nor how often we drove off merely to drive back again and renew interrupted conversations about nothing, before the Toll House was fairly left behind. Alas! and not a mile down the grade there stands a <b>ranche</b> in a sunny vineyard, and here we must all dismount again and enter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jim {{only knows}} what he's heard outside: the talk of men, you know,--and he hears {{a good deal of}} that--more, perhaps, than YOU do. It was that which put me up to finding out the truth. And I didn't rest till I did. I'm not to be fooled, Clarence,--you don't mind my calling you Clarence now we're both married and done for,--and I'm not the kind to be fooled by anybody from the Cow counties--and that's the Robles <b>Ranche.</b> I'm a Southern woman myself from Missouri, but I'm for the Union first, last, and all the time, and I call myself a match for any lazy, dawdling, lash-swinging slaveholder and slaveholderess--whether they're mixed blood, Heaven only knows, or what--or their friends or relations, or the dirty half-Spanish grandees and their mixed half-nigger peons who truckle to them. You bet!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{these are}} but experiments. All {{things in this}} new land are moving farther on: the wine-vats and the miner's {{blasting}} tools but picket for a night, like Bedouin pavilions; and to-morrow, to fresh woods! This stir of change and these perpetual echoes of the moving footfall, haunt the land. Men move eternally, still chasing Fortune; and, fortune found, still wander. As we drove back to Calistoga, the road lay empty of mere passengers, but its green side was dotted with the camps of travelling families: one cumbered with a great waggonful of household stuff, settlers going to occupy a <b>ranche</b> they had taken up in Mendocino, or perhaps Tehama County; another, a party in dust-coats, men and women, whom we found camped in a grove on the roadside, all on pleasure bent, with a Chinaman to cook for them, and who waved their hands to us as we drove by.|$|E
60|$|Men {{ploughed}} {{with wooden}} ploughs and yoked oxen, small on a boundless expanse, as if attacking immensity itself. The mounted figures of vaqueros galloped in the distance, {{and the great}} herds fed with all their horned heads one way, in one single wavering line as far as eye could reach across the broad potreros. A spreading cotton-wool tree shaded a thatched <b>ranche</b> by the road; the trudging files of burdened Indians taking off their hats, would lift sad, mute eyes to the cavalcade raising the dust of the crumbling camino real made by {{the hands of their}} enslaved forefathers. And Mrs. Gould, with each day's journey, seemed to come nearer to the soul of the land in the tremendous disclosure of this interior unaffected by the slight European veneer of the coast towns, a great land of plain and mountain and people, suffering and mute, waiting for the future in a pathetic immobility of patience.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{himself did}} not remain a bachelor, but {{six years after}} his return to England took a wife to himself, and the house at Blackheath was none too large for his family. Harry Wade's home is with Tom, and he is still hale and hearty. Up to {{the last few years}} he paid {{occasional}} visits to America, and stayed for a while with his red brother Leaping Horse, when they lamented together over the disappearance of game and the extinction of the buffalo. Hunting Dog had, at Harry's urgent advice, settled down in the ways of civilization, taking up a <b>ranche</b> and breeding cattle, of which he now owns a large herd. Jerry Curtis and Pete Hoskings made a journey together to Europe after the closing of the mine. They stayed for a month at Blackheath, and ten years later Tom received a lawyer's letter from Denver saying that Peter Hoskings was dead, and that he had left his large house and other property in Denver to Mr. Thomas Wade's children. Jerry still lives at the age of seventy-five in that city.|$|E
6000|$|... "'In {{the first}} place, I know pretty well every one in Colorado, Montana, and Idaho; {{in the next}} place, in my wanderings I have come across a score of bits of land in out-of-the-way places where a young fellow could set up a <b>ranche</b> and breed cattle and horses and make a good thing of it; or {{if he has a}} turn for mechanics, I could show him places where he could set up saw-mills for lumber, with water-power all the year round, and with markets not far away. Of course, he is too young yet, but unless he is going to walk in your steps and turn sailor he might do worse than come out to me in three or four years' time. Rough as the life is, it is a man's life, and a week of it is worth more than a year's quill-driving in an office. It is a pity your family have run to girls, for if one boy had made up his mind for the sea you might have spared me another.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{only saw}} Foss once, though, {{strange as it}} may sound, I have twice talked with him. He lives out of Calistoga, at a <b>ranche</b> called Fossville. One evening, after he was long gone home, I dropped into Cheeseborough's, and was asked if I should like to speak with Mr. Foss. Supposing that the {{interview}} was impossible, and that I was merely called upon to subscribe the general sentiment, I boldly answered [...] "Yes." [...] Next moment, I had one instrument at my ear, another at my mouth and found myself, with {{nothing in the world}} to say, conversing with a man several miles off among desolate hills. Foss rapidly and somewhat plaintively brought the conversation to an end; and he returned to his night's grog at Fossville, while I strolled forth again on Calistoga high street. But it was an odd thing that here, on what we are accustomed to consider the very skirts of civilization, I should have used the telephone {{for the first time in}} my civilized career. So it goes in these young countries; telephones, and telegraphs, and newspapers, and advertisements running far ahead among the Indians and the grizzly bears.|$|E
