5000|$|The {{contents}} of main memory (RAM) are preserved while booting into {{and running the}} dump-capture kernel by reserving {{a small amount of}} RAM in advance, into which the dump-capture kernel is preloaded so none of the RAM used by the primary kernel is overwritten when a kernel crash is handled. This reserved amount of RAM is used solely by the dump-capture kernel and is otherwise unused during normal system operation. Some architectures, including x86 and ppc64, require a small fixed-position portion of RAM to boot a kernel regardless of where it is loaded; in this case, kexec creates a copy of that portion of RAM so it is also accessible to the dump-capture kernel. Size and optional position of the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion</b> of RAM are specified through the kernel boot parameter , and the [...] command-line utility is used after the primary kernel boots to preload a dump-capture kernel image and its associated initrd image into the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion</b> of RAM.|$|E

50|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} flash-gas in the liquid line include a {{cautious}} {{design of the}} cooling system and its piping, but also the incorporation of gear that might help solve this type of difficulty. The inclusion of a refrigerant receiver is a common, cheap and simple way of decreasing the gas ratio in the liquid line. The incorporation of a subcooling stage after the receiver reduces even more the chances to observe flash gas. This subcooling may {{be done in a}} <b>reserved</b> <b>portion</b> of the main condenser, or separately with a heat exchanger. Some receivers may incorporate an internal heat exchanger that draws heat form the subcooled liquid to superheat the gas compressors suction. There are also many kinds of independent subcooling displays and applications such as refrigeration cycle optimizers; these help avoiding flash-gas in the liquid line by lowering the temperature away from the refrigerant’s saturation curves. Some systems deal with flash-gas by separating it from the refrigerant that goes to the evaporator, as that portion of the refrigerant alrealdy evaporated and will only increase superheating.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we examine the}} {{necessary}} succession rules whose main feature is the particularly high protection of the forced heirs’ rights. In other legal systems also exist some forms of protection of the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion,</b> but not as intense as in our legal system. One of the clearest example {{of the level of}} protection of forced heirs rights is given by the fact that if the testamentary dispositions or donations exceed the portion which the testator can legally dispose of (the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion),</b> then the forced heirs have at their disposal a specific legal action “azione di riduzione” that permits them to restore the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion.</b> The intangibility of the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion</b> and the in rem quality of the legal action aimed at restoring the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion,</b> produces important consequences on the market transaction, since it’s capable of hindering the validity of payment contracts concluded even many years before. All these aspects have lead many scholars to question this kind of legal rules pledging for a reform of them. Another question that we have analysed is the so called “family pact”, which is a contract through which an entrepreneur transfer a productive good to a family member. These kinds of transactions are excluded from the applicability of the necessary succession discipline in order to guarantee the intergeneration transfers of the enterprise. The law has actually set up a double channel in the necessary succession area: from one side, in the case of productive goods, all the potential forced heirs can sign an agreement which upsets the general rule that all forced heirs have to receive goods belonging to the testator’s asset, and they can receive instead a sum on money corresponding to the value of the goods of the asset, they should have received. When a family pact is signed both the sum of money and the goods are in principle excluded from the legal action aimed at restoring the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion.</b> As a way of conclusion we could say that frequently the different solutions adopted in commercial law have opened new paths and new interpretations, leading to law reforms, that’s why we can say that the complex system of rules of the necessary succession could be modified, taking as an example the specific solutions adopted for the “family pact”...|$|E

40|$|The essay {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of ‘new philanthropy’ from a juridical point of view, wondering if Italian civil law that rules the contract of donation is able to reach a fair balance between the interests of donors and those of donees. Some legal scholars reckon {{that there are too}} many limits to the act of donation, such as those arising from the constraint of a solemn form and above all those related to forced heirship (‘successione necessaria’), according to which an indefeasible portion of the estate passes to the deceased’s next-of-kin. On the contrary, the author argues the reasons why these limits aim, on the one hand, to make the donor aware of the seriousness of the choice of undergoing a pauperization, and, on the other, to fulfil the constitutional protection of the nuclear family. Moreover, although forced heirs can use a specific legal action (called ‘azione di riduzione’) that permits them to restore the <b>reserved</b> <b>portion,</b> donations can be abated only after the testamentary dispositions exceeding the disposable portion have been reduced...|$|E

Real-time applications are then able to <b>reserve</b> a smaller <b>portion</b> of the available bandwidth to satisfy their needs and therefore reduce the inevitable waste of bandwidth.

40|$|Background: As {{the most}} common joint {{disorder}} worldwide (1), osteoarthritis represents {{a growing concern for}} older adults. Prognostic predictive models (statistical models used to predict future disease development (2)) may enable the identification of patients at high risk of developing osteoarthritis, allowing for health and lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing the risk of disease development (3, 4). Methods: For our project, we accessed the DELPHI (Deliver Primary Healthcare Information) database which contains de-identified electronic medical records of more than 60, 000 primary care patients in Ontario (5, 6). From these data, we constructed a retrospective cohort examining patients’ risk factors and followed them over time to observe incident cases of osteoarthritis. This retrospective cohort was used to develop and test prognostic predictive models, using methods such as logistic regression, to determine the models’ ability to predict development of osteoarthritis. Models were evaluated, examining both discrimination (AUC) and calibration (calibration plots), using a <b>reserved</b> <b>portion</b> of patient data. Results: A logistic regression model was built that predicts the incidence of osteoarthritis based on patient age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), osteoporosis status, and leg injury status (AUC: 0. 73). Discussion 2 ̆ 6 Conclusion: By creating a prognostic predictive model for osteoarthritis, we aim to support primary health care practitioners in estimating an individual patient’s risk of osteoarthritis; thereby allowing practitioners and patients to create unique plans to address the patient’s personal risk factors. Interdisciplinary Reflection: This project is highly interdisciplinary as it spans the fields of epidemiology, statistics, health informatics, primary health care, and computer science.
