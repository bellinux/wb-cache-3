5|$|In {{the mating}} season, <b>rutting</b> males bellow {{to make their}} {{presence}} known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle.|$|E

Wolves are major predators; a study found that old <b>rutting</b> bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village dogs are reported to kill fawns, but are unlikely to successfully hunt and kill adults.|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. <b>Rutting</b> males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} mating tactics of Przewalski’s gazelle on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2005. Przewalski’s gazelle is a cluster mating animal whereby female groups, {{including}} juveniles, travel {{to and from}} their resting grounds along fixed routes and dominant males stand on or near these travel routes during <b>rut.</b> To explain <b>rut</b> patterns in male gazelles, we tested predictions arising from the “Resource-based Hypothesis” and “Female Traffic Version of the Hotspot Hypothesis”. We marked the location of each <b>rut</b> stand and female travel route, measured food availability in each <b>rut</b> stand and recorded the mating opportunities of <b>rut</b> stand owners. We also conducted a field experiment to force female groups to change their daily travel route, and observed whether males abandon their original <b>rut</b> stands and shift their <b>rut</b> stands to new travel routes of females during the 3 rd <b>rut.</b> We found that: (1) male gazelle defending <b>rut</b> stands closer to a female travel route had a higher chance of mating; (2) food resources within <b>rut</b> stands {{had no effect on}} mating opportunities of the <b>rut</b> stand owner; (3) when the female travel route was obstructed, female groups changed grazing sites, and all males abandoned their original <b>rut</b> stands and defended new <b>rut</b> stands along the new female travel route. In conclusion, the location of <b>rut</b> stands in relation to female travel routes is the ultimate factor for consolidating mating opportunities in male gazelle, supporting the “Female Route Version of Hotspot Hypothesis” [Current Zoology 57 (6) : 701 – 708, 2011]...|$|R
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the <b>rutting</b> season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} <b>rutting</b> males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a <b>rutting</b> male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{off-road}} vehicles (ORVs) on sandy beaches creates <b>ruts</b> {{in the sand}} that may interfere with the beach dispersal of sea turtle hatchlings. The present study investigated the influence of simulated ORV <b>ruts</b> of 3 depths (5, 10 and 15 cm) on the success and speed of green sea turtle Chelonia mydas hatchling dispersal. Almost all hatchlings (91 %) were unable to traverse a single 15 cm <b>rut,</b> indicating that <b>ruts</b> of this depth are particularly detrimental to hatchling dispersal. Hatchlings had greater success traversing the 5 and 10 cm <b>ruts,</b> although they spent 2. 6 and 18. 6 times longer {{to get through a}} single <b>rut,</b> respectively (compared to the flat sand control path). It took progressively longer to get through subsequent <b>ruts,</b> and 99 and 53 % of the hatchlings crawled along the 10 and 5 cm <b>ruts,</b> respectively, instead of attempting to crawl out of them. It was estimated that if hatchlings had to traverse 100 ORV <b>ruts</b> during dispersal, it would take 1. 9 and 25. 1 h for 5 and 10 cm deep <b>ruts,</b> respectively. The results from the present study indicate that green sea turtle hatchlings would spend considerable time navigating through ORV <b>ruts,</b> even as shallow as 5 cm, resulting in increased exposure to predation, dehydration and energy expenditure during this initial stage of dispersal.

5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A <b>rutting</b> male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. <b>Rutting</b> males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, <b>rutting</b> males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory measurements on the determination of <b>rut</b> parameters resulting from the operation of a pneumatic drive wheel with a different slip. The experiment was performed on the test bench consisting of the researched wheel load simulator, a mobile soil tub and the rope slip control system. <b>Ruts</b> were made at the wheel slip s= 6 %, 25 %, 43 %, 62 %, 81 %, 100 %, and when the wheel rolled along the ground with s close to 0 %. The obtained <b>ruts</b> were mapped to the computer using the non-contact laser measuring station. Based on the mapping for the <b>rut</b> fragment, the surface area was calculated in a simplified variant, as a horizontal projection of a <b>rut</b> on the surface area and as a real three-dimensional surface area; moreover, the <b>rut</b> volume was measured. It was found that using a simplified method for determination of the surface area of the <b>rut,</b> i. e. a <b>rut</b> horizontal projection, a significant error is committed. For studies with only rolling a wheel, a simplified surface area accounted for only 0. 6 of real surface area, and for the wheel slip s= 25 % is was only 0. 5 of actual surface area. Increase of the slip results in significant increase of the <b>rut</b> volume.

40|$|Abstract — Expert {{off road}} drivers have found through {{experience}} that <b>ruts</b> formed on soft terrains {{as a result}} of vehicular transit can be used to improve vehicle safety and performance. <b>Rut</b> following improves vehicle performance by reducing the energy wasted on compacting the ground as the vehicle traverses over the terrain.

40|$|Background. The rapid urease test (<b>RUT)</b> is used at Groote Schuur Hospital for {{diagnosing}} Helicobacter pylori infection. This is {{an in-house}} method, {{which has not}} been validated. Objective. To validate our practice of reading the <b>RUT</b> immediately after endoscopy (<b>RUT</b> 0), by comparing this with a reading at 24 hours (<b>RUT</b> 24) and with histological analysis. Design. Ninety consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy over a 6 -week period from October 2005 to November 2005, and in whom rapid urease testing was indicated, were included in the study. Patients with recent exposure (within 2 weeks of endoscopy) to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) and antibiotics (confounders) were noted and included in the cohort. Two antral and two body biopsies were taken for histological examination and a third antral biopsy was placed in the <b>RUT</b> bottle. Both haematoxylin and eosin and modified Giemsa staining methods were used to identify H. pylori. The <b>RUT</b> was read immediately (within 5 minutes of upper endoscopy) (<b>RUT</b> 0), as per our current practice, and each specimen was re-read at 24 hours (<b>RUT</b> 24). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the impact of confounders were calculated. Results. Of the 90 patients undergoing rapid urease testing, 39 % were male and 61 % were female, {{with a mean age of}} 55 years (range 22 - 79 years). Histological examination revealed H. pylori in 67. 8 % (N= 61) of the biopsy specimens. In the 65 patients without confounders, the sensitivity and specificity of the <b>RUT</b> 0 were 65. 9 % and 100 % respectively, and 90. 9 % and 100 % for <b>RUT</b> 24. After including the 25 patients with confounders, the sensitivity and specificity were 68. 8 % and 100 % for <b>RUT</b> 0, and 90. 1 % and 100 % for <b>RUT</b> 24 respectively. Thirteen <b>RUT</b> 0 specimens (30. 9 %) that were initially negative became positive at the <b>RUT</b> 24 reading. There were 6 (9. 8 %) <b>RUT</b> 0 - and <b>RUT</b> 24 -negative but histology-positive specimens. Four of these 6 false-negative <b>RUT</b> 24 results could be accounted for by a low H. pylori density on histological analysis (2 patients were taking PPIs). Confounders did not alter the sensitivity and specificity outcomes or impact on the number of false-negative <b>RUTs.</b> Conclusions. Our locally prepared <b>RUT</b> is a specific test for the detection of H. pylori infection. The sensitivity is greatly enhanced by reading the test at 24 hours. The use of PPIs, H 2 RAs and antibiotics preceding endoscopy did not impact significantly on the results...|$|R
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs {{to hold onto the}} prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's <b>rutting</b> call to attract them.|$|E
