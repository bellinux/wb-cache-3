The procedure to assess <b>reporting</b> <b>levels</b> assessed the sensitivity of the methods and the standard deviation of blank sample results (Skogerbue and Grant, 1970). In addition, the <b>reporting</b> <b>levels</b> were determined using a different generation of ICP-AES instrumentation with different sample introduction apparatus than is used now.

50|$|The data {{collection}} of the MCTFS {{is based on the}} principle of singular reporting. Whenever practical, an event is reported when and where it occurs to ensure accuracy and timeliness of reporting. An item of information is entered into the system only once; thereafter, only changes, deletions, or corrections to this information are reported. MCTFS uses a centralized strategy and management style with decentralized execution at the lowest <b>reporting</b> <b>level.</b> The information maintained within the MCTFS is used for the functions described above. Additionally, the purposes for which information is maintained within the MCTFS are adequately described per the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and manpower Life Cycle Management (LCM) documentation maintained by the Deputy Commandant Manpower and Reserve Affairs (Code MI) and Deputy Commandant Programs & Resources (Code RFF). Data maintained in MCTFS on Marines is categorized as the Official Electronic Military File (OEMF) for that individual. As such, the OEMF is subordinate in precedence to the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) maintained by the Commandant of the Marine Corps (Code MMSB). The data contained in the OEMF must be carefully safeguarded under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. Commanders who fail to do so may be held personally accountable.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. Since 1981, 15 {{states have}} {{established}} registries for surveillance of adult lead absorption, primarily based on reports of elevated blood lead levels from clinical laboratories. I review {{the status of}} the registries and recommend steps for further development. METHODS. Companies reported to the New York registry are compared with those cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). I present data on US workers and plants with potential lead exposures and blood tests, as well as review registries' reporting requirements. RESULTS. Registries identify many companies not cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but underreporting occurs because (1) reporting is usually not required from laboratories outside the state, (2) most registries use a blood lead <b>reporting</b> <b>level</b> of 1. 21 mumol/L, which excludes many exposed workers, and (3) many companies with potential exposures do not have routine monitoring programs. CONCLUSIONS. Registries' reporting requirements and procedures should be standardized, including a blood lead <b>reporting</b> <b>level</b> of 0. 72 mumol/L. Elevated blood lead levels should be a reportable condition nationwide, and a comprehensive national surveillance system should be established: clinical laboratories should be required to report cases to those states with lead registries or directly to the national adult lead registry...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 1784 legal-size (≥ 356 mm TL) hatchery-produced red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) were tagged and {{released}} to estimate tag-reporting levels of recreational anglers in South Carolina (SC) and Georgia (GA). Twelve groups of legal-size fish (~ 150 fish/ group) were released. Half {{of the fish}} of each group were tagged with an external tag with the message “reward” {{and the other half}} of the fish were implanted with tags with the message “$ 100 reward. ” These fish were released into two estuaries in each state (n= 4); three replicate groups were released at different sites within each estuary (n= 12). From results obtained in previous tag return experiments conducted by wildlife and fisheries biologists, it was hypothesized that reporting would be maximized at a reward level of $ 100 /tag. <b>Reporting</b> <b>level</b> for the “reward”tags was estimated by dividing the number of “reward” tags returned by the number of “$ 100 reward” tags returned. The cumulative return level for both tag messages was 22. 7 (± 1. 9) % in SC and 25. 8 (± 4. 1) % in GA. These return levels were typical of those recorded by other red drum tagging programs in the region. Return data were partitioned according to verbal survey information obtained from anglers who reported tagged fish. Based on this partitioned data set, 14. 3 (± 2. 1) % of “reward” tags were returned in SC, and 25. 5 (± 2. 3) % of “$ 100 reward” tags were returned. This finding indicates that only 56. 7 % of the fish captured with “reward” tags were reported in SC. The pattern was similar for GA where 19. 1 (± 10. 6) % of “reward” message tags were returned as compared with 30. 1 (± 15. 6) % for “$ 100 reward” message tags. This difference yielded a <b>reporting</b> <b>level</b> of 63 % for “reward” tags in GA. Currently, 50 % is used as the estimate for the angler <b>reporting</b> <b>level</b> in population models for red drum and a number of other coastal finfish species in the South Atlantic region of the United States.

40|$|This study brings {{together}} two perspectives on managers’ <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> of red tape. The work motivation perspective explains how managers’ characteristics, such as work engagement (alienation) or commitment, affect their <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> of red tape. The external control perspective explains how managers’ feedback relations with external actors and organizations reduce miscommunications and conflicts between multiple sources of rules, regulations, and procedures. Hypotheses are derived {{about the effects}} of managers’ levels of work engagement, commitment to the organization, and networking activity with external actors and organizations on their <b>levels</b> of <b>reported</b> red tape. The hypotheses are simultaneously tested on a cross-sectional data set of Dutch primary school principals with information about their <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> of externally generated general red tape (n = 792) and personnel red tape (n = 787). The results of the analyses suggest that work engagement reduces and commitment increases <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> of red tape. Networking activity with national government is associated with high <b>levels</b> of <b>reported</b> general red tape and personnel red tape. Networking activity with local government and interest organizations in the labor relations domain are associated with low <b>levels</b> of <b>reported</b> personnel red tape. Finally, commitment moderates the effect of networking with national government on general red tape and the effect of networking with interest organizations on personnel red tape.
