Therefore, we propose to develop the higher-order generalized averaging method to construct the approximations up to third-order, giving explicit formulas in the general case. A process permitting the study of several resonances simultaneously is proposed. Furthermore, for a class of forced nonlinear oscillators, the existence possibility of two cycles of order q near <b>resonance</b> <b>points,</b> which appear by saddle node bifurcations is shown.

50|$|Another {{application}} of memetics in the sustainability space is the crowdfunded Climate Meme Project conducted by Joe Brewer and Balazs Laszlo Karafiath {{in the spring}} of 2013. This study was based on a collection of 1000 unique text-based expressions gathered from Twitter, Facebook, and structured interviews with climate activists. The major finding was that the global warming meme is not effective at spreading because it causes emotional duress in the minds of people who learn about it. Five central tensions were revealed in the discourse about change, each of which represents a <b>resonance</b> <b>point</b> through which dialogue can be engaged. The tensions were Harmony/Disharmony (whether or not humans are part of the natural world), Survival/Extinction (envisioning the future as either apocalyptic collapse of civilization or total extinction of the human race), Cooperation/Conflict (regarding whether or not humanity can come together to solve global problems), Momentum/Hesitation (about whether or not we are making progress at the collective scale to address climate change), and Elitism/Heretic (a general sentiment that each side of the debate considers the experts of its opposition to be untrustworthy).|$|E

50|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or tone in a wind {{instrument}} initiated by vibrating reed or lips, a phenomenon called mode-locking counteracts the natural inharmonicity of the string or air column and causes the overtones to lock precisely onto integer multiples {{of the fundamental}} pitch, even though these are slightly different from the natural <b>resonance</b> <b>points</b> of the instrument.

These vocal patterns can be noted as a person’s accent. An accent along with the slang and unique vernacular of a region creates a dialect. Dialects are best explored with four different categories: rhythm & melody, sound changes, <b>resonance</b> <b>point</b> and oral posture. Rhythm is the tempo of the speech, and the melody is the pitch. Some languages are more musical than others, depending on the 4 Canfield rhythm and melody of the speech.

40|$|We {{explore the}} Z_N parafermionic clock-model generalisations of the p-wave Majorana wire model. In {{particular}} we examine whether zero-mode operators analogous to Majorana zero-modes {{can be found}} in these models when one introduces chiral parameters to break time reversal symmetry. The existence of such zero-modes implies N-fold degeneracies throughout the energy spectrum. We address the question directly through these degeneracies by characterising the entire energy spectrum using perturbation theory and exact diagonalisation. We find that when N is prime, and the length L of the wire is finite, the spectrum exhibits degeneracies up to a splitting that decays exponentially with system size, for generic values of the chiral parameters. However, at particular parameter values (<b>resonance</b> <b>points),</b> band crossings appear in the unperturbed spectrum that typically result in a splitting of the degeneracy at finite order. We find strong evidence that these preclude the existence of strong zero-modes for generic values of the chiral parameters. In particular we show that in the thermodynamic limit, the <b>resonance</b> <b>points</b> become dense in the chiral parameter space. When N is not prime, the situation is qualitatively different, and degeneracies in the energy spectrum are split at finite order in perturbation theory for generic parameter values, even when the length of the wire L is finite. Exceptions to these general findings can occur at special "anti-resonant" points. Here the evidence points to the existence of strong zero modes and, {{in the case of the}} achiral point of the the N= 4 model, we are able to construct these modes exactly.

40|$|We {{consider}} theoretically {{the transport}} in a one-channel spinless Luttinger liquid with two strong impurities {{in the presence}} of dissipation. As a difference with respect to the dissipation free case, where the two impurities fully transmit electrons at <b>resonance</b> <b>points,</b> the dissipation prevents complete transmission in the present situation. A rich crossover diagram for the conductance as a function of applied voltage, temperature, dissipation strength, Luttinger liquid parameter K and the deviation from the resonance condition is obtained. For weak dissipation and 1 / 2 <K< 1, the conduction shows a non-monotonic increase as a function of temperature or voltage. For strong dissipation the conduction increases monotonically but is exponentially small. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Quantum pumping through {{mesoscopic}} {{quantum dots}} {{is known to}} be enhanced by resonant transmission. The pumped charge is close to an integer number of electrons when the pumping contour surrounds a resonance, but the transmission remains small on the contour. For non-interacting electrons, we give a quantitative account of the detailed exchange of electrons between the dot and the leads (to the electron reservoirs) during a pumping cycle. Near isolated distinct resonances, we use approximate Breit-Wigner expressions for the dot's Green function to discuss the loading/unloading picture of the pumping: the fractional charge exchanged between the dot and each lead through a single <b>resonance</b> <b>point</b> is related to the relative couplings of the dot and the leads at this resonance. If each <b>resonance</b> <b>point</b> along the pumping contour is dominated by the coupling to a single lead (which also implies a very small transmission), then the crossing of each such resonance results in a single electron exchange between the dot and that lead, ending up with a net quantized charge. When the resonance approximation is valid, the fractional charges can also be extracted from the peaks of the transmissions between the various leads. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a force induced by the {{labyrinth}} seal on the stability of rotor systems and the factors of the seal which affect the stability are investigated. In the analysis, {{it is assumed that}} the fluid in the seal is steady and that the rotor is set vertically {{in order to avoid the}} effects of gravity force. The force induced by the seal is expressed in terms proportional to the velocity and displacement of the rotor and is deduced to that expression for the oil film force in journal bearings.

The force induced by the labyrinth seal always makes the rotor system unstable, and the tendency is marked when seal leakages are small. The <b>resonance</b> <b>point</b> of the rotor system is also affected by the labyrinth seal (the <b>resonance</b> <b>point</b> of the rotor system is removed by the seal leakages).

40|$|We {{develop a}} new quantum-mechanical {{approach}} to scattering a particle on a one-dimensional (1 D) system of two identical rectangular potential barriers, which implies modelling the dynamics of its subprocesses [...] transmission and reflection [...] at all stages of scattering. On its basis we define, for each subprocess, the dwell {{time as well as}} the local (exact) and asymptotic (extrapolated) group times. Our concept of the asymptotic transmission group time confirms the validity of the Wigner phase time in the opaque limit, as well as the existence of the usual and generalized Hartman effects predicted on its basis. On the energy scale, this concept is valid everywhere in the high energy region {{as well as in the}} low energy region, excepting <b>resonance</b> <b>points</b> and their neighborhoods. On the contrary, the Buttiker dwell time is valid, as the transmission time, just only at the <b>resonance</b> <b>points.</b> Our concept of the transmission dwell time predicts monotonous growth of the tunneling time when the distance between the opaque barriers increases. By our approach only this time scale yields the true time spent, on average, by transmitted particles in the region occupied by the system. We explain why the asymptotic and local transmission group times cannot play this role and why the concept of transmission group velocity lies beyond the scope of special relativity. And else, all the transmission times admit only indirect measurements. Hence the unambiguous interpretation of all tunneling-time experiments is impossible when the transmission dynamics at all stages of scattering is unknown.
