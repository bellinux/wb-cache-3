5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, <b>removable</b> <b>media,</b> etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E

40|$|To prevent data {{breaches}} via <b>removable</b> storage <b>media,</b> the way {{to enhance}} the access control capability of hosts within trusted zone with <b>removable</b> storage <b>media</b> attached was explored. Firstly, based on traditional Cipher-text-Policy hiding Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) schemes, an expression with lattice for attributes was proposed. Each attribute {{was described as a}} linear lattice or a subset lattice, and an attribute set was described as a product lattice. Furthermore, the lattice-based multi-level access control model was applied to construct access policies. The new scheme was proven fully secure under the standard model. It effectively simplifies the expression of access policies and satisfies fine-grained access control of sensitive information shared in the context of multi-level security. Secondly, considering the ubiquitous usage of <b>removable</b> storage <b>media,</b> some security attributes associating with the context of use were adopted to construct a lattice structure. Then a dynamic access control could be achieved. Finally, based on authorization and dynamic access control, a layered security solution providing multi-level protection for <b>removable</b> storage <b>media</b> was presented. Security and flexibility of proposed solution was analyzed, and a comparison experiment shows that it still has pretty good efficiency. It also can be applied to information security management in other ubiquitous environments. 12 page(s...|$|R

500|$|Nevertheless, in February 2008, a {{group of}} {{security}} researchers published details of a so-called [...] "cold boot attack" [...] that allows full disk encryption systems such as BitLocker to be compromised by booting the machine off <b>removable</b> <b>media,</b> such as a USB drive, into another operating system, then dumping the contents of pre-boot memory. The attack relies {{on the fact that}} DRAM retains information for up to several minutes (or even longer if cooled) after power has been removed. There is the Bress/Menz device described in US Patent 9,514,789 that can accomplish this type of attack. Use of a TPM alone does not offer any protection, as the keys are held in memory while Windows is running. Similar full disk encryption mechanisms of other vendors and other operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS X, are vulnerable to the same attack. The authors recommend that computers be powered down when not in physical control of the owner (rather than be left in a sleep mode) and that the encryption software be configured to require a password to boot the machine.|$|E

2500|$|NAND flash {{has reduced}} erase and write times, and {{requires}} less chip area per cell, thus allowing greater storage density and lower cost per bit than NORflash; {{it also has}} up to 10 times the endurance of NORflash.
