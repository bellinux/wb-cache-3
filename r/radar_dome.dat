5|$|The Boeing E-3 Sentry, {{commonly}} known as AWACS, is an American airborne early warning and control (AEW) aircraft developed by Boeing. Derived from the Boeing 707, it provides all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications, and {{is used by the}} United States Air Force, NATO, Royal Air Force, French Air Force, and Royal Saudi Air Force. The E-3 is distinguished by the distinctive rotating <b>radar</b> <b>dome</b> above the fuselage. Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft had been built.|$|E

25|$|In October 1968, {{a routine}} night launch of an E-2A from VAW-123 {{led the way}} for all {{launches}} aboard Forrestal. The crew members were LCDR Paul Martin Wright (Operations Officer), LCDR James Leo Delaney (Maintenance Officer), LTJG Howard Booth Rutledge (Personnel Officer), LTJG Frank J. Frederick (Asst. Maintenance Officer), and AT1 David E. Carpenter (Avionics Dept). The flight was routine and all aircraft recovered as usual until the VAW-123 E-2A, which was the last plane to recover. The aircraft boltered and went off the angled deck and into the water, nose first. When it hit the water, the aircraft flipped over onto its back, breaking its <b>radar</b> <b>dome</b> off and sank within minutes. The dome floated and was recovered. Immediately, helicopters moved into the area for search and rescue operations. AT1 David E. Carpenter and LTJG Frank J. Frederick were rescued without serious injury. Lost at sea were LCDR Wright, LCDR Delaney, and LTJG Rutledge.|$|E
500|$|Modifications to the Boeing 707 for the E-3 Sentry {{included}} a rotating <b>radar</b> <b>dome</b> (rotodome), hydraulics were changed from 3500 to 5000 PSI {{to drive the}} rotodome, single-point ground refueling, air refueling, and a bail-out tunnel or chute. The original design had two (one forward, and one aft), but the aft bail-out chute was deleted to cut mounting costs. Engineering, test and evaluation began on the first E-3 Sentry in October 1975. Between [...] 1977 and 1992, a total of 68 E-3s were built.|$|E
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park was {{the site}} of a Cold War era radar station. The Benton Air Force Station in the north of the park at what is now the Red Rock Job Corps Center was {{constructed}} during 1950 and 1951. Part of the 648th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Fort Indiantown Gap, the radar station [...] was a [...] "frontline defender of national security". About 300airmen served at the radar station {{during the height of the}} Cold War. Barracks were constructed and recreational facilities for the airmen were provided. In 1963 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began jointly operating the radar station; the 648th Squadron was inactivated in 1975 and the Job Corps center was established in 1978, using the barracks and recreational facilities as the Red Rock Job Corps Center. As of 2010, the <b>radar</b> <b>dome</b> is still fully functional and is used by the FAA as an auxiliary radar to the tower at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport.|$|E

40|$|Radar antennas {{deployed}} in real use usually include a protective dome, which shields them from potentially harmful weather conditions. The protective dome is typically constructed from a plastic material, which {{can affect the}} radar signal.

5000|$|The US National Security Agency (NSA) built one of {{its largest}} {{listening}} stations on top of Teufelsberg hill in the British sector of West Berlin, allegedly part of the global surveillance network ECHELON. [...] "The Hill", as it was known colloquially, began operation in July 1961. A large structure was built atop the hill, which would come to be run by the NSA (National Security Agency). Construction of a permanent facility was begun in October 1963. The station continued to operate until the fall of East Germany and the Berlin Wall, after which the station was closed and its equipment removed. However, the huge buildings and massive <b>radar</b> <b>domes</b> still remain in place.|$|R
50|$|The station became {{operational}} on 1 July 1958 {{when the}} 822d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W Sq) {{was assigned to}} the new station. The station consisted of 66 buildings, including operation and administrative facilities, 3 dormitories, 27 family housing units, 3 <b>radar</b> <b>domes,</b> and the normal support facilities/utilities. The site was divided into three general areas: the operations area at the summit, cantonment area at mid-mountain, and a family housing area {{at the north end of}} the city of Cottonwood. The 822d AC&W Sq operated used AN/MPS-7, AN/MPS-14, and AN/FPS-6 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes.|$|R
5000|$|Several <b>radar</b> <b>domes</b> {{and towers}} {{operate on the}} summit of the hill. The largest of the radar arrays is part of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) radar network, and covers one of 30 {{overlapping}} regions of UK airspace. The one on Titterstone Clee monitors all aircraft within a 100-mile radius. The smaller of the two is a Met Office weather radar which is part of a network of 16 radars across the country used to detect cloud precipitation (rain). The domes and masts are well-known local landmarks, with one in particular often being nicknamed [...] "the golf ball" [...] because of it looking like a giant teed-up golf ball. They can be seen for many miles, even from some parts of The Black Country.|$|R
