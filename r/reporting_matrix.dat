30|$|Cappels (Cappels 2004) {{said that}} {{effective}} risk management requires four steps for assessing and managing risk: identification of potential risks, quantification of risk, developing {{a response to}} risk and risk response control. Goodpasture (Goodpasture 2004) using Kano model and project balance sheet for managing of risk. Smith and Merritt (Smith & Merritt 2002) propose proactive risk management in five steps: identify risks, analyze risk, prioritize and map risks, resolve risk and monitor risk. Vargas (Vargas 2008) discuses and analyze the model and best practices used in the PMI standards, published in the PMBOK guide (PMBOK Guide 2004). The risk management processes model (Risk management guide for DOD acquisition 2006) includes the following key activities of risk: identification, analysis, mitigation planning, mitigation plan implementation and tracking. The risk <b>reporting</b> <b>matrix</b> is {{used to determine the}} level of risk. Dobie (Dobie 2007) proposes the risk management process in nine steps.|$|E

30|$|Mechanisms {{that control}} {{vascular}} permeability during inflammation have been <b>reported.</b> <b>Matrix</b> metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important regulatory enzymes in pro-inflammatory pathways, and their expression and activities are typically increased during the inflammatory process. MMPs degrade major {{components of the}} vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrix, such as gelatin and collagen, in the alveolar-capillary barrier (Manicone and McGuire 2008). Therefore, we investigated the mRNA expression level of MMPs in the lung {{during the course of}} viral infection. MMP- 7 expression following viral infection was suppressed in the LFK-administered group at DPI- 7 (Figure  4 B). For the other MMPs, a decreasing trend was observed in the LFK-treated group at DPI- 7 (Figure  4 B). These results suggest that the downregulation of MMP expression by LFK-administration could attenuate the vascular permeability caused by viral infection.|$|R

40|$|During {{extracellular}} matrix assembly, fibronectin (FN) binds to cell surface receptors and initiates fibrillogenesis. As {{described in this}} <b>report,</b> <b>matrix</b> assembly has been dissected using recombinant FN polypeptides (recFNs) expressed in mammalian cells via retroviral vectors. RecFNs were assayed for incorporation into the detergent- insoluble cell matrix fraction and for formation of fibrils at the cell surface as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Biochemical and immunocytochemical data are presented defining the minimum domain requirements for FN fibrillogenesis. The smallest functional recFN is {{half the size of}} native FN and contains intact amino- and carboxy- terminal regions with a large internal deletion spanning the collagen binding domain and the first seven type III repeats. Five type I repeats at the amino terminus are required for assembly and have FN binding activity. The dimer structure mediated by the carboxy-terminal interchain disulfide bonds is also essential. Surprisingly, recFNs lacking the RGDS cell binding site formed a significant fibrillar matrix. Therefore, FN-FN interactions and dimeric structure appear to be the major determinants of fibrillogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{the protein}} separation, {{adsorption}} and desorption of target protein {{have been using}} different buffer condition. Different buffer will change the structure and activity of target protein in some cases. This work describes the use of different wavelength light for remote regulation of adsorption and desorption of target protein in the same buffer solutions. A dynamic system that captured and released protein in response to light is <b>reported.</b> <b>Matrix</b> gold nanoparticles and light-responsive affinity ligand comprising thrombin aptamer (APT 15), polyethylene glycol linker, and azobenzene-modified complementary sequence were used. UV light induced a trans-cis isomerization of the azobenzene that destabilized the duplex of aptamer and azobenzene-modified complementary sequence, resulting in thrombin binding to aptamer sequence. Visible light irradiation resulted in DNA duplex rehybridization and thrombin released. Our work demonstrates that different light wavelengths effectively regulated the adsorption and desorption of thrombin in the same buffer, and this system also can capture and release prothrombin from plasma with different wavelength light. Furthermore, this method can be widely applied {{to a variety of}} different protein separation process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{model of the}} vibrational dynamics of HOONO is investigated. This model focuses on the couplings between the OH stretch vibration and the two torsions. The model is based on electronic energies, calculated at the CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ level of theory and basis and dipole moment functions calculated at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ level. The resulting points were fit to explicit functional forms, and the energies, wave functions, and intensities were evaluated using an approach in which the OH stretching motion was adiabatically separated from the torsional modes. It is found that the HOON torsion is strongly coupled to both the OONO torsion and OH stretch. Despite this, many of the conclusions that were drawn from earlier two-dimensional treatments, which {{did not include the}} OONO torsion, hold up on a semiquantitative level. In addition, we use this model to investigate the assignment of recently <b>reported</b> <b>matrix</b> isolated spectra of HOONO and DOONO. Finally, by comparing the results of this three-dimensional calculation to two-dimensional calculations and to the results of second-order perturbation theory, we investigate the question of how one determines the size of the reduced-dimensional system that is needed to describe the vibrational spectrum of molecules, like HOONO, that contain several large amplitude motions. ...|$|R
