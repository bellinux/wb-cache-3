40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a universal <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> controller to be used with a 8 -wire <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> panels and function as input device for the overlaying system. The controller is imple- mented in a microcontroller and designed to function with <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screens</b> of different sizes and from different vendors. The con- troller enables the determination of the touch status of the screen as well as the touchpoints X-Y position. The controller is designed to function in equipments used in rugged environments. Connection to the overlaying host system is provided through a USB connection. It is adapted to the HID protocol which gives the benefit that the drivers needed are provided in most major operating systems. Because it is common for <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> sensor panels to be misaligned and suffer from problems with linearity, a calibration software for Windows that communicates with the controller has been developed. The resulting prototype is a 8 -wire touch controller that utilizes a robust measuring technique in order to provide accurate and calibrated coordinates even in harsh environments...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{mechanical}} locks to limit entry into space is still predominating today, {{there is a need}} for a more flexible and controllable method of locking and unlocking the door. That method can be represented by the use of an embedded access control system. In the thesis we have developed an embedded system for access control that uses a RFID technology and two-factor authentication, while a server program on a personal computer executes control and surveillance. The system is composed of a microcontroller with ARMv 7 architecture (ARM Cortex-M core), Ethernet module, <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> LCD and RFID card reader. Access control system reads the card number with a RFID card reader and then shows the keypad on the LCD <b>touch</b> <b>screen.</b> When a user enters the PIN code by touching buttons on LCD, the PIN code along with the RFID card identification number are sent to the server that approves or refuses the entry. The server logs user authentication. In this work we have presented the RFID technology and the operation of <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screens.</b> This has been followed by the presentation of the system components and their operation. In the programming part we have described the configuration of modules and the use of DMA devices. We have presented the problem of the mechanical misalignment of the <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> and calibration algorithm. Because of the fact we connect the device to a server via Ethernet, we need to use TCP/IP protocols. We have chosen uIP TCP/IP stack and described the application of it based on embedded system for access control that we have made. We have also presented the finite state automaton of the system and described the server program. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract As use {{of printed}} {{electronics}} is going towards expansion in near future, researchers are studying methods {{for development of}} printed components, and also procedures for driving them. Few low speed but low cost, and flexible stand alone systems e. g., some sensor systems and displays; have already {{made their way to}} market after competing conventional, high speed, high cost, and rigid silicon electronics. At present, there are different type of printed sensors and display matrices, which have been developed but not being used in stand alone systems. Thus, there was a need for demonstrating ‘developed printed electronic components’ in such a way, that they are integrated with other core electronic circuits like embedded systems, to assure their ability to replace individual conventional component. In the thesis, some experiments were conducted to drive printed electronic components while overlooking their manufacturing details; i. e., the circuit used to drive the printed components was not a part of printed technology (e. g., printed processing, memory units), rather a conventional system (e. g., microcontroller and microprocessor boards available in market) is used. Particularly for this project the printed components are meant to be capacitive sensor matrix, <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screen,</b> organic light emitting diodes (OLED) matrix, electrophoretic display matrix, and electrochromic display matrix. These components were interfaced using embedded system {{in such a way that}} they can be driven meaningfully e. g., <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> can control display option for OLED matrix. Embedded Linux has significant advantages over previously used OS and non-OS based solutions as it is robust, scalable, and manage resources efficiently. Such a system with backbone of Linux processing was a part of design, which handled a separately designed interface board capable of interfacing 13 capacitive sensor (maximum 8 pF) inputs, a four wire <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> (with few hundred ohm resistance between terminals), a current driver with 50 mA segment current for 10 x 10 display matrix and voltage range from 0 to 5 V, voltage driver for two led segments capable of dissipate 40 mA at 5 V, finally a voltage driver for separate 10 led segments capable of dissipating 40 mA from 0 to 15 V or a 10 x 10 display matrix with power rating of maximum 16. 9 mA at 0 to 15 V. So, in this way different displays or individual led segments can be interfaced with a system which can download their display configuration from HTTP client based user interface, and upload the capacitive sensor and <b>resistive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> readings back to user. The device was capable of changing demonstration parameters e. g., blinking, animation for displays via user interface, and program structure was kept convertible so that minor changes can create completely new demonstration: interfacing different components. Design included a power board capable of providing stable 1 A supply current at 5 V. A Current-Voltage (I-V) characterizing board was part of design which can measure I-V curve of printed solar cells. Printed electronic components were interfaced with embedded systems without much problem, making one comfortable in conclusion that these individual components are ready to replace conventional components in non-standalone systems at-least...|$|E
