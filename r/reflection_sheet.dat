40|$|Malaysian {{students}} have always faced difficulty in understanding subject-verb agreement(SVA). The {{reason for this}} to happen is because of interference from students’ first language (L 1). However, explicit teaching of this grammar point may increase students’ level of anxiety. Therefore,teachers need to camouflage the teaching by including fun elements in the lesson. Thus, this study aims toinvestigate the effectiveness of using songs in enhancing the understanding of SVA. The study adoptedquasi-experimental design. Thirty-seven primary five pupils from Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Pulai wereinvolved. They were divided into two groups, the experimental group and the control group. Theexperimental group went through the song-based tasks in three different sessions while the control groupresumed normal lesson.

40|$|Autonomy in {{language}} learning suggests that students {{control their own}} learning (Benson, 2001). Students 2 ̆ 7 {{control over their own}} learning consists of three aspects, namely controls over learning management, cognitive process and learning content. This paper aims at exploring stu-dents 2 ̆ 7 control over learning management while working on project-based English language learn-ing, namely the collaborative audio-journal project. It is argued that project-based language learn-ing provides a principled and practicable route toward autonomy (Thomas, 1991, cited in Benson, 2001 : 21). In this regards,students themselves plan, monitor, solve problems, and evaluate the pro-ject accomplishment without much intervention from the teacher. A qualitative method was employed in this study. Two instruments were used to obtain the data, namely <b>reflection</b> <b>sheet</b> and interview. The results obtained from the study revealed that students employed four major controls over learning management, including planning, problem solving, monitoring, and evaluating. The planning included time and quality, creativity, and strategy. The students also encountered the constraints, such as time management, language proficiency, and laziness, which entailed problem solving strategies. The monitoring included rereading, re-listening, and comparing. Lastly, the students conducted self-evaluation on the process and the product.

40|$|The optical simulation, analysis, {{and design}} of {{backlight}} units (BLU) of liquid crystal displays, using ASAP optical modeling software, are introduced in this article. Two major types of BLU, i. e. edge lighting and bottom lighting, and their respective optical components are reviewed. The concerns in optical design of those components, namely the light guide in edge lighting BLU and the diffusion and reflection sheets in the bottom lighting BLU, are discussed. A scattering pattern is usually screen printed under the light guide, on which smaller scattering dots are sparsely located near the light sources while larger scattering dots are more densely distributed away from the sources. A diffusion sheet can be a Lambertian surface or with more sophisticated bidirectional reflection distribution function. The cross section of a <b>reflection</b> <b>sheet</b> {{may look like a}} parabolic curve that can be optimized. The structure of ASAP consists of the pre-processor that creates models and specify optical properties, the processor that calculates optical interactions, and the post-processor that retrieves and manipulates data for more analyses. The general procedure of ASAP analyses and optimizations of both types of BLU is introduced. The ASAP scripting language is powerful enough in optimizing the shape and dimensions of the BLU optical components fore mentioned. Finally the results of a case study of the design analysis for equal irradiance in a bottom lighting BLU are given to depict how the ASAP scripting language is applied to obtain the optimal locations for lamps. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Curriculum and Instruction)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Junior {{high school}} {{continues}} to be a challenging time academically for adolescent students, particularly in mathematics. Student engagement, motivation and achievement drops significantly during this transitional period (Eccles, 2004; Harter, 1998; Simmons & Blyth, 1987; Watt, 2004; Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991; Wigfield, Eccles, & Pintrich, 1996). This thesis examined what was within the teacher's and students' control to help promote achievement and a cultivate a growth mindset in the midst of such obstacles. An original intervention based on growth mindset theory and self-regulated learning strategies was designed by the researcher and implemented by the participating seventh grade pre-algebra teacher. It involved a single period of lower-performing seventh grade pre-algebra students (N= 24). This intervention involved one introductory brain training session, where students were taught about the malleability of their brain and about the importance of having a growth mindset. This was followed by students filling out their own Growth Portfolios {{for the remainder of the}} trimester. These Growth Portfolios had two parts: 1) a Growth Chart (where students documented their own pre-post formative learning progress of grade level standards on a bar graph) and 2) a <b>Reflection</b> <b>Sheet</b> (where students reflected on their progress and effort and planned a way around obstacles). The entire intervention lasted a trimester, roughly 10 weeks of instruction. Grades and mindset scores were calculated before and after the intervention. A post-intervention semi-structured interview was completed with the participating teacher. Students also filled out a final confidential evaluation of their experiences with the intervention upon completion. This quasi-experimental study used mixed methods. Quantitative data showed that the intervention was statistically significant in increasing student achievement (pre-post overall math grades) and in shifting student mindsets up towards a more growth orientation. Qualitative data revealed that overall the teacher and students both found the intervention to be motivating, helpful, and effective. The growth charts were noted as most impactful, while both agreed that the reflection sheets should have been simplified. Limitations and areas of future study are discussed.

40|$|Background Students {{arrive at}} {{university}} with high expectations. Consequently {{they are often}} disappointed. This {{can lead to a}} consumer mentality (‘I have paid for my degree’), and increased attrition rates. Several complex issues affect such behaviour and an obvious starting point is to understand how to manage students’ expectations. Evidence suggests relationships among metacognition, confidence and academic performance. However, boosting confidence per se may be undesirable, as over and under confidence lead to unrealistic expectations. In higher education, the problem is apparent when dissatisfaction when the actual outcome (i. e., grade or classification) does not correspond with students’ expectations. Objective In order to address these issues, underlying cognitive strategies were developed by means of metacognitive instruction and critical reflection. The role and interaction of metacognition and confidence with expectations was investigated to understand if there exists an optimal confidence level for making realistic expectations. Procedure Student participants undertook the instructional and reflection activities, which were neither assessed nor monitored (to encourage disclosure), in part fulfilment of their coursework. Fully informed consent for the analysis of resultant data was given in advance. Students were allocated to a ‘reading’ or ‘questionnaire’ group. They completed an inventory to measure self-reported metacognitive awareness and were asked to predict the time and date they would complete their next assessment and the grade they would be awarded. Metacognitive training materials were uploaded weekly for the 6 -week study period. Group 1 completed a reading activity each week. Group 2 completed a questionnaire-type activity. All materials focused on metacognition. In addition, each week, participants critically reflected using a structured <b>reflection</b> <b>sheet.</b> At the end of the 6 -week period, the inventories were again administered. Baseline scores from the inventories were compared with post study scores, content analysis was conducted on the reflections and students’ predicted dates and grades were compared with actual dates and grades. Results Metacognitive awareness and knowledge increased from before to after the study (according to the inventories and the reflection spreadsheets). A negative association was noted between prediction accuracy and both high and low metacognition (assessed using the inventories). A positive correlation was noted between prediction accuracy and high metacognition (assessed using the reflection spreadsheets). Conclusions In order to make realistic predictions, metacognitive skills, including deep self-awareness and monitoring, need to be developed. Content analysis was a better predictor of improvement than using self-report measures. ...|$|E
40|$|Key Points •	Getting the Measure {{training}} and resources {{have been effective}} in encouraging frontline workers to discuss alcohol with service users, and has been particularly useful for staff who work to the Key Worker Practice Model. •	The AI training was successful in improving staff confidence and knowledge levels {{and to a lesser}} extent on staff attitudes. •	While most staff felt it was appropriate for them to discuss alcohol with their clients, some groups of staff have been less able to implement alcohol interventions than others. This is partly due to a difficulty within some services in raising the issue of alcohol in a way that feels relevant and appropriate. A key challenge for Cyrenians is finding solutions to the identified barriers to implementing AI in these settings. •	There is a need for further research into the potential use of a validated screening tool to assist staff in accurately capturing the drinking patterns and related risk of the clients they work with and assessing their suitability for the Cyrenians alcohol intervention. •	The training had a positive impact on staff knowledge about Motivational Interviewing (MI) approaches and confidence in implementing these and wider behaviour change approaches, through case file analysis it was difficult to assess whether these techniques were being applied in practice. •	Staff identified a number of ongoing support materials and training that would help them to more fully implement AI in practice including refresher courses on MI, clearer visual prompts, accessible written information for clients, and guidance relating to units and limits for under 18 year olds. About the Evaluation The evaluation used a mixed method approach. Pre and post course questionnaires, with follow up questionnaires at 3 and 6 month intervals were completed by staff (n= 39) who had attended the AI training, combined with 13 qualitative interviews, the analysis of 22 case files and two validation groups with 12 members of staff. The research was carried out and report written by Julie Dowds and Steven McCluskey of Create Consultancy Ltd. The {{training and}} evaluation was commissioned by Cyrenians Scotland and was funded by the Comic Relief UK grants programme. Background Edinburgh Cyrenians is a charity that aims to make a difference in the lives of people who are at risk from poverty and homelessness, many of whom struggle to recognise the direct impact of alcohol use on their health and everyday lives. Cyrenians recognised this, and their experience of specialist alcohol services being over-subscribed or not aimed at working with vulnerable people, as a challenge for staff in being able to effectively support individuals with their alcohol use and related problems. The Comic Relief UK funded Getting the Measure: alcohol intervention project has been in operation since October 2008 and was a response to these identified challenges. The project aimed to build internal capacity to enable staff to more effectively address problematic alcohol use among its service users. The one day training course, jointly developed and delivered by STRADA, aimed to develop awareness and knowledge of alcohol use, equip staff with tools, including motivational interviewing, to be able to talk about alcohol with service users, and develop an understanding of units, drinking limits and harm reduction strategies. Alongside the training a number of resources were developed to aid staff. This included the “Getting the Measure” website with downloadable resources and support materials. Training was delivered to 52 staff members in 2010. The design of the training was informed by the available evidence in relation to alcohol early interventions and good practice within the homelessness field. In addition, it was based upon many of the underlying principles and elements which are common to an alcohol brief intervention approach while being mindful of the complex circumstances and needs of Cyrenians service users. It aimed to address barriers and promote the implementation of AI in practice. This research used engagement with staff to assess the effectiveness of the training and resources in supporting them to discuss alcohol with their clients and to explore the effectiveness of the model for wider use. “I found the course very informative and [it] has given me confidence in approaching people’s drinking. ” An Adapted Model “Knowing all about it [alcohol] is the biggest thing so that if it arises I have that knowledge and background. ” The Cyrenians alcohol intervention model draws upon and incorporates some of the key principles and elements of a brief intervention on alcohol approach including a focus on non-threatening ways of raising the issue of alcohol, exploring alcohol consumption, assessing risk, and providing information and feedback. It uses Motivational Interviewing techniques, provides harm reduction advice and assesses and supports an individual’s readiness to change. Adaptations were made to the widely practiced brief intervention approach to reflect the complex needs of the client group and include: •	The incorporation of the intervention into key-work as part of ongoing case management support rather than a one off intervention •	A focus on building clients motivation, knowledge and skills to change and supporting them through the change process with less of an emphasis on self help •	No formal or validated screening tool, in response to concerns about appropriateness, and the negative impact this might have on the client and key worker relationship •	The introduction of assessment, monitoring and planning tools to plan and monitor changes in alcohol use and related problems on an ongoing case management basis. Findings from the Questionnaires •	Prior to the training few respondents discussed any aspect of alcohol on a weekly basis. Few respondents indicated that they had used the key components of brief interventions on alcohol on a regular basis, and over half had never or only a few times in their career provided written information related to sensible drinking. •	At all stages of the evaluation the majority of respondents felt that it was very important for Cyrenians staff to be able to address clients’ drinking behaviour. •	Respondent perceptions of how knowledgeable they felt on alcohol related statements increased after training. This increase was statistically significant. •	There was some positive improvement post training on the average ratings given by respondents on how much they agreed with attitude statements relating to how alcohol issues can be addressed, however only three of these increases were statistically significant. This may reflect the already favourable attitudes held by participants prior to training and/or ongoing concerns by some participants about the legitimacy of them raising the issue of alcohol in some situations. •	Respondent confidence levels in managing a series of alcohol related statements increased after training and were largely maintained at 3 and 6 months. This increase was statistically significant. •	The largest increases in knowledge and confidence related to statements specific to the use of MI and wider behaviour change approaches, though at each stage of the evaluation some of these statements were given the lowest knowledge and confidence scores. •	The majority of respondents indicated that they had found the training very useful or useful. Feedback included perceived improvement in knowledge and skills, increased confidence, a consolidation of previous learning and an opportunity to reflect on practice. “It’s given me more confidence to discuss this quite openly with people and people have been very responsive to it. ” Following training all respondents indicated that they would integrate AI into practice. Findings from Qualitative Approaches •	The majority of interviewees indicated that the training had positively impacted on their practice. •	Key facilitators for implementation included units information and the unit calculators, increased knowledge and confidence from training, opportunities to put learning into practice particularly through alcohol questions being part of the personal plan, and having an awareness of MI. •	Questions were raised about the appropriateness of the AI approach with some client groups e. g. younger clients, clients with learning disabilities, clients that indicate that they don’t have alcohol issues or are unable or unwilling to admit to alcohol use. •	Other barriers to implementation included lack of opportunity for certain staffing groups to raise the issue of alcohol, feeling that certain services did not lend themselves to discussing alcohol use, loss of knowledge and confidence if AI is not used regularly, and feelings amongst some staff that alcohol is a taboo subject. •	While overall interviewees were positive about AI as an approach, notes of caution included the recognition of multiple client support needs and competing priorities, the need to raise alcohol at an appropriate time and place, and an awareness of literacy issues among some clients which impact on their ability to engage with the materials. •	Interviewees identified a number of ongoing support needs with suggestions of revision courses, advanced training, peer support and specialist agency input into team meetings. •	Case file analysis indicated greater and improved focus on alcohol with staff more likely to raise the issue of alcohol with clients. In addition that client alcohol consumption and related problems are being more effectively monitored and that some staff are exploring alcohol consumption more effectively at initial contact. “I think it has a lot to do with the person you are working with and where they are in terms of admitting that their drinking has become problematic. ” A number of issues were identified in the case file analysis including inconsistencies in how staff are assessing risk in levels and patterns of consumption, the quality of discussion on alcohol and information recorded. Actions were often described in vague and general terms, and it was difficult to identify from the case notes whether certain stages of the AI were being applied in practice. Key Conclusions •	In general the “Getting the Measure” training has had a significant impact on staff ability to raise the issue of alcohol. Where there has been less impact is among the services and staffing groups that follow the Key Worker Light approach and where there was no built relationship between practitioner and client. This was confirmed in the validation groups. •	Analysis indicates that while for many staff the training had a positive and sustained impact on their knowledge and skills relating to the assessment of risk, for others some inconsistencies were apparent. The validation process confirmed that the alcohol consumption questions used do not always accurately capture the drinking patterns and related risk of some clients. Some staff may benefit from further information and guidance in relation to units of alcohol and recommended limits, and assessing a client’s suitability for AI. •	There is some indication that the training has had a positive impact on staff knowledge and use of motivational interviewing and wider behaviour change approaches though it was difficult to assess from the case files whether MI approaches techniques and tools were being used in practice. Further training and tools which support the use of these techniques were identified as being useful. •	Specific factors which were identified as supporting the process of raising the issue and carrying out alcohol interventions were the development of staff confidence and recognition that clients won’t generally be offended when alcohol is discussed, the changes in paperwork which provide prompts and support raising the issue, and the provision of materials such as unit wheels and cups. Suggestions for additional support include refresher courses, opportunities for peer support and clear visual prompts and materials for use with clients. Recommendations for Action •	The development of tailored training for differing staffing groups to address specific concerns. •	The development of refresher sessions incorporating opportunities for staff to practice their skills and receive feedback, share good practice and specific example from practice, and opportunities for reflective practice supported by a practice <b>reflection</b> <b>sheet</b> that outlines the core components of the AI approach. •	The ongoing development of visual and tactile resources to help assess risk and carry out specific behaviour change techniques. Suggestions include the continuum of risk arrow and visual prompts for MI and behaviour change techniques. These would be in addition to the resources currently available on the Getting the Measure website. •	Further exploration into the potential use of a validated screening tool, which includes consideration of issues such as whether service users would perceive the use of such tools to be a legitimate part of the role of Cyrenians staff, and takes into account the differences in worker/client relationships across the range of Cyrenians services. •	Development of 2 nd stage research with a focus on the engagement of clients to explore issues around role legitimacy and impact of the intervention...|$|E

The data collection process included collecting teacher <b>reflection</b> <b>sheets</b> on the professional development sessions, reflecting on grade-level lesson using a culturally relevant reflection tool, interviewing six individual teachers, and interviewing the other eight teachers in a focus group. In the end, the teachers went through a transformation during the professional development sessions and as a result, they linked what they learned back to their teaching in the classroom. The themes that supported the teachers??? understanding the characteristics of culturally relevant teaching were caring and honoring the students in the classrooms, developing empathy for the students, and the teachers??? evolving selfidentity. Effective teaching practices that supported CRT in order to support the students??? development were the teachers??? developing cultural competence, becoming more self-reflective with regards to their teaching, and creating critically conscious lessons/practices. Teacher collaboration, trust and professional development, and effective site leadership were found to be essential in planning and following through with effective professional development...|$|R

Abuilding Beijing subway line 10 is traversed by a thermal {{pipeline}} in China. To ensure the progress and safety of the subway tunnel, the deformation monitoring of the tunnel structure is necessary. The terrestrial laser scanning technology is applied to monitor the deformation of subway tunnel structure. The paper puts forward a method of three-dimension integral deformation monitoring of subway tunnel structure. This method can obtain the three-dimension integral deformation tendency, which help to provide mechanics analysis on the deformation of tunnel construction and provides the technical support for the design, construction and management. The monitoring project is introduced. Firstly, within the deformation district of subway tunnel, the annular closed survey control network is set along the line of the up-down rail. Secondly, put a set of cross section every 3 m to 5 m following the middle line of tunnel. Set the <b>reflection</b> <b>sheets</b> on the arch, vertical wall, rail subgrade, etc. Then collect the point clouds information by three-dimension lidar scanner. After data joint and registering, the three-dimension model of tunnel structure is established. Thirdly, adopt automatic electronic total station to monitor the deformation of tunnel structure by fixed stationing. Finally, according to data processing and analysis using a model interpolation method, the deformation of subway tunnel is fitted finally. Thus we can obtain the 3 D image of the subway deformation in a precision, stereo and visual way. 1...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 49 - 50). As teachers, we {{strive to}} help every student be successful {{and develop a}} love for learning. We want, and expect, that every child can and will be successful. However, we are still falling short of our goal. Too much time is spent on whole group instruction that only reaches the middle. Students do not learn {{at the same rate}} or with the same methods as their peers. I propose the solution to this is developing a self-paced, individualized classroom. A classroom in which students are allowed to learn at their own pace and take control of their learning. In this study I analyzed data taken from my classroom of 7 th and 8 th grade mathematics students. I studied how taking control of their learning affected their attitude and understanding of mathematics. I observed student behaviors, conversations and interactions. I designed units, daily guides and <b>reflection</b> <b>sheets</b> that students completed to monitor their learning. The results showed increases in students' abilities to learn independently. Mathematics learning increased. The study showed an increase of between 11 - 55 % more math standards attained during the school year. Besides the mathematical knowledge gained, my students learned how to use an informational text (math book) to gain understanding and clarity about a topic. They learned how to take initiative and ask for help when needed. Students learned to trust one another and seek help and lessons from peers. The results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} have a successful, independent self-paced learning environment in mathematics...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recruitment {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{challenges}} in performing randomized controlled trials. Often clinical trials with participants diagnosed with schizophrenia are terminated prematurely because of recruitment challenges resulting in a considerable waste of resources in the form of time, funding, and the participants' efforts. Dropout rates in schizophrenia trials are also high. Recruitment challenges are often due to patients not wanting to participate in research but can also be due to clinicians' concerns regarding individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia as participants in research. This paper reports how overcoming recruitment challenges not related to patients revealed high readiness to take part and low dropout rates in a one year long randomized controlled trial testing Guided Self-Determination (GSD) among outpatients with schizophrenia receiving treatment in Assertive Outreach Teams in the northern part of Denmark. Methods: GSD is a shared decision-making and mutual problem-solving method using <b>reflection</b> <b>sheets,</b> which was developed in diabetes care and adjusted for this study and utilized by patients with schizophrenia. Descriptive data on strategies to overcome recruitment challenges were derived from notes and observations made during the randomized controlled trial testing of GSD in six outpatient teams. Results: Three types of recruitment challenges not related to patients were identified and met during the trial: 1) organizational challenges, 2) challenges with finding eligible participants and 3) challenges with having professionals invite patients to participate. These challenges were overcome through: 1) extension of time, 2) expansion of the clinical recruitment area and 3) encouragement of professionals to invite patients to the study. Through overcoming these challenges, we identified a remarkably high patient-readiness to take part (101 of 120 asked accepted) and a low dropout rate (8 %). Conclusion: Distinction between recruitment challenges was important in discovering the readiness among patients with schizophrenia to take part in and complete a trial with the GSD-intervention...|$|R

This research is categorized as descriptive qualitative research. It involved 7 th grade students of SMP Negeri 4 Pakem Yogyakarta of 2012 - 2013 academic year as the participants. The instruments were the researcher himself (the interviewer), interview guideline, observation <b>sheets,</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>sheets,</b> and a voice recorder. The data were collected through observations and interviews. The data were in the form of field notes and interview transcript. The trustworthiness was gained through the triangulation technique which involved the English teachers. The researcher also made data categorization before formulating the findings. The findings of the study describe six factors that cause language anxiety. The first factor is type of task which demands classroom presentation. Students were afraid if their weaknesses are being exposed in front of the classroom participants. The second is fear of making mistakes during students‟ speaking performance which commonly happened are on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. The third is the role of the language teachers related to teachers‟ ability to maintain suitable teaching and learning process for the students. The fourth is self perception or self esteem. It is about students‟ thought and estimation towards their own capability in mastering the speaking skill. The next is gap of competence which refers to students‟ competence in speaking compared with others. The last is limited exposure to English. It is related to students‟ lack of practice and experience on speaking which affects their confidence and ability in speaking...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} perspectives of 21 emotional intelligence (EI) trainers working in New Zealand to identify variables {{that contribute to the}} design of successful EI training. The development of EI abilities has been established as making a positive and observable difference to employee performance in the workplace. Therefore from an organisational and an individual perspective it is desirable to develop EI skills. While the importance of the contribution of EI theory is well established and reported in the academic literature, {{the perspectives of}} EI trainers who conduct this training has been largely under-represented and unreported. This research explores the perspectives of EI trainers to find out what variables contribute the success design of successful EI training. The study uses an Action Research (AR) approach which is an iterative process of exploration, action and evaluation for the purpose of gaining greater understanding of the phenomenon under inquiry. The process is repeated until the desired understanding and pragmatic outcomes are reached. AR is a useful methodology for this study as it is a new field of research and therefore as a researcher I needed to respond to the findings as they emerged. The analysis of findings uses data from interviews, World Café <b>reflection</b> <b>sheets,</b> on-line descriptive surveys and researcher observations, depending on the stage of the AR process. The findings highlighted the strong alignment of EI trainer practice with EI theory, which reinforces the need for their ‘voice’ to be represented in academic literature. Discrete roles of academic, consultant and practitioner were identified within the generic term ‘EI trainer’ which has implications for learners, trainers and organisations. Successful EI training outcomes were also predicated on the importance of self-awareness for EI development, and the need to design a safe learning environment characterised by trust and observable through learners’ readiness to talk about issues in which they felt vulnerable. Two models were developed based on the findings. Firstly, the Emotional Intelligence Learning Environment model highlights the complexity of the learning environment which needs managing. The model is useful for helping EI trainers design their training programs {{in such a way as}} to create a safe learning environment so that learners are able to navigate the turmoil and chaos they experience in the process of achieving EI development. The second model, the Self-awareness Engine of Growth Model was designed to assist EI trainers to develop learners’ self-awareness, a key component that learners need to increase their EI. Additionally, EI trainers taking part in the study tended to practice in relative isolation from one another and expressed the desire to connect and engage with others. In response to this need, a symposium for EI trainers was organised, with the theme “Connect, Network, Engage. ” The symposium was evaluated in terms of its contribution toward building a fledgling EI training community of practice...|$|R

40|$|The HIV and AIDS crisis can be {{presented}} as a socio-ecological issue, with an ever-increasing impact on both human beings and the environment. Teaching about socio-ecological issues and the consideration of individual capabilities has become crucial within HIV and AIDS education programmes. Issues of deforestation, land degradation and other environmental problems have worsened {{since the advent of}} HIV and AIDS, especially in developing countries. The My Future is My Choice (MFMC) programme has been identified as an important HIV and AIDS education initiative that caters for young people in Namibian secondary schools (Grades 8 - 12). One of the themes within the programme (Facing HIV and AIDS) is highlighted in this study. This study was constituted as a case study of one school in rural Omuthiya, in the Oshikoto region. The study investigated the opportunities for the integration of a focus on socio-ecological issues and risks, within the MFMC education programme. The study also investigated {{the way in which the}} program develops learners‟ capabilities to respond to HIV and AIDS related socio-ecological issues and risks/vulnerabilities. The study also presents the constraints and enabling factors influencing the implementation of the programme. This study used a qualitative, interpretive case study methodology. The research methods included the analysis of eight documents and nineteen semi-structured interviews, with the Programme Coordinator, the Programme Facilitator, the School Principal and with the programme participants. The analysis also included two focus group discussions with a group of learners; and two classroom observations; and the learners' submissions (<b>reflection</b> <b>sheets).</b> Convenience sampling was used, and ethical issues were taken into consideration throughout the study. The study revealed the following as key findings:  The aims and objectives of the HIV and AIDS education programme can enhance and constrain the development of capabilities, as well as opportunities and challenges for the integration of a focus on socio-environmental issues and risks as additional learning content.  Teaching and learning methods that are participatory and rooted within the learner centered approach can make the integration of HIV and AIDS inherent socio-environmental issues and risks into the MFMC education programme possible.  The values and beliefs inherent within the MFMC education programme stand as opportunities for the successful development of capabilities in the education programme. The study concluded by recommending that capabilities within the MFMC programme be developed through teaching learners about their rights, respect for human dignity, and the right to health and to living the life free from discriminatory practices, as a moral entitlement of each and every individual. While teaching learners about their right to health and the importance of healthy diets, this study found that the programme could include learning about food production and handling practices for the benefit of those living with HIV and AIDS, while caring for the environment. Another recommendation was that future research should consider actively involving young people in decision-making with regard to the programme, as this will allow them to choose and decide on what knowledge and skills they need and want to acquire. The study further explained that this will promote the programme participants‟ sense of agency, and their freedom to choose what they value being and doing as an important element in enhancing learner capabilities. Ultimately, this will also enable the learners to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge they need in order to respond to the socio-ecological problems they face in their communities...|$|R
