40|$|Raman spectroscopic {{studies were}} carried out for hybrid polymer thin films {{prepared}} for photonic applications by the sol-gel technology. Our aims were to analyse the ability of the Raman method to estimate the efficiency of the main reactions of the sol-gel process and to provide information about the chemical composition of the films as well as their thickness, profile, and quality. The difficulties in meas-urement such as low level of Raman signals, difficulties in data analysis caused by the complex structure of the materials, and the influence of interfering signals, are discussed. The application of Raman micros-copy for characterising films based on 3 -glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTS), methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPTS), and 3 -aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (APTES) is presented. The efficiencies of reactions of inorganic and organic polymerisation were measured and their products have been identified. The influence of the excitation beam wavelength as well as the type of substrate on the Raman spectra was investigated. Moreover, two-dimensional Raman mapping enabled us to <b>record</b> <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> profiles of the deposited structures and to detect their defects.

However, data on the effects and comparison of these specific exercises on the cervical muscle morphology are insufficient or lacking. Objective: To investigate the effects of different exercise treatments on neck muscles in patients with chronic neck pain. Design: A randomized study. Methods: Fifty-six patients with chronic neck pain were randomized into 3 groups as follows: Pilates group (n[*]=[*] 20), yoga group (n[*]=[*] 18) and isometric group (n[*]=[*] 18). Demographics and background information were <b>recorded.</b> <b>The</b> <b>thickness</b> and cross-sectional area of neck muscles were evaluated by ultrasound imaging.

The study {{was carried out in}} the Wadden Sea on the islands of Schiermonnikoog (NL), Terschelling (NL) and the peninsula of Skallingen (DK). Firstly, we <b>recorded</b> <b>the</b> presence of sand in the sediment representing initial salt-marsh formation. The results indicate that part of the salt marsh developed under conditions that were dynamically enough for sand to be transported. The spatial distribution of these conditions depends on soil elevation and location on the marsh, modified by the presence of artificial sand dikes. Further we <b>recorded</b> <b>the</b> presence and <b>thickness</b> of sand layers within the salt-marsh sediment. Sand layers are found on twenty percent of the marsh area and are partly associated with the local sources of the sand, i. e. marsh creeks, the salt-marsh edge and washovers. In total, sand layers contribute less than ten percent to the volume of marsh deposits on Schiermonnikoog. We dated the layers using <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> of <b>the</b> deposits and known marsh age. The ages of the layers indicate that for the decadal occurrence of storms capable of depositing sand in the salt marsh, the local hydrodynamics and availability of sand determine whether a site receives sand or not (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} applications of photopolymers is as holographic recording materials for holographic memories.

In recent years many 2 -dimensional models have been proposed for the analysis of photopolymers. Good agreement between theoretical simulations and experimental results has been obtained for layers thinner than 200 µm.

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the axial {{stiffness}} values of the CFRP confined columns were lower than those of the unwrapped heat-damaged specimens that have been subjected to the same heating regimen: compared to control heated specimens, a reduction in axial stiffness of about 33 and 24 % was observed in CH 2 -C 1 L and CH 3 -C 1 L, respectively. This discrepancy in the axial stiffness values is probably associated with the non homogeneity of the concrete and the inevitable variability between the different column specimens. In fact, researchers (Bisby et al. 2011) confirmed that thermal exposure aggravates non homogeneities in the concrete. Moreover, confinement provided by the FRP wraps is not expected to be fully activated until reaching the maximum strength of the heated unconfined concrete after which continuous pressure is applied on the concrete core up to the failure (rupture) of the FRP wraps. Nonetheless, the overall effect of <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> of <b>the</b> wrapping sheets on axial stiffness is still obvious. Within the same category of heating duration and type of FRP wraps, the enhancement in axial stiffness achieved when using two layers of the FRP wraps was notable: Compared to the case where a single layer of the CFRP sheets were used, an increase of 8.6 and 3.9 % was <b>recorded</b> upon increasing <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> of <b>the</b> wrap in the CH 2 and CH 3 specimens, respectively.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and sonographic features {{in patients with}} endometrial malignancy in whom endometrial thickness on ultrasound examination had been recorded in our database to be < 5 mm. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study on 187 consecutive patients diagnosed with endometrial malignancy in whom an ultrasound evaluation of the endometrium had been performed in our institution. The characteristics of those patients presenting with an endometrial thickness < 5 mm were analyzed. RESULTS: <b>The</b> median endometrial <b>thickness</b> was 15 mm: 12 mm for the women who underwent endometrial sampling before ultrasound examination vs. 17 mm in {{those who did not}} (P = 0. 0086). In 13 women (6. 9 %), <b>the</b> endometrial <b>thickness</b> <b>recorded</b> in our database was < 5 mm. In 12 of these the measurement was compromised in some way: nine of these patients had undergone endometrial sampling (Pipelle biopsy in one and dilatation and curettage in eight patients) before the ultrasound examination, in two cases, focal malignant lesions were not included in <b>the</b> <b>recorded</b> endometrial <b>thickness</b> and in one, <b>the</b> endometrial <b>thickness</b> was visualized poorly due to myometrial distortion. In only one case was was the endometrium correctly measured to be < 5 mm; this woman had diffuse uterine and endometrial metastases of a breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: A thin and regular endometrial line is very reliable for the exclusion of endometrial carcinoma. The suspicion of focal lesions as well as incomplete visualization of the endometrium on sonography should be considered abnormal. Recently performed endometrial sampling makes measurement of <b>the</b> endometrial <b>thickness</b> unreliable. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Authors {{investigated}} 75 {{patients with}} uterine myomas, appraising whether fibroid pseudocapsule (FP) thickness {{varies depending on}} fibroid location, by a prospective cohort trial (level of evidence II- 2) settled in University-affiliated Hospitals. Uteri were scanned via bidimensional and power Doppler ultrasound (US) to map <b>the</b> fibroids and <b>record</b> <b>the</b> FP <b>thickness,</b> prior to hyster-ectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids. After hysterectomy, FP specimens were sampled and analyzed by pathologists. Ultra-sound and histology data were matched. Pseudocapsule thickness of 108 fibroids was measured: subserosal fibroids (SSFs), intramural fibroids (IMFs), and fibroids near the endometrial cavity (FEC). The FEC’s pseudocapsules were considerably thicker than those of IMF and SSF measured by US and histology (P. 001). A clear cutoff existed between FEC pseudocapsule thickness and all other pseudocapsules, with significant differences observed at 2 mm (P. 001). Similarity between histological and US measurements was observed only with IMF pseudocapsules, whereas FEC or SSF showed significant differences. The pseudocap-sule of fibroids is considerably thicker near the endometrial cavity when compared to those of both IMFs and SSFs. Since fibroids closest to the endometrial cavity are the most involved in fertility and infertility and FP is considerably thicker near the endome-trial cavity, {{it is possible to}} hypothesize an involvement of FP of fibroid near the endometrium since FP contains many neuropep-tides and neurotransmitters that are physiologically active, even if these data may take on a broader meaning in a study on a larger number of patients...|$|R

30|$|Floods {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{processes}} contributing to sediment discharge from land to ocean. However, there are few proxies available that are able to quantitatively record flood events. Annually laminated lake sediments provide a rare opportunity to visualize sediment layers deposited by floods and to compare <b>the</b> age and <b>thickness</b> of flood layers with the timing and magnitude of heavy precipitation events in <b>the</b> observational <b>record.</b> Suzuki et al. (2016) conducted such a study using sediment cores recovered from Lake Suigetsu that <b>record</b> <b>the</b> history of the last ~ 370  years. Their results are promising because <b>the</b> sediments <b>record</b> flood events that were caused mostly by typhoons and their work demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> of a given flood layer faithfully <b>records</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of heavy precipitation.|$|R

40|$|The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) {{is used by}} {{dermatologic}} {{investigators to}} assess psoriasis disease severity. PASI measures are time-consuming and require trained personnel. We developed and evaluated a structured PASI-like instrument for self-measurement of psoriasis disease severity for use in future large-scale epidemiologic studies. The instrument consisted of a silhouette of a body for patients to shade in affected areas and of three modified visual analog scales for <b>recording</b> <b>the</b> redness, <b>thickness,</b> and scaliness of an average lesion. The resulting “patient PASI” score was compared to investigator PASI measurements in 43 patients with mild to severe psoriasis. Patients and investigator also recorded a subjective global severity score. The patient PASI score was highly predictive of the investigator PASI score (r 2 = 0. 71, p < 0. 0001) and the investigator global score (r 2 = 0. 37, p < 0. 0001). The patient global score was also predictive of the investigator PASI (r 2 = 0. 18, p < 0. 0053) and the investigator global score (r 2 = 0. 10, p < 0. 044), but these relationships exhibit wide predicted confidence intervals. Following the initial evaluation by 18. 4 ± 9. 1 d of therapy, one-way t tests for paired samples (pre and post) showed significant improvements in the patient PASI (p < 0. 003) and investigator PASI (p < 0. 05). We conclude that although patients' overall scores may not allow for accurate prediction of clinical disease severity in a single individual, this structured instrument facilitates prediction of psoriasis disease severity in a population...|$|R
