40|$|In {{recent years}} the health and social care, and {{education}} sectors {{have been subject to}} a range of policy initiatives which have been characterised by a concern for 'modernisation' and <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>workforce.</b> This has resulted in a reappraisal and so-called 'professionalisation' of many existing previously low-skill roles, and the development of new intermediate or 'assistant practitioner' roles, such as 'parent support advisors' and higher-level teaching assistants in schools. In health care, in pay bands three and four, there has been the inclusion of associate and assistant practitioner roles to support the 'professional' workforce in bands five and above. The 'professionalisation' of roles in the public sector has been associated with enhanced qualification requirements, and foundation degrees (FDs) have provided an appropriate work-based qualification. This paper explores notions of professional learning and professionalism in the current policy context, and draws out points of commonality and divergence between the two sectors. In light of recent concern about broadening access to the professions, this discussion is related to a critique of the potential role of 'assistant practitioner' roles and associated intermediate-level FD qualifications in widening access to the professions in these two sectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} Early Years Framework, {{launched}} in Scotland in 2008, was to improve outcomes for young children, reflecting global trends in the repositioning of early childhood education and care and in the professionalisation of those working in these settings. One part of this framework is a mandatory requirement for leaders of early years establishments to attain the Standard for Childhood Practice through a Childhood Practice Award, equivalent to an undergraduate degree. This repositioning and <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>workforce</b> has {{had a number of}} implications, explored in this article. The challenges have been to design programmes that address mandatory requirements, meet the needs of experienced professionals in full-time employment and support the transition into adult learning. Through this learning journey, professional identities are reconstructed and the sector professionalised through academicisation, which has resulted in a number of challenges for the wider education workforce. This article draws on empirical research with Childhood Practice students, who discuss their response to this initiative. The shift in professional identity and change in professional status has resulted in issues of perception and parity, particularly in relation to teachers, and raises further structural and pedagogical questions about the remodelling of the early years workforce...|$|R

This article reports focus group research which reflects upon that relationship. It argues that we must also understand the significance of place {{if we are to}} make sense of the ways in which women's domestic and working lives are shaped and their action in response to structural change. The research is situated in an old industrial city which has experienced very fundamental processes <b>of</b> <b>restructuring.</b> Changes in the nature of work, the move from full to part time, from permanent, skilled manual to casual semi and unskilled work has been reflected in the gendered <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>workforce</b> and a considerable rise in male unemployment.

These groups were important as a way of gaining access to women who were at a particular point in the lifestage when the dominant concerns might be expected to be domestic ones.

40|$|Excerpt] This {{document}} {{responds to}} {{questions that the}} Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and {{the staff of the}} Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have received regarding their estimates {{of the effects of the}} Affordable Care Act (ACA). In their original analysis of the impact of the legislation, CBO and JCT estimated that, on balance, the number of people obtaining coverage through their employer would be about 3 million lower in 2019 under the legislation than under prior law. As reflected in CBO’s latest baseline projections, the two agencies now anticipate that, because of the ACA, about 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case under prior law. [...] . The analysis presented here explains two of the key assumptions about employers’ behavior that affect CBO and JCT’s estimates of the effects of the ACA and presents a range of estimates of sources of insurance coverage and federal budgetary outcomes that would result from the ACA under certain alternative assumptions. The analysis also shows how CBO and JCT’s estimates might differ if firms were able to, and ultimately decided to, undertake more widespread <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> their <b>workforces</b> than is reflected in the baseline projections—through strategies such as shifting more of their lower-wage workers into separate firms, contracting for the services of more such workers from other companies, or shifting their workforces toward part-time workers instead of fulltime workers...|$|R

40|$|Background: The nursing {{workforce}} {{is critical}} to improving patient outcomes. Without adequate evidence to guide decision making, <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the nursing <b>workforce</b> to meet increasingly complex patient care needs {{in the context of}} registered nurse shortages might fail to produce desired outcomes. Objective: To develop a suite of nursing-sensitive outcome indicators for monitoring the safety of multi-day adult medical and surgical patients associated with nurse workloads and nursing workforce models. Design: A feasibility study was conducted. Setting: Adult acute metropolitan public hospitals in Western Australia. Data sources: Patient data for testing the suite were sourced from 2006 to 2010 coded discharge morbidity abstracts. Method: Indicator development followed the American Nurses Association (2011) approach: clarifying indicator scope and purpose; determining selection criteria; reviewing the literature for potential indicators; identifying data sources; review by experts; documenting each indicator; and determining baselines. Results: The proposed suite comprises 9 indicators pertaining to medical and surgical patients: failure-to-rescue; in-hospital 30 -day mortality; average length of stay; hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, sepsis, pneumonia and pressure injuries; falls with injury occurring in hospital; nurse staffing levels (comprising skill mix and nursing care hours per patient day). Conclusions: Sufficiently robust administrative data is available to calculate retrospective monthly and annual rates of nursing-sensitive outcomes at unit level and further analysed by ward category for metropolitan patients. Further work is required to pilot test the suite and develop processes for reporting to the Department of Health and hospitals on the impact of nurse staffing and care delivery models on patient outcome...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of maternal health services is adequate, skilled human resources (Campbell and Graham, 2006; WHO, 2006). Paying and motivating this key resource {{is just as important as}} ensuring that enough workers are in place to provide the service. At the same time, health financing policy implementation especially in low-income countries requires hard decisions about priorities for channelling limited resources, and the use of staff incentives may come into competition with other claims for resource prioritization (Ensor and Ronoh, 2005). It is important, therefore, to be able to produce evidence for the desirability and expected efficacy of offering financial incentives to staff. A methodology to assess the incentives to deliver maternal health services was developed out of three Immpact evaluations of maternal health care interventions in Ghana, Indonesia and Burkina Faso. Although in each of the initial Immpact evaluations (see Module 2 and Module 3 for more information) the effect on human resources was considered important, the initial development of this tool was undertaken during a project in Cambodia which examined the <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the medical <b>workforce</b> in a context of very low public spending on wages. A key question in that study was to determine how great a financial incentive is required to ensure that public sector health workers remain in their posts rather than spending part of their working hours in private practice, leaving the public sector entirely, or engaging other activities to boost their income – alternative opportunities that often motivate public health workers in many, if not most, low- and middle-income countries. Immpact’s experience showed also that financial incentives are particularly useful when scaling up a public health policy intervention, when there is a need to attract skilled staff to less popular areas of work (for instance in remoter locations) in order to be able to implement the policy comprehensively and effectively...|$|R
