40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} for small developed economies finds that consumption is procyclical and as volatile as output, and <b>real</b> <b>net</b> exports are coutercyclical. Earlier studies {{have not been}} able to reproduce these regularities in a DSGE small open economy model when productivity shocks drive the business cycles and households have a normal intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Instead, these studies have reduced this elasticity to make consumption more procyclical and volatile and <b>real</b> <b>net</b> exports countercyclical. This paper shows that a standard model can reproduce these regularities, without lowering the intertemporal substitution, if the terms of trade and foreign interest rate are added as source of business cycle fluctuations. These shocks, compared to productivity shocks, make consumption and investment more volatile and procyclical relative to output, and make <b>real</b> <b>net</b> exports countercyclical. <b>Terms</b> of trade;Productivity;External shocks;Economic models;net exports, open economy, export sector, elasticity of substitution, aggregate consumption, trade shocks, terms of trade shocks, trade shock, tradable goods, nontradable goods, current account balance, political economy, domestic demand, open economies, aggregate demand, exportable sector, economic indicators, trade effects, terms of trade effects, fixed investment, importable goods, domestic production, domestic goods, domestic firms, export good, foreign trade, prices of exports...|$|R

Based on an analysis over a sample period from 1975 Q 1 to 2005 Q 1, the authors determine that the leading-indicator properties of the narrow monetary aggregates for output growth have shifted over time and that, since 1993, real M 1 + has become a better indicator of future output growth than <b>real</b> gross and <b>net</b> M 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{seeks to}} {{estimate}} the long run behavioral equilibrium exchange rate in Nigeria. The empirical analysis builds on quarterly data from 1986 Q 1 to 2006 Q 4 and derives a Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) and a Permanent Equilibrium Exchange Rate (PEER). The econometric analysis starts by analyzing the stochastic properties of the data and found all the variables stationary at first level of differencing. Accordingly, the paper proceeds by estimating vector-error correction models. Regression results show {{that most of the}} long-run behavior of the real exchange rate could be explained by <b>real</b> <b>net</b> foreign assets, <b>terms</b> of trade, index of crude oil volatility, index of monetary policy performance and government fiscal stance. On the basis of these fundamentals, four episodes each of overvaluation and undervaluation were identified and the antecedents characterizing the episodes were equally traced to the archive of exchange rate management in the country within the review period. Among others for instance, large inflow of oil revenues into the country and stable macroeconomic performance were discovered to account for undervaluation of the real exchange rate between 2001 Q 1 and 2006 Q 4 in Nigeria. The results further suggest that deviations from the equilibrium path are eliminated within one to two years. The paper recommends the pursuance of sound monetary policy as an instrument for achieving real exchange rate cum macroeconomic stability in Nigeria. ...|$|R

40|$|Net {{investment}} in inventories {{is one of}} the more volatile components of GDP, giving it an important role in short-run variation in the growth of GDP and in the timing and duration of economic downturns. Its most distinctive feature may, however, be the number of conceptual and practical difficulties that arise in its measurement both in nominal terms and in <b>real</b> <b>terms.</b> <b>Net</b> {{investment in}} inventories is also known as change in inventories (CII). The first part of this paper concerns the measurement of nominal CII at the annual frequency. The principle that the economic value of production is measured at the prices existing when the production occurred means that the definition of nominal CII must keep holding gains and losses on inventories out of the measure of GDP. Yet, however clear this requirement may be in the realm of theory, it does not translate literally into practice because the data are generally not precise enough to justify complete faith in the raw estimate of holding gains or losses on inventories. If the estimate of holding gains or losses on inventories is large, the implicit price for the annual CII it is likely to be extreme or negative. We wish to avoid the inconvenience that this causes unless we have some assurance that the large estimate is not a result of an unlucky draw of random errors in the underlying data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} the interaction between inflation and the taxation of capital income. The principal conclusions are: (1) Inflation substantially increases the total effective tax rate on the income from capital used in the nonfinancial corporate sector. The total effective tax rate has risen from less than 60 percent in the mid- 1960 's to more than 70 percent in the late 1970 's. (2) The higher effective tax rate reduces the <b>real</b> <b>net</b> rate of return to those who provide investment capital. In the late 19701 s, the <b>real</b> <b>net</b> rate of return averaged less than three percent. (3) The interact ion between inflation and existing tax rules contributed to the fall in the ratio of share prices to real pretax earnings, or, equivalently, to the rise in the real cost to the firm of equity capital. (4) By reducing the <b>real</b> <b>net</b> return to investors and by widening the gap between the firms' cost of funds and the maximum return that they can afford to pay, the interaction between tax rates and inflation has depressed the rate of net investment in business fixed capital. (5) The failure to consider correctly {{the effects of the}} fiscal structure has caused observers to underestimate the expansionary character of monetary policy in the past two decades. (6) The goal of increasing investment while maintaining price stability can be achieved with tight money, a high real interest rate, and tax incentives for investment. A high real net-of-tax interest rate could reduce residential investment and other forms of consumer spending while the tax incentives offset the monetary effect for investment in business capital. ...|$|R

We build analytical general equilibrium models with both skilled and unskilled labor, and we solve for expressions that show {{the change in the}} <b>real</b> <b>net</b> wage of each group. A decomposition shows the effect of the tax rebate, the effect on the uses side of income (higher product prices), and the effect on the sources side of income (relative wage rates). We also include numerical examples. Even though the pollution tax injures both types of labor, we find that returning all of the revenue to the low-skilled workers is still not enough to offset the effect of higher product prices. Moreover, changing wage rates may further hurt low-skilled labor. In almost all of our examples, the rebate of all revenue to low-skilled labor still does not prevent a reduction in their overall <b>real</b> <b>net</b> wage. ...|$|R
