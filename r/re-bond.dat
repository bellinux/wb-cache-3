40|$|Background: Microleakage {{is still}} one of the defects of resin {{composites}} that can lead to treatment failure; and <b>re-bonding</b> technique is one of the effective ways to reduce it. This study evaluated the effect of <b>re-bonding</b> with a surface sealant or a dentin adhesive on microleakage in class V microhybrid, nanohybrid, and packable composite restorations. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, class V cavities with occlusal margins in enamel and cervical margins in dentin/cementum were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of 54 extracted premolars. The prepared teeth were randomly assigned to three groups (3 group′s Χ 18 teeth each), with each group being restored with microhybrid (Point 4); nanohybrid (Herculite XRV Ultra), and packable (Packable Premise) resin composite. Following finishing and polishing procedures, each group was randomly subdivided in to three subgroups (n = 12). The margins of two groups were both etched and <b>re-bonded</b> with surface sealant (Optiguard) or dentin adhesive (Opti Bond Solo Plus) and control group received no treatment. Specimens were thermocycled 1500 cycles, immersed in a methylene blue, sectioned, evaluated for microleakage using a stereomicroscope at a x 20 and scored on a scale of 0 - 3. Data were analyzed with Kruskal - Wallis, Mann - Whitney, and Wilcoxon tests (α = 0. 05). Results: There were no significant differences among the three resin composites tested, and also no significant differences among subgroups with the same surface treatment. Only the microhybrid and packable composite restorations sealed with Optiguard had significantly lower microleakage compared to the control subgroups at the occlusal margin. There were no significant differences between occlusal and cervical margins regarding the microleakage scores when compared to the control subgroups of microhybrid and packable composite restorations. Conclusion: The <b>re-bonding</b> technique could be considered as an advisable procedure in order to minimize microleakage and its effect might be material-dependent...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the bonding {{performance of a}} coating material "White Coat" (Kuraray) to enamel. Methods: Effect of surface treatment on bonding, durability of bonding, as well as <b>re-bonding</b> as a repeated treatment were investigated using extracted human incisors. To {{evaluate the}} effect of surface treatment, intact or ground enamel surfaces were treated using White Coat primer for 20 seconds or 40 % phosphoric acid (K-etchant) for 10 or 60 seconds, as well as combination usage of White Coat primer and 40 % phosphoric acid. Small resin cylinders of the base-coat of White Coat were bonded to the treated surfaces and irradiated for 30 seconds. For the durability test, small resin cylinders of base coat were bonded to intact enamel using White Coat primer and stored in 37 °C saline for 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of <b>re-bonding</b> after the removal, <b>re-bonding</b> was done after various removal regimens. A micro-shear {{test was used to}} assess the bond strength of all specimens. Results: Application of the primer for 20 seconds to intact enamel produced a mean micro-shear bond strength of 28 MPa for intact and ground enamel. Values were similar to 10 seconds phosphoric acid etching to ground enamel (P> 0. 05). The bond strength of the primed intact enamel did not decrease up to 3 months (P> 0. 05), but decreased significantly by 6 months (P 0. 05). Consequently, White Coat was considered an acceptable temporary coating material tor no longer than 3 months. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the actual {{resistance}} against fracture of a crown fragment fractured and reattached using three different techniques of preparation. Forty bovine incisors were randomly assigned into four groups of which the first was the control group. The elements of the three experimental groups were all cut at a fixed distance of 3 mm for the incisal margin on the buccal surface of the crown in a plane normal to the buccal surface itself, and subsequently <b>re-bonded</b> using an adhesive system. After the reattachment, on the teeth of group 2, a circumferential chamfer was performed along the fracture line; on the teeth of group 3 a groove called 'overcontour' was made also along the fracture line; the teeth in group 4 received a chamfer on the buccal surface and an overcontour on the lingual surface. Finally, all the elements were encompassed in chalk blocks and the models were mounted on the 858 Mini Bionix to perform a fatigue load test. A force was applied on the buccal surface of each tooth at 1. 5 mm from the incisor margin, with a velocity of 1 mm min(- 1), through the use of a steel prick. All the elements of groups 2, 3 and 4 demonstrated a lower resistance to fracture in comparison with the elements of the control group. The teeth of group 2 showed a resistance to fracture equal to 36. 1 % of the resistance of the elements in the control group; in group 3 the resistance was equal to 50. 2 %, while in group 4 the resistance reached 55. 9 %. The difference in resistance between group 3 and group 4 did not result statistically significant (P = 0. 82). Reattachment of coronal fragments does not restore the resistance to fracture to an equal level of the intact teeth, in a static test. The different techniques of preparation significantly modify the resistance to the fracture of a <b>re-bonded</b> fragment. The technique of the circumferential chamfer produced results that were less favourable in terms of resistance against fracture. PMID: 18489478 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLIN...|$|R

40|$|Ceramic {{materials}} including Al_ 2 O_ 3, SiC, AlN, Si_ 3 N_ 4, MgO, MgAl_ 2 O_ 4, Si and SiO_ 2 {{as well as}} the {{refractory metal}} tungsten are irradiated with protons in the 10 MeV energy range at temperatures from 75 C to 630 C under uniaxial tensile stresses from 6 to 330 MPa to dose levels up to about 0. 1 dpa. Changes in length and electrical resistivity are monitored after each irradiation or during beam-off periods. TEM and optical absorption technique are applied to extract information on the radiation induced microstructural changes. For materials with crystalline structure a modified rate theory is used to discuss the measurements whereas for SiO_ 2 glass a model is developed to describe the radiation induced deformation (compaction) and viscous flow. Alternatively a recently developed visco-elastic model based on thermal spike formation is also applied to explain the observed viscous flow in SiO_ 2 glass. It is found that crystalline materials irradiated in the intermediate temperature range (0. 2 T_m<T_i_r_r< 0. 4 T_m) deform in four different stages: (1) at very low doses mainly point defects or small defect clusters (loops) are formed, the strain increases linearly with dose. (2) After the nucleation of interstitial-type loops has finished and they become the dominating sinks, the strain follows a 2 / 3 power law dose dependence. (3) The growth and intersection of loops resulting in the formation of dislocation networks leads to a 1 / 2 dose dependence of the strain. (4) Finally, the strain saturates when the vacancy concentration becomes so high that spontaneous recombination dominates. Thermal spike formation can account for at most 10 % of the observed viscous flow of vitreous SiO_ 2 under 9. 2 MeV proton irradiation. It is therefore proposed that energy deposition through electronic processes must also contribute to the viscous flow in glassy materials through processes of bond-breaking and <b>re-bonding</b> during irradiation. Formation of new bonds results in deformation while rearrangements of atoms with respect to the direction of an external stress during <b>re-bonding</b> causes viscous flow. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates indirectly that the so-called RIED effect (radiation induced electrical degradation) in Al_ 2 O_ 3 could be due to surface contamination which is enhanced by the applied electrical field.

" Holden's review reverberates a general agreement that "Frozen" is finally a movie that can be truly enjoyed by both sexes and that does not promote the idea that love triumphs over anything else...|$|R
