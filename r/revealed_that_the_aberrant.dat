30|$|Recent {{studies have}} <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> {{expression}} of miRNAs {{is involved in}} tumor progression; these miRNAs function by inhibiting their target genes, and they play critical roles in the coordination of tumor cell proliferation, invasion, intravasation, survival, extravasation, and/or colonization. Therefore, the identification of specific miRNAs and their targets involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis would provide important clues for identifying new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cancer prevention and treatment. Interestingly, the microarray analysis by Blenkiron et al. revealed that miR- 33 a is often lost in human breast cancer (Blenkiron et al., 2007). Here, we found that miR- 33 a exhibits a decreased expression level in breast cancer tissues compared with matched normal tissues. Moreover, in patients with breast cancer, a correlation is observed between lower miR- 33 a expression and increased lymph node metastasis. MiR- 33 a inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and suppresses tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Therefore, our study identifies miR- 33 a as a tumor-suppressive gene in breast cancer metastasis.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A single {{gallbladder}} with {{a double}} cystic duct is a very rare finding. In addition, few cases with this rare condition are preoperatively diagnosed. However, the preoperative confirmation or suspicion of this rare condition could facilitate safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is a minimally invasive therapeutic modality for gallbladder disease. We herein present a case of gallstone disease in a patient {{with a double}} cystic duct who was preoperatively diagnosed and successfully treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Presentation of case: A 57 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with epigastric pain. Gallstone disease in the gallbladder and common bile duct was diagnosed by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> cystic duct arose from the cystic duct and communicated with the intrahepatic bile duct of the posterior segmental branch. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in combination with intraoperative cholangiography. Discussion: If an anomaly of the biliary duct system is not identified during surgery, {{it may turn out}} to be a bile leak. The preoperative diagnosis of a double cystic duct allows laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be performed safely in combination with intraoperative cholangiography. Conclusions: A single gallbladder with double cystic duct is a very rare anomaly. However, laparoscopic surgery can be facilitated by the use of preoperative and intraoperative images...|$|E
40|$|Hatching {{failure is}} a {{surprisingly}} common phenomenon given that natural selection constantly works against it. In birds, {{an average of}} about 10 per cent of eggs across species fail to hatch, often owing to the death of embryos. While embryo mortality owing to inbreeding is both well-documented and evolutionarily plausible, this is not true for other sources of mortality. In fact, the basis for hatching failure in natural populations remains largely unexplained. Here, we demonstrate that embryo mortality in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) follows from chromosomal aneuploidy or polyploidy. As part of microsatellite genotyping of a captive breeding population, we found 12 individuals (3. 6 %) with three alleles among 331 embryos that had died during development, while there were no such cases observed among 1210 adult birds. Subsequent genotyping of 1920 single nucleotide polymorphism markers distributed across the genome in birds with three alleles at microsatellite loci, and in greater than 1000 normal birds, <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> karyotypes involved cases of both trisomies and triploidy. Cases of both maternally and paternally inherited trisomies resulted from non-disjunction during meiosis. Maternally inherited cases of triploidy were attributable to failure of meiosis leading to diploid eggs, while paternally inherited triploidy could have arisen either from diploid sperm or from dispermy. Our initial microsatellite screening set only had the power to detect less than 10 per cent of trisomies and by extrapolation, our data therefore tentatively suggest that trisomy might be a major cause of embryo mortality in zebra finches...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{conducted}} the present meta-analysis with relevant cohort studies {{to determine whether}} expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. (VEGF) could predict the prognosis of diffuse large B. cell lymphoma. (DLBCL). Materials and Methods: The MEDLINE (1966 - 2013), the Cochrane Library Database (Issue 12, 2013), EMBASE (1980 - 2013), CINAHL (1982 [...] 2013), Web of Science (1945 - 2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1982 - 2013) were searched without any language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA software (Version 12. 0, Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas USA). Hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated. Results: Eight clinical cohort studies, which recruited a total 670 DLBCL patients, {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that DLBCL patients with positive VEGF expression had a shorter overall survival than those with negative VEGF expression. (HR = 1. 58, 95 % CI = 0. 80 - 2. 36, P < 0. 001). Ethnicity-stratified analysis illustrates that high expression levels of VEGF may be significantly correlated with poor DLBCL prognosis among both Caucasian and Asian populations. (Caucasian: HR = 1. 73, 95 % CI = 0. 56 - 2. 90, P = 0. 004; Asian: HR = 1. 45, 95 % CI = 0. 41 - 2. 50, P = 0. 006). Conclusion: The major findings of our meta-analysis <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> expression of VEGF may correspond to shorter overall survival of patients with DLBCL, <b>revealing</b> <b>that</b> VEGF expression could be an unbiased prognostic determinant in the management of DLBCL patients...|$|R

Analyses of 271 presumptive S. aureus strains, supplemented with 59 well-defined methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, were performed. Only the Staphaurex Plus (Murex Diagnostics, Dartford, United Kingdom) and the Pastorex Staphplus (Sanofi, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) tests displayed 100 % sensitivity. The observed difference with the free-coagulase test (Bacto coagulase plasma; Difco, Detroit, Mich.), a bound-coagulase (clumping factor) test, and the former Staphaurex test (Murex Diagnostics) was caused mainly by the inability of these three tests to identify some MRSA strains correctly.

However, the recent demonstration that AtBT 1 is dually localized to plastids and mitochondria (Bahaji et al., 2011) has prompted the hypothesis that plastidic AtBT 1 would not be essential for normal growth and fertility of Arabidopsis. To test this hypothesis we produced and characterized homozygous AtBT 1 ::T-DNA mutants stably expressing either the dually localized AtBT 1, or AtBT 1 specifically localized in the mitochondrial compartment. These analyses <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> growth and sterility phenotype of homozygous AtBT 1 ::T-DNA mutants was complemented when expressing both the dual-targeted AtBT 1 and the AtBT 1 specifically delivered to mitochondria.

Intriguingly, dysregulated Chc expression facilitated a nuclear accumulation of pStat 3, leading to an enhanced cell proliferation of the A 339 V clones. Down-regulation and abrogation of Chc-mediated cellular trafficking, respectively, by knocking-down Chc and ectopic expression of a dominant-negative (DN) form of Chc could significantly reduce the nuclear pStat 3 and rescue the aberrant cell proliferation of the A 339 V clones. Subsequent expression analysis further revealed that CHC and pSTAT 3 are co-overexpressed in 66. 7 % (10 / 15) MNG. Taken together, our results suggest that the A 339 V TTF 1 mutant protein up-regulates the cellular expression of Chc, resulting in a constitutive activation of Stat 3 pathway, and prompting the aberrant growth of thyroid cells.

Its correct folding and assembly within the nuclear replication pre-initiation complex is crucial for normal cell cycle progression and genome maintenance. Due to a single point mutation in the largest DNA polymerase α subunit, p 180, the temperature-sensitive mouse cell line tsFT 20 exhibits heat-labile DNA polymerase α activity and S phase arrest at restrictive temperature. In this study, we show that an aberrant form of endogenous p 180 in tsFT 20 cells (p 180 tsFT 20) is strictly localized in the cytoplasm while its wild-type counterpart enters the nucleus. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged or photoactivatable green fluorescent protein-tagged p 180 tsFT 20 variants and inhibitor analysis <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of <b>aberrant</b> p 180 tsFT 20 from the nucleus is due to two distinct mechanisms: first, the inability of newly synthesized (cytoplasmic) p 180 tsFT 20 to enter the nucleus and second, proteasome-dependent degradation of nuclear-localized protein. The nuclear import defect seems to result from an impaired association of aberrant de novo synthesized p 180 tsFT 20 with the second subunit of DNA polymerase α, p 68.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} shows that phenotypic changes including axon aberrations, rather than loss of neurons, account for behavioral impairments during aging. The present thesis was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of axon aberrations in relation to transmitter identity, glial reaction and sensorimotor disturbances. To shed light on possible underlying mechanisms, signs of oxidative stress and inflammation were also examined. The studies were performed on behaviorally defined aged (30 months old) and young adult (2 - 3 months old) Sprague Dawley rats, by using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. <b>The</b> results show <b>that</b> many aged motoneurons lose a significant portion of their bouton covering, due to a decreased number of apposing boutons. Consistent with the more pronounced sensorimotor disturbances observed in the hind- in comparison with the forelimbs, lumbar motoneurons appeared more severely affected than cervical motoneurons. In the neuropil of <b>the</b> motor nucleus, <b>aberrant</b> axons were encountered. Ultrastructural analysis of aberrant axons in relation to content of amino acid neurotransmitters and the free radical scavenger glutathione (GSH) <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> many of <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> axons contained high levels of glutamate-immunoreactivity (-IR) and were often enriched with GSH-IR. Increased levels of GSH-IR were also encountered in glutamate-IR terminals with a preserved ultrastructure, suggesting that a changed redox status may be mechanistic in the development of axon aberrations. GABA- and glycine-IR terminals were more rarely affected, suggesting that excitatory and inhibitory pathways are differentially affected. In the aged rats, immunohistochemistry showed a reduced fiber density and axon aberrations of cholinergic and monoaminergic axons in both the spinal cord and the hippocampus. In contrast, the innervation of alpha-motonearons by C boutons was preserved in senescence. However, the C boutons showed a decreased labeling for cholinergic markers. Regions disclosing axon terminal loss and aberrations showed increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, the main intermediate filament of astrocytes). Using Marchi staining on spinal cord sections, the outer parts of the white matter showed signs of a changed myelin metabolism and/or dysmyelination in aged rats. hi the same regions, astro- and microglial cells showed conspicuous signs of activation, most pronounced in rats disclosing the most severe sensorimotor disturbances. The glial reaction appeared less pronounced in brain white matter compared to the spinal cord white matter. The spinal cord white matter of aged rats also disclosed a changed expression of several cytokines, while the majority of investigated cytokines were unaltered in the hippocampus. One of the most prominent changes was an upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma, encountered in both the hippocampus and the spinal cord. There was a robust upregulation of TGFbeta- 1 and IL 1 -beta in astroglia of spinal cord white matter, while no change was evident in the hippocampus. CNTF levels were unaltered in aged rats, however, IR appeared reduced in oligodendroglia-like cells, while it seemed increased in astroglia of the spinal cord white matter.

40|$|A {{sample of}} fossil deer remains (genus Candiacervus) from Mavro Mouri cave, Crete, Greece is studied because a large {{proportion}} shows aberrant, seemingly pathological changes to the morphology {{and the structure of}} the bones. Here we show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> appearance of <b>the</b> Mavro Mouri bone sample can be understood through a simple taphonomical explanation: post-mortem damage to the bones inflicted by bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus). Hence they are not osteoporotically altered due to supposed malnutrition, as proposed before. This conclusion has a bearing on our understanding of island evolution, as it eliminates a supposed direct relation between persistent malnutrition on the one hand, and island dwarfing on the other...|$|R
40|$|When {{dividing}} {{cells of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{were exposed to}} the polysaccharide-binding dye Congo red, the walls and septa became sites of chitin accumulation. In addition, the cytoplasm showed many vesicles that were different from those accumulating in the growing bud and from the lytic vacuoles of the untreated yeasts. To obtain information about these membranous structures, living cells were observed under phase contrast and UV light microscopes. Furthermore, ultrathin sections of Congo red-treated cells were processed by cytochemical techniques to reveal the chitin areas. Observations suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> vesicles were involved in a secretory process, and that pre-assembled chitin was not among the components transported to the cell periphery...|$|R
30|$|At mid-altitude, {{the mean}} C/N ratio for soils under savanna forest cover <b>reveals</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organic matter was of good quality (C/N <  10), while those for soils under {{afforestation}} plantations and grazing systems were of medium quality (C/N =  10 – 14).

40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in human development concerns how the young infant's {{ability to recognize}} emotional signals is acquired through both biological programming and learning factors. This issue {{is extremely difficult to}} investigate because of the variety of sensory experiences to which humans are exposed immediately after birth. We examined the effects of emotional experience on emotion recognition by studying abused children, whose experiences violated cultural standards of care. We found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> social experience of abuse was associated with a change in children's perceptual preferences and also altered <b>the</b> discriminative abilities <b>that</b> influence how children categorize angry facial expressions. This study suggests that affective experiences can influence perceptual representations of basic emotions...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the number of "aberrant plants" showing various {{developmental}} abnormalities in cultivated cauliflowers has dramatically increased, thus hampering the registration of new varieties in some cases. <b>The</b> <b>aberrant</b> phenotype occurred during the cultivation period and in any variety type (pure line or F 1 hybrid). <b>The</b> number of <b>aberrant</b> plants increased considerably from 1994 onwards. <b>The</b> rate of <b>aberrant</b> plants observed among F 1 hybrids in the field was found to vary according to genotype and cultivation area. Besides morphological changes, aberrant phenotypes showed various patterns of evolution, i. e. stable, evolving toward another phenotype or reversing toward normality. Vegetative and seed progenies were obtained in order to investigate the genetic control of these phenotypic variations. Given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>aberrant</b> phenotypes can evolve towards either normality or another abnormality during {{the life cycle of}} <b>the</b> plant and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aberration capacity and/or the "acquired morphological disorder" can be transmitted to the progeny, an epigenetic hypothesis has been proposed for the determinism of this phenomenon...|$|R
