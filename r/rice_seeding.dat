40|$|Rice (paddy) {{and fish}} yields in concurrent, direct-seeded culture were {{investigated}} at the Co Do station {{located in the}} Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Three different <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rates (100, 200 and 300 kg ha(- 1)) {{were used in the}} absence or presence of fish (Oreochromis niloticus (all male), Puntius gonionotus, and Cyprinus carpio). Significantly (P < 0. 05) higher paddy and fish yields were obtained at the lowest <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate. No significant effect of the <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate on aquatic weed biomass was found, whereas water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and pH were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher at 100 kg rice seed ha(- 1). The presence of fish resulted in a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction of aquatic weed biomass, and significantly (P < 0. 05) lower dissolved oxygen and PO 4 concentrations, and higher chlorophyll-a levels in the pond water. Analysis of the results indicated that the effect of <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate on fish production was most likely to be related to a 'growth effect' resulting from increased availability of oxygen and food. Paddy yields at high seeding densities were affected by mutual shading. A further reduction of <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate may be feasible for rice-fish farmers, given their limited possibilities for weed control through land preparation (field levelling) and water management.

40|$|The {{microbial}} {{communities of}} bulk soil of rice paddy fields under an ancient organic agriculture regimen, consisting on an alfalfa-rice rotation system, were characterized. The drained soil of two adjacent paddies {{at different stages}} of the rotation was compared before <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> and after harvesting. The relationships among the soil microbial, physicochemical, and biochemical parameters were investigated using multivariate analyses. In the first year of rice cropping, aerobic cultivable heterotrophic populations correlated with lineages of presumably aerobic bacteria (e. g., Sphingobacteriales, Sphingomonadales). In the second year of rice cropping, the total C content correlated with presumable anaerobic bacteria (e. g., Anaerolineae). Independently of the year of rice cropping, before <b>rice</b> <b>seeding,</b> proteolytic activity correlated positively with the cultivable aerobic heterotrophic and ammonifier populations, the soil catabolic profile and with presumable aerobes (e. g., Sphingobacteriales, Rhizobiales) and anaerobes (e. g., Bacteroidales, Anaerolineae). After harvesting, strongest correlations were observed between cultivable diazotrophic populations and bacterial groups described as comprising N 2 fixing members (e. g., Chloroflexi-Ellin 6529, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria). It was demonstrated that chemical parameters and microbial functions were correlated with variations on the total bacterial community composition and structure occurring during rice cropping. A better understanding of these correlations and of their implications on soil productivity may be valid contributors for sustainable agriculture practices, based on ancient processes...|$|E

40|$|Weeds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to {{the success}} of dry-seeded rice (DSR). The main means of managing these in a DSR system is through chemical weed control using herbicides. However, the use of herbicides alone may not be sustainable in the long term. Approaches that aim for high crop competitiveness therefore need to be exploited. One such approach is the use of high <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rates. Experiments were conducted in the aman (wet) seasons of 2012 and 2013 in Bangladesh to evaluate the effect of weed infestation level (partially-weedy and weed-free) and <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 kg ha− 1) on weed and crop growth in DSR. Under weed-free conditions, higher crop yields (5. 1 and 5. 2 t ha− 1 in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, respectively) were obtained at the seeding rate of 40 kg ha− 1 and thereafter, yield decreased slightly beyond 40 kg seed ha− 1. Under partially-weedy conditions, yield increased by 30 to 33 % (2. 0 – 2. 2 and 2. 9 – 3. 2 t ha− 1 in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, respectively) with increase in seeding rate from 20 to 100 kg ha− 1. In the partially-weedy plots, weed biomass decreased by 41 – 60 % and 54 – 56 % at 35 days after sowing and at crop anthesis, respectively, when seeding rate increased from 20 to 100 kg ha− 1.

40|$|Many authors {{report on}} the effect of rice-fish culture on rice yields. Some reports show {{increased}} rice yields, others show no effect or even decreased yields. To verify the impact of rice-fish culture, data gathered over eight experiments (1995 - 1999) at the Co Do experimental rice-fish station, Vietnam, were analysed through multiple regressions with rice yield and different yield components as the dependent variables. We used eight independent variables: season, water depth, rice variety, <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate, and the effective stocking density (ESD) of silver barb, Nile tilapia, common carp and snakeskin gourami. Season had the biggest impact on nearly all dependent variables. Rice yields in the wet season were on average 2. 42 t/ha lower as compared to the dry season. Higher water levels decreased the number of panicles/m(2) and the rice yield. The <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rate affected the yield component variables, but had no impact on the rice yield. Silver barb feeding decreased the number of panicles/m(2) but this was compensated by an increased number of grains/panicle. Snakeskin gourami had a positive effect on panicles/m(2) and, together with common carp, on sink capacity, probably through improved nutrient cycling in presence of fish and improved nutrient uptake by the rice plant. Snakeskin gourami had a negative effect on the ripening ability, whereas Nile tilapia had a positive effect. Fish did not have any impact on the rice yield. Increased water level and reduced rice arable area, the main two requirements for rice-fish culture, result in lower rice yields from rice-fish systems as compared to monoculture systems. status: publishe...|$|E

A conventional method to inspect the varietal purity of <b>rice</b> <b>seeds</b> is based on manually selecting random samples of <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> from a batch and evaluating the physical grain properties through a process of human visual inspection. This is a tedious, laborious, time consuming and extremely inefficient task where only a very small subset of the entire batch of the <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> can be examined.

Developing integrated weed management strategies that promote {{the suppression of}} weeds by crop density, cultivar selection, and nutrition requires {{better understanding of the}} extent to which rice interferes with the growth of this weed and how it responds to resource limitation due to rice interference. The growth of I. rugosum was studied when grown with four <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rates (0, 25, 50, and 100 kg ha 21) and four nitrogen (N) rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha 21). Compared to the weed plants grown alone, weed tiller number was reduced by 63 – 80 %, leaf number by 68 – 77 %, leaf area by 69 – 77 %, leaf biomass by 72 – 84 %, and inflorescence biomass by 81 – 93 % at the <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> rates of 25 – 100 kg ha 21. All these parameters increased with increasing rates of N from 0 to 150 kg ha 21. At weed maturity, I. rugosum plants were 100 % taller than rice at 0 kg N ha 21, whereas, with added N, the weeds were only 50 % taller than rice. Weed biomass increased by 82 – 160 %, whereas rice biomass increased by 92 – 229 %, with the application of 50 – 150 kg N ha 21. Added N favored rice biomass production more than it did the weed. Rice interference reduced the height and biomass of I. rugosum, but did not suppress its growth completely. I. rugosum showed the ability to reduce the effects of rice interference by increasing leaf area, leaf weight ratio, and specific leaf area, and by decreasing the root-shoot weight ratio in comparison to the weed plants grown alone.

Herein, soil column study was conducted using four biochars, i. e., wheat straw(WBC) and wood sawdust(SBC) that pyrolyzed at 500 ℃ and 700 ℃, respectively, to study the effects of two different biochar application patterns on rice growth. These two typical biochar application patterns were:generally mixed application(mixed treatment) and surface application(surface treatment). The results showed that:(1) In comparison with CK, all biochar application treatments promoted the growth of rice in terms of plant height and SPAD(Soil Plant Analysis Development) value. Plant height of surface treatment was higher than that of mixed treatments at the heading, filling and maturation stages. SPAD and NDVI(Normalized Different Vegetation Index) value of surface treatments were slightly lower than mixed treatment.

30|$|In <b>rice,</b> <b>seeding</b> depth {{for direct}} seeding is an {{important}} factor for ensuring seedling establishment. Lee et al. (2002) recommended a 2 – 3 -cm sowing depth for japonica rice. When the seeding depth is > 3  cm, seedling emergence was markedly delayed (Kawatei et al. 1963; Murai et al. 1995; Luo et al. 2007; Chung 2010; Alibu et al. 2012). Moreover, when seeds were sown deeper than 5  cm, the first leaf developed under the soil surface, and seedling establishment decreased remarkably (Chung 2010). Similar result was obtained in this study: seedling emergence speed and percentage at 7  cm and 10  cm soil depths were lower than those at the seeding depth of 3  cm in all the genotypes (Fig. 5). Although 3 -cm seeding depth might be optimal for direct seeding based on these results, many studies have used seeding depths of less than 3  cm, which caused seed desiccation and floating and seedling lodging (Lee et al. 2002, Kumar and Ladha 2011). Genotype differences for seedling emergence and coleoptile length were more pronounced at 5  cm than at 3  cm seeding depth (Figs. 1 and 5). The two parents and the 3 CSSLs showed > 90 % seedling emergence within 7  days when the seeding depth was 3  cm, whereas Kasalath and CSSL- 5 showed > 90 % emergence and the other three lines reached a plateau at 80 % emergence at 5  cm seeding depth (Fig. 5). These results indicate that soil depth of 3 – 5  cm is appropriate for direct seeding of cultivars that show good mesocotyl elongation without affecting seedling establishment. Based on these findings, we selected 5  cm soil depth for screening seedling emergence traits under the deep-seeding condition.|$|E

A study was conducted in the Philippines and India in 2008 and 2009 to assess the relations of seeding rates (15 - 125 kgha- 1) of hybrid and inbred varieties to crop and weed growth in aerobic rice. Plant densities, tillers, and biomass of rice increased linearly with increased in seeding rates under both weedy and weed free environments. Weed biomass decreased linearly with increasing seeding rates from 15 to 125 kgha- 1. Panicles and grain yields of rice in competition with weeds increased in a quadratic relation with increased seeding rates at both locations; however, the response was flat in the weed free plots. A quadratic model predicted that seeding rates of 48 - 80 kgha- 1 for the inbred varieties and 47 - 67 kgha- 1 for the hybrid varieties were needed to achieve maximum grain yield when grown in the absence of weeds, while rates of 95 - 125 kgseedha- 1 for the inbred varieties and 83 - 92 kg seed ha- 1 for the hybrid varieties were needed to achieve maximum yields in competition with weeds. On the basis of these results, seeding rates greater than 80 kgha- 1 are advisable where there are risks of severe weed competition. Such high seeding rates may be prohibitive when using expensive seed, and maximum yields are not the only consideration for developing recommendations for optimizing economic returns for farmers. Results of the present study do suggest however that increasing seeding rates of aerobic rice does suppress weed growth and reduce grain yield losses from weed competition. This information could be incorporated in integrated crop management packages to manage weeds more effectively...|$|E
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{a primary}} global food cereal. However, when {{compared}} to wheat, rice has poor food processing qualities. Dough that is made from rice flour has low viscoelasticity because <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> lacks storage proteins that are comparable to gluten protein from wheat. Thus, current research efforts aim to improve rice flour processing qualities through the transgenic expression of viscoelastic proteins in <b>rice</b> <b>seeds.</b> In this study, we characterized the transgenic expression of wheat glutenin subunits in <b>rice</b> <b>seeds.</b> The two genes 1 Dx 5 _KK and 1 Dy 10 _JK, which both encode wheat high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits that confer high dough elasticity, were cloned from Korean wheat cultivars KeumKang and JoKyung, respectively. These genes were inserted into binary vectors {{under the control of}} the rice endosperm-specific Glu-B 1 promoter and were expressed in the high-amylose Korean rice cultivar Koami (Oryza sativa L.). Individual expression of both glutenin subunits was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses performed using T 3 generation of transgenic <b>rice</b> <b>seeds.</b> The subcellular localization of 1 Dx 5 _KK and 1 Dy 10 _JK in the <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> endosperm was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis, indicating that the wheat glutenin subunits accumulate in protein body-II and novel protein body types in the <b>rice</b> <b>seed.</b> These results contribute to our understanding of engineered seed storage proteins in rice...|$|R

Este trabalho objetivou {{investigar}} a competitividade de cultivares de arroz irrigado (Oryza sativa L.) com cultivar simuladora de arroz-vermelho. Investigou-se na safra 2000 / 2001 o comportamento de oito genótipos de arroz, cultivados na presença ou ausência da cultivar de arroz EEA 406, que simulou infestação de arroz-vermelho. Aos 45 e aos 60 dias após a semeadura, avaliou-se a resposta da simuladora em relação às cultivares de arroz. Na colheita, foram determinados estatura de planta, componentes do rendimento e produtividade das plantas. A cultivar tardia IR 841 suprimiu o crescimento da simuladora, apresentando com a cultivar superprecoce Ligeirinho as menores reduções de produtividade quando em competição. Por sua vez, as cultivares IAS 12 - 9 Formosa e Bluebelle permitiram maior crescimento e produção de sementes pela concorrente, também sofrendo as maiores reduções de produtividade de grãos na condição de competição. Morphologic and physiologic {{characteristics of}} crop plants can affect their competitive ability with weeds.

40|$|Wetland <b>rice</b> <b>seeding</b> is an {{increasingly}} common practice for irrigated and favourable rainfed lowlands. Most developed countries sow rice seed in saturated water to minimize cost and labour requirements (Smith and Show, 1996). Farmers {{in developing countries}} increasingly are adopting wet seeding because of the migration of farm labour to non-farm jobs and the consequent labour shortage and high costs for manual transplanting (Ho, 1995; Pandey, 1995; Pingali, 1994). Wet seeding in irrigated areas occurs into aerobic, anaerobic, and wet soils based {{on the level of}} oxygen {{in the vicinity of the}} germinating seed or the depth of flood water at seeding. Direct seeded rice either broadcasted or line sown gave significantly higher grain yield than transplanting under proper management (Elahi et al., 1997; Hussain et al., 2000). Santhi (1999) reported that the establishment of sprouted rice seed under broadcasted systems flowered 7. 2 days earlier than transplanted rice seedling. The sprouted rice manually sown in lines had 7 days earlier flowering than transplanted rice in both dry and wet seasons. The delayed flowering in transplanted rice might be due to transplanting shock of the rice seedling. Islam (2008) observed that the radicle and plumule length was increased with the increase of incubation duration. Islam (2008) also reported that significantly higher grain yield was attained after 96 hours of rice seed incubation; however, using a drum seeder, no difference was observed among 24, 48 and 72 hours incubation. Very recently, CIMMYT has developed a 2 -WT tractor-operated Versatile Multi-crop Planter (VMP) with the provision to use adjustable row spacing of crops for zero tillage, strip tillage, single pass shallow tillage, bed planting, and even conventional tillage (Islam et al 2010). The VMP has facilities to sow seed and place basal fertilizer simultaneously in a single pass operation under different tillage systems. To obtain the direct-seeded rice establishment benefits, the VMP was evaluated to assess the performance of sprouted rice seed sowing. A field study was undertaken to determine the establishment of sprouted rice seed and estimate the damage of radicle and plumule during mechanized sowing; and to determine the optimum time of rice seed incubation for grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent rice-fish {{systems in}} the Mokong Delta, Vietnam, are {{characterized}} by a rice field surrounded by a trench (on average 1000 m(2), covering 15 - 20 % of the field surface). Rice is direct seeded and fish are reared in polyculture. The most common species for polyculture are silver barb Barbodes gonionotus (Blecker), common carp Cyprinus carpio L. and Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.). In a 1996 - 1997 dry season experiment, the effects of (1) absence or presence of a fish polyculture, and (2) two different rice-seeding rates (100 and 300 kg pre-germinated rice per ha) on the trench floodwater ecology were studied. Fish were stocked in six out of twelve rice-fish plots at the Co Do experimental rice-fish station (10 degrees 10 ' N and 105 degrees 20 ' E), Silver barb, common carp and Nile tilapia were stocked in polyculture at densities of 3150, 310 and 550 fish/ha,respectively. Several hydrological and biological parameters or the trench floodwater were measured. About 65 % of the observed variation in the trench floodwater {{could be attributed to}} the Fishes stocked and changes in rice-seeding rate. The presence of a fish polyculture increased the water turbidity of the trench floodwater, mainly through suspension of mineral and organic material through fish perturbation. At the lower rice-seeding rate, this resulted in a lower primary production. Photosynthetic activity, dissolved oxygen am and pill showed significant decreases, but only at the lower rice-seeding rate in the presence of fish. Fish polyculture presence resulted in lower ortho-phosphate concentrations, higher phytoplankton communities and higher Protozoa numbers, most probably due to a higher availability of nutrients through fish defecation and perturbation. The rice-seeding rate {{had a significant impact on}} pH am, pH pill and temperature pm readings. The survival rate for Nile tilapia and the gross production for Nile tilapia and common carp was higher at the lower <b>rice</b> <b>seeding,</b> rate, most probably due to a better aquatic environment of the field. In terms of fish production, the trench floodwater environment was better than the field floodwater. The trench is a very important part or the rice-fish system. It serves as a refuge and supplies reasonable amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton to the fish. status: publishe...|$|E

The samples were 104 farmers who produced Suphan Buri 1 <b>seeds</b> for Ratchaburi <b>Rice</b> <b>Seed</b> Center during the 2009 rainy season in Khu Bua Sub-District under Mueang Ratchaburi District, Tha Chumphon Sub-District and Soifah Sub-District under Photharam District, Lad Bua Khaow Sub-District under Ban Pong District, Huay Yang Thone Sub-District under Pak Tho District in Ratchaburi Province; Rai Ma Kham Sub-District under Ban Lat District, Phetchaburi Province; and Khao Sam Sip Harb under Tha Maka District, Kanchanaburi Province. The samples were selected by using stratified random sampling methodology. The data were collected by a structured interview. The data was analyzed using a computer program. The statistical parameters being analyzed were a frequency, a percentage, a minimum value, a maximum value, a mean, and a standard deviation, and multi-regression analysis. The major findings were as follows: 1) The {{average age of the}} farmers was 49. 08 years. The average duration of <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> producing was 5. 90 years. They communicated among other farmer fellows and they were supported and instructed by field officials for 4 - 5 times during a cropping season. They received the information and related documents about <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> production from other farmers in their group and field officials and attended training courses. The main occupation of more than four-fifths of them was <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> producers. They planted the Suphan Buri 1 cultivar prior to the 2009 rainy season. The average quantity of <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> application was 22. 47 kilogram per rai. Their average production cost was 4, 793. 08 Baht per rai per season. Their average income was 9, 499. 52 Baht per rai per season. Two-fifths of them used their own capital. The average quantity of the family labor was 3. 10 persons. Their average <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> production area was 20. 50 rais and an average payment for rented land was 1, 235. 14 bahts/season. 2) The actual practice of <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> production was generally at the highest level and they had good attitude towards field officials. 3) The duration of <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> production was related to the quality of <b>rice</b> <b>seeds</b> produced by farmers at a level of 0. 05 statistical significance. 4) More than three-fifths of them had problems with insufficient supply of water, causing delayed planting. Three-fifths of them had problems with the high price of seeds, impurity, delayed supply of seeds, and low selling price of their own paddy. About two-fifths of them had problems with high cost of harvesting per rai, and maintaining harvesters. More than one-third of them had problems with the labor shortage. They, therefore, suggested that the Office of Irrigation should have irrigated their farms promptly throughout the cropping season, the price of their <b>rice</b> <b>seeds</b> should have been determined by the center at 14, 000 - 15, 000 Baht per ton, the quantity of <b>rice</b> <b>seed</b> driers should have been increased, the center should have had its own vehicles to carry <b>rice</b> <b>seeds,</b> and funds for buying fertilizer and chemical substances should have been set up. การศึกษาในครั้งนี้มีวัตถุประสงค์เพื่อศึกษาเกษตรกรผู้ผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวของศูนย์วิจัยเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวราชบุรี ดังนี้ 1) ศึกษาปัจจัยด้านสังคม และเศรษฐกิจ 2) การผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ดี 3) ปัจจัยที่เกี่ยวข้องกับการเมล็ดพันธุ์ดี ตลอดจนปัญหา และข้อเสนอแนะของเกษตรกรผู้ผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวศูนย์เมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวราชบุรี กลุ่มตัวอย่าง คือ เกษตรกรผู้ผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวพันธุ์สุพรรณบุรี 1 ฤดูฝน ปี 2552 ในพื้นที่ ตำบลคูบัว อำเภอเมือง ตำบลท่าชุมพล และตำบลสร้อยฟ้า อำเภอโพธาราม ตำบลลาดบัวขาว อำเภอบ้านโป่ง ตำบลห้วยยางโทน อำเภอปากท่อ จังหวัดราชบุรี ตำบลไร่มะขาม อำเภอบ้านลาด จังหวัดเพชรบุรี และตำบลเขาสามสิบหาบ อำเภอท่ามะกา จังหวัดกาญจนบุรี เพื่อจำหน่ายเมล็ดพันธุ์ให้กับศูนย์เมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวราชบุรี จำนวน 104 ราย สุ่มตัวอย่างแบบชั้นภูมิ เก็บรวบรวมข้อมูลโดยใช้แบบสัมภาษณ์แบบมีการศึกษาในครั้งนี้มีวัตถุประสงค์เพื่อศึกษาเกษตรกรผู้ผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวของศูนย์วิจัยเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวราชบุรี ดังนี้ 1) ศึกษาปัจจัยด้านสังคม และเศรษฐกิจ 2) การผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ดี 3) ปัจจัยที่เกี่ยวข้องกับการเมล็ดพันธุ์ดี ตลอดจนปัญหา และข้อเสนอแนะของเกษตรกรผู้ผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวศูนย์เมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวราชบุรี กลุ่มตัวอย่าง คือ เกษตรกรผู้ผลิตเมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวพันธุ์สุพรรณบุรี 1 ฤดูฝน ปี 2552 ในพื้นที่ ตำบลคูบัว อำเภอเมือง ตำบลท่าชุมพล และตำบลสร้อยฟ้า อำเภอโพธาราม ตำบลลาดบัวขาว อำเภอบ้านโป่ง ตำบลห้วยยางโทน อำเภอปากท่อ จังหวัดราชบุรี ตำบลไร่มะขาม อำเภอบ้านลาด จังหวัดเพชรบุรี และตำบลเขาสามสิบหาบ อำเภอท่ามะกา จังหวัดกาญจนบุรี เพื่อจำหน่ายเมล็ดพันธุ์ให้กับศูนย์เมล็ดพันธุ์ข้าวราชบุรี จำนวน 104 ราย สุ่มตัวอย่างแบบชั้นภูมิ เก็บรวบรวมข้อมูลโดยใช้แบบสัมภาษณ์แบบม...|$|R
