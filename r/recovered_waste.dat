50|$|Section and Chapter titles {{describe}} {{broad categories}} of goods, while headings and subheadings describe products in more detail. Generally, HS sections and chapters {{are arranged in}} order of a product’s degree of manufacture or {{in terms of its}} technological complexity. Natural commodities, such as live animals and vegetables, for example, are described the early sections of the HS, whereas more evolved goods such as machinery and precision instruments are described in later sections. Chapters within the individual sections are also usually organized in order of complexity or degree of manufacture. For example, within Section X (Pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; <b>Recovered</b> (<b>waste</b> and scrap) paper or paperboard; Paper and paperboard and articles thereof), Chapter 47 provides for pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic materials, whereas Chapter 49 covers printed books, newspapers, and other printed matter. Finally, the headings within individual Chapters follow a similar order. For example, the first heading in Chapter 50 (Silk) provides for silk worm cocoons while articles made of silk are covered by the chapter's later headings.|$|E

The MIST laboratory is designed to test the integration capability of the following subsystems of a modular integrated utility system (MIUS) : (1) electric power generation, (2) space heating and cooling, (3) solid waste disposal, (4) potable water supply, and (5) waste water treatment.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEGs) convert heat to electricity {{by way of}} the Seebeck effect. TEGs have no {{moving parts}} and are environmentally friendly and can be implemented with systems to <b>recover</b> <b>waste</b> heat. This work examines complete thermoelectric systems, which include the (TEG) and heat exchangers or heat sinks attached to the hot and cold sides of the TEG to maintain the required temperature difference across the TEG. A 1 -D steady state model is developed to predict the performance of a TEG given the required temperatures and device dimensions. The model is first validated using a 3 -D model and then is used to examine methods to improve the TEG performance. A numerical model is developed to predict the thermal performance of heat exchangers to be used in combination with the TEG model. The combined thermoelectric generator – heat exchanger model, is compared with a 3 -D model and then used to predict the performance of a TEG – heat exchanger system used to <b>recover</b> <b>waste</b> heat from a diesel engine. Next natural convection heat sinks are modeled and studied to be implemented with the TEG. A model is developed to predict the performance of a system applied for power harvesting in a nuclear power plant. The model is also used to design a system to <b>recover</b> <b>waste</b> heat from the human body. Finally, a novel natural convection heat sink is suggested, where microwires act as the extended surface for the heat sink. The microwire heat sink is modeled accounting for the relevant thermal physics.

In this study LCA is applied to compare the environmental performance of three scenarios for sludge disposal in a WWT plant located in southern Italy. The first business-as-usual scenario is based on the actual sludge management performed within the case-study plant: after mechanical treatment, dewatered sludge is transported by truck to a landfill for final disposal. The second scenario assumes a circular pattern, with anaerobic fermentation of sludge to biogas, and biogas use for electricity and heat cogeneration: electricity is feedback to WWT, while heat is used for digestate drying, in addition to thermal energy from previously <b>recovered</b> <b>waste</b> cooking oil (WCO). The third scenario suggests an improved circular pat-tern where the dried sludge is further gasified for syngas production and syngas is added to biogas for heat and electricity production.

To generate electricity from biomass combustion heat, geothermal wells, <b>recovered</b> <b>waste</b> heat from internal combustion engines, gas turbines or industrial processes, both the steam cycle and the organic Rankine cycle are widely in use. Both technologies are well established {{and can be found}} on comparable industrial applications. This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis and a comparative study of the cycle efficiency for a simplified steam cycle versus an ORC cycle. The most commonly used organic fluids have been considered : R 245 fa, Toluene, (cyclo) -pentane, Solkatherm and 2 siliconeoils (MM and MDM). Working fluid selection and its application area is being discussed based on fluid properties. The thermal efficiency is mainly determined by the temperature level of the heat source and the condenser conditions. The influence of several process parameters such as turbine inlet and condenser temperature, turbine isentropic efficiency, vapour quality and pressure, use of a regenerator (ORC), is derived from numerous computer simulations. The temperature profile of the heat source is the main restricting factor for the evaporation temperature and pressure.

The model allocates combustible fuel and renewable energy inputs among generic end-uses including intermediate conversions through onsite power and steam generation. Results of this model provide the basis to scale energy process-step models. Two federal databases used to construct energy end-use models are Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey of the U. S. Energy Information Administration, and the Energy Information Administration’s “EIA- 860 B: Annual Electric Generator Report”.

Therefore, the purpose of fuel consumption at non-utility plants is to run their end-uses. During the course of this study, the most recent U.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the sustainability of recovering industrial wasteheat from several heat sources in a foundry constructed in a plant belonging to ITT Waterand Wastewater in Emmaboda, Sweden. A triple bottom line perspective will be appliedto achieve this objective. The triple bottom line approach takes into account ecologicaland social performance in addition to financial performance. The technology forrecovering the waste heat is a Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) which is aconstruction consisting of 140 vertical boreholes, 150 meters deep with an internal spaceof four meters. The calculated amount of energy for storage is approximately 3800 MWh annually. Ofthis amount 2500 MWh are expected to be utilized, while storage losses accounts for theremaining part. The value of the recovered heat is 2, 78 million SEK. The project entails aprice cut of 80 % between the stored heat and the current price for district heating.

The Carnol process is a viable alternative to sequestering CO{sub 2 } in the ocean for purposes of reducing CO{sub 2 } emissions from coal burning power plants.

Methanol as an alternative liquid fuel for automotive engines and for fuel cells achieves additional CO{sub 2 } emission reduction benefits. The economics of the process is greatly enhanced when carbon can be sold as a materials commodity.
