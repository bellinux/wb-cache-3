5|$|The next {{mention of}} Qatna after the Story of Sinuhe comes from Mari in the 18th century BC, during the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> Išḫi-Addu of Qatna.

5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city.

In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E

5|$|At {{the head}} of Macedonia's {{government}} was the king (basileus). From at least the <b>reign</b> <b>of</b> PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence is lacking regarding {{the extent to which}} each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework.
