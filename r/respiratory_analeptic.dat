50|$|Theophylline is {{no longer}} used as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>analeptic</b> in newborn infants. Theophylline has a very narrow {{therapeutic}} index, so its dosages must be supervised by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid toxicity.|$|E
40|$|Ethamivan {{was used}} as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>analeptic</b> in the {{treatment}} of nine cases of severe barbiturate poisoning. Initial intravenous injections of 100 to 150 mg. of ethamivan increased the depth of respirations within a minute. Prolonged respiratory stimulation was achieved by a continuous intravenous infusion of 500 to 3000 mg. of ethamivan per litre of fluid. If hypotension occurred, an intravenous drip of noradrenaline was used; fluid overloading was avoided by adjusting the concentrations of drugs given, so that no more than a total of 125 c. c. of fluid per hour was administered. The chief side effect of overdosage of ethamivan was muscular twitching. This did not prove to be a problem and was of some value in determining the amount of drug given. The nine patients survived. It was concluded that ethamivan is a useful agent in the treatment of barbiturate poisoning...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} define a {{reliable}} method for estimating maximal ventilation in cattle, 12 healthy calves underwent a rebreathing trial and injections of increasing doses of lobeline, a <b>respiratory</b> <b>analeptic.</b> The effects of these tests on the main ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, VT; respiratory frequency, fR and minute volume,. VE) recorded during the 15 s of maximal response were studied and compared. The sharp rise in. VE(4. 8 {{times higher than the}} resting value) observed during the rebreathing trial was mainly due to an increase in VT. This rise in ventilation was the highest ever reported in calves. Lobeline dose-dependently enhanced ventilation up to a threshold dose of 0. 25 mg/kg, which always produced a maximal response. This maximal response (3. 7 times higher than the resting value), reflecting both an increase in fR and VT, was reproducible at an interval of 12 h and was highly correlated with that observed during the rebreathing trial (R = 0. 98, P< 0. 001). These results suggest that: (1) rebreathing trial is a reliable method to induce and measure maximal ventilation in calves; and (2) lobeline administration (0. 25 mg/kg) is a reliable means of accurately estimating this variable. Lobeline administration, unlike the rebreathing trial, is safe and easy to standardize, and the test therefore seems to be the preferred way of studying maximal ventilation in calves.

50|$|An {{analeptic}}, in medicine, is {{a central}} nervous system stimulant. The term analeptic typically refers to <b>respiratory</b> <b>analeptics</b> (for example, doxapram). Analeptics are central nervous system stimulants that include {{a wide variety of}} medications used to treat depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and <b>respiratory</b> depression. <b>Analeptics</b> can also be used as convulsants, with low doses causing patients to experience heightened awareness, restlessness and rapid breathing.The primary medical use of these drugs is as an anesthetic recovery tool or to treat emergency respiratory depression.Other drugs of this category are prethcamide, pentylenetetrazole, and nikethamide. Nikethamide is now withdrawn due to risk of convulsions. Analeptics have recently been used to better understand the treatment of a barbiturate overdose. Through the use of agents researchers were able to treat obtundation and <b>respiratory</b> depression. Various <b>analeptics</b> contain epononymous names. E.g. Etamivan has the tradname of Analepticon & synephrine is called Analeptin.|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} pharmacotherapy of ST-elevation {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) in cardiology departments of Saratov hospitals of various types. Material and methods. The retrospective pharmacoepidemiological study {{was carried out}} with involved of 424 hospital charts of STEMI patients, discharged during the year from the cardiology department of Saratov municipal hospital (MH; n= 216) and emergency cardiology department of Saratov clinical hospital (CH; n= 208). Results. The real practice in the audited hospitals are not fully consistent with current guidelines for the STEMI patients management. The relationship between guidelines compliance and hospital type is clearly seen. Doctors in MH in comparison with them in CH more often prescribed <b>respiratory</b> <b>analeptics</b> (13. 4 % vs 5. 3 %, respectively), metabolic drugs (63. 4 % vs 37. 5 %, respectively) and rarer used beta-blockers (50 % vs 88. 9 %, respectively) and thrombolytic therapy (3. 7 % vs 51 %, respectively). In MH dipyridamole was used in 9. 6 % of patients {{as an alternative to}} the acetylsalicylic acid, and clopidogrel was not prescribed. At the same hospital clotting time was determined for monitoring of heparin therapy. Statins were rare used in both hospitals (26 % in MH vs 40 % in CH). Conclusion. The real clinical practice of STEMI patients management in Saratov hospitals are not completely consistent with current clinical guidelines. There are differences in STEMI patients therapy depending on hospital type. </p...|$|R
