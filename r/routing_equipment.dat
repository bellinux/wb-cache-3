30|$|The layout showing {{potential}} machine {{locations in}} Problem- 1 {{is provided in}} Fig. 3. Although the proposed model can address any type of layout shape and material handling system, we prefer to adopt a system served by automated guided vehicles (AGVs) arranged in tandem configuration. AGVs are preferable to stationary material handling robots because of their mobility, and to conveyors because of their flexibility (Asef and Laporte 2005). An AGV system can be reconfigured to accommodate changes in production volume, product mix, product <b>routing,</b> and <b>equipment</b> interface requirements more readily than most other material handling systems (Goetz and Egbelu 1990). In Table 12, we provide the locations of machines in an arbitrarily generated functional layout (where similar machines are placed in close proximity) and five arbitrarily generated distributed layouts (DL 1,..., DL 5). The material handling and machine relocation distances between each pair of locations are shown in Tables 13 and 14, respectively.|$|R

30|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} (WMNs) offer a {{great promise}} in supporting ubiquitous multimedia Internet access for mobile or fixed mesh clients (MCs). In WMNs, Internet traffic from MCs is aggregated by serving mesh router (MR) and forwarded hop-by-hop by MRs to an internet gateway (IGW) or vice versa. While deploying MRs and IGWs, intricate relationships among antenna types, wireless links with adaptive modulation and coding, MAC scheduling, <b>routing,</b> and <b>equipment</b> cost render the network planning an extremely complex problem. This article presents a novel cross-layer MR placement (CMRP) scheme that can cope {{up with this}} issue. CMRP encapsulates the cross-layer metrics into three underlying attributes: Local Coverage (LC), Backbone Residual Capacity (BRC), and Deployment Cost (DC), and are used to minimize the network deployment cost. Coupled with our proposed novel tree-based minimal cost routing scheme and weight-based link assignment for user coverage, {{we are able to}} plan the design of WMNs efficiently. Extensive simulations have been performed to examine the performance and feasibility of CMRP and compared with existing design schemes based on coverage, connectivity, and combination of the two. The result demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing schemes both in the cost performance ratio and potential implementation feasibility.|$|R
30|$|In the past, various schemes {{in various}} layers [7 – 17] {{have been used}} in placing MRs and IGWs so as to enhance the performance. Intricate {{relationships}} among antenna type used, wireless links with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme, MAC scheduling, <b>routing,</b> and <b>equipment</b> cost render the problem of optimal WMN planning extremely complex to address. Similar to the IEEE 802.16 j scheme, some researchers [7, 8] develop schemes to place MRs so as to improve the WMN throughput, while others discuss the problem of MR placement (MRP) either without considering the wireless backbone network specifications for users' demand [9] or just focusing on the user coverage while ignoring users' demand [10, 12 – 16], not to mention the wireless backbone network support. The authors in [11] present an MRP algorithm without considering the cost for various antenna types. To simplify the problem, these works only consider a part of the design parameters associated with the MRP. Therefore, a more sophisticated MRP scheme is desirable to design a cost effective WMN that can meet users' demand both at the local level and at the backbone, with various technical options, such as antenna types, MAC scheduling, and routing.|$|R

40|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990 s, {{the optical}} fiber "backbone" of the {{telecommunication}} and data-communication networks had evolved from megabits-per-second transmission rates to gigabits-per-second transmission rates. Despite this boom in bandwidth, however, users at the end nodes were still not being reached on a consistent basis. (An end node is any device that does not behave like a router or a managed hub or switch. Examples of end node objects are computers, printers, serial interface processor phones, and unmanaged hubs and switches.) The primary reason that prevents bandwidth from reaching the end nodes is the complex local network topology that exists between the optical backbone and the end nodes. This complex network topology consists of several layers of <b>routing</b> and switch <b>equipment</b> which introduce potential congestion points and network latency. By breaking down the complex network topology, a true optical connection can be achieved.
