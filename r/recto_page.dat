[...] In {{the discussion}} of three-columned manuscripts, notation may make use of folio number + recto/verso + column a/b/c (e.g. [...] "f. 3 v. col. c" [...] references the third column on the verso side of the third folio).|$|E
50|$|In a book, {{the side}} of a leaf one reads first is called the <b>recto</b> <b>page,</b> and the back side of that leaf is called the verso page. In a spread, one reads the verso page first and then reads the <b>recto</b> <b>page</b> of the next leaf. In English-language books, the <b>recto</b> <b>page</b> is on the right and the verso page is on the left. By modern convention, these books start with a <b>recto</b> <b>page</b> and hence all recto pages in such books have not even numbers.|$|E
50|$|In {{magazine}} publishing, indicia {{refers to}} a piece of text traditionally appearing on the first <b>recto</b> <b>page</b> after the cover, which usually contains the official name of the publication, its publication date, information regarding editorial governance of the publication, and a disclaimer regarding disposition of unsolicited submissions. In recent years, placement of indicia has moved away from being exclusively on the inside first <b>recto</b> <b>page.</b> Since 2006, American comic books commonly have indicia on the inside last verso page, while magazines may place their indicia almost anywhere within the publication (often on whichever page has the table of contents).|$|E
50|$|Even numbers usually {{appear on}} verso pages, while odd numbers appear on <b>recto</b> <b>pages.</b> In the {{printing}} industry, {{in cases where}} odd numbers appear on verso pages and even numbers on <b>recto</b> <b>pages,</b> this {{is referred to as}} non-traditional folios (in the past, it had been referred to as Chinese folios, however this term has fallen out of favor in recent years).|$|R

The region, encompassing Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, was transformed when the rivers were diverted for cotton irrigation by the former Soviet Union. Drake's resulting self-published book, Two Rivers (2013), was financed via Kickstarter; it was well received by Sean O'Hagan. For Jeffrey Ladd, the book's design (by Sybren Kuiper), notably the way some photographs on <b>recto</b> <b>pages</b> have their right edges on the verso, detracted from it.|$|R

50|$|A {{frontispiece}} {{in books}} generally {{refers to a}} decorative or informative illustration facing a book's title page, being the verso opposite the <b>recto</b> title <b>page.</b> While some books depict thematic elements, other books feature the author's portrait as the frontispiece. In medieval illuminated manuscripts, a presentation miniature showing the book or text being presented (by whom and to whom varies) was often used as a frontispiece.|$|R
30|$|Only seven full-page miniatures {{remain in}} the manuscript, with a conjectured 20 – 40 or more now missing. All the full-page miniatures are found on the versos (v), or back sides of the leaves, facing the {{beginning}} of the text to which each relates. The rectos (r), or front sides, of these leaves are blank, even where this creates a blank two-page spread between the end of the preceding text and the full-page miniature. Almost all the texts in the manuscript, including very short texts such as the suffrages to the saints, begin at the top of <b>recto</b> <b>pages,</b> suggesting that they were intended to face full-page miniatures. For the Hours of the Virgin, one would expect a complete set of eight miniatures, and this is confirmed by the presence of historiated borders at terce (f. 157 r), vespers (f. 166 r), and compline (f. 171 r). The miniature of the Annunciation to the Shepherds, now at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Ms. 60 (95.ML. 53), is thought to have faced f. 157 r. The Hours of the Passion presumably also had a complete set of miniatures, judged from the presence of historiated borders for matins (f. 181 r), and nones (f. 194 r).|$|R
5000|$|In {{publishing}} and {{certain types of}} academic writing, a running header or running headline is a header that appears on each page.

40|$|This article uses content {{analysis}} {{to characterize the}} performance of the media in a national public sphere, by setting apart those qualities that typify internal press coverage of a political event. The article looks at the coverage of the 1999 devolved Scottish election from the day before the election until the day after. It uses a word count to measure the election material in Scottish newspapers the Herald, the Press and Journal and the Scotsman, and United Kingdom newspapers the Guardian, the Independent and The Times, and categorizes that material according to discourse type, day and page selection. The article finds a number of qualities that typify the Scottish sample in particular, and might be broadly indicative of a political public sphere in action. Firstly, and not unexpectedly, it finds that the Scottish newspapers carry significantly more election coverage. Just as tellingly, though, the article finds that the Scottish papers offer a greater proportion of advice and background information, in the form of opinion columns and feature articles. It also finds that the Scottish papers place a greater concentration of both informative and evaluative material in the period before the vote, consistent with their making a contribution to informed political action. Lastly, the article finds that the Scottish sample situates coverage nearer the front of the paper and places a greater proportion on <b>recto</b> <b>pages.</b> The article therefore argues that the Scottish papers display features that distinguish them from the UK papers, and are broadly consistent with their forming part of a deliberative public sphere, and suggests that these qualities might be explored as a means of judging future media performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} {{is based upon}} an article by Michael Andrew entitled ?Amazing Bible Floats in Midair? published in the American tabloid ?Weekly World News? on 9 January 1996. It describes a bible that a maid discovered floating four feet above a bed in a motel {{on the outskirts of}} Sacramento, California. Religious experts spoke of the mysterious phenomenon as ?the miracle of the risen word?. Dr Henry Wanz, a physicist, along with a scientific team were brought in to investigate the phenomenon. But after ?a battery of tests? and efforts to establish whether there was evidence of chicanery, they concluded that there was no explanation for the suspension of the laws of gravity. For Frank Glergins, a 50 -year old ex-Marine and the motel?s owner, the sight of the floating bible changed his life forever. The night before the discovery, a kindly-looking man with a beard checked into the motel and began a discussion about religion with him. Glergins confessed that he didn?t believe in God, but the man assured him that ?You will believe tomorrow?. The bible was open at the page where it is written ?but with God all things are possible? (Matthew 19. 26). The motel owner believed that the message was intended both for him and the world: God could overcome every problem, no matter how difficult. The local clergy petitioned the Vatican to declare it a miracle, but to no avail, while churchman in the area urged the public not to believe that the bearded man (who could never be located) was ?the reincarnation of Jesus Christ?. During its twenty-eight year run, the ?Weekly World News? published largely fictional stories as ?truth?, including numerous articles about mutants, supernatural creatures, aliens, sightings of Elvis alive, and Big Foot. In this respect, the paper was a major contributor to the dissemination and origination of urban mythologies. More often than not, the settings associated with the encounters were vague, witnesses and experts were untraceable, and the stories, inauthenticable. The story of the floating bible conflates several established narratives of religious miracles. In the Roman Catholic tradition there are many claims to visions of the Host (or sacramental wafer), as well as crosses and crucifixes hovering in the air unsupported. The bible, too, contains its own contribution to the suspension genre in the story of an axe head that floated upon the water (2 Kings 6. 1 - 7). In defying the laws of nature, such miracles were the ideal proof of Christianity's authenticity. They were acts that God alone could perform, and clearly visible to many people at once. For the purposes of the composition, the factuality or otherwise of the phenomenon is irrelevant. The story is a visually striking encapsulation of the conflict between science and religion, the miraculous and the empirical. I challenged myself to represent the image sonically and to literally float a bible but with the aid of science and technology rather than divine intervention. In the mundane world, the bible does float free from physical support when it is read aloud. The words are unanchored from the printed page and become audible vibrations or sound waves. In radio broadcasting, these sound waves are, by means of a microphone, converted into an electrical signal, encoded as modulated electromagnetic waves, and transmitted from a radio antenna. The waves are, in turn, received by another radio antenna, a tuner, an amplifier, and finally a demodulator that extracts the sound wave from the original signal so that it can once again float upon the air. The composition?s source material is a reading taken from the Authorized Version of the bible that was broadcast by an American fundamentalist radio station. The same translation is used in Gideons bibles - brown cover, octavo versions of which are deposited by the organization in many motels rooms in the USA. The text for the {{composition is}} based upon the verso and recto (pages 1014 and 1015) of an edition of the Gideons bible that would have been available {{at the time of the}} incident. The text ?with God all things are possible? is printed on the recto. The reading begins, at the top of the verso with the second part of Matthew chapter 19 and verse 3 : ?him, Is it lawful for a man ??. It ends at the bottom of the verso, at Matthew chapter 20 and verse 25 : ? ? and they that are great exercise authority upon them. ? The visible text consists of 1, 285 words. A recording is made of each word. The scripture is then suspended temporally, rather that spatially (as it was in the motel room). The duration of each word?s sound is stretched to 7 minutes and 22 seconds (the time it took the radio broadcaster to read the entire text). All the words of each verse are heard at the same time. On this album, the verses printed on the <b>recto</b> <b>page</b> then, the verso page, and finally both pages can be heard altogether at the close of the suite. The cover artwork for the individual verses (which can be seen by clicking on the track title) is a visual response to the sonic suite. Here, each word on the open pages is written out by hand (the equivalent of speaking the text), scanned, digitally stretched, word by word, to the column height of the text in the Gideon bible, and arranged within the outline of the whole page format in either a verso or recto orientation. The sound articulations of the verses were developed incrementally between the period from April to October 2014. 57 -part work [URL]...|$|E
