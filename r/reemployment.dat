25|$|Adhering to the {{official}} cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down, but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium and {{a seat on the}} republican Council of State. In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a Geneva conference on the generation gap, alongside Louis Armand, Claude Autant-Lara, and Jean Piaget. Also that year, he helped with the recovery and <b>reemployment</b> of a former rival, Traian Herseni. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime. Together, they published Sociologia succesului ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym Traian Hariton.|$|E

2500|$|The Weather Channel {{announced}} in January 2012 {{that it would}} be presenting a six-episode docu-reality series (Hurricane Hunters) in July 2012 depicting the operations of the 53d WRS during the 2011 hurricane season. [...] However even before its debut, the series and its network were beset by controversy when a 53d WRS member, Major (then Captain) Nicole L. Mitchell, an ARWO and an on-camera meteorologist for TWC from July 2004 to January 2011, revealed on 4 June 2012 that she had filed suit 9 September 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against The Weather Channel and its owners, NBC Universal and two private equity firms, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group, claiming that the termination of her employment in 2010 was based on her part-time Air Force Reserve service, was discriminatory and was in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and <b>Reemployment</b> Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994. A second nine-segment season, filmed in August and October 2012, aired on The Weather Channel beginning in June 2013. Mitchell subsequently became the Chief Meteorologist at Al Jazeera America and after September 2015 became the only remaining Air Force meteorologist with personal experience flying through Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|However, a 2000 {{paper by}} Thomas Miles found no effect upon {{aggregate}} employment {{but found that}} adopting the implied contract exception causes use of temporary employment to rise as much as 15%. [...] Later work by David Autor in the mid-2000s identified multiple flaws in Miles' methodology, found that the implied contract exception decreased aggregate employment 0.8 to 1.6%, and confirmed the outsourcing phenomenon identified by Miles, but {{also found that the}} tort exceptions to at-will had no statistically significant influence. [...] Autor and colleagues later found in 2007 that the good faith exception does reduce job flows, and seems to cause labor productivity to rise but total factor productivity to drop. [...] In other words, employers forced to find a [...] "good faith" [...] reason to fire an employee tend to automate operations to avoid hiring new employees, but also suffer an impact on total productivity because of the increased difficulty in discharging unproductive employees. [...] Other researchers have found that at-will exceptions {{have a negative effect on}} <b>reemployment</b> of unemployed (but not already employed) workers, and that hedonic regressions on at-will exceptions show large negative effects on individual welfare with regard to home values, rents, and wages. Verkerke also explains that several international comparative studies have found that [...] "job security has a large negative effect on employment rates." ...|$|E
50|$|Ruth Kanfer is a {{psychologist}} {{known for her}} research {{in the role of}} motivation in a work setting. One of her research studies focused on age and <b>reemployment</b> success after a job loss. She focused on people who were aged 40 and over but were unemployed. Kanfer proposed that chronological age affects job search and <b>reemployment</b> outcomes after job loss. She used a meta-analysis and two supplemental datasets to examine the strength of the relationship between age and speed of <b>reemployment,</b> and whether the relationship between age and <b>reemployment</b> was mediated by job search activities. Her research documented difficulties that people over the age of 50 have in finding jobs, which affects their lives and how they will live after that age.|$|E

50|$|Although trade-dislocated {{workers are}} not {{significantly}} different from workers displaced by other reasons, they present some slight differences. They tend to be older, less educated, more tenured and production-oriented, have higher earnings on the lost job and fewer transferable skills, and the prevalence on women is higher than for other displaced workers. These characteristics are associated with limited labor mobility and <b>reemployment</b> difficulties, especially for workers with obsolete skills who do not receive additional training, no matter the reason of displacement. Furthermore, asymmetric information in absence of good job-search skills and geographic mismatch lead to prolong unemployment. Hence, trade-displaced workers face longer periods to find a new job and have low <b>reemployment</b> rates (63% during the last two decades according to Kletzer, 2005). <b>Reemployment</b> is particularly challenging for older workers. The DOL (2012) reports that in 2012 <b>reemployment</b> rates for workers ages 55 to 64 and 65 years and over were 47 and 24% respectively while the rate for those ages 20 to 54 was about 62%.|$|E
50|$|The period an {{individual}} has to make application for <b>reemployment</b> or report back to work after military service is based on time spent on military duty.

For service of more than 30 days but less than 181 days, the service member must submit an application for <b>reemployment</b> within 14 days of release from service. For service of more than 180 days, an application for <b>reemployment</b> must be submitted within 90 days of release from service.|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, while {{continuing}} in the Naval Reserve, Wright joined the United States Department of Labor (DOL) as an attorney, where he litigated {{to enforce the}} Veterans’ <b>Reemployment</b> Rights Law (VRR). That 1940 law gives individuals the right to <b>reemployment</b> after military service or training. Wright served on an interagency task force which recommended that Congress revise the VRR. In 1994, Congress passed the Uniformed Services Employment and <b>Reemployment</b> Rights Act (USERRA) to make those changes. [...] In April 2008, Wright joined the law firm Tully Rinckey P.L.L.C. as a partner, with the U.S. Navy Veterans Association as a client. He announced his resignation from Tully Rinckey in January, 2009 and was no longer employed by Tully Rinckey by April 2009. He apparently started {{to work for the}} Reserve Officers Association as there attorney around that time, but continued to represent the U.S. Naval Veterans Association.|$|E
50|$|USERRA {{establishes}} the cumulative {{length of time}} that an individual may be absent from work for military duty and retain <b>reemployment</b> rights to five years. The exceptions to the five-year limit include initial enlistments lasting more than five years, periodic United States National Guard and reserve training duty, and involuntary active duty extensions and recalls, especially {{during a time of}} national emergency. USERRA clearly establishes that <b>reemployment</b> protection does not depend on the timing, frequency, duration, or nature of an individual's service as long as the basic eligibility criteria are met.|$|E
5000|$|Sullivan was the {{defendant}} in 1946 United States Supreme Court case, Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock, which first articulated an [...] "Escalator Principle." [...] That principle held that drafted service members returning to work would receive seniority and benefits as though their {{service at the}} company was uninterrupted. In 1994, the Uniformed Services Employment and <b>Reemployment</b> Rights Act eventually codified that principle into law, but in 1946 Fishgold lost the appeal and was not entitled to seniority. However, the right of <b>reemployment</b> under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 was affirmed.|$|E

50|$|The Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration program, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, {{provides}} {{a variety of}} <b>reemployment</b> services including training and job-searching assistance and benefits to displaced workers {{who have lost their}} jobs or suffered a reduction of hours and wages as a result of increased imports or shifts in production outside the United States. The TAA program aims to help program participants obtain new jobs faster, ensuring they retain employment and earn wages comparable to their prior employment. Among the main benefits are: trade readjustment allowances (TRA) in addition to regular unemployment insurance (UI) up to 117 weeks of cash payments for all workers concurrently enrolled only in full-time training (workers must be enrolled in training 8 weeks after certification or 16 weeks after layoff, whichever is later, to receive TRA), and <b>Reemployment</b> Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) or supplementary wages for workers age 50 and over, and earning less than $50,000 per year in <b>reemployment.</b> It {{provides a}} wage supplement equal to 50% of the difference between a worker's <b>reemployment</b> wage and wage at the worker's certified job with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over a period of up to two years (workers must be reemployed within 26 weeks). The TAA used to include a Health Coverage Tax Credit Program which will definitively expire at the end of 2013 and other tax credits related to health coverage will become available (e.g. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). The program promotes retraining since workers receive the TRAs only if they participate in a full-time TAA training (or are under a waiver). The program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) in cooperation with the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.|$|E
