The low pressure system in place moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Definition of {{individual}} risk profile {{is the first}} step to implement strategies to keep the delicate balance between under- and overimmunosuppression after kidney transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS We used data from the Efficacy Limiting Toxicity Elimination Symphony Study (1190 patients between 2002 and 2004) to model risk of rejection and infection in the first year after kidney transplantation. External validation was performed in a study population from the Fixed-Dose Concentration-Controlled Trial (630 patients between 2003 and 2006). RESULTS Despite different temporal dynamics, rejections and severe infections had similar overall incidences in the first year after transplantation (23. 4 % and 25. 5 %, respectively), and infections were the principal cause of death (43. 2 % of all deaths). Recipient older age, deceased donor, higher number of HLA mismatches, and high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> cytomegalovirus disease were associated with infection; deceased donor, higher number of HLA mismatches, and immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporin A (compared with tacrolimus), with rejection. These factors were integrated into a two-dimensional risk stratification model, which defined four risk groups: low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection and rejection (30. 8 %), isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> rejection (36. 1 %), isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection (7. 0 %), and high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection and rejection (26. 1 %). In internal validation, this model significantly discriminated the subgroups in terms of composite end point (low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection/rejection, 24. 4 %; isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> rejection and isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection, 31. 3 %; high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection/rejection, 54. 4 %; P< 0. 001), rejection episodes (isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection and low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection/rejection, 13. 0 %; isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> rejection and high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection/rejection, 24. 2 %; P= 0. 001), and infection episodes (low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection/rejection and isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> rejection, 12. 0 %; isolated <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection and high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> infection/rejection, 37. 6 %; P< 0. 001). External validation confirmed the applicability of the model to an independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS We propose a two-dimensional risk stratification model able to disentangle the individual <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> rejection and infection in the first year after kidney transplantation. This concept can be applied to implement a personalized immunosuppressive and antimicrobial treatment approach...|$|R

5|$|Through its Global Trade Finance Program, the IFC {{guarantees}} trade payment {{obligations of}} more than 200 approved banks in over 80 countries to mitigate risk for international transactions. The Global Trade Finance Program provides guarantees to cover payment <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> emerging market banks regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange, letters of credit, bid and performance bonds, supplier credit for capital goods imports, and advance payments. The IFC issued $3.46 billion in more than 2,800 guarantees in 2010, of which over 51% targeted IDA member nations. In its fiscal year 2011, the IFC issued $4.6 billion in more than 3,100 guarantees. In 2009, the IFC launched a separate program for crisis response, known as its Global Trade Liquidity Program, which provides liquidity for international trade among developing countries.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} researched areas of mental illness {{in the context of}} its association with religiosity is depression. The thrust of studies published over the last century found religious/spiritual factors to be generally associated with lower rates of depression.

The primary aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between religiosity and depression longitudinally, utilizing a 10 -year follow-up, and to explore the potential differential impact of religiosity on the prevalence of depression in those at high versus low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression. Results suggest that 1) prospectively, a personal importance of religion is protective against MDD over a 10 -year period; 2) prospectively, there exists a differential effect of religious belief on MDD in individuals at high versus low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression; 3) prospectively, the protective effect of religious/spiritual importance against MDD is exclusive to individuals at high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression based on parental MDD status; 4) Time 10 Catholicism is protective against MDD cross-sectionally 5) The protective effect of Catholicism may be more prevalent in individuals at low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression than in individuals at high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression; 5) cross-sectionally, there exists a differential impact of religious attendance on the prevalence of MDD in those at high risk versus those at low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression at Time 10 : for those at high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression, religious attendance is associated with increased rates of MDD; 6) cross-sectionally, after controlling for social support there exists a differential impact of religious attendance on MDD in those at high versus low <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression: in individuals at high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression, after controlling for social functioning, religious importance becomes a <b>risk</b> factor <b>for</b> MDD...|$|R
