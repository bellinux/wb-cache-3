5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM <b>responds</b> <b>to</b> DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily <b>responds</b> <b>to</b> stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E

However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which <b>responds</b> <b>to</b> an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|Antennal lobe interneurons of male Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) were {{investigated}} by using intracellular recording and staining techniques. Physiological and morphological characteristics of local interneurons and projection neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> sex pheromone and plant-associated volatiles are described. The interneurons identified {{were divided into}} three groups, depending on their physiological response characteristics. Both types of interneurons, local interneurons and projection neurons, were described in all three groups. 1. Interneurons <b>responding</b> exclusively <b>to</b> sex pheromone stimuli, displayed different degrees of specificity. These neurons <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> either one, two, three or {{all four of the}} single sex pheromone or sex pheromone-like compounds tested. Most of these neurons also <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> a mixture of the two pheromone components present in the female S. littoralis blend. Two local interneurons and one projection neuron were identified as blend specialists, not <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> the single female produced sex pheromone components, but only to their mixture. Five pheromone specific projection neurons arborized in one or more subcompartments of the macroglomercular complex (MGC) and some of them had axonal branches in the calyces of the mushroom body and {{in different parts of the}} lateral protocerebrum. 2. Interneurons <b>responding</b> only <b>to</b> plant-associated volatiles varied highly in specificity. Neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> only one of the stimuli, neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> a variety of different odours and one neuron <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> all stimuli tested, were found. Three specialized local interneurons had arborizations only in ordinary glomeruli. One specialized and three less specialized local interneurons had arborizations within the MGC and the ordinary glomeruli. The projection neurons <b>responding</b> only <b>to</b> plant-associated volatiles had mostly uni- or multiglomerular arborizations within the ordinary glomeruli. 3. Interneurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> both sex pheromones and plant-associated stimuli varied in specificity. Individual interneurons that <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> few plant-associated odours mostly <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> several pheromone stimuli as well. Projection neurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> most of the plant-associated volatiles also <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> all pheromone stimuli. Two local interneurons <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> both stimulus groups, arborized within the MGC and the ordinary glomeruli. Projection neurons mostly arborized in only one ordinary glomerulus or in one compartment of the MGC.

The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities.

5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it <b>responds</b> <b>to</b> prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day.

Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
