40|$|International audienceAccurately {{localize}} {{a mobile}} vehicle {{with an easy}} and quickly deployable system can be very useful for many applications. Herein we present an EKF-SLAM algorithm which allows using radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>beacons</b> without any prior knowledge of their location. As <b>RF</b> <b>beacons</b> provide only range information, recovering their positions {{is not an easy}} task. For this range-only SLAM case, a new procedure to instantiate the beacons in the filter is proposed. The method uses two range measurements from different robot's positions to initialize two hypotheses for the beacon's location, which are then integrated in the filter as a Gaussian mixture. This approach is evaluated and compared to other initialization techniques in simulation and with a real dataset.

40|$|Abstract In this manuscript, {{we propose}} an on-line trajectory-tracking {{algorithm}} for nonholonomic Differential-Drive Mo-bile Robots (DDMRs) {{in the presence}} of possibly large para-metric and measurement uncertainties. Most mobile robot tracking techniques that depend on reference <b>RF</b> <b>beacons</b> rely on approximating line-of-sight (LOS) distances between these beacons and the robot. The approximation of LOS is mostly performed using Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements of signals propagating between the robot and <b>RF</b> <b>beacons.</b> However, accurate mapping between RSS mea-surements and LOS distance remains a significant challenge and is almost impossible to achieve in an indoor reverberant environment. This paper contributes {{to the development of a}} neighboring optimal control strategy where the two major control tasks, trajectory tracking and point stabilization, are solved and treated as a unified manner using RSS measure-ments emitted from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. The proposed control scheme is divided into two cas-caded phases. The first phase provides the robot’s nomi-nal control inputs (speeds) and its trajectory using full-state feedback. In the second phase, we design the neighboring optimal controller, where RSS measurements are used to better estimate the robot’s pose by employing an optimal filter.

40|$|Autonomous airdrop systems exhibit {{significant}} improvements over their unguided counterparts {{due to the}} addition of control mechanisms and real-time feedback. Increased landing accuracy comes with a high dependence on accurate sensor measurements (primarily GPS) and a consistent nominal system and environment. Unfortunately, airdrop systems represent a highly uncertain class of aerial vehicles where operation at off-nominal, degraded conditions is the norm and not the exception. Degraded conditions are caused by numerous effects including: parafoil rigging changes caused by canopy opening shock, parafoil damage during canopy inflation, parafoil canopy collapse, payload mass and inertial loading imbalances, human rigging errors, etc. Additionally, the loss of GPS feedback due to environmental causes (urban or canyon environments blocking the signal or causing multi-pathing issues) and active GPS denial by tech savvy adversaries present a second classification of degraded flight. These issues must be addressed to aid the continued expansion of the parafoil technology for delivery and re-entry purposes. This work applies two solutions to overcome the problems of physical degraded flight conditions and loss of GPS feedback. A highly adaptive control law is embedded {{at the core of}} the new guidance, navigation and control (GNC) algorithm to identify system dynamics and control sensitivity using a discrete nonlinear Hammerstein dynamic model. All model parameters are estimated in-flight to maintain a high level of landing accuracy under a large range of degraded flight conditions.

Analyzing the information recorded from pervasive sensor networks can provide insight about human behavior for better personalized system services, as well as richer media content and social communication. With these increased capabilities, serious concerns which create great obstacles to the deployment of such network are raised with regard to privacy and boundaries. However, there exist no real data currently about privacy in pervasive media networks and most {{studies that have been}} made so far are speculative. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a configurable infrastructure that can protect users' dynamic levels of privacy in a pervasive sensor network. Through an active badge system, users have different options to disable each type of data transmission. This work evaluates approaches for privacy protection through conducting an extensive user study in an actual ubiquitous invasive sensing environment to obtain feedback via sensor system data and questionnaires and correlates that information for future reference in the design of privacy-protected ubiquitous sensor networks. Results from the user study indicated that an active badge for on-site control, especially periodically broadcast <b>RF</b> <b>beacon</b> for privacy control, is the most effective and acceptable method. (cont.) However, it also suggested that if every occupant in the building used this approach to constantly block all data transmission, significant system blinding (on the order of 30 % or more) would be incurred.

40|$|StrathSat-R is an {{experiment}} proposed for ESA/DLR's REXUS 13 sounding rocket campaign to validate different inflation deployment techniques in space conditions. The primary {{objective was to}} deploy and validate two structures in micro-gravity and near vacuum conditions by using residual air inflation. The experimental setup consisted of two CubeSat-based ejectables, the first of them deploying a pyramidal structure {{that can be used}} for passive orbit transfer and de-orbiting, and the second containing a morphing inflatable with multiple cells, which will actively modify its shape during flight by using pumps connected to cells to alter the distribution of air. StrathSat-R was originally selected to be launched from Esrange Space Centre in Kiruna on board of the REXUS 13 rocket in May 2013. Unfortunately, due to a procedural omission by the launch service provider, the two ejectable sections of the StrathSat-R experiment were not ejected during flight and remained inside the rocket. The experiment did perform nominally and recorded the flight, but could not carry out its experimental goals without ejection. Therefore, a second launch opportunity was granted to the team with the experiment launched once again on REXUS 15 in May 2014. This paper presents the design changes and improvements made in the different subsystems between both launches, as well as the results of the second sounding rocket flight. The new experiment presents a more robust and reliable electronic subsystem, avoiding problematic components in the original design, and includes slight modifications in the design and the fabrication procedures of the two inflatable structures.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{wildlife}} tracking {{market can}} be regarded as a niche market in the worldwide tracking industry. The methods considered for RF wildlife tracking are limited to techniques that can be reconciled with the cost, size and power consumption limitations required by this application. For this reason the primary method of wildlife tracking till recently was still based on an <b>RF</b> <b>beacon</b> transmitter fitted to the animal and a mobile manually operated tracking device that is equipped with a RF receiver. This method of tracking is very time consuming, as the animal is tracked by physically searching for it in the wild, which mostly limits the tracker to focus on one animal at a time. Another method that found limited use in wildlife tracking is GPS positioning combined with communication by means of satellite telemetry. This method of tracking is very expensive, the physical size of the tracking device limits the usage of this system to large animals, and there are to date not an efficient power source to drive this system for a desired period of time without putting undesired stress on the animal. Recent advances in the world of wireless communications resulted in the widespread use of RF tracking based on mobile transceivers that communicate not with a mobile tracking device or with satellites but with the beacons of a fixed installed wireless network. The primary method of positional tracking used in this industry is GPS location based on triangulation, with data communication by means of GSM or an alternative network of fixed RF transmitters. Using the communication capabilities of GSM networks as basis for wildlife tracking enables a level of efficiency, flexibility and cost-effectiveness that cannot be matched by the earlier approaches. As this new approach to wildlife tracking has not been applied in practice before as an integrated part of wildlife management systems, the need existed to investigate the design, development, production and support of a wildlife tracking system that is based on these advances in technology. The results of this method of tracking opened up a whole new dimension in wildlife tracking for research, security and wildlife management, {{based on the fact that}} GPS is a global means of determining positional data and GSM is a globally accepted means of data transfer that is expanding each day.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 The thesis reports on the evaluation and comparison of various signal processing algorithms for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of a high frequency (HF) beacon signal from a CubeSat in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The DOA of the HF beacon signal is {{expressed in terms of}} the two angles, azimuth (α) and elevation (). The azimuth and elevation angles of the received HF signal are calculated from the phase differences between signals observed at three elements of an L-shaped crossed-loop antenna array. The algorithms which were evaluated are the Zero Crossing (ZC), Cross Correlation (CC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Cross Power Spectral Density (CPSD) algorithms. A theoretical analysis was done to demonstrate that the phase differences at the radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> of the <b>beacon</b> are propagated to the baseband signals. The algorithms were thus tested using simulated baseband signals as would be derived from the RF signals intercepted by the three elements of an L-shaped crossed-loop antenna array. Gaussian noise with a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was added to the simulated baseband signals. The algorithms were implemented in MATLAB. The criteria for the selection of the best algorithm were accuracy and speed. The standard deviation (SD) of the azimuth and elevation errors was used to measure the performance accuracy of each algorithm, while the computational time for a given number of samples and runs was used to express the speed of each algorithm. First the ZC, CC, FFT and CPSD algorithms were evaluated for various SNR values, and compared with respect to SD of the azimuth and elevation errors. The analysis of the simulations demonstrate that the FFT and CPSD algorithms outperform the ZC and CC algorithms by estimating the DOA with a small SD of errors even at the low SNR of 0 dB, where the noise amplitude {{is the same as the}} signal amplitude. The ZC algorithm estimates the DOA with a large SD of error at low SNR due to multiple ZC points occurring during the same cycle. The ZC algorithm breaks down when the SNR decreases below 35 dB. The accuracy of the ZC algorithm depends on the method by which the ZC points are detected. The CC algorithm breaks down when the SNR decreases below 10 dB. The CPSD and FFT algorithms break down when the SNR decreases below – 20 dB. However, at a high SNR of 40 dB and above, all the algorithms estimate the DOA with a SD of error smaller than 1 ˚ for the azimuth and elevation. Next, the ZC, CC, FFT and CPSD algorithms were compared with respect to computation time. The FFT was found to be the fastest algorithm. Although the CPSD and the FFT algorithms reach the same accuracy in the estimation of the DOA, the FFT was selected as the optimum algorithm due to its better computation time. Recommendations are made regarding the implementation of the proposed algorithms for real signals from the HF direction finding (DF) array. At the time of submission of this thesis, such signals were not yet available...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSN), {{power consumption}} {{continues to be a}} major problem despite advances in power management techniques. In general, the most power hungry component in a wireless sensor node is the radio subsystem. Apart from outgoing data transmissions, the radio is also responsible for monitoring the wireless channel for incoming data packets intended for it. Most existing radio power management techniques are based on the general principle of duty-cycling with scheduled wakeup. In a scheduled wakeup scheme, the receiver node wakes up at regular intervals to check for any incoming transmissions. If there are no data transmissions, it goes back to sleep. For WSN applications characterized by a small number of sporadic transmissions per day (e. g., detecting rare events), analysis of the energy profile of scheduled wakeup shows that 85 - 90 % of a node’s energy is spent on monitoring the wireless channel. This implies that even though there are only very few transmissions, {{a substantial portion of the}} node’s energy is spent on merely looking for wireless activity. In addition, the cost of time synchronization, which is required for scheduled wakeup schemes to work effectively, also contributes to the energy overhead of the node. ^ This research focuses on reducing the energy overhead due to channel monitoring. The approach, which we term on-demand wakeup, wakes up the main radio only when there is data to be received; else it is asleep. This design employs a novel hardware component called the on-demand wakeup trigger (OWT) component at the receiver node. The OWT component consumes almost zero power and is always on. When the transmitter is ready to transmit data, it first sends out an <b>RF</b> <b>beacon</b> that is processed by the OWT component to generate a hardware interrupt. This interrupt serves as an RF trigger to wake up the receiver’s main radio. Since the transmitter and receiver are now active, data transmission ensues. Hence the energy consumed by the main radio is eliminated in on-demand wakeup. ^ A Markov chain based power model was developed to estimate the improvement in the node lifetime obtained by on-demand wakeup. The hardware and software for on-demand wakeup have been designed and integrated with a commercially available wireless sensor node to illustrate and evaluate the concept. For applications characterized by a small number of sporadic transmissions per day and fast response time requirement, experimental results showed a 4 - 6 X increase in lifetime for on-demand wakeup when compared to scheduled wakeup. Also, the additional energy overhead due to the OWT component in the on-demand wakeup scheme is negligible when compared to the channel monitoring energy overhead in scheduled wakeup schemes. ...|$|E
40|$|IWT Baekeland mandateIn current {{healthcare}} environments, such as {{hospitals and}} other skilled nursing facilities, a trend towards mobile and personalized interactions between patients and medical staff has recently emerged. Personalized care {{is capable of}} increasing the patient comfort feeling, since {{he or she is}} adequately assisted within a limited amount of time, while also the care giving staff benefits from location based services: automated access control, automated availability of the patient's care files, assistance in drug administering, etc. Even though these personalized, location based services are clearly time preserving for the care giving staff, technological constraints combined with economical considerations cause these services to still be very little implemented in the current care facilities. The most considerable technological barrier is the fact all people present in the care facility (nurses, physicians, but also patients and technology assisting staff) should be located throughout the care facility within a reasonable amount of time, or even more challenging: continuously tracked. The present doctoral research focuses on the development of an indoor localization system specifically designed for use in healthcare facilities, which are characterized by long corridors and small, more or less equally sized rooms at each side of this corridor. Therefore, the field of application hence includes hospitals with possibly thousands of patient beds, but also smaller topologies as can be found in rest homes. The developed system must by all means by scalable, and provide accurate localization up to room level (or locate people in a certain sector of a corridor). The research focuses on a method by which a mobile unit worn by a person is capable of locating itself indoors, based on signal strength measurements which can be related to RF beacons installed at predetermined positions in the care facilities. These predetermined positions correspond to the actual location of ubiquitously available nurse call network access points, thus ensuring easy integration and cost effectiveness. For reasons of location update speed, only a minimal amount of simple yes/no decisions is needed. No prerequisites regarding the used hardware are required, except for an RF chip capable of performing RSS measurements. With extensive testing and statistical support, we prove the algorithm {{can be used in a}} healthcare setting with an envisioned level of localization accuracy up to room level (or region level in a corridor), while avoiding heavy investments. To simulate the performance of the developed indoor localization algorithm, a method for simulating signal strength measurements is developed, in which several building related parameters (room sizes, etc.) and RF related parameters (path loss exponents, EM wave attenuation due to wall penetration, etc.) can be entered. Hence, a performance prediction tool is available and can be used for other RF chips than the one used in this research. The mobile device is able to reason on information captured from beacons in the used communication channel, on condition that the sent information contains valid information about the beacon's position. An automated method for ensuring the information is correct, is described in this work: an automatic commissioning system of newly deployed beacons is proposed. Newly deployed beacons gather signal strength measurements between themselves while the commissioning system uses this centrally collected information to assign a secondary IEEE MAC 48 address to each <b>RF</b> <b>beacon</b> in an organized way. nrpages: 266 status: publishe...|$|E
