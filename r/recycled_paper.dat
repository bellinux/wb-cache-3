5|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{that such a}} large event could not be carbon-friendly, the presidential committee incorporated environment-friendly measures in its planning of the inaugural events. The environmental measures included the use of recyclable carpet for the platform, retrieval of recyclable items from outdoor areas after an event, {{and the use of}} <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> for invitations and inaugural ball tickets.|$|E
5|$|The record-breaking {{publication}} of Half-Blood Prince {{was accompanied by}} controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high value bets were made {{on the death of}} Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where, it was believed, the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened. Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% <b>recycled</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, <b>recycled</b> <b>paper,</b> biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E

5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using <b>recycled</b> <b>paper.</b> In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E
25|$|Economist Steven Landsburg has {{suggested}} that the sole benefit of reducing landfill space is trumped by the energy needed and resulting pollution from the recycling process. Others, however, have calculated through life-cycle assessment that producing <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> uses less energy and water than harvesting, pulping, processing, and transporting virgin trees. When less <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> is used, additional energy is needed to create and maintain farmed forests until these forests are as self-sustainable as virgin forests.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008 five paper {{companies}} in Japan {{were accused of}} misleading customers about the <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> content of their products. Oji Paper, the largest paper company in Japan, admitted that its copy and print paper contained 5 to 10% <b>recycled</b> <b>paper,</b> instead of the 50% stated. The president of Oji Paper apologized to its customers, {{and the president of}} Nippon Pages, the second largest paper company in Japan, resigned to take responsibility. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission said it would investigate.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan has}} two value chains to produce pulp. The first is {{thermomechanical}} process, which is fed chippings directly from external sources, {{as well as}} on-side chopping of lumber. The bark from the lumber is extracted and used in as on-site heating. The second source of pulp is from <b>recycled</b> <b>paper,</b> sourced both domestically and through import. The <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> goes through a deinking process before becoming usable deinkled pulp (DIP). A small portion of calcium carbonate {{is added to the}} pulp before processing.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{proliferation}} of freesheet newspapers continues to escalate, {{the impact on the}} environment is fast becoming a major concern to many environmentalists. Over 44 million editions are being produced every day worldwide; it takes 12 established trees to make one tonne of newsprint, which is enough to print 14,000 editions of an average-size tabloid. That means a daily usage of newsprint of a little over 3,142 tonnes. Which, in turn, means the felling of 37,714 trees. On average around 70% of paper used by the newspaper industry is claimed to be recycled. So after <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> usage, over 11,314 trees are being felled daily to feed the freesheet print presses in over 58 countries. Also, whilst the increased use of <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> is welcomed by many, the extensive bleaching (especially use of chlorine) and other chemical processes to make reclaimed paper blank again for reuse are not lessening the concerns of environmentalists.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{industrialisation}} of {{the paper}} production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It {{was not until the}} introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, two new studios {{were built}} {{and they were}} {{equipped}} with low-energy lighting which has saved approximately 90,000 kwh per year. A carbon literacy course was ran with Heads of Departments of EastEnders attending and as a result, representatives from each department agreed to meet quarterly to share new sustainability ideas. The paper usage was reduced by 50 percent across script distribution and other weekly documents and 20 percent across all other paper usage. The production team now use <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> and recycled stationery.|$|E
25|$|One million {{invitations to}} Barack Obama's inauguration were sent {{out in the}} first week of January 2009. Printed between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, the invitations invited people to {{celebrate}} Barack Obama's inauguration as the forty-fourth President of the United States. The invitations have kept the same basic design of a gold seal and black script since the 1949 inauguration of Harry S. Truman, but this invitation was produced in a green manner, using <b>recycled</b> <b>paper,</b> by companies certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} as NorskeCanada in 2000, when Norske Skog bought {{the majority of}} Fletcher Challenge Canada with Elk Falls Mill and Crofton Mill. The following year Pacifica Papers, operating Port Alberni Mill and Powell River Mill, was merged into the group. A recycling plant in Coquitlam was bought in 2003. The group took the Catalyst name in 2005 and the following year Norske Skog sold their shares. Snowflake Mill was bought in 2008, but in the following two years the Elk Falls, Coquitlam and one machine at Crofton were shut down. Snowflake followed suit in 2012. The reason was falling demand for newsprint and increased cost of <b>recycled</b> <b>paper.</b> Catalyst reentered US production in 2015 with the purchase of Biron Mill and Rumford Mill.|$|E
50|$|In {{the time}} after the Second World War, the number of farms shrank markedly, and those that were left thereby became bigger. Farms run as primary {{businesses}} became secondary businesses.

25|$|Some {{of these}} efforts include the {{construction}} of the Green Roof in 2006. The roof helps to keep the building temperature regulated while using less energy which aids in keeping pollution low. The plant life, which is a sedum species, helps to purify the air. The green roof also reduces stormwater runoff - which can cause sewage backup during periods of deluge. NOW implements a 100% <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> policy and uses only vegetable-based dyes for print. This effort, each year, saves over 28,000 living trees, reduces greenhouse gases - the equivalent given off by 534 cars, eliminates 7 swimming pools of waste water and saves 79 garbage trucks worth of solid waste. Now also partners with Green Enterprise Toronto (GET) and Canopy (formerly Markets Initiative). Both companies are dedicated to responsible business and green initiatives.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Unomásunos {{circulation}} in Mexico City was of 7,000. Several of its closes competitors greatly surpassed Unomásunos circulation; La Jornada had 60,000, while Excélsior had 40,000. The following year, Unomásuno {{was not among}} the top newspapers in Mexico with certified daily circulation above 18,000. Its rival Excélsior was on {{the top half of}} the list with 55,492 confirmed daily circulations. Without the financial backing from the PRI that it once benefited from, Unomásuno was unable to increase its daily circulation. It was also because Unomásuno was marginalized by its readers following the defeat of the PRI by the National Action Party (PAN) in the 2000 presidential elections. By 2005, Unomásunos quality and readership had declined, in large due to its publications being characterized with having a cult of personality, yellow journalism, and for reporting gossip short-stories as factual accounts. In addition, the design was not appealing to many its readers, was difficult to read, was sometimes poorly printed, and was made from <b>recycled</b> <b>paper.</b> It was not uncommon for readers to find orthographic mistakes and prose errors.|$|E
25|$|Ink for {{the invitations}} was {{supplied}} by Chicago company BuzzInk, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies selected Precise Continental of Brooklyn, New York to print the invitations. Precise Continental {{was selected because}} it is a union company, uses <b>recycled</b> <b>paper,</b> and is Forest Stewardship Council certified. The printing technique for the invitations was engraving. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press with a sheet of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression {{on the front of the}} page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom. The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial. The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness and shine, and the final print run added the fine details to the seal. One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The invitations were printed one at a time on 11×17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8½×11 sheets.|$|E
