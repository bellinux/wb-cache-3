40|$|Abstract—A {{study of}} the effects of traps on the RF charac-teristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is {{conducted}} using small and large-signal microwave measurements with deep-level optical spectroscopy. Different variations of the drain current swing are observed for illuminations of different photon energies. The time evolution of the current swing in transient measurements enabled to determine the optical transient time-constant and the equilibrium relaxation time-constant. The dependence of the S-parameters upon the illumination yielded results consistent with the variation of the drain current swing under illumination. A variation in the small signal transconductance and drain conductance was extracted at 2 GHz which presumably arises from the variation of the drain <b>resistance</b> <b>under</b> <b>illumination.</b> In addition, it was verified that the SiN passivation greatly helps in mitigating the RF performance degradation arising from deep trapping centers.

It would be fundamentally transformative if optical gating was used for spin-FET. We report {{a new type of}} spin-polarized {{field-effect transistor}} (spin-FET) with optical gating, which is fabricated by partial exposure of the (La,Sr) MnO 3 channel to light-emitting diode (LED) light. The manipulation of the channel conductivity is ascribed to the enhanced scattering of the spin-polarized current by photon-excited antiparallel aligned spins. And the photon-gated spin-FET shows strong light power dependence and reproducible enhancement of <b>resistance</b> <b>under</b> light <b>illumination,</b> indicting well-defined conductivity cycling features.

40|$|Death of Escherichia coli {{resulted}} when {{a buffer}} suspension was exposed simultaneously to colloidal benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and 355 -mμ illumination. Neither hydrocarbon nor illumination alone caused death; oxygen {{had to be}} present. The survival curve had a shoulder, and then death proceeded exponentially with time. Death rate was independent of temperature between 6 and 32 C. The duration of the shoulder, however, decreased slightly with increase in temperature. The shoulder was not due to delay in BP entering the cell. Death {{was influenced by the}} composition of the medium in which the cells were grown prior to illumination. The amount of BP bound to the cells was determined after three ethyl alcoholether extractions. Appreciable binding occurred in the presence of 355 -mμ illumination with air, and relatively little binding occurred under nitrogen; very little binding occurred in the dark with nitrogen or air. At the outset, rate of binding <b>under</b> <b>illumination</b> with air was not temperature-dependent, but with time it became strongly temperature-dependent. Binding <b>under</b> <b>illumination</b> with nitrogen was temperature-independent. Bound BP was associated primarily with cell protein. Cells in growth medium resisted death and BP binding.
