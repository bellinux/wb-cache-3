5|$|All {{three of}} the stelae were {{discovered}} by Teoberto Maler in 1901 {{near one of the}} site's main temple, the O-13 pyramid. Stela 13 was possibly erected on a terrace reached by the pyramid's main stairway, and Stela 18 lies in a <b>row</b> <b>on</b> the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway. Stela 23, on the other hand, was erected at the very base of the pyramid. This pyramid was most likely the burial place for Itzam K'an Ahk II, and—seeing as how Ha' K'in Xook, Yo'nal Ahk III, and K'inich Yat Ahk II all revered the site as a dynastic shrine—it is further evidence to back the argument that Ha' K'in Xook was the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth <b>row</b> <b>on</b> each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E

5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows {{on the side of the}} tooth, and two or three in the other <b>row</b> <b>on</b> the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
5|$|The current M-11 follows Remembrance Road, Wilson Avenue and 28th Street. The {{first two}} of these names were chosen to memorialize the roadway in honor of local people. Remembrance Road was {{dedicated}} in 1923 on the initiative of the {{local chapter of the}} Daughters of the American Revolution. They planted 231elms in a double <b>row</b> <b>on</b> each side of the highway and erected a boulder bearing a bronze plaque dedicated to the veterans of Kent County. Wilson Avenue was named for Samuel H. Wilson, a local realtor. He had developed a series of local residential subdivisions in the area up until his 1931 death, In 1942, the county road commission named Wilson Avenue in his honor to comply with a state law requiring roads that benefitted from state funds to have proper names.|$|E

50|$|The {{legislative}} chamber {{is designed}} to have four <b>rows</b> <b>on</b> the government side and three <b>rows</b> <b>on</b> the opposition side. This is because elections have traditionally yielded a strong government majority; in fact on occasion, such as currently, even {{with many of the}} seats {{on one side of the}} House, the government has spilled over to the opposition side. Quite often the House is oriented to have only two <b>rows</b> <b>on</b> the opposition benches, in the event of a large opposition adding a third row makes the opposition benches rather crowded.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one <b>row</b> <b>on</b> the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|The {{third part}} of {{qualifying}} determined pole position {{and only the}} two Mercedes drivers set two timed laps. After he clocked in behind both Ferrari drivers in his first run, Rosberg improved to second place on his second time out, {{but was unable to}} challenge teammate Hamilton, who took the fiftieth pole position of his career. Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen locked out the second <b>row</b> <b>on</b> the grid ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight on the grid. Therefore, Q3 saw little running with the final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and back margins are straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a <b>row</b> <b>on</b> the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E

At Fastlane, Ziggler challenged Owens to a match for the Intercontinental Championship, which he lost. In the following weeks, Ziggler began to re-ignite his feud with The Authority, and on the March 14 episode of Raw, he confronted Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. This resulted in Ziggler being granted a match against Triple H where if he won, he could pick his match at WrestleMania (excluding the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match); however, Ziggler lost. At WrestleMania 32, Ziggler competed against Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, The Miz, Stardust, Sin Cara and Zack Ryder in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, which was won by Ryder.|$|E

5|$|Determined {{to become}} part of the fashion industry, but unable to make a breakthrough, Everest decided to use his {{knowledge}} of tailoring. He answered an advertisement placed in the London Evening Standard, in 1982, by Tommy Nutter; 'Boy wanted in Savile Row'. He pestered Nutter for weeks, until he was given the job. Nutter's client base included rock stars, celebrities, politicians and businessmen; he famously dressed The Beatles and The Stones. Everest also mixed with future celebrities of the fashion world. John Galliano, who had been studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, passed on some design skills to Everest, while on work placement with Nutter. Everest met his future wife Catherine (now an actress and film producer) at this time, while she was also working with Nutter. The couple have two daughters. Everest's time under Nutter, a Savile Row revolutionary in the 1960s, inspired him to experiment with tone and pattern in his own designs. In 1986, after nearly five years as Nutter's apprentice, Everest was persuaded to move on to work for Malcolm Levene. He had become disillusioned with Savile Row, particularly with their lack of appreciation for Nutter's more modern approach. Everest found that working with Levene, a small menswear retailer based away from Savile <b>Row,</b> <b>on</b> Chiltern Street, provided a welcome change. During Everest's first year there, Levene's turnover doubled.|$|E
5|$|Four {{putative}} first lower molariforms (mf1s) of Ferugliotherium are known, and {{the only}} known tooth of Trapalcotherium is also thought to be an mf1. Ferugliotherium mf1s are roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bear two longitudinal rows of cusps. There are four cusps in the lingual <b>row</b> (<b>on</b> {{the side of the}} tongue) and three in the labial row (the side of the lips). The cusps are connected to cusps in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from cusps in their own rows by three transverse furrows. Two heavily worn Ferugliotherium mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of Vucetichia gracilis by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two preserves the roots; at the front and back, there were two roots, fused at their bases. The mf1 of Trapalcotherium differs only in some details; among others, the cusps are less distinct from the crests. The sole mf2 of Ferugliotherium is the holotype. It bears two rows of two cusps. The cusps in the front and back pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow. Transverse ridges between the cusps similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Moore {{formed a}} tag team with Yang, {{with the two}} {{defeating}} Deuce 'n Domino. They later competed in a tag team battle royal {{to determine the number}} one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the November 9 episode of SmackDown, but were the second team eliminated. In December, Moore and Yang challenged John Morrison and The Miz for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful, igniting a feud between the two teams. The following week on ECW, Moore and Yang defeated Morrison and The Miz in a non-title match, to earn a rematch for the championship. On January 1, 2008, Moore and Wang Yang once again beat Morrison and the Miz, this time in a six-person tag team match also involving Layla and Kelly Kelly. The following week, in a Fifteen Minutes of Fame Match, Moore and Wang Yang tied the champions on pinfalls, meaning Miz and Morrison retained the championship. Throughout late January and February, Moore and Yang moved into a feud with Deuce 'n Domino, defeating them two weeks in a <b>row.</b> <b>On</b> the February 15 episode of SmackDown, Moore, Yang, and Jesse and Festus defeated Deuce 'n Domino and Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in an eight-man tag team match on SmackDown. In April, Moore and Yang reignited their feud with Morrison and The Miz, losing to them twice in tag team encounters. Yang and Moore went on to win singles matches against Morrison and The Miz respectively, earning another match for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the May 2 episode of SmackDown, but were unsuccessful once again.|$|E

5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single <b>row</b> <b>on</b> each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E

Orr built one of the most distinctive rows in the district, 6-10 Madison, from 1845-48 specifically with wealthy homebuyers in mind. The pointed-arch windows and Gothic tracery suggest the possible influence of Andrew Jackson Downing's architectural theories.|$|E
