40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{evaluation and}} analysis of U.

Effluent activities were compiled and analyzed and trends were identified using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test to show long-term U. S. nuclear industry effluent release patterns. Using UNSCEAR and U. S. NRC dose methodologies, the average collective effective doses and doses to maximally exposed individuals were calculated. Summary data from every plant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>radiological</b> environmental <b>monitoring</b> programs were studied to identify the impact of radiological releases. Evaluation of {{this portion of the}} research led to an on-site investigation at one nuclear power plant. ^ Results of the research showed that the entire industry effluent releases have mostly remained level over the study period. Decreasing trends were shown in the PWR and total gaseous fission and activation gases and the BWR non-tritium radionuclides. Increasing trends were shown in the PWR and total liquid tritium and the BWR gaseous tritium. Both estimated collective effective doses and doses to maximally exposed individuals were well below regulatory limits. The highest annual effective dose and cumulative dose calculated was 1. 68 × 10 - 7 mSv GW- 1 person- 1 and 1. 19 × 10 - 9 mSv, respectively. No correlation was found between effluent release activities and electrical generation, when compared alone. Analysis of the <b>radiological</b> environmental <b>monitoring</b> programs demonstrated that, overall, the routine operation of all facilities had no significant radiological impact on the environment or human health for the study time period.

5000|$|The Mohawk {{began as}} a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would {{outperform}} the Cessna L-19 Bird Dog. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the Korean War. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, artillery spotting, air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and <b>radiological</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small [...] "jeep" [...] escort class carriers (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as {{the winner of the}} competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 kts. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the close air support (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.|$|E
50|$|Assigned to the Repair and Service Unit (Task Unit 1.8.1) of Joint Task Force 1, for Operation Crossroads, {{the atomic}} bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, Enoree {{departed}} Manila on 4 June 1946, and arrived at Bikini on 13 June 1946. She provided fuel for the other units assigned to the work there {{for the next two}} weeks before shifting to Kwajalein on 29 June 1946. During Test Able, on 1 July 1946, she lay at Kwajalein, about 155 nautical miles (178 statute miles; 287 km) southeast of Bikini, and because of the favorable weather conditions and the relatively small size of the bomb, received no contamination from the atomic blast. Underway on 3 July 1946, Enoree returned to Bikini the following day, and remained anchored there until the second dog watch on 13 July 1946, when she again got underway to return to Kwajalein. Reaching her destination the following afternoon, she replenished her fuel supplies there and then set course for Bikini on the 16th, arriving the following morning. Between 20 and 23 July 1946, she supplied oil to various units of the task force. Underway late in the afternoon watch on 24 July 1946, Enoree was underway the following morning (25 July 1946) in company with the destroyer tender , and observed Test Baker, the shallow underwater detonation, from a distance in excess of 17 nautical miles (19.5 statute miles; 31.5 km). Enoree ultimately returned to Bikini lagoon during the morning watch on 29 July 1946, and resumed dispensing fuel oil, a vital logistical task that occupied her throughout much of the month of August 1946. She left Bikini for the last time on 24 August 1946, when she sailed for Kwajalein, arriving the next day. A <b>radiological</b> <b>monitoring</b> team boarded the ship on the morning of 28 August 1946, and declared her radiologically safe, clearing her to sail.

40|$|BackgroundIncidental {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) {{are identified}} when the abdomen is imaged for other reasons. These are common, and many undergo incomplete <b>radiological</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The association between monitoring completeness and population-based outcomes {{has not been}} studied. MethodsA cohort of incidental AAAs (defined as previously unidentified aortic enlargement exceeding 3 cm found on an imaging study done for another reason) was linked to population-based data. Patients were followed to elective AAA repair, AAA rupture, death, or March 31, 2009. Monitoring completeness was gauged as the sequential number of months without a recommended abdominal scan. Its association with time to elective AAA repair and time to death was measured using a multivariable Cox regression model adjusting for other important covariates. ResultsWe identified 191 incidental AAAs between 1996 and 2004 (median diameter of 3. 5 cm [range, 3. 0 - 5. 3 cm], median follow up of 4. 4 years [range, 0. 6 - 12. 7 years]). During the study, patients spent a median of 19. 4 % of their time with incomplete AAA monitoring (interquartile range [IQR] 0. 3 %- 44 %); 56 patients (29. 3 %) had no follow-up imaging of their aneurysm. Nineteen patients (10. 0 %; 2. 0 % per year) underwent elective AAA repair, and 79 patients (37. 7 %; 7. 6 % per year) died. Independent of important covariates, people were {{significantly less likely to}} undergo elective repair (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 03) and significantly more likely to die (HR, 2. 99) if their AAA went without <b>radiological</b> <b>monitoring</b> for 1 year. ConclusionsIncomplete incidental AAA <b>radiological</b> <b>monitoring</b> was significantly associated with a decreased risk of elective AAA repair and an increased risk of death.
