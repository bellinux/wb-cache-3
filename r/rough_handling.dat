5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept <b>rough</b> <b>handling.</b> It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperament}} of the West Highland White Terrier {{can vary}} greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It {{will not tolerate}} <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> such as a child pulling on its ears, and can be both food- and toy-possessive. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate <b>rough</b> <b>handling.</b> The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E

The foremast was still standing, but the fore-topsail was flying loose, and the head-sails were streaming out in long white pennons in front of her. Never have I seen a vessel which appeared to have gone through <b>rougher</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|R
5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate <b>rough</b> <b>handling.</b> The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} 51st Army joined the North Caucasian Front at Kuban. In July, Marshal Budenny received orders {{to combine the}} Southern Front and North Caucasian Front into a single formation retaining the title of North Caucasian Front, and 51st Army joined the 'Don group' of that front under General Lieutenant Rodion Malinovsky, along with the 12th Army and the 37th Army. On 22 July, army commander Major general Nikolai Trufanov was relieved of command. As part of the Stalingrad Front (from 1–5 August), then briefly with the Southeast Front (from 6 August until 27 September), and then back with the Stalingrad Front it {{took part in the}} Battle of Stalingrad. On 31 July when it came under Stalingrad Front control it was so worn down by its previous <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> that it was only 3,000 men strong. It was attacked on the same day by the 4th Panzer Army, which was able to break through. During Operation Uranus, the counterattack from Stalingrad, the 4th Mechanized Corps began its attack from the 51st Army's sector. In early December, 51st Army was deployed to cover the Kotelnikovo approaches against German relief attempts by the LVII. Panzerkorps. On 24–25 December 1942, the commander of 51st Army, Major-General N.I. Trufanov, organized a local offensive operation on the right flank with the forces of three rifle divisions, and moved to the north bank of the Aksav River, {{on the eve of the}} Kotelnikovo offensive operation, which eventually defeated the German efforts made as part of Operation Winter Storm to relieve the Sixth Army in Stalingrad. On 30 January 1943, the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 51 destroyed the 51st Army's Headquarters, near Salsk. Dropping 100– 250kg bombs, a wave of Junkers Ju 88s and Heinkel He 111s destroyed the communications center, working offices of the chief-of-staff, the operational headquarters and the offices of the operational duty officer. Up to 20 buildings and personnel billets were also destroyed. Casualties among personnel were also very high.|$|E
25|$|Though {{small in}} terms of {{accommodation}} in comparison with modern boats with wider beams and greater headroom, the compact cabin of the Contessa resulted from the low, narrow-beamed design that emphasized <b>rough</b> weather <b>handling</b> and seaworthiness {{at the expense of}} cabin space.|$|R
5000|$|A Cabinet meeting held on 6 July {{discussed}} the riots {{of the previous}} two days, with Prime Minister Winston Churchill demanding to know [...] "Why could we not keep better order? Had we no British troops to call in to restore order? Where was our military police? Were we going to let these wild Canadians break up the homes of these poor innocent shopkeepers?" [...] Churchill's military adviser Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke replied {{that it would have}} been [...] "only as a very last resort that I should order British troops to <b>rough</b> <b>handle</b> Canadians who are giving trouble... In such cases Canadians must deal with their own nationals. Even British Red Cap police must be kept out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The knives {{were large}} ones with <b>rough</b> <b>handles</b> and strong blades, and when Luka took one {{out from a}} bundle and said to the chief, [...] "We will give this knife for enough skins to finish the hut," [...] he gave an order to his wife, and she {{and two of the}} other women at once brought some elk hides from a pile lying by the side of his tent. A few {{stitches}} here and there with the needle made of a sharp fish-bone, with a thread of twisted gut, fastened the corners of the hides together, and in half an hour the tent was complete. The goat-skins were spread on the ground. The fox and other skins were made into two piles, one {{on each side of the}} tent, and all the goods stored inside.|$|R
5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E

25|$|After the <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> of {{his light}} brigade, the viceroy {{expanded}} {{it into a}} light division and put General of Brigade Joseph Marie, Count Dessaix at its head. He added three additional voltiguer battalions, two more cannons, and the 9th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment. The new division was destined to {{play a key role}} in Eugène's victory at the Battle of Piave River on 8 May 1809.|$|E
50|$|Centerfire {{cartridges}} {{are more}} reliable {{for military purposes}} because the thicker metal cartridge cases can withstand <b>rougher</b> <b>handling</b> without damage, and safer to handle because explosive priming compound in a protruding rim {{is more likely to}} be triggered by impact if a rimfire cartridge is dropped or pinched. The stronger base of a centerfire cartridge is able to withstand higher pressures which in turn give a bullet greater velocity and energy. While centerfire cartridge cases require a complex and expensive manufacturing process, explosive handling is simplified by avoiding the spinning process required to uniformly distribute priming explosive into the rim because of uncertainty about which angular segment of a rimfire cartridge rim will be struck by the firing pin. Larger caliber rimfire cartridges require greater volumes of priming explosive than centerfire cartridges, and the required volume may cause an undesirably high pressure during ignition. Reducing the amount of priming explosive would reduce the reliability of rimfire cartridge ignition, and increase the probability of misfire or dud cartridges.|$|R

25|$|Graft patency is {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors, including the type of graft used (internal thoracic artery, radial artery, or great saphenous vein), the size of the coronary artery that the graft is anastomosed with, and, of course, the skill of the surgeon(s) performing the procedure. Arterial grafts (e.g. LITA, radial) are far more sensitive to <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> than the saphenous veins and may go into spasm if handled improperly.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{in chicken}} farms may be unsanitary, {{allowing}} {{the proliferation of}} diseases such as salmonella, E. coli and campylobacter. Chickens may be raised in very low light intensities, sometimes total darkness, to reduce injurious pecking. Concerns have been raised that companies growing single varieties of birds for eggs or meat are increasing their susceptibility to disease. <b>Rough</b> <b>handling,</b> crowded transport during various weather conditions {{and the failure of}} existing stunning systems to render the birds unconscious before slaughter, have also been cited as welfare concerns.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of {{the heads}} show some form of damage or {{mutilation}} {{that may or may}} not have been deliberately inflicted upon them before they were placed in the tomb. One of the most common features is for their ears to be broken off or seemingly chiseled away At least one scholar disputes that the damage to the ears was deliberate, pointing out cases where detached ears have been found in perfect condition, and that the damage may be due more to <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> by tomb robbers. Of the many reserve heads only one has wholly intact ears; in others they have been scraped off close to the surface, whereas other or more crudely hacked or broken away. One example contained dowel holes for the attachment of external ears which were not found with the head, and another, smaller group of reserve heads were not made with any ears at all.|$|E
40|$|Skin {{damage and}} meat quality are very {{important}} issues for the whole pig industry as well as animal welfare. To investigate the real impact of pre-slaughter period and its entity on carcass apperance and meat quality, a Risk Assessment approach was applied on 1680 Italian heavy pigs which were examinated and frequency of pigs’behaviour was recorded and related to carcass, ham, loin and shoulder/head damage. The operators’handling was recorded too. The main potential cause of damage both unloading and to the stunning resulted the use of driving devices by operators for the highest frequency and calculated risk of lesions. The effect of pre-slaughter stress was also evaluated on some quality traits of pork. Twenty-eight pigs of different breed (Italian large White, Italian Duroc and Pietrain) were subjected to <b>rough</b> and gently <b>handling</b> before stunning {{and the level of}} lactate, pro-, macro- and total glycogen were evaluated in longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus musles. Pigs <b>rough</b> <b>handled</b> before death tended to presents muscles with lower level of pro-, macro- and total glycogen and higher level of lactate, with little differences among breeds. Also transport is known to be another very stressful event for pigs which influence skin damage score and meat quality. Data of 3. 650 heavy pig batches were collected to identify the relationship between the transport and ham estetical and technological defects that make them rejected from PDO Parma Consortium. The results shown that short (170 km) travel distances may have adeverse effects on the incidence of defects on fresh hams together the season of transport, where Autumn and Spingtime are the seasons with highest incidence of ham defects. It’s clear that pre-slaughter events as transport and handling affect animal welfare and ham defects, total carcass damage and meat quality parameters...|$|R
50|$|Conventional swept-back {{stressed}} skin construction tail surfaces were a 35° sweptback fin and 40° swept tail-planes {{just above the}} rear fuselage. Control surfaces were Ailerons on each wing, a rudder on the fin and elevators on the tail-planes. The fuselage was a two step design with a high length to beam ratio to improve <b>rough</b> water <b>handling,</b> v-section planing bottom, two steps and was divided into nine water-tight compartments the forward and rear compartments being pressurised. Engine nacelles for the Lyul'ka AL-7F engines were attached to the fuselage sides under the wing centre-section.|$|R
50|$|The Mauser Model 1895 {{iron sight}} line had an open post type front sight, and a tangent-type rear sight with a rear notch. These {{standard}} sight lines consisted of somewhat coarse aiming elements making it suitable for <b>rough</b> field <b>handling,</b> aiming at distant area fire targets and low light usage, but less suitable for precise aiming at distant or small point targets. The rear tangent sight was graduated for 1893 pattern 7×57mm Mauser cartridges loaded with a 11.2 g long round-nosed bullet from 400 to 2000 m in 100 m increments.|$|R
25|$|Since those {{involved}} with the production {{had no idea of}} the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure. Nine other puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded. In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> by children and storage in an attic. Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then.|$|E
25|$|At Florence and Halldale, two {{officers}} issued {{a plea for}} assistance in apprehending a young suspect who had thrown an object at their car and whom they were now pursuing on foot. Approximately two dozen officers, commanded by 77th Street Division LAPD officer Lieutenant Michael Moulin, arrived and arrested the youth, 16-year old Seandel Daniels, forcing him {{into the back of}} a car. The <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> of the young man, a minor who was well known in the community, further agitated an uneasy and growing crowd, who began taunting and berating the police. Among them was Bart Bartholemew (who was later attacked and had his driver side window broken), a freelance photographer for The New York Times, and Timothy Goldman, who began to record events with a camcorder over the next two hours. The police formed a perimeter around the arresting officers as the crowd grew more hostile, leading to further altercations and arrests (including that of Damian Williams' older brother, Mark Jackson). Fearing police would resort to deadly force to repel the growing crowd, Lieutenant Moulin ordered officers out of the area altogether. Moulin later said that officers on the scene were outnumbered and unprepared to handle the situation because their riot equipment was stored at the police academy.|$|E
25|$|Nordmann {{received}} {{promotion to}} Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 24 May 1809. Archduke Charles appointed him {{to lead the}} army Advance Guard, with 11,837 infantry, 2,528 cavalry, and 26 guns. This mass of troops numbered more than the V or VI Armeekorps. Under his command were four brigades under Friedrich Riese, Joseph Mayer, Peter von Vécsey, and Franz Frelich. At the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, Charles assigned the Advance Guard and the VI Armeekorps to cover the river bank {{while the rest of}} the corps assembled farther inland. This doomed Nordmann's force to <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> on the 5th when Napoleon's troops in greatly superior strength forced a crossing on the east side of Lobau Island and rolled up the Austrian defenses. Before retreating to the north, the Advance Guard suffered heavy losses, including most of its artillery. Nordmann took position on the Austrian left flank, in rear of Prince Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg's IV Armeekorps. That evening, the Advance Guard was subordinated to Rosenberg. On 6 July, Nordmann was slain in heavy fighting at the village of Markgrafneusiedl. He was one of four Austrian generals killed or mortally wounded at Wagram, the others being Josef Philipp Vukassovich, Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré, and Peter Vécsey.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} perceived roughness {{of the end}} of a tool is influenced by the texture of the handle used to hold it. Participants rated the roughness of the ends (caps) of a series of tools by rubbing them along their forearm, and indicated the perceived roughness of the tool's cap by means of an anchored visual scale. The caps of the tools had one of eight different levels of roughness varying from very smooth (sample 1) to very rough (sample 8). The participants held the tool handle in one hand while rubbing the cap of the tool against their contralateral forearm. The tool handle was either smooth (similar in smoothness to sample 1) or else very rough (matched in roughness to sample 8). Overall, participants were remarkably good at ignoring the roughness of the tool's handle when discriminating the roughness of the tool's cap. Nevertheless, the roughness of the tool handle was shown to modulate roughness judgments concerning the tool cap under certain conditions: in particular, tool caps at the rougher end of the scale (6 and 7) were rated as being significantly less rough when the participants held tools with a <b>rough</b> <b>handle</b> than when they held tools with a smooth handle. Our results therefore demonstrate a small but significant effect of the roughness of the handle of a tool on the perceived roughness of its cap...|$|R

500|$|The inquiry covered {{possible}} explosion scenarios involving sabotage, faulty fueling procedures, {{failure of}} the moorings of the Quinault Victory, defects in munitions, {{the presence of a}} super sensitive element in the ordnance, problems with steam winches and rigging, <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> by loaders and organizational problems within the base. The Navy determined that the tonnage contest between divisions was not at fault, although the Judge Advocate warned that [...] "the loading of explosives should never be a matter of competition." [...] The officers in charge were cleared of guilt. The report stated that the cause of the explosion could not be determined, but implied that a mistake made by the enlisted men in the handling of the ordnance was most likely at root. No mention was made of the men's lack of training in the handling of explosives.|$|E
500|$|Development continued, {{but there}} were {{problems}} with service regulations that were not written with such an unconventional weapon in mind. The sticky bomb was inevitably rather fragile and even a specially designed box could not fully meet the army's demanding requirements for withstanding <b>rough</b> <b>handling</b> without damage. It seemed there were problems at every turn. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who was concerned {{with the state of}} the country's anti-tank defences, learnt about the grenade and urged its development. The Ordnance Board of the War Office did not approve the grenade to be used by the Army. However, Churchill ordered further tests to be conducted in July, and after personally viewing a demonstration of the grenade ordered that it immediately be put into production. His memo of October 1940 simply read [...] "Sticky bomb. Make one million".
