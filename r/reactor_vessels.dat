25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{adequate}} cooling, the materials inside of the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> overheat and deform as they undergo thermal expansion, and the reactor structure fails once the temperature reaches the melting point of its structural materials. The corium melt then accumulates {{at the bottom of}} the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel.</b> In the case of adequate cooling of the corium melt, the melt can solidify and the spread of damage is limited to the reactor itself. However, corium may melt through the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> and flow out or be ejected as a molten stream by the pressure inside the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel.</b> The <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> failure may be caused by heating of its vessel bottom by the corium melt, resulting first in creep failure and then in breach of the vessel. Cooling water from above the corium layer, in sufficient quantity, may obtain a thermal equilibrium below the metal creep temperature, without <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> failure.|$|R
25|$|Construction on Byron Nuclear Generating Station {{began in}} 1975, at a 1,782-acre (7.2km²) site, 17miles (27km) {{southwest}} of Rockford, Illinois, {{south of the}} city of Byron in Ogle County. The firm of Sargent & Lundy acted as consulting engineer during construction and Babcock & Wilcox oversaw the completion of the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels.</b> Before construction was completed on the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels</b> and facilities, at least three groups joined in a 1981 lawsuit to halt Byron Nuclear Generating Station's completion. The League of Women Voters, DeKalb Area Alliance for Responsible Energy, and others were involved in the lawsuit over the safety of and need for the plant. In 1984 the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, a division of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), stopped the planned nuclear station at Byron by refusing its owners, then Commonwealth Edison, permission to begin operation. The decision stemmed from concerns about the quality control of independent contractors hired during construction. Ultimately, the board overturned its decision in October1984 and permission was granted to operate after a re-inspection of over 200,000items and components within the plant.|$|E
25|$|Pure oxygen {{activated}} sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels</b> with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen atmosphere-mixed liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), {{can be controlled}} by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, pressure swing adsorption, or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October 2011, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission {{presented}} a timetable in a draft report titled, “how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”. Within 10 years, a start {{should be made}} with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning {{would take more than}} 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels</b> are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.|$|E

50|$|HPCI {{consists}} of a pump or pumps that have sufficient pressure to inject coolant into the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> while it is pressurized. It is designed to monitor the level of coolant in the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> and automatically inject coolant when the level drops below a threshold.

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{concern and}} {{interest}} {{in the safety of}} nuclear power plants have increased considerably since the Fukushima accident. In the event of a severe accident, the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level cannot be measured. The <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level has a direct impact on confirming the safety of reactor core cooling. However, {{in the event of a}} severe accident, it may be possible to estimate the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level by employing other information. The cascaded fuzzy neural network (CFNN) model can be used to estimate the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level through the process of repeatedly adding fuzzy neural networks. The developed CFNN model was found to be sufficiently accurate for estimating the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level when the sensor performance had deteriorated. Therefore, the developed CFNN model can help provide effective information to operators in the event of a severe accident...|$|R

40|$|Safety-related {{parameters}} {{are very important}} for confirming {{the status of a}} nuclear power plant. In particular, the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level has a direct impact on the safety fortress by confirming reactor core cooling. In this study, the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level under the condition of a severe accident, where the water level could not be measured, was predicted using a fuzzy neural network (FNN). The prediction model was developed using training data, and validated using independent test data. The data was generated from simulations of the optimized power reactor 1000 (OPR 1000) using MAAP 4 code. The informative data for training the FNN model was selected using the subtractive clustering method. The prediction performance of the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level was quite satisfactory, but a few large errors were occasionally observed. To check the effect of instrument errors, the prediction model was verified using data containing artificially added errors. The developed FNN model was sufficiently accurate to be used to predict the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level in severe accident situations where the integrity of the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level sensor is compromised. Furthermore, if the developed FNN model can be optimized using a variety of data, {{it should be possible to}} predict the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> water level precisely...|$|R
