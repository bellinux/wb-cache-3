40|$|The {{contents}} of protein, amino acids, reducing sugars, fibre (ADF), lignin (ADL) and mineral components in tissues of smooth brome grass – Bromus inermis and <b>rescue</b> <b>grass</b> – Bromus unioloides were determined. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to compare the nutritive value of either species of grass...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of daily dry weight {{increment}} and assimilation area of the investigated plants the production indexes NAR, LAI and CGR and yields of dry weight were calculated for three years. The comparison of indexes and yields showed that the dynamics and mass increment of <b>rescue</b> <b>grass</b> are higher that those of smooth brome grass...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElachista synethes was {{recently}} {{recognized as an}} alien species in northern Chile, where its larvae mine the <b>rescue</b> <b>grass</b> Bromus catharticus (Poaceae). In order to provide the necessary information to allow field detection of E. synethes during early ontogeny, we conducted a morphological reappraisal of the immature stages of this leaf-miner moth, based on light and scanning electron microscopy, including the first descriptions of the egg and the first-instar larva. This is the first report {{of the existence of}} an apodal early larva for a species of Elachista Treitschke. The legs and prolegs are absent in the first two instars, but are well developed in the last two. Additional observations on the life history are also provided, including a description of the mine...|$|E
50|$|The Richland Township Volunteer Fire Department {{is located}} on County Road 500 N, just East of Alexandria Pike on the west-central side of the township. The fire {{department}} provides fire suppression, rescue, and basic life support services to all of Richland Township and mutual aid services to surrounding areas. The fire department is staffed by approximately 35 volunteer members who are trained in fire suppression, emergency medical services, and rescue. The fire department has seven pieces of apparatus: one fire engine (Engine 48), two 3,000-gallon tankers (Engine/Tanker 40 & Tanker 44), one Medium Rescue (<b>Rescue</b> 49), one <b>Grass</b> truck (Grass 47) and two transporting BLS ambulances (Ambulances 45 and 46). Richland is also {{the home of the}} Madison County Hazardous Materials Decontamination Team (Decon 40), which has a fully equipped decon trailer, including a mass decontamination tent. The fire department responds to approximately 400-450 calls for service per year.|$|R
