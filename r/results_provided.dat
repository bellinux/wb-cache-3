Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E

25|$|After sitting the HKCEE {{and having}} their {{examination}} results announced, candidates could {{apply for a}} place in sixth form in local schools in Hong Kong. Moreover, {{to qualify for the}} Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), students had to pass certain requirements of HKCEE as a prerequisite. The Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS), including the EAS system under JUPAS, also considered students' HKCEE results as a requirement and as a decisive factor of admission in the admission processes. Thus, students' results in HKCEE affected their application to sixth form but also directly affected the chance of entering the universities after seventh form, which was commonly ignored by students until they entered sixth form. In JUPAS, most admissions programs gave HKCEE results about a 10–30% weight, and some as much as 50%; the HKALE <b>results</b> <b>provided</b> the other 50%. Thus, HKCEE was the initial stage of University Entrance Examination.|$|E

Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's [...] "quantum energy levels". Before a collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities.|$|E
500|$|The Pleistocene is a {{geological}} epoch {{that began}} about 2.6 million years ago. [...] The Holocene, the current geological epoch, begins about 11,700 years ago, when the Pleistocene ends. [...] Establishing {{the date of}} this boundary − which is defined by sharp climatic warming − as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists {{for much of the}} 20th century. [...] At Two Creeks, in Wisconsin, a fossil forest was discovered (Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area), and subsequent research determined that the destruction of the forest was caused by the Valders ice readvance, the last southward movement of ice {{before the end of the}} Pleistocene in that area. [...] Before the advent of radiocarbon dating, the fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at Two Creeks with sequences in Scandinavia. This led to estimates that the trees were between 24,000 and 19,000 years old, and hence this was taken to be the date of the last advance of the Wisconsin glaciation before its final retreat marked the end of the Pleistocene in North America. [...] In 1952 Libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from the Two Creeks site and two similar sites nearby; the dates were averaged to 11,404 BP with a standard error of 350 years. [...] This result was uncalibrated, as the need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood. [...] Further results over the next decade supported an average date of 11,350 BP, with the results thought to be most accurate averaging 11,600 BP. [...] There was initial resistance to these results on the part of Ernst Antevs, the palaeobotanist who had worked on the Scandinavian varve series, but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists. [...] In the 1990s samples were tested with AMS, yielding (uncalibrated) dates ranging from 11,640 BP to 11,800 BP, both with a standard error of 160 years. [...] Subsequently, a sample from the fossil forest was used in an interlaboratory test, with <b>results</b> <b>provided</b> by over 70 laboratories. [...] These tests produced a median age of 11,788 ± 8 BP (2σ confidence) which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP. [...] The Two Creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing the modern understanding of North American glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene.|$|E
