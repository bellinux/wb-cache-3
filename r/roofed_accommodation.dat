The exterior of the building is substantially intact. The alterations have diminished the interiors and distorted some internal spatial relationships but much original internal fabric remains including the main entrance hall and main office, the rear entrance porch and telephone booth, terrazzo flooring throughout the building including fine examples of terrazzo in the entrances, panelling, joinery including doors and windows, shelving, furniture, anti-actinic glazing to the windows and leadlight and cut glass decorative glazing to doors and fanlights.

500|$|The {{first group}} of 200 prisoners were transported {{under the control of}} Dr James Pattison Walker from Calcutta. Deportees {{included}} many prominent leaders of the Wahabi movement (an Islamic [...] "reform movement") and the subsequent revolution.) The prisoners landed at the Andaman Islands on 10 March 1858. Walker soon put the convicts on the arduous task of clearing the dense forest of Ross Island, building their own shelters and other buildings, and laying roads. The prisoners were chained and collared around the neck with identity tags, and were in a poor state of health. In the beginning there were no basic amenities. During the rainy season they had to live in tents. In November 1858 temporary barrack-type huts with walls made of mats and with leaking thatched <b>roofs</b> provided <b>accommodation</b> for about 1,000 prisoners.|$|R
5000|$|On June 26, 2008, Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter {{accepted}} PennPraxis' {{recommendations for}} the introduction of Foxwoods and SugarHouse casinos in the redevelopment of the Delaware River waterfront. [...] The plan, while not binding on the two casino operators yet, strongly recommends serious redesign of the casinos' plans, {{including the use of}} off-site parking accessible to non-patrons. [...] Representatives from both casinos accused PennPraxis of being biased against them. [...] It was later reported that PennPraxis hired five experts to devise alternative plans for the casinos, accommodating for reduced on-site parking, a breakdown from a more singular building mass to allow more public access to the river, a 30-percent allotment of the area for open space, use of green <b>roofs</b> and <b>accommodations</b> for mass transit, to conform to PennPraxis' civic vision, parts of which the mayor has since promised to accept.|$|R

50|$|Trinity House {{decided to}} build a {{lighthouse}} and foghorn in 1891 and the building was designed by their engineer Sir Thomas Matthews. The 17 m tower, buildings and surrounding wall was constructed by Arthur Carkeek of Redruth who had to flatten the headland before building could commence. The five-wick Argand lamp provided by Messrs Chance, of Smethwick near Birmingham, was commissioned on 26 September 1900 and replaced in 1926 by an electric one. The original Argand oil lamp was {{on display at the}} Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum, Penzance until 2005 when the museum closed. Pendeen Lighthouse was automated in 1995 with the keepers leaving the station on 3 May. Apart from the tower itself, with its machinery built into the base, there is an 'E' shaped building split into a terrace of four cottages. Three of the cottages were originally used to house the three resident keepers, their wives and families, with the fourth used as an office area and sleeping accommodation for the supernumerary keepers. They are now let as holiday cottages. Behind the cottages are three kitchen gardens (which soon fell into disuse as nothing would grow in such an exposed position) and, on the seaward side of the complex, a foghorn and its accompanying machinery. Water was originally collected off the flat <b>roof</b> of the <b>accommodation</b> block and stored in an underground tank.|$|R
50|$|The {{facade of}} the new Court was {{designed}} specifically to complement the Commonwealth Bank building. Construction of the building was begun in 1934 and completed in 1936. The Annual Report for the Department of Public Works, 1934 gave the following description:This building, which will be of concrete and brick construction with cement finish externally and tile <b>roof,</b> will provide <b>accommodation</b> for the Police Court and officials connected therewith. The main facade, facing East street, is designed with portico to match the neighbouring building of the Commonwealth Bank, and together with the Supreme Court, should complete a pleasing architectural group... accommodation will be provided for the Clerk of Petty Sessions and his staff, together with strong rooms, and also the Police Magistrate.... In rear approached from entrance drive to the Supreme Court, will be situated the new court room... with verandahs on either side and at rear, and with rooms for solicitors and witnesses... Altogether, the building when completed, should be an asset to the already long list of handsome buildings erected in this city.Estimated cost of construction was to be £7,825. The colour for the Police Court building was also chosen so as {{to blend in with}} the Commonwealth Bank. At the same time new police buildings and courthouses were being erected in Mackay, Dalby and Toowoomba. The Police Court was accommodated in this building until being altered to its present arrangement as a Magistrate's Court in 1991.|$|R
