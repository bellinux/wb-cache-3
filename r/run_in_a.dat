5|$|A BT46 {{competed in}} 'B' {{specification}} {{once again in}} 1979 in the Gunnar Nilsson Trophy race at Donington Park. This was an event held {{to raise funds for}} the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Fund. Originally intended as a non-championship Formula One race, without FIA sanction it was instead <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time trial format, with victory going to the fastest single lap recorded. As it was not an FIA event, the car's illegality was not a factor. Nelson Piquet drove, coming fourth of the five cars competing.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt was not {{expected}} to make the Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, but he {{was added to the}} bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and fourteen strikeouts (to go with just two walks) in fourteen innings in Spring training. His major league debut came on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched two innings, giving up three hits and a <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 140 loss.

5|$|Cain was the Giants' {{number three}} starter in 2009. He threw six shutout innings {{and had an}} RBI single against Mike Pelfrey on May 17 in a 20 victory over the Mets. In his next start on May 23, he threw a {{complete}} game, allowing just one run as San Francisco defeated the Seattle Mariners 51. On June 4, {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader, he threw a five-inning complete game, allowing one <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 41 victory over the Nationals. He allowed one <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complete game against Oakland on June 14, striking out nine as the Giants won 71. From May 7 through June 14, Cain won seven straight decisions. On July 5, Cain was announced as an All-Star {{for the first time in}} his young career. On Cain's final start before the All-Star Game, he was hit by a line drive right below his elbow and was forced to miss pitching for the NL All-Star Team, although he did still attend and was announced as an All-Star. Duke replaced Cain on the NL All-Star team. Cain threw a complete game on August 3 against Houston; however, he suffered the loss for the first time in his career when throwing a complete game, allowing four runs in a 43 defeat. On September 25, Cain was awarded the Willie Mac Award.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the Great Western Railway Chiltern Main Line was routed {{directly}} through Wood Siding, but no interchange station was built. The GWR was to <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908 and 1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line.|$|E
25|$|Mick Lewis {{finished}} with bowling figures of 10–0–113–0 which (as of 4 February 2016) {{remains the most}} <b>runs</b> conceded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single ODI match.

5|$|In December 2008, President-elect Barack Obama {{nominated}} two-term incumbent Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, {{leaving an}} empty {{seat in the}} United States Senate. After two months and many potential names considered, then-Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand as the interim Senator from New York. Gillibrand was required to <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special election in 2010 for the permanent position, which she won with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012 with 72% of the vote, the highest margin for any statewide candidate in New York.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|In Game 2 of the NLDS against Atlanta on October 8, Burrell hit {{a three-run}} home <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 54 loss. On October 16, in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Phillies, {{he had an}} RBI double against Roy Halladay. Nate Schierholtz then pinch-ran for him, scoring the winning run in the Giants' 43 victory. In the World Series, Burrell struck out eleven times in {{thirteen}} at-bats, had no hits, and was benched for Game 4. However, the Giants won the World Series in five games, and Burrell received his second championship ring.|$|E

5|$|Ms. Mililani Minerva Mudd, Millie's mother, is a lawyer, who is as an older, wiser, more {{temperate}} {{version of}} Millie. She was like Millie in her childhood, {{and as a}} result knows how to deal with any trouble caused by her, much to Millie's annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss.

5|$|New York State Route17A (NY17A) is a {{state highway}} in {{southern}} New York in the United States, entirely within Orange County. Its western terminus {{is located in the}} village of Goshen at a junction with NY17, and its eastern terminus is at another intersection with NY17 located in Southfields. It runs concurrently with NY94 from Warwick to Florida. It serves mainly to connect Warwick {{with the rest of the}} county. While it is an east–west route, many sections <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more north–south orientation. Its circuitous route allows it to offer much scenery to drivers.|$|E
5|$|Robson's {{professional}} playing {{career as}} an inside-forward spanned nearly 20 years, during which he played for three clubs: Fulham, West Bromwich Albion, and, briefly, Vancouver Royals. He also made 20 appearances for England, scoring four goals. After his playing career, he found success as both a club and international manager, winning league championships in both the Netherlands and Portugal, earning trophies in England and Spain, and taking England to the semi-final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which remains the national team's best <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> World Cup since 1966. His last management role was as a mentor to {{the manager of the}} Republic of Ireland national team.|$|E

5|$|When Alben Barkley {{resigned}} his Senate seat {{to assume}} the office of vice president in 1948, Clements had appointed Garrett L. Withers to fill the vacancy. Barkley's term was to expire in 1950, and {{near the end of}} the term, Withers resigned, allowing Clements to <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special election to fill both the remainder of Withers' term and a full six-year term simultaneously. He won the election over Republican Charles I. Dawson by a vote of 300,276 to 256,876. On November 27, 1950, he resigned as governor {{to assume the}} seat.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E

5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E
