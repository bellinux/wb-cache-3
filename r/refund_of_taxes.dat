Certain countries thus try to enhance their tax attractiveness by offering special regimes for holding companies. Special rules for holdings include the exemption from local corporate income tax (e.g. Switzerland), exemption from current taxation (e.g. Luxembourg until 2010), the exemption from tax on all disposals of shares in subsidiaries (e.g. Singapore) or a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> paid to non-resident shareholders if profits are distributed (e.g. Malta).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is {{to respond to the}} Executive Committee {{direction}} to the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer and the City Solicitor for a report on Personal Vehicle Tax (PVT) refunds, and to report on the Executive Committee’s referral to the Mayor’s Office of a letter from the Chair of the Licensing and Standards Committee for necessary action to address the inequity between Ambassador and Fleet Taxis. The tax was designed in accordance with the City’s legislative authority at the time, and provides refunds where a person has paid an amount of tax that is not payable under the by-law, i. e. only where the tax is collected in error, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence and such determination by the City’s Chief Financial Officer. It does not provide for refunds due to changing circumstances such as plate cancellation or relocation outside Toronto. This contrasts with the Provincial registration fee system, and has resulted in criticism. Staff have examined scenarios with regard to providing refunds more in line with the Provincial registration system. Taking into account fairness, feasibility, and cost, it is recommended that PVT be refunded when ownership and address changes occur prior to the onset of a whole year(s) validation renewal period. More comprehensive (monthly) refund administration would take years to implement and is not recommended. In addition, staff have examined the feasibility of refunding PVT paid by individually owned Ambassador Class and Standard Class taxicabs. It is recommended that both classes be subject to a full <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> paid, starting September 1, 2010...|$|E

40|$|Midwestern producers, {{especially}} livestock producers, {{may find}} that their projected farm expenses exceed anticipated farm income for the current tax year. These farm losses are likely to cause cash flow difficulties. However, for some producers, farm losses may generate cash inflows in the form <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>refunds.</b> Tax law allows choices with respect to farm losses. Losses in one tax year may be carried back two years or five years to obtain <b>refunds</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> previously paid, or losses may be carried forward to offset tax liabilities in future years. Many farmers had high incomes in 2007 and 2008, and carrying back a 2009 loss is likely to generate an income tax refund. If carrying a 2009 loss back two or five years {{has little or no}} tax benefit, a producer can elect to carry the loss forward. Therefore, producers with farm losses should analyze their carryback and carryforward alternatives and not just file their current year’s tax return. The farm loss reported on Schedule F (Form 1040) is generally not the same as a net operating loss (NOL) for income tax purposes. The NOL concept is simple, but computation of the NOL deduction and NOL carryback can be quite complex. This complexity arises because various tax benefits must be removed by modifying the deductions of the loss year and modifying the income in the carryback year or years. Similar modifications are made if the loss is carried forward. Because of these modifications, the <b>tax</b> benefits <b>of</b> the loss may be reduced significantly. Before briefly discussing these modifications, this publication addresses some possible los...|$|R
