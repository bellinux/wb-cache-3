25|$|On July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Gregg v. Georgia and upheld 7-2 a Georgia {{procedure}} {{in which the}} trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death <b>penalty</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>imposed.</b> At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty - either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana, the court struck down 5-4 statutes providing a mandatory death sentence.|$|R

The case arose from an incident in which the applicants, all South African citizens, had been arrested in Zimbabwe on charges that they had plotted to stage a coup in Equatorial Guinea. The applicants sought relief {{in the form of}} an order directing the South African government to seek assurances from the governments of Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea that the death <b>penalty</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>imposed</b> on the applicants. The basis of the application was a contention that the applicants’ constitutional rights to a fair trial, to dignity, life and freedom and security of the person were being infringed in Zimbabwe, and were likely to be infringed if they were extradited to Equatorial Guinea. The state’s duty to protect the rights of the applicants (stemming from section 7(2)) required them to be provided with diplomatic protection.|$|R

(2) [...] "Those who, at the {{instigation}} of thedevil, violently lay {{hands on}} ecclesiastics or religious of either sex, exception being made, as regards reservation, {{in behalf of}} cases and of persons that the law or privileges allow the bishop or others to absolve." [...] This is the celebrated privilege or immunity [...] "of the canon" [...] (privilegium canonis), so called from the canon [...] "Si quis, suadente diabolo" [...] (Decretum of Gratian, C. xvii, q. iv, c. xxix), enacted by the Council of Lateran in 1139 and intended to protect {{the honor of the}} clergy from material violence and injury. The persons protected are all who belong to the clergy in the broad sense of the word, i.e. both minor and major clerics, tonsured persons, monks, nuns, novices, and even tertiaries living in community. This privilege is to be interpreted broadly. The acts punished are all injurious corporal violence, such as blows and wounds, a fortiori mutilation; also pursuit, imprisonment, and arrest, likewise insulting acts, such as a slap in the face, etc. The <b>penalty</b> is <b>not</b> <b>imposed</b> for acts that are not grievous, for verbal injuries, for excusable violence, e.g. in the case of legitimate defense, or finally when one is unaware that he is dealing with a cleric. Nowadays only the real perpetrators of these deeds are excommunicated, not accomplices nor those who are morally responsible. Once the fact is publicly known the culprits are vitandi even without being denounced by name. Absolution from this excommunication is regularly reserved to the pope, but the text of the article maintains the faculties possessed by bishops and others, such as we have heretofore indicated.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates {{an average}} bid auction, {{in which the}} bid closest to the average wins the auction. In the first study, I investigate the equilibrium bidding strategy in the average bid auction, when cost constitutes a private value without the winner?s curse. More specifically, {{in addition to the}} pooling equilibrium established by the existing literature, I characterize a partially pooling equilibrium with three bidders, in which the bid function is constant for small cost realizations and strictly increasing in cost for high cost realizations. Moreover, complete necessary conditions for the existence of partially pooling equilibrium are provided in the case of more than three bidders. Lastly, unlike the first price auction, the average bid auction loses efficiency, and the buyer is likely to pay the more compared to first price auction. The second study investigates the characterization of the equilibrium bid function with three bidders in the average bid auction, considering the possibility of cost overrun and penalty. When the penalty is zero, every bidder bids an identical amount. If the penalty is large, either some bidders bid identically and the rest of bidders follow a strictly increasing bidding strategy, or all bidders place an identical bid. Finally, I compare the average bid auction with the first price reverse auction from the buyer?s point of view. If the <b>penalty</b> is <b>not</b> <b>imposed</b> on insolvent bidders, the buyer who chooses the average bid auction could be better off. On the other hand, if the penalty is large enough to prevent all bidders from defaulting, the average bid auction is always worse. This result partly explains why the average bid auction has been widespread in Italy, and the first price reverse auction has been dominantly used for the procurement in the U. S...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2010, Alabama Attorney-General Troy King {{announced}} he had information {{not yet made}} public and wanted to try Watson for capital murder, asserting jurisdiction based {{on the theory that}} the alleged crime was planned in Alabama. King petitioned Australia for the evidence held by police but was refused access until he gave an undertaking that the death <b>penalty</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>imposed,</b> as required under Australian law. This condition has been strongly criticised by King and Don Valeska, chief of the attorney-general's violent crime division, who stated: [...] "If an Australian woman was killed here, we would immediately send the evidence there. We would not presume to tell the Australian authorities how to run their criminal justice system". In response to the announcement, Watson's parents came to the defence of their son, breaking their public silence on the case. Friends and family of Watson questioned whether he had any motive for the murder, noting that his affection for Tina had seemed genuine, there was no life insurance policy naming him as beneficiary, and he appeared to be emotionally devastated for an extended time following Tina's death.|$|R
5000|$|The {{local court}} {{forwarded}} {{the records of}} its inquiry to the Judicial Faculty at Duisburg, which recommended Linck be publicly hung and her body burned. They recommended torture to extract further testimony from Mühlhahn. The Halberstadt officials who were submitting all this information for review by King Frederick William wrote at length about its difficulty in determining the appropriate punishment because the Bible was silent on sexual activity between women and the acts in question {{did not meet the}} formal definition of sodomy, since they were [...] "committed with a lifeless leather device". They also considered which method of execution was called for: beheading, hanging, or fire. They recommended beheading by the sword with the body to be burned afterwards. Some members of the court who thought the death <b>penalty</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>imposed</b> if Linck's behavior did not precisely match Biblical definitions of sodomy recommended flogging for her other offenses. The report recognized that Mühlhahn had committed a lesser offense and described her as [...] "this simple-minded person who let herself be seduced into depravity". For her the Halberstadt court recommended three years imprisonment followed by banishment, rather than the torture the Duisburg court had recommended. The king confirmed the sentences of death by beheading for Linck and imprisonment for Mühlhahn.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the tools}} at the {{disposal}} of those engaged in international crime control is extradition, the transfer of an individual from one state to another state that aims to submit the accused to trial. Extradition is typically a formal process, involving authorities, and based on an agreement. Most extradition treaties are still bilateral in nature, although in Europe the multilateral European Convention on Extradition, concluded in 1957, has also had an important role. Even though they are often bilateral in form, many extradition treaties contain similar provisions. Thus, most are based on the so-called principle of double criminality; individuals will only be extradited for offences that are prohibited in both states. Often, such treaties also contain the principle of specialty; the request for extradition and the subsequent prosecution need to address the same allegations. Many extradition treaties provide for two important, related exceptions: individual should not be extradited for political activities or military offences. This makes it important to figure out what exactly is meant by political offence, and needless to say, opinions here differ. The standard idea is to exclude action inspired by political considerations, but obviously this creates problems, as some of the worst crimes are inspired precisely by such motives. A recent innovation, at least in the practice of European states, is also to provide for an exception in cases where the death penalty may ensue. Many European states have abolished the death penalty; consequently, they are not keen to extradite to states where the death penalty is a possible outcome of the trial, and reserve the right to refuse extradition unless assured by the requesting state that the death <b>penalty</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>imposed...</b>|$|R
