The paper deals with a key area of a Central-Eastern-European country (Hungary) from the European perspective, i. e. tourism. Tourism provides a remarkable ratio of GDP, thus its importance is inevitable. Tourism destination management (TDM in further text) organisations are local building stones of this important branch. These organisations received remarkable development funds in the previous budget period. The aim was to turn tourism into a competitive and innovative branch. Quadruple helix model - approach to innovation systems provides the opportunity to include the fourth helix - the media-based civic society - into the innovation performance, thus its performance influences the efficacy of the given innovation system. The paper assumes that these TDM organisations, as media-based civil organisations, appear as enterprises that are responsible for touristic innovation performance. The research objective is to prove, or deny that these institutions are important workshops of innovation. A survey research was conducted. In the meantime, feedback was collected about the structure, comprehensiveness and the logical structure of the questionnaire. Cooperation characteristics, the correlations between the innovation performances, the factors generating innovation and the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> are presented.

We analyse regional innovation strategies in these countries. The regional development strategies are relatively new phenomenon in V 4 countries. Most of the re- gions created their strategies less than five years ago and many of them have been still in imple- mentation phase, so we concentrate more on the creation of innovation strategies rather than on their implementation. The paper has two main parts - theoretical background containing the examples and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> support at the regional level as well as key problems <b>for</b> governance of <b>innovation</b> support, mainly the problem of complexity of innovation support, which goes behind officially esta- blished borders. The second part compares activities and measures of 29 regional innovation strategies in these regions and identifies some key differences among them. We found out more similarities among the regions from the same country rather than similarities among the regions with similar level of development (e. g. in metropolitan regions). We deal with some key issues <b>for</b> regional <b>innovation</b> strategies – appropriate level and the role of regional self-governments for creation of strategy, se- ctoral dimension of RIS or “building cathedral in the desert” problem. We also identify dominance of hard infrastructure measures in the strategies. We also compare specific innovation strategies with general regional development strategies in order to identify key differences in governing crea- tion of these strategies.

40|$|Novel and {{marketable}} service {{ideas are}} useful to most service enterprises. However, the literature has identified several <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovations</b> in services as lagging behind those in manufacturing. Some service enterprises believe that service ideas and innovations are readily imitated by competitors. Others view {{the impact of}} service innovations on profitability difficult to assess because specific innovative service elements are typically bundled with many other service elements when delivered to or used by customers. Some service enterprises do not have in-house groups specifically dedicated to innovative pursuits, {{making it difficult for}} them to systematically produce new service ideas. Furthermore, because services are usually produced and consumed concurrently, any failure tends to expose the service enterprise immediately, unlike the manufacturing companies which can minimize such risks of exposure by conducting pilot testing away from the marketplace. As a result, many service enterprises are said to shy away from aggressively pursuing new service development projects. It does not have to be this way. This paper describes the combinatorial, heuristic, and normatively guided method, which when correctly applied to a service enterprise enhances the generation of new service ideas in a systematic, speedy, and cost-effective manner, and without requiring the creation of a dedicated and rigid organizational structure. Virtual teams of the "stealth" type are set up to address innovation needs related to marketability and cost competitiveness. These teams may include frontline customer-facing employees as well as customers, suppliers, and other external experts, who can work together despite geographical and time-zone constraints. The application of this method toward developing a specific new service idea is discussed in greater detail. The integration of a "stealth" team can also be readily applied to the front end of a typical stage-gate service development process, whereby parallel teams are engaged to address critical issues and steps needed to successfully market a service idea before initiating costly development, thereby raising the service enterprises' overall probability of developing commercially successful new services over time.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a project carried out on behalf of the German Ministry for Research and Technology entitled 'Technology Assessment of Internet Payment Systems for Digital Products and Services'. It was carried out by the Institute of Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS) of the Research Centre Karlsruhe. It started from the widespread assumption that the lack of appropriate electronic payment systems hampered the development of electronic commerce. The study mainly tried to assess non-technical questions such as the need for new payment systems, the interests of different actors involved, and the prospects of the new technology to be successfully implemented on a large scale. To achieve this, more than 60 experts from relevant branches were interviewed between May 1997 and December the same year. The report has two main subjects. The first focus is on digital products, services and rights. This is the segment of e-commerce going beyond the familiar mail order, using the internet merely as a new means to order. The second focus is on innovations of payment systems. We use the term payment systems, because we do not only refer to 'electronic money' as other recent studies, but try to cover the whole range of payment alternatives. The report covers the following topics in some more detail: the place of traditional mail order within the field of electronic commerce; digital products, services and rights and the need for new payment solutions in this emerging sector; the importance of e-commerce for local markets; state of innovative payment systems with regard to Germany; approaches for small payments and micropayments; aspects of costs, fees and economic viability of payment systems; <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> (and non-innovation) {{from the point of view}} of banks; the development of internet payment systems from a genetic perspective, the relationship between 'electronic money' and political regulation of money; definitions of 'electronic money', non-technical aspects of security and anonymity; risks of consumers, and remarks on open research questions.

Growing attention is being focused upon the small firm sector as a seedbed <b>for</b> <b>Innovation</b> and government policy has been changing to encourage the entrepreneurial new technology based firm (NTBF). The novel perspective of this research results from working in such a firm. It provides a longitudinal study of the management of innovation {{in conjunction with the}} corporate strategy of the firm. Given that the researcher was a participant and observer in the firm studied, the research is akin to action research in methodology but is better described as grounded theory. Theoretical concepts are drawn from the prescriptive literature describing corporate strategy, and from the empirical literature which has evaluated new product success and failure. Models of the Innovation process are discussed and appropriate strategies and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> product <b>innovation</b> failure in NTBFs are described. The strategy, structure and new product development progress of the company are examined, using both the researcher's observations and company documents. This provides information on the methods and practices adopted <b>for</b> product <b>innovation</b> in a NTBF. The thesis analyses the performance of the firm In terms of product innovation. The models and strategies derived from the literature are then tested {{in the light of the}} experience of the company. Conclusions are drawn regarding strategies <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> in NTBFs and about the innovation process in general. The importance of a NTBF adopting a synergistic strategy is shown.

Poor communication, a low chance to be accepted by the external party, and economic market factors appear to be important reasons why ethnic entrepreneurs do not join franchise organizations. The low chance of acceptance is primarily reflected in the entrepreneurs’ perception of their unfavorable market conditions, but in addition there are other <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> low participation which can be rectified. From our research, general lessons can be derived which are applicable also to other situations in which ethnic entrepreneurs may also be less inclined to join institutional cooperative systems.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is notorious for its (lack of) innovativeness. Many papers, reports and articles {{have been written}} on this subject already {{for more than three}} decades. The explanations presented can be summarized by such terms as fragmentation, segmentation and segregation when referring to the industries’ structure and by qualifications such as opportunistic, hostile, antagonistic and conflictive when referring to its culture.

It is particularly this kind of competition which is identified as a source to stimulate innovation. In construction, production capabilities are tested on the market and not product capabilities. As a result, design decisions are not tested on the market. It is this flaw which is examined in this paper, and possible improvements are suggested.
