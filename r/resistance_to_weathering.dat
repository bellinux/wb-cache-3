2500|$|The Cottonwood Limestone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{persistent}} and easily recognizable horizons in Kansas. This limestone is usually light gray or buff in color, massively bedded, and has an average thickness of about six feet. The upper part of the member in particular is recognizable for being almost entirely made up of the small wheat-grain shaped foraminifera Fusulinida, with few other animal remains. The line of outcrop of the Cottonwood is generally marked by a line of massive rectangular blocks of light gray or bleached, bone-colored limestone, often supporting a line of shrubs. [...] Because of its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> it often forms a prominent escarpment. The Cottonwood Limestone is noteworthy for the persistence of this lithologic character across its range.|$|E
50|$|Duct tape is {{commonly}} used in situations that require a strong, flexible, and very sticky tape. Some have a long-lasting adhesive and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|E
50|$|ULE {{has a high}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> {{because of}} its hardness, and is also {{unaffected}} by nearly all chemical agents. ULE also shows no changes when quickly cooled from 350 °C.|$|E
50|$|Screws {{and bolts}} are usually made of steel. Where great <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> or {{corrosion}} is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, {{materials such as}} stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{activity}} of several ionic liquids (alkylimidazolium salts) {{that are used to}} improve the dispersion of coagent particles in peroxide-cross-linked hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene elastomer (HNBR). Hydrotalcite grafted with monoallyl maleate was applied as a coagent for the HNBR vulcanization. In this paper, we discuss the effect of the ionic liquids (alkylimidazolium salts) with respect to their anion (bromide, chloride, tetrafluoroborate, and hexafluorophosphate) and the length of alkyl chain in the cation (allyl-, ethyl-, butyl-, hexyl-, and octyl-) on the vulcanization kinetics of rubber compounds. The influence of ionic liquids on the cross-link density, the mechanical properties of the vulcanizates, and their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> ageing were also studied. Alkylimidazolium salts seem to improve the dispersion of the coagent particles and to be active in the cross-linking of HNBR with peroxide. The type of ionic liquid considerably influences the activity of the coagent particles toward the HNBR. The application of ionic liquids increases the cross-link density of the vulcanizates and improves their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> aging...|$|R
50|$|A few works {{produced}} by Coade, mainly {{dating from the}} later period, have shown poor <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> due to a bad firing in the kiln where the material was not brought up to a sufficient temperature.|$|E
50|$|In Finland, olivine is {{marketed as}} an ideal rock for sauna stoves because of its {{comparatively}} high density and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> under repeated heating and cooling.

50|$|The façades {{were covered}} with natural colored stones that shaped the mural titled Historical Representation of the Culture. Said mural is unique because it's {{one of the largest}} int the world, taking into account its {{building}} technique based on panels that, as a whole, make up a great natural stone polychromatic mosaic. This effect was based on the combination of 12 basic colors, set in an impressionist style, that is, as colored spots that when seen from a distance become specific figures. The colors were chosen from 150 samples of original stones. The criteria for the selection was the stones <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> factors such as rain, sunlight, temperature changes, etc.|$|R
50|$|Desert varnish often {{obscures the}} {{identity}} of the underlying rock, and different rocks have varying abilities to accept and retain varnish. Limestones, for example, typically do not have varnish because they are too water-soluble and therefore do not provide a stable surface for varnish to form. Shiny, dense and black varnishes form on basalt, fine quartzites and metamorphosed shales due to these rocks' relatively high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|E
50|$|PVF has low {{permeability}} for vapors, burns very slowly, and has excellent <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and staining. It is also resistant to most chemicals, except ketones and esters. It is {{available as a}} film {{in a variety of}} colors and formulations for various end uses, and as a resin for specialty coatings. It has insufficient thermal stability for injection moulding and thus it is usually available commercially as a film product.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is in the}} New England granite belt, {{where about}} 220 million years ago an episode of granite {{magmatism}} resulted in the intrusion of the Stanthorpe Adamellite into the surrounding metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Subsequent uplift and erosion of the New England Fold Belt has seen {{the majority of the}} surrounding sediments and metamorphic rocks eroded away, with the Stanthorpe Adamellite remaining due to its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} elucidate the physiological factor determining the association of seed size and seed coat quality with varietal differences in seed vigour, and to pursue an alternative on the mechanism of varietal differences in seed <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> field <b>weathering.</b> Results of this study revealed that seed polymer change (seed volume change minus seed weight change during moisture imbibition) was the physiological factor determining the association of seed size and seed coat quality with varietal differences in seed vigour. The mechanism of varietal differences in seed <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> field <b>weathering,</b> therefore, seemes <b>to</b> be mainly controlled by seed coat quality (seed coat-seed weight ratio and seed coat colour) through controlling the magnitude of seed polymer change during moisture absorption at postphysiological maturity, which in turn determine the degree of membrane damage in the seed...|$|R
50|$|Laminate {{panel is}} a type of {{manufactured}} timber made from thin sheets of substrates or wood veneer. It is similar to the more widely used plywood, except that it has a plastic, protective layer on one or both sides. Laminate panels are used instead of plywood because of their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> impact, <b>weather,</b> moisture, shattering in cold (ductility), and chemicals.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{color of}} Tyrian purple {{seems to have}} varied from a reddish to a bluish purple. According to the Roman writer Vitruvius, (1st century BC), the murex coming from {{northern}} waters, probably murex brandaris, produced a more bluish color {{than those of the}} south, probably murex trunculus. The most valued shades were said to be those closer to the color of dried blood, as seen in the mosaics of the robes of the Emperor Justinian in Ravenna. The chemical composition of the dye from the murex is close to that of the dye from indigo, and indigo was sometimes used to make a counterfeit Tyrian purple, a crime which was severely punished. What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color, but its luster, richness, its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and light, and its high price.|$|R
50|$|The {{geological}} formation of Dongyin {{is closely related}} to Mainland China, where the granite bedrock was formed by Yanshan Movement (燕山運動) dated to 100 - 200 million years ago. Thanks to its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> granite bedrock is seen above ground widespread in Dongyin. Although massive granite is tough, lacking internal structures, granite of poor primary permeability is easily eroded by sea water, rain, and gales, resulting in various and magnificent coastal sights.|$|E
50|$|Chalk {{has greater}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and {{slumping}} than the clays {{with which it}} is usually associated, thus forming tall steep cliffs where chalk ridges meet the sea. Chalk hills, known as chalk downland, usually form where bands of chalk reach the surface at an angle, so forming a scarp slope. Because chalk is well jointed it can hold a large volume of ground water, providing a natural reservoir that releases water slowly through dry seasons.|$|E
50|$|Corundum {{occurs as}} a mineral in mica schist, gneiss, and some marbles in {{metamorphic}} terranes. It also occurs in low silica igneous syenite and nepheline syenite intrusives. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to ultramafic intrusives, associated with lamprophyre dikes and as large crystals in pegmatites. It commonly occurs as a detrital mineral in stream and beach sands {{because of its}} hardness and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b> The largest documented single crystal of corundum measured about 65 * 40 * 40 cm, and weighed 152 kg. The record has since been surpassed by certain synthetic boules.|$|E
5000|$|Drummer {{and founder}} Remo D. Belli experimented with PET {{film as a}} {{possible}} material {{for the production of}} drumheads after World War II due to its consistency in tonal qualities and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> changes. Throughout the 1960s, it was a fight to gain market acceptance, as purist jazzmen preferred the sound of natural calfskin. However, these calfskin drumheads had to be frequently tuned with weather fluctuations. Remo Belli created convenience for professional drummers when he pioneered the use of Mylar, a synthetic polyester film for drumheads. Originally, the drumheads were white and opaque to help mimic the look of calfskin. Later innovations were clear drumheads, two-ply drumheads (for added durability and depth), and simulated natural drumheads with a product called [...] "FIBERSKYN", which is currently on its third version. Remo Belli died on April 25, 2016.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePoly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) {{is a very}} {{important}} fluoropolymer. It possesses high <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> or ageing and to chemical and thermal aggressions, as well as unique electroactive properties. The reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of VDFcan, so far, only be achieved via degenerative transfer using ITP (iodine transfer polymerization) or RAFT (reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer). However, due to chain defects, and transfer to solvents, the RAFT polymerization of VDF produces PVDF chains with different chain ends. This article presents the results obtained from advanced 1 H, 13 C, and 19 F NMR spectroscopy experiments using decoupling strategies, to ascertain unequivocally the microstructure of the PVDF chains synthesized using RAFT polymerization. This article provides a very detailed description of the different α- and ω-chain ends of PVDF 51 -XA and reveals an uncommon NMR heteronuclear coupling between the proton of the stereocenterof the CTA R-group and the fluorine atoms of the CF 2 moiety of the first added VDF unit...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} synthesis and structural characterisation of novel biodegradable polymeric controlled-release systems of pesticides with potentially higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> conditions {{in comparison to}} conventional forms of pesticides. Two methods for the preparation of pesticide-oligomer conjugates using the transesterification reaction were developed. The first method of obtaining conjugates, which consist of bioactive compounds with the carboxyl group and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) oligomers, is "one-pot" transesterification. In the second method, conjugates of bioactive compounds with hydroxyl group and polyhydroxyalkanoates oligomers were obtained in two-step method, through cyclic poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) oligomers. The obtained pesticide-PHA conjugates were comprehensively characterised using GPC, 1 H NMR and mass spectrometry techniques. The structural characterisation of the obtained products {{at the molecular level}} with the aid of mass spectrometry confirmed that both of the synthetic strategies employed {{led to the formation of}} conjugates in which selected pesticides were covalently bonded to PHA oligomers via a hydrolysable ester bond...|$|R
50|$|The ZTR {{index is}} a method of {{determining}} how weathered, both chemically and mechanically, a sediment (or a corresponding sedimentary rock) is. The letters in ZTR stand for 3 common minerals found in ultra-weathered sediments: zircon, tourmaline, and rutile. Other minerals {{that can be used}} along the ZTR index are garnet, magnetite, sphene, and other minerals from local provenance sources. The ZTR index is commonly high in beach or littoral zone depositional environments due to the long transport distances from the source and the high energy of the environment. These minerals are found in abundance due to their high specific gravity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, Potsdam Sandstone {{was highly}} {{regarded}} as a building material. There was extensive quarrying for Potsdam Sandstone in the Potsdam area, beginning in 1809. Properties of the rock that give it value as a building material include high compressive strength, attractive reddish coloring, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b> The rock also {{was said to be}} [...] "soft and easy to carve" [...] when freshly quarried but [...] "extremely hard" [...] and [...] "weather-resistant" [...] after exposure to the air, but modern geologists suggest that this is a misconception. Potsdam Sandstone resists spalling when exposed to fire, making it highly suitable for use as a refractory for lining iron furnaces.|$|E
50|$|Kinetic energy {{metamorphosis}} (KEM) is {{a recently}} discovered tribological process of gradual crystal re-orientation and foliation of component minerals in certain rocks. It {{is caused by}} very high, localized application of kinetic energy. The required energy may be provided by prolonged battery of fluvially propelled bed load of cobbles, by glacial abrasion, tectonic deformation, and even by human action. It can result {{in the formation of}} laminae on specific metamorphic rocks that, while being chemically similar to the protolith, differ significantly in appearance and in their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> or deformation. These tectonite layers are of whitish color and tend to survive granular or mass exfoliation much longer than the surrounding protolith.|$|E

50|$|The Blue Ridge Thrust Belt Province {{underlies}} {{parts of}} eight States from central Alabama to southern Pennsylvania. Along its western margin, the Blue Ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted {{margin of the}} Appalachian basin, so that a broad segment of Paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles, buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets. At the surface, the Blue Ridge consists of a mountainous to hilly region, {{the main component of}} which are the Blue Ridge Mountains that extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Surface rocks consist mainly of a core of moderate-to high-rank crystalline metamorphic or igneous rocks, which, because of their superior <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and erosion, commonly rise above the adjacent areas of low-grade metamorphic and sedimentary rock.

50|$|Wollastonite has {{industrial}} importance worldwide. It {{is used in}} many industries, {{mostly by}} tile factories which have incorporated it into the manufacturing of ceramic to improve many performance parameters, and {{this is due to}} its fluxing properties, freedom from volatile constituents, whiteness, and acicular particle shape. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent. In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, inert, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength. In some industries, it is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Samples were {{collected}} from a 11 - 4 m deep weathered profile of a metamorphic rock. The mineralogy was determined from XRD powder patterns, differential thermal and thermogravimetric analyses with CEC determinations and chemical analyses. Four stages in a weathering sequence from the profile base towards the surface are as follows: (i) a partially regular trioctahedral chlorite-chlorite mixed layer; (ii) a random chlorite-vermiculite mixed layer; (iii) a random chlorite-smectite mixed layer, and finally (iv) a smectite. Some chloritic layers are therefore more resistant <b>to</b> chemical <b>weathering</b> than other chloritic layers.
