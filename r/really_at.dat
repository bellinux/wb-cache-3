5|$|Ezra Pound is <b>really</b> <b>at</b> heart a very boyish {{fellow and}} an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E

It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E

500|$|Although {{it seems}} that she disapproves of Marge's {{marriage}} to Homer, stating that he is never to address her as [...] "Mom", she has shown that she does tolerate Homer {{a lot more than}} her elder daughters, evident in [...] "Moe Letter Blues" [...] when she explained to Homer that Patty and Selma were <b>really</b> <b>at</b> fault for ruining her birthday party and not him.

[...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are <b>really</b> <b>at</b> their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are." [...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|E
500|$|Different {{groups of}} people have responded to feminism, and {{both men and women}} have been among its {{supporters}} and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist. The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists [...] "are less often associated with day-to-day work/leisure activities of regular women." [...] However, as recent research has demonstrated, as people are exposed to self-identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism, their own self-identification with feminism increases. Roy Baumeister has criticized feminists who [...] "look only at the top of society and draw conclusions about society as a whole. Yes, there are mostly men at the top. But {{if you look at the}} bottom, <b>really</b> <b>at</b> the bottom, you'll find mostly men there, too." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.' What is <b>really</b> <b>at</b> issue here is responsibility– moral responsibility." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is <b>really</b> <b>at</b> stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
500|$|Making {{the most}} of the inside of the bend in the river, Cambridge pushed on to be a length clear by The Doves pub. [...] As both crews rowed into Chiswick Reach, they were struck by the {{headwind}} and by Chiswick Steps, the Light Blues had extended their lead by half a length, rating two strokes per minute more than Oxford. [...] By the time they passed below Barnes Bridge, Cambridge were seven seconds ahead. [...] They passed the finishing post with a lead of two and a quarter lengths in a time of 20 minutes 57 seconds, taking the overall record in the event to 4440 in their favour. [...] It was the Light Blues' tenth consecutive victory, a record streak {{in the history of the}} event. [...] It was the slowest winning time since the 1925 race and the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race. [...] Writing in The Observer, William Beach Thomas declared that [...] "a good crew was beaten by a good crew after one of the finest races in the long chronicles". [...] According to the former Oxford rower E.P.Evans, [...] "the features of the race were the superb stroking of the Oxford crew by Holdsworth and the extremely bad coxing of the Cambridge boat ... although Cambridge won, they were not <b>really</b> <b>at</b> their best." ...|$|E

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was <b>really</b> <b>at</b> a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E
500|$|Greg Bear was 343 Industries' {{first choice}} {{to write a}} trilogy of books based {{on the history of}} the Forerunners and another mysterious race known as the Precursors. Bear had been writing a book {{entitled}} Hull Zero Three when he was approached to be the trilogy's author. At the first meeting with Bear regarding the book, he was told that it should be a [...] "classic Greg Bear giant – in the vein of Eon, Anvil of the Stars and so on", but inspired by Halo and its extended universe. The book and author were announced on April 6, 2009. 343 Industries' General Manager, Bonnie Ross, stated that the back and forth with Bear made [...] "the whole experience better", and was preferable to assigning the author his task with no feedback. Halo franchise development director Frank O'Connor stated, [...] "The enigma of the Forerunners is <b>really</b> <b>at</b> the heart of the drama and mystery of the Halo universe ... in all the games and the books so far we've only scratched the surface of the terrible events that engulfed the Forerunners and the Galaxy they protected 100,000 years ago". Although nothing was forced upon Bear in terms of story templates, he had numerous and comprehensive discussions about the history of the Halo universe and the major events of the Forerunner history had already been established through the information hidden in Halo 3. O'Connor said that the book is meant to have a [...] "hard sci-fi" [...] feel with a [...] "hint of space opera, in the mold of Banks, Reynolds and Bear himself." ...|$|E

Likewise, on the other end, {{corporations}} saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper. Using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets. This expands credit.

2500|$|A {{pervasive}} theme, {{according to}} Publishers Weekly, is the discomfort responders felt in professing unproven beliefs, which Publishers Weekly declared [...] "an interesting {{reflection of the}} state of science". The question inspired implicit or explicit reflection in a number of responders about the scientific method's reliance on observable, empirical and measurable evidence, with a good many of what The Observer points out as largely American responders defending against [...] "a return to an age of uncertainty in which creationism and intelligent design hold sway in the public mind". [...] "What's <b>really</b> <b>at</b> stake here", Wired said in its review, [...] "is the nature of 'proof' itself".|$|E
2500|$|It {{is known}} that `Abdu'l-Bahá also sat for portraits {{at the request of}} Gibran.

So the influence is <b>really</b> <b>at</b> the choice of Gibran - he could as well have chosen and mention any other source of inspiration for his book. It seems he chose `Abdu'l-Bahá. As `Abdu'l-Bahá is one of the [...] of the Bahá'í Faith and these are works of fiction, it is certainly the case that at least two of Gibran's, and his most famous, are properly mentioned here.|$|E

The inspection was performed on April 24, 2013, by the Federal Lands Bridge Office, {{an arm of the}} FHWA. In its post-inspection report, the FHWA declared the bridge to be [...] "in poor condition overall due to continuing problems related to corrosion of the steel in the bascule span, deterioration of the concrete in the arch spans, and deterioration of the sidewalks and wearing surface." [...] Among the problems noted in the report: moderate amounts of rusting were found on all the bridge's load-bearing beams, there were moderate to widespread cracks in the reinforced concrete arch spans, metal flakes (or [...] "spalls") were coming off the steel beams on the road deck's underside, and the drainage system was clogged in many places by debris or rust.|$|E
2500|$|Peter {{gathered}} anthropometric data on 3,284 persons, analysed 198 blood samples, bought clothes, jewellery, books (such as the Tengyur and Kangyur), {{and various}} other objects now found at the National Museum of Denmark and the Royal Library. He assembled a list of Tibetan noble families and, along with his wife, established biographical notes {{about a number of}} refugees (most notably about women who practised polyandry, [...] "something <b>really</b> <b>at</b> variance with our way of conducting family affairs"), and described Tibetan Muslims. Having registered their songs, sagas, everyday conversations, oracle prophecies and religious ceremonies, Peter took more than 3,000 photographs of Tibetans. When he asked them if they had body hair (an important piece of information in anthropology), the relatively hairless Tibetans roared with laughter. They were excited when he showed them his own chest hair, and exclaimed that he must be a monkey. One man did not understand why the Prince bothered to wear a shirt, given that he already had hair.|$|E
