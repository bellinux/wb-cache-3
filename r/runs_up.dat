5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> {{and down the}} peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due {{to the length of}} the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E
5|$|From 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso Wan Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> the hill and hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E

25|$|When the tsunami's {{wave peak}} reaches the shore, the {{resulting}} temporary rise in sea level is termed <b>run</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Run</b> <b>up</b> {{is measured in}} metres above a reference sea level. A large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving {{over a period of}} hours, with significant time between the wave crests. The first wave to reach the shore may not have the highest <b>run</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a {{considerably}} more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain. The Liberty Ridge Route <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

30|$|The {{thickness}} of the deposits seems {{to be related to}} the tsunami <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height in comparable transects from Phang Nga coast (Fig. 7, Table 1). The thickest deposits are in transects with the highest <b>run</b> <b>up.</b> The averaged tsunami deposit layer thickness for a coast with a tsunami <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height less than 6 m is 8.5 cm (29 measurements), and for the sites with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> greater than 6.0 m, 11.4 cm (34 measurements). The trends of tsunami deposits thickness also differ with regard to the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1). In the case of the smaller <b>run</b> <b>up</b> transects, the maximum thickness is usually closer to the shoreline, and then the deposits generally become thinner landward (transects 3 and 4 in Fig. 3, and transect 10 in Fig. 4). In some of the areas with the highest <b>run</b> <b>ups,</b> the deposit thickness increase inland until it reached approximately 1 / 3 of the inundation distance, where the maximum is observed, and then the deposits thin landward (transects 1, 5 and 6 in Fig. 3). The fourth transect in this group (transect 7, Fig. 4) revealed three maxima, located at approximately 100, 450 and 600 m landward, separated by areas covered by thinner deposits. The thickest deposits are found in a depression, and their deposition was probably enhanced by the local topography.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} {{in the end}} zone for a touchback, and the Volunteers started at their 20-yard line. Tennessee resumed running out the clock via short <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> {{the middle of the field}} that kept the game clock ticking down. After not gaining a first down, Tennessee punted to the Hokies with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an incomplete pass that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E

5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> to her and asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E

40|$|The wave <b>run</b> <b>up</b> under semi-submersible {{platform}} deck and the dynamic response are important design factors, {{and determine the}} expected minimum air gap in extreme design conditions. For a semi-submersible, the prediction of probabilities wave <b>run</b> <b>up</b> in harsh environments is a challenging task. This paper addresses the problem of expressing the probability density and cumulative distribution functions that utilize Weibull distribution to model estimates the waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> for a large volume semi-submersible squared-section columns platform in two sea states. The two parameters Weibull distribution, namely shape parameter and scale parameter were considered. The analysis interpreted the measured data of 9 realizations with different seeds in the moored model experiments. The length of total measured data analyzed included approximately 9 times 250 waves for each sea state. The wave <b>run</b> <b>up</b> was found by model estimates using a Rayleigh distribution, and some waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> were identical apart from one another for different seeds. Finally, by this model with a sequence return for two sea states the associated motions distribution for the large volume {{semi-submersible platform}} were numerically predicted...|$|R
30|$|A massive {{appearance}} is observed in approximately 45 % of the investigated sites (Figs. 3 and 4). These deposits lack clear {{change in their}} grain size or macroscopically visible laminations. The massive structure is observed in deposits of various thickness, grain size (both in sand and muds) and distance from the shoreline. The massive layers are more common in areas with smaller <b>run</b> <b>up</b> (more than 50 %) than in the regions with a higher <b>run</b> <b>up</b> (approximately 40 %). A normal grading (fining upward) {{is the most common}} appearance of the IOT layers. Along the Phang Nga coast it is found in almost 70 % of the sites with a low <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height and in almost all of the sites with a higher <b>run</b> <b>up</b> (Table 1). A reverse grading is found only in 2 trenches located less than 200 m from the shoreline, forming the lowermost part of the tsunami deposits. Frequently, tsunami deposits are laminated. In the areas with higher <b>run</b> <b>up</b> more than 25 % of the sites reveal a plane lamination. In the sites with lower <b>run</b> <b>up</b> and in the sites located more than 450 m from the coastline the plane lamination is less common. Cross lamination is less frequent and is found in a few sites close to the shoreline. The scour and fill structures recording two distinct depositional events are found in 5 trenches located within 200 m of the coastline in areas with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> > 6 m.|$|R

However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show.

Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he <b>runs</b> <b>up</b> a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
