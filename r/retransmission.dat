5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated <b>retransmission</b> consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during <b>retransmission</b> consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the FCC {{modified}} its media ownership {{rules to}} count LMAs formed after November 5, 1996 that cover more than 15% {{of the broadcast}} day toward the ownership limits for the brokering station's owner. Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became increasingly common during the 2000s; these outsourcing agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the Nexstar Broadcasting Group began expanding their portfolios by acquiring additional stations {{in an effort to}} drive scale as well as to gain leverage in <b>retransmission</b> consent negotiations with cable and satellite television providers.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated <b>retransmission</b> consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated <b>retransmission</b> consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

30|$|Note that (13) {{describes}} {{energy efficiency}} averaged over all possible <b>retransmissions.</b> In low error rate conditions, probability of {{small number of}} <b>retransmissions</b> is high. Similarly probability that a frame is received correctly is also high. Moreover, because we use larger frame size for small number of <b>retransmissions,</b> the ratio of data bytes to actually transmitted bytes is also high. However, in case of high error rate channels, such as the 11 [*]Mbps 802.11 networks, probability of large number of <b>retransmissions</b> is high. In this setting, we expect less energy efficiency from PLO, a fact that is substantiated later in this section using theoretical analysis {{and in the next}} section using empirical analysis.|$|R
40|$|A cross-layer {{design is}} {{developed}} which combines the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) at the physical layer and truncated Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) {{at the data}} link layer to maximize the spectral efficiency under prescribed error performance constraints. Depending on the error correcting capability of the truncated ARQ, which depends on the maximum allowable number of <b>retransmissions,</b> we design AMC transmission modes, with each mode consisting of a specific modulation and FEC code pair as in IEEE 802. 16 standard, that guarantee the required performance. Numerical results reveal that <b>retransmissions</b> at the data link layer relieve stringent error control requirements at the physical layer and thereby enable considerable spectral efficiency gain. This gain {{is provided by the}} maximum number of <b>retransmissions</b> per packet which equals the diversity order. The improvement on spectral efficiency decreases when the number of <b>retransmissions</b> increases, suggest that a small number of <b>retransmissions</b> offers a desirable delay-throughput tradeoff, in practice.

25|$|On September 15, 2008, LIN and Time Warner Cable {{entered into}} an impasse during {{negotiations}} to renew <b>retransmission</b> consent deals {{for some of}} the group's television stations. Bright House Networks, one of two major cable providers serving Indianapolis, negotiates <b>retransmission</b> consent contracts through Time Warner Cable. LIN TV requested compensation for carriage of its stations {{in a manner similar to}} the deals that cable networks have with pay television providers, as other broadcast station owners began to seek compensation from cable and satellite providers for their programming. The carriage agreement with Bright House expired on October 2. By 12:35a.m. on October 3, LIN's television stations were replaced on Time Warner Cable systems in markets where the group owns stations and where either provider operates systems with programming from other cable channels. LIN's stations (with the exception of WIIH-CA) were restored 23 days later on October 26 through a new carriage agreement reached between Time Warner Cable and LIN TV.|$|E

Low-powered television stations are exempt from the must-carry and <b>retransmission</b> consent regulations that full-powered stations enjoy, meaning that its carriage on other area cable systems besides Suddenlink, and satellite providers is not guaranteed.|$|E

On the other hand, O-Z <b>retransmissions</b> will only consider error recovery outside the error zone, reducing the average energy consumption when packets enter the error zone. Unreliable transmissions and semi-reliable packet-level redundancy are also sensitive to higher PER.|$|R
25|$|On August 11, 2014, Tribune Broadcasting {{announced}} that CW affiliate WTTV {{would become the}} market's CBS affiliate on January 1, 2015, {{as part of an}} agreement that also renewed the CBS affiliations on Tribune-owned stations in five other markets. The deal, which resulted in the end of WISH-TV's 58-year relationship with CBS, was reportedly struck as a result of WISH station management balking at the network's demands for sharing of <b>retransmission</b> consent revenue from its affiliates. This marked the second time in Indianapolis television history that WTTV took an affiliation from WISH, the first being ABC in 1956.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2011, {{the first}} day of the 2011 regular season, ESPN {{extended}} its contract for Monday Night Football for eight additional seasons, giving it rights to the broadcasts until 2021. The new deal, valued between $14.2 billion and $15.2 billion, also gives ESPN rights to expanded highlights, international and streaming rights, and possibly a wild-card playoff game. Cable television providers condemned the new contract, noting that ESPN has the highest <b>retransmission</b> consent fees of any national cable television channel, nearly seven times higher than the nearest competitor (TNT), and raises fees on an annual basis.|$|E
