5|$|Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham {{the river}} leaves behind the {{built-up}} area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton <b>Reed</b> <b>Bed,</b> another SSSI which consists of dense <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the {{vegetation}} {{on the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become very thick and has resulted in it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> in the small lagoon area.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>beds</b> {{are natural}} {{habitats}} found in floodplains, waterlogged depressions, and estuaries. <b>Reed</b> <b>beds</b> {{are part of}} a succession from young reeds colonising open water or wet ground through a gradation of increasingly dry ground. As <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> age, they build up a considerable litter layer that eventually rises above the water level and that ultimately provides opportunities for scrub or woodland invasion. Artificial <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> are used to remove pollutants from grey water.|$|R
50|$|Swallows {{gather in}} {{communal}} roosts after breeding, sometimes thousands strong. <b>Reed</b> <b>beds</b> are regularly favoured, with the birds swirling en masse before swooping {{low over the}} <b>reeds.</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>beds</b> are {{an important source of}} food prior to and whilst on migration; although the barn swallow is a diurnal migrant that can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water, the <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> enable fat deposits to be established or replenished.|$|R
50|$|Although common reeds are {{characteristic}} of <b>reed</b> <b>beds,</b> not all vegetation dominated by this species is characteristic of <b>reed</b> <b>beds.</b> It also commonly occurs in unmanaged, damp grassland and as an understorey in certain types of damp woodland.|$|R
5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster. The {{construction of a new}} sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Marsh has a {{very low}} risk of {{pollution}} and as such the main threat from man has been from vandalism; in 2007, a fire started by youths destroyed {{a third of the}} Newlands reedbed. This was the second time the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> had been targeted, the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck.|$|E
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in the <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> {{are managed}} {{to prevent them}} drying out and also to prevent saline {{intrusion}} from the coast. Despite such control of ecological succession, the breeding bittern population (measured by [...] "booming" [...] males) has been in decline. This {{may be related to}} the <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> being relatively mature.|$|R

5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common redshank and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, and a pair of little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010–2012.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1972, {{a pair of}} Montagu's harriers, Britain's rarest {{breeding}} birds of prey, nested in the <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's harriers did not return, but marsh harriers did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 {{to cope with the}} numbers of visitors.|$|E
5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E

25|$|Kew Pond, {{near the}} {{northeast}} corner of Kew Green, believed to date from the tenth century, is originally thought to have been a natural pond fed from a creek of the tidal Thames. During high (spring) tides, sluice gates are opened to allow river water to fill the pond via an underground channel. The pond is concreted, rectangular in shape and contains an important <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> habitat which is vital for conservation and resident water birds. The pond is managed in partnership with the Friends of Kew Pond.|$|E
25|$|The lakes provide {{habitat for}} {{large numbers of}} birds. Clumber lake is fringed by alder, sallow and ash trees, with some sedge marsh. It {{was one of the}} first sites in the country used by gadwall for breeding, and also has a winter {{population}} of goosander. Hobbys frequent the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> below Clumber Dam in August and September, where they hunt swallows and martins. The upper lake is fringed by oak, yew, beech and Scots pine trees, and provides habitat for willow tits and woodpeckers, with blackcaps visiting in the summer. Mandarin ducks also visit occasionally.|$|E

25|$|North Blackpool Pond Trail {{beginning}} at Holyoake Avenue and continuing {{as far as}} Moor Park Avenue covers a group of 23 ponds, a <b>reed</b> <b>bed,</b> a community orchard (on Salmesbury Avenue located at the former 'Higher Moor Farm') {{and a series of}} dykes /ditches, most of which are Biological Heritage Sites (important at a county level). A campaign by local residents and environmental groups {{led to the creation of}} a series of walks and interpretation boards along with a programme of events and volunteering opportunities though most of these 'walks' existed prior to their involvement and were produced by 'job creation' schemes. There are now significant opportunities for people to access and engage with the natural environment.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the borough; Marline Valley Woods, Combe Haven and Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach. Marline Valley Woods lies within the Ashdown ward of Hastings. It {{is an ancient}} {{woodland}} of Pedunculate oak—hornbeam which is uncommon nationally. Sussex Wildlife Trust own part of the site. Combe Haven is another site of biological interest, with alluvial meadows, and the largest <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> in the county, providing habitat for breeding birds. It is in the West St Leonards ward, stretching into the parish of Crowhurst. The final SSSI, Hastings Cliffs to Pett Beach, is within the Ore ward of Hastings, extending into the neighbouring Fairlight and Pett parishes. The site runs along the coast and is of both biological and geological interest. The cliffs hold many fossils and the site has many habitats, including ancient woodland and shingle beaches.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the eastern}} and southwestern sides of the Green are residential; the {{northern}} side is largely residential, with a few pubs, restaurants, and the Herbarium Library; and {{a small number of}} commercial and retail buildings cluster in the southeast corner. To the north of the Green is Kew Bridge, carrying the busy South Circular Road, which in turn runs across the Green, dividing it into a large western part and a smaller eastern part. At the south end is St Anne's Church, Kew's parish church. At the west end of the Green is Elizabeth Gate, one of the two main entrances into Kew Gardens. Near the northeast corner is Kew Pond, originally thought to have been a natural pond fed from a creek of the tidal Thames. During high (spring) tides sluice gates are opened to allow river water to fill the pond via an underground channel. The pond is concreted, rectangular in shape and contains an important <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> habitat which is vital for conservation and resident water birds.

25|$|Three Sites of Special Scientific Interest {{lie within}} the parish: Lewes Downs, Lewes Brooks and Southerham Works Pit. Lewes Downs is {{a site of}} {{biological}} interest, an isolated area of the South Downs. Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, {{is part of the}} floodplain of the River Ouse, providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails. Southerham Works Pit is of geological interest, a disused chalk pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains. The Railway Land nature reserve is {{on the east side of}} the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> designed by local land artist Chris Drury. The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in East Sussex and Kent home to the marsh frog, an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.|$|E
500|$|The {{preferred}} winter habitat {{around the}} Mediterranean is scrub and olive orchards, where densities approach the levels {{found in the}} best breeding areas. The British wintering population is atypical, with 95% found in gardens, mostly in towns at altitudes below [...] In Africa, habitats include cultivated land, acacia scrub, mangroves and forest, and these warblers are found at altitudes up to [...] in {{the east of the}} continent. Wintering birds wander in search of good fruit supplies, but often stay in good feeding areas, and return in subsequent winters. Migrants may occur {{in a wide variety of}} habitats, such as <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> and fen, but show a preference for shrubland.|$|E
500|$|The North Norfolk Coast SSSI {{contains}} {{a variety of}} habitats including foreshore, shingle, [...] salt marshes, <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> and pasture, and is important primarily for the [...] breeding populations of nationally and internationally scarce bird species, and also {{the large numbers of}} wildfowl it supports in winter. More than three-quarters of the SSSI has been acquired as nature reserves by conservation organisations, whose properties also hold several rare or endangered invertebrates and plants. The mixed pattern of ownership of the ten reserves existing in 2012 reflects the availability of land for purchase or management over the preceding century, and the differing priorities of the various bodies.|$|E
