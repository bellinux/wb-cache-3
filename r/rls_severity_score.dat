40|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{the most}} common movement disorder in pregnancy, which can be idiopathic or secondary. There are limited comparative data regarding these two forms of RLS. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare clinical features of idiopathic and secondary RLS in pregnant women. Over a period of 3 months, 443 women who admitted for delivery in two clinical centers were screened for RLS using four diagnostic criteria of the international RLS study group. A total of 79 subjects diagnosed with RLS were consecutively enrolled in the present study. All of them were interviewed for medical history and complaints during pregnancy and responded to self-administer international RLS rating scale. Ten subjects (12. 9 %) out of 79 pregnant women with RLS had idiopathic form, and their mean age was significantly higher than patients with secondary RLS (30. 6 ± 7. 3 years vs. 26. 4 ± 4. 6 years, P = 0. 0260). Compared with women with secondary RLS, sleep duration in pregnancy was significantly decreased in idiopathic RLS group (P = 0. 0460), whereas <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> was similar in both groups. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of other sleep complaints, the positive family history of RLS, parity, duration of pregnancy, or frequency of cesarean section (P > 0. 0500). Idiopathic and secondary RLS have relatively similar courses and features during pregnancy. However, the idiopathic form may have more negative impact on sleep in pregnancy. Careful screening and effective treatment of idiopathic RLS before pregnancy is recommended to limit these disturbances...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to compare serum endocan levels in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and control subjects in order to elucidate whether RLS is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Methods: A total of 31 drug naïve female patients with RLS and 31 age- and BMI-matched women were included in the study. Patients with pathological or physiological conditions or with a history of medication use that could potentially influence endothelial functions were excluded, as well as those with alcohol or drug abuse history. The two groups were compared with routine blood tests and serum endocan levels. Results: Patients with RLS had lower serum endocan levels than the controls (P= 0. 037). There was a negative bivariate correlation between <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> and serum endocan levels (r=- 0. 406, P= 0. 023). While white blood cell count was significantly higher in RLS group, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D 3, vitamin B 12, transferrin saturation rate, and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower. Creatininemia and diastolic blood pressure were also marginally insignificantly lower in RLS group. Due to the presence of differences between two groups in these variables, a linear regression analysis was performed that showed a positive association between endocan and creatininemia (β= 0. 310, P= 0. 022), and a negative association between endocan and RLS (β=- 0. 502, P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The results of this study seem to suggest that patients with RLS may have better endothelial functions when compared with the general population and that these patients may be better protected against atherosclerosis.

40|$|Background. Uraemic {{restless legs}} {{syndrome}} (RLS) affects {{a significant proportion of}} patients receiving haemodialysis (HD) therapy. Exercise training has been shown to improve RLS symptoms in uraemic RLS patients; however, the mechanism of exercise-induced changes in RLS severity is still unknown. The aim of the current randomized controlled exercise trial was to investigate whether the reduction of RLS severity, often seen after training, is due to expected systemic exercise adaptations or it is mainly due to the relief that leg movements confer during exercise training on a cycle ergometer. This is the first randomized controlled exercise study in uraemic RLS patients. Twenty-four RLS HD patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the progressive exercise training group (n 12) and the control exercise with no resistance group (n 12). The exercise session in both groups included intradialytic cycling for 45 min at 50 rpm. However, only in the progressive exercise training group was resistance applied, at 6065 of maximum exercise capacity, which was reassessed every 4 weeks to account for the patients improvement. The severity of RLS symptoms was evaluated using the IRLSSG severity scale, functional capacity by a battery of tests, while sleep quality, depression levels and daily sleepiness status were assessed via validated questionnaires, before and after the intervention period. All patients completed the exercise programme with no adverse effects. RLS symptom severity declined by 58 (P 0. 003) in the progressive exercise training group, while a no statistically significant decline was observed in the control group (17 change, P 0. 124). Exercise training was also effective in terms of improving functional capacity (P 0. 04), sleep quality (P 0. 038) and depression score (P 0. 000) in HD patients, while no significant changes were observed in the control group. After 6 months of the intervention, RLS severity (P 0. 017), depression score (P 0. 002) and daily sleepiness status (P 0. 05) appeared to be significantly better in the progressive exercise group compared with the control group. A 6 -month intradialytic progressive exercise training programme appears to be a safe and effective approach in reducing RLS symptom severity in HD patients. It seems that exercise-induced adaptations to the whole body are mostly responsible for the reduction in <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> <b>score,</b> since the exercise with no applied resistance protocol failed to improve the RLS severity status of the patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To measure {{interobserver}} {{variation in}} recording injury from case notes {{and its effect}} on calculating injury <b>severity</b> <b>scores</b> (ISS) from identical data and predicting probabilities of survival by using the combined trauma and injury <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> (TRISS). DESIGN [...] Observer variation study using injury <b>severity</b> <b>scoring</b> and subsequent calculation of probability of survival based on combined trauma and injury <b>severity</b> <b>scores.</b> SUBJECTS [...] 16 patients with a range of injury <b>severity</b> <b>scores,</b> and 15 observers. RESULTS [...] There was a wide variation in recorded injury <b>severity</b> <b>scores,</b> the probability of two observers agreeing on the score being 0. 28 (28 %). The probability of any two observers agreeing over which severity band the patient should be in was 0. 5 (50 %). Observer variation was independent of the training and type of observer. Survival probability (calculated by combined trauma and injury <b>severity</b> <b>scoring</b> methodology from individual observers' scores) varied by over 0. 2 in six of the 16 patients and by over 0. 5 in three. CONCLUSIONS [...] There is wide observer variation in injury <b>severity</b> <b>scoring,</b> which highlights a potential fallibility in its use for trauma audit. The use of combined trauma and injury <b>severity</b> <b>scoring</b> for individual prediction of survival is potentially inaccurate except at the extremes of probabilities. The use of the 0. 5 survival line on a combined trauma and injury <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> "pre-chart" is statistically and clinically inappropriate...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{clinical}} practice or trials on hand eczema {{the severity of}} this disease can be 'measured' in different ways: {{by means of a}} physician-rated clinical <b>severity</b> <b>score,</b> a patient-rated clinical <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> or by an indicator of the burden of disease. We assume that the patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> corresponds more with the (change in) burden of disease than with the physician-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score.</b> Objectives To demonstrate how physicians and patients differ in their assessment of the severity of hand eczema as seen in a physician-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score,</b> patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> and a burden of disease questionnaire. Methods We used data from an open-label randomized controlled trial which was set up in two university hospital dermatology departments in the Netherlands, specializing in hand eczema. One hundred and fifty-eight patients with moderate to severe chronic hand eczema were included. The main outcome measures were the physician-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score,</b> based on five visible aspects of hand eczema (desquamation, erythema, vesicles, infiltration, fissures), the patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> (a self-rating scale), a burden of disease questionnaire (the Dermatology Life Quality Index, DLQI) and the correlations between these parameters, both at inclusion and over time. Results Only desquamation and infiltration were significantly correlated with patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score.</b> Patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> correlated with seven of 10 DLQI items, but it did not correlate with the items regarding influence on clothes worn, impairment of sporting activities, and problems associated with treatment of the skin. The majority of patients showed improvement in all parameters after treatment. However, the improvement in patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> was not clearly correlated with changes in physician-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score.</b> Except for DLQI item 1 (itch, soreness, pain, stinging), none of the changes in burden of disease was correlated with changes in patient-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score.</b> For each DLQI item, change over time correlated weakly with decreases in several, but not all, components of the physician-rated <b>severity</b> <b>score.</b> Conclusions Disease <b>severity</b> can be expressed by different scores; these scores are not clearly correlated, and measure different aspects. Patient satisfaction is not guaranteed when treatment is focused solely on the visible aspects of hand eczema. Instead, burden of disease has a greater impact...|$|R

Here, we describe the development of such <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> and its validation in a large, well characterized cohort of ZSD individuals. We developed a <b>severity</b> <b>scoring</b> system based on the 14 organs that typically can be affected in ZSD. A standardized and validated method was used to classify additional care needs in individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities (Capacity Profile [CAP]). Thirty ZSD patients of varying ages were <b>scored</b> by the <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> and the CAP. The median score was 9 (range 6 - 19) with a median scoring age of 16. 0 [*]years (range 2 - 36 years). The ZSD <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> was significantly correlated with all 5 domains of the CAP, most significantly with the sensory domain (r[*]=[*] 0. 8971, p[*]=[*] < 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Description of the {{anatomical}} severity of injuries in trauma patients is important. While the Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> has {{been regarded as}} the “gold standard” since its creation, several {{studies have indicated that}} the New Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> is better. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the accuracy of the Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> and the New Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> in predicting mortality. Methods: Two researchers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases and included studies from which the exact number of true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative results could be extracted. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc. Meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the source(s) of heterogeneity and factor(s) affecting the accuracy of the New Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> and the Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> in predicting mortality. Results: The heterogeneity of the 11 relevant studies (total n = 11, 866) was high (I 2 > 80 %). The meta-analysis using a random-effects model resulted in sensitivity of 0. 64, specificity of 0. 93, positive likelihood ratio of 5. 11, negative likelihood ratio of 0. 27, diagnostic odds ratio of 27. 75, and area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve of 0. 9009 for the Injury Severity Score; and sensitivity of 0. 71, specificity of 0. 87, positive likelihood ratio of 5. 22, negative likelihood ratio of 0. 20, diagnostic odds ratio of 24. 74, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 9095 for the New Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score.</b> Conclusion: The New Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> and the Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> have similar abilities in predicting mortality.

Results: Of the 204 patients reviewed, 69 had radiographic evidence and symptoms of CAP. Only 1 patient had a pneumonia <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> recorded. Based on calculated CORB, CURB- 65 and SMART-COP scores for the remaining 68 patients, 13 (19 %), 3 (4. 4 %) and 1 (3. 6 %) patients had severe pneumonia. 93 % of patients received ceftriaxone. An average of 8 % of patients were prescribed antibiotics compliant with the Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic. Compliance varied with the pneumonia <b>severity</b> <b>scoring</b> tool used.

The number of faces with lesions and <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> at the humerus articular cartilage was unaffected by increasing dietary Lys concentration (P> 0. 16) or the addition of high Met/Cu/Mn to the diet (P> 0. 37). The total faces with lesions were not impacted by increasing dietary Lys concentration (P> 0. 78) or additional high Met/Cu/Mn (P> 0. 86). The total abnormalities (external and number of faces) tended to increase with increasing dietary Lys (linear, P 0. 16). The total <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> for both external and OC evaluation increased with increasing dietary Lys concentration (linear, P< 0. 01). The addition of high Met/Cu/Mn decreased the total <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> (P< 0. 02) compared to pigs fed diets with standard concentrations of Met/Cu/Mn. Finally, increasing dietary Lys concentration increased the sum (linear, P< 0. 05) of abnormalities and total <b>severity</b> <b>score.</b> The addition of high Met/Cu/Mn tended (P< 0. 09) to reduce the overall <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> compared to pigs fed diets with standard concentrations of Met/Cu/Mn. In conclusion, feeding growing gilts dietary Lys to maximize growth performance may increase the severity of OC lesions, while a diet with additional Met/Cu/Mn may aid in the reduction of OC <b>severity</b> <b>scores...</b>|$|R
30|$|At visit 1, vital signs, {{physical}} exam findings, and demographic information were collected. The RSV clinical <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> was calculated using respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, presence of retractions, {{and ability to}} feed [11]. The study physicians assigned each subject a Clinician Global Impression of <b>Severity</b> (CGIS [12]) <b>score</b> of 1 [*]=[*]“normal, not at all ill,” 2 [*]=[*]“borderline ill,” 3 [*]=[*]“mildly ill,” 4 [*]=[*]“moderately ill,” 5 [*]=[*]“markedly ill,” 6 [*]=[*]“severely ill,” or 7 = “among the most extremely ill patients.” Both the Midulla clinical <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> and CGIS {{were used in the}} GRCD validity analyses.|$|R
30|$|The {{assessment}} {{of the degree of}} injury was subjective in nature, making it difficult to estimate the procurement of resources to deal with the injury. To address this, more objective scoring systems are developed. Some of these systems only consider aspects of anatomy such as Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> (ISS), and New Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> (NISS). Others only consider physiological aspects such as Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and Coded RTS (CRTs).|$|R
50|$|These {{frequency}} and intensity scores will get calculated {{together to create}} a <b>severity</b> <b>score</b> for each question. Total symptom severity is calculated by summing up all the individual item <b>severity</b> <b>scores.</b> For example, in the CAPS-IV scoring, to meet criteria for a symptom, the symptom must have an intensity score of 2 (on a scale or 0-4) or greater and a frequency score of 1 (on a scale of 0-4) or greater.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{significance}} of extracranial injuries, as measured by Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score,</b> on 6 -mo and 9 -yr mortality of neurotrauma. Design: Retrospective linked data cohort study. Setting: A major neurotrauma center in Western Australia. Patients: Six hundred eighty-three adult neurotrauma patients. Measurements and main results: Data were first used to validate the largest published international neurotrauma "extended" mortality prognostic model, in which extracranial injuries are considered significant if the patient has hypoxemia or hypotension on admission. Logistic and Cox regression, incorporating bootstrap techniques to adjust for overfitting, were used {{to assess the}} significance of Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> in determining 6 -mo and 9 -yr mortality, respectively. Among a total of 683 patients admitted between 1994 and 2002, 636 (93. 1 %) had extracranial injuries. The international neurotrauma "extended" mortality prognostic model was poorly calibrated and underestimated the observed mortality (slope and intercept of the calibration curve were 2. 14 and 0. 35, respectively) when applied to our patients. Incorporating Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> into the model improved its calibration. Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> accounted for 11 % of the variability and was the third most important factor after Marshall computed tomographic grading (17. 8 %) and pupil reactivity (14. 5 %) in determining 6 -mo mortality. There was a notable increase in mortality between 6 -mo (19. 2 %) and 24 -mo follow-up (25. 8 %). Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> remained important and accounted for 9. 2 % of the variability in determining 9 -yr mortality after the injury. Conclusions: Hypotension and hypoxemia on admission were inadequate markers of extracranial injuries; incorporating more comprehensive extracranial injury assessment by the Injury <b>Severity</b> <b>Score</b> to the standard neurologic prognostic factors improved the accuracy of predictions on mortality after neurotrauma...|$|R
40|$|Guidance for {{highway bridge}} and {{structure}} maintenance {{management in the}} UK {{is provided by the}} code of practice (CoP) 'Management of Highway Structures'. With regards to inspection of reinforced concrete beams in accordance with the code, the professional judgement of the bridge engineer is required to assess the extent and severity of deterioration with help from a library of different defects. The Extent of the defects is rated A – E whilst the <b>Severity</b> is <b>scored</b> 1 – 5, giving an Extent and <b>Severity</b> <b>score</b> for each element, known as the element condition score.
