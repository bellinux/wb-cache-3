50|$|The concept {{can arise}} {{in any number}} of contexts, but the most common are {{inheritance}} law and retirement plan law. In real estate, to vest is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else’s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.|$|E
40|$|The oldest unit of land {{assessment}} in Sweden is the attung (lat. octonarius). It is first mentioned in written {{documents from the}} late 12 th century. When, where and why it was introduced has been much discussed. In this study an investigation of documents mentioning the attung until 1376 is presented together with a statistical processing of data from an earlier work (Dovring 1947). The distribution of land assessed in this unit is restricted to the south-eastern part of the medieval Swedish kingdom. According to an evaluation of some records not discussed before in this context the taxation of real estates in attung units dates from the late 11 th century. Most probably the original purpose of the taxation was to create an adequate base for the military levy system. Several indications show that the attung originally corresponded to one family's normal holding of land. The usefulness of the attung for other purposes was soon realised. Besides taxes it also became the base for tenant's land rent, tithes to a particular hospital, compensation for plowing of fallow fields {{but also for the}} subdivision of common fields on a pro rata basis. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> could also be connected to the attung. At the same time a subdivision of the attung unit in several fractions was created which facilitated the trading of landed property. A drastic fall in prices on real estates assessed in the attung unit is observable just after the Black Death. The overall conclusion is that the multi functionality of the attung was something that developed gradually in response to socio-legal ideas from the continent as well as progress in domestic agricultural technology, economy and society...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{easements}} are amassing increasing popularity as {{a private}} means for accomplishing a public good. In 1980, conservation easements protected 128, 001 acres. By 2003, that number had jumped to over 5 million acres. In Georgia, over 131, 000 acres had been protected by conservation easements {{by the end of}} 2005, more than double the acreage of just a few years before. <b>A</b> conservation <b>easement</b> is <b>a</b> legal arrangement whereby <b>a</b> landowner chooses <b>to</b> transfer certain development <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> eligible <b>easement</b> holder, usually <b>a</b> non-profit or government agency, in order <b>to</b> achieve <b>a</b> qualified purpose. The landowner can sell or donate these development rights. If the easement is made in perpetuity and is either donated or transferred in a “bargain sale,” the landowner may be eligible for federal income tax, estate tax, state income tax, and property tax deductions. In states such as Georgia, conservation easements can exist in perpetuity or be limited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> term of years. The rising popularity of conservation easements makes the distinction between perpetual and fixed-term easements ever more important. Evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} perpetual as opposed to fixed-term easements is not as simple as simply looking at the landowner and the easement holder. The stakeholders in <b>a</b> conservation <b>easement</b> transaction may also include multiple levels of government, the public, future purchasers of the burdened property, abutting and nearby neighbors, developers, and the environment itself. Weighing the costs and benefits to each of these stakeholders gives a more complete picture of the risks and opportunities that perpetual easements provide. The argument in favor of a policy preferring perpetual conservation easements will proceed as follows: First, the memo will discuss the benefits of perpetual conservation easements from the standpoint of each of the stakeholders. Second, the memo will outline the downside to each stakeholder. Third, the memo will conclude that the upside of perpetual easements far outweighs the downside, and recommend that landowners and governments continue to use perpetual easements to conserve land...|$|R

2500|$|There is also {{an unwritten}} form of <b>easement</b> {{referred}} <b>to</b> as <b>an</b> implied <b>easement</b> or easement by implication, arising from the original subdivision of the land for continuous and obvious use of the adjacent parcel (e.g., for access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> road, or <b>to</b> <b>a</b> source of water) such as the right of lot owners in <b>a</b> subdivision <b>to</b> use the roadway on the approved subdivision plan without requiring a specific grant of easement to each new lot when first conveyed.

This paper highlights a number of problems associated with easements in Tasmania. First, it asks whether the law on access <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> should be clarified.
