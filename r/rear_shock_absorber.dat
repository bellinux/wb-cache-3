5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{mountain}} bicycles with {{rear suspension}} systems have a pivoting rear triangle to actuate the <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> There is much manufacturer {{variation in the}} frame design of full-suspension mountain bicycles, and different designs for different riding purposes.|$|E
500|$|Johnson and Burton stated it was {{difficult}} to achieve a rhythm because of the small fuel cells mandated for the race and the hard-compound tires. Temperatures had been warmer than the previous day's Busch Series race and this gave the drivers more grip although sliding was observed during both events. McMurray noted it {{was difficult}} to drive alongside other cars and that other competitors drove cautiously. Kenny Francis, Kahne's crew chief, stated that he preferred to see longer runs but was aware that safety had to be taken into consideration. Four days after the race, Penske Racing South were given penalties for Kurt Busch's car. The penalties, for [...] "actions detrimental to stock car racing"; [...] "car, car parts, components and/or equipment that do not conform to NASCAR rules"; and a right <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> that did not compress, included a $25,000 fine and a two race suspension for crew chief Roy McCauley who was placed on probation until December 31, 2006. Crew chief Matt Gimbel took over McCauley's role at the next race weekend. Team owner Roger Penske and Kurt Busch were penalized 50 points in the Owners' and Drivers' Championships. The following day, Penske Racing South announced it would not appeal the penalties.|$|E

2500|$|Front and <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> are {{tuned to}} improve {{stability}} (Coupe Version S and Version ST, Roadster Version ST) ...|$|R
50|$|Both {{the front}} and <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> can be {{adjusted}} automatically during the run by air circuits that are controlled by an electronical control unit.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, batch by batch {{reliability}} of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that Commercial Motor praised as [...] "exceptionally good". Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers {{at the end}} of each shift, a preventative maintenance regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months. In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> using rubber pads on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul. Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932 and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.|$|E
50|$|Debut {{of a new}} <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> {{providing}} rebound as well as preload adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|... 1966-1967: The A1 was {{available}} {{with either a}} candy red or candy blue with chrome parts and black frame. The fuel tank had rubber knee grips, metal Kawasaki flag emblem and 2 white stripes at the bottom. Rear fender, lower <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> chain guard, {{and parts of the}} front fork assembly were chrome. Front fender was stainless steel, a novelty then. Upper fork, headlight and speedometer combination as well as upper <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and side-mounted oil reservoir covers were painted.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968: The {{color scheme}} remained, but {{the fuel tank}} was {{completely}} painted and a [...] "KAWASAKI" [...] word logo positioned {{at the top of}} the tank's panels. Upper <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> were painted black.|$|R

5000|$|It has a {{telescopic}} {{suspension and}} gas filled <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> for providing {{comfort to the}} rider. A patented easy center stand is geared at making it convenient for the user to put the bike up on center stand.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{mountain}} bicycles with {{rear suspension}} systems have a pivoting rear triangle to actuate the <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> There is much manufacturer {{variation in the}} frame design of full-suspension mountain bicycles, and different designs for different riding purposes.|$|E
50|$|A {{lightweight}} {{long wheelbase}} (1715 mm) frame was designed using {{aluminum die casting}} to minimize weight, with a double cradle design to provide the strength. Suspension consists of a die cast aluminum swinging arm and a hidden single horizontal <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and large diameter front forks.|$|E
50|$|Updates in 2000 saw {{the wheels}} change and get updated to all new Marchesini wheels. The front forks were also {{titanium}} nitrided to reduce stiction. The spokes also {{changed from the}} three-spoke rim style of the 916 to a new five-spoke scheme. In 2001 another overhaul saw the 996 <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> change from a Showa to an Ã–hlins.|$|E
5000|$|The Pacifica {{crossovers}} were {{equipped with}} [...] "Autostick" [...] transaxles, Chrysler's {{version of a}} manually controlled automatic transmission. Other features include five-link rear suspension, self-leveling <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers,</b> and variable assist rack-and-pinion steering. The Pacifica offered a towing capacity of 3500 lb.|$|R
50|$|The Hunk has a stepped {{seat and}} rear-set foot pegs {{that give the}} rider a sporty stance without sacrificing rider comfort. The {{vibrations}} are well controlled. The bike also features gas-charged adjustable <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> and <b>rear</b> tire with a tuff-up tube.|$|R
50|$|Included {{with the}} level ride package, which {{utilized}} a compressor and air-pressurized <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> to maintain vehicle height regardless of load, was a control panel and air hose kit that allowed the vehicle {{to be used to}} inflate tires, air mattresses, sporting equipment and such.|$|R
50|$|A magnet {{combined}} with a <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> forms the folding mechanism. The magnet connects and locks the back wheel section to the frame. To fold the bike in half, the magnet disconnects with one movement and in a second, and without having to use one's hands, the rear wheel rotates forward, and the bike folds vertically. This mechanism also enables one to roll the half-folded bike on its rear wheel.|$|E
50|$|The frame {{lost the}} steel engine cradles, {{but also its}} bolt-on {{subframe}} and the rear ride height adjuster. The swingarm was a new unbraced, rectangular-section extruded design. The wheel sizes were the same, but the wheels were a new, lighter design. The brake calipers carried over, but the discs were smaller and lighter without stopping power being affected. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> changed from a remote-reservoir to a lighter, more compact piggyback design. The wheelbase dropped 30 mm to 1410 mm.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{handling}} of the R1 was improved through changes to frame and suspension. A new sub frame was designed for the 2009 R1, cast from magnesium giving lower weight aiding mass centralisation. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> on the 2009 offers variable speed damping, {{as well as an}} easy to tweak pre-load via a screw adjustment. The rear shock now connects underneath the swing arm through a different linkage; a change from previous years' models. To improve overall handling and safety, Yamaha included an electronic steering damper.|$|E
50|$|Again in 1979 he {{produced}} a Seeley Honda TL200 trials bike, a smaller version of the 360cc works bike ridden by Rob Shepherd, based on the XL185 engine with a Reynolds 531 tubing frame, Marzocchi forks and Girling <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers.</b> All machines were hand-built, and, with limited production volumes, have become collectors' items.|$|R
50|$|Suspension on both {{models is}} by leaf springs front and <b>rear,</b> with <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> {{on the front}} only.|$|R
50|$|The DB6 {{continued}} with then high-tech Armstrong Selectaride cockpit-adjustable <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> as {{available on the}} DB5. Other highlights include adopting front-door quarter windows, an oil-cooler air scoop low on the front valance, quarter-bumpers at each corner, revised tail-lamp clusters; additionally the spoiler affected the overall proportions of the DB6, {{with an increase in}} length by approximately two inches.|$|R
5000|$|Launched in 1989, the GSF250 and GSF400 are naked street motorcycles, with liquid-cooled, inline four {{cylinder}} engines {{derived from}} the GSX-R250 and GSX-R400 motorcycles, mounted as a stressed member in a steel trellis frame with single <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> Apart from the engines and transmission, the [...] "baby Bandits" [...] share many of their parts. Limited editions have a retro-styled top fairing. 'N' designated models have clip-on handlebars. [...] "GSF" [...] and [...] "Bandit" [...] nomenclature are both used across the series' chronology and market geography.|$|E
50|$|Race {{number five}} on the 2006 Chase, and {{the halfway point}} of the playoff, the Bank of America 500, was held on Saturday, October 14, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. The event was the only Saturday night race in the Chase. Scott Riggs won the pole, and Kurt Busch had his 3rd-place run disqualified due to an unapproved right <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> It cost him 50 points (along with a similar {{deduction}} for Penske Racing) and $25,000 (US) in fines {{as well as a}} four race suspension for his crew chief.|$|E
50|$|The XR200, a {{development}} of the XL185 trail bike, was produced from 1980 until 2002. unlike the XL185 dual shock setup, the XR200 had a single <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> with pro-link suspension (1980 Xr200s had dual rear shocks) and an ohc 2-valve air-cooled engine with kick-start only. Although the XR200's power output was modest, the bike was much smaller and lighter than the XR250, and it suited less experienced riders. Due to its lightness and ground clearance it made an excellent backwoods bike. Drum brakes were fitted front and rear. Having neither battery nor electric start, the driving lights shone only when the engine was running. Some years had no headlights.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000 model year, a new version, the X4 LD ("Low Down"), was introduced. It {{offered a}} {{slightly}} lower seat and overall frame, improved suspension (with [...] "piggyback"-style Showa <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers),</b> and minor cosmetic differences including an unpainted engine block (versus {{the black of}} the original) and lightweight latticework inner rotors on the front brakes (the originals were solid discs).|$|R
5000|$|The Mark V Hawk {{announced}} in September 1952 {{was given a}} larger clutch, larger <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers,</b> a strengthened body-frame and other minor mechanical changes. A new treatment {{was given to the}} car's front. It was also available as a [...] "luxury touring limousine". A lowered bonnet line and wrap-around bumpers with over-riders distinguished this model from the Mk IV ...|$|R
50|$|Classic classes {{exist for}} vintage bikes. Classes include pre-1965 or pre-1967 {{motorcycles}} (typically British), {{as well as}} newer vintage events for observed trials motorcycles with two <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers.</b> In most cases, twin-shock motorcycles were manufactured between 1967 and 1985 and are typically Japanese or Spanish. A recent addition has been a class for air-cooled monoshock bikes, this covers machines up to around 1990.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} the FZ750 is {{manufactured}} from mild steel box-section and uses a perimeter layout. The fairing and upper rear section use separate cylindrical tubing sub-frames. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> is placed vertically behind the engine and connects to an extruded aluminium alloy swinging arm via several forged aluminium rocker arms. The 16 in front wheel is held between spring and oil damped forks. Later models of the FZ750 used a 17 in front wheel. Early FZ750s used twin ventilated disc brakes for the front wheel with a single ventilated disc at the rear. Later versions used unventilated disks, with four piston calipers on the front.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{has greater}} vertical travel and more adjustability than the suspension on the Versys 650 siblings.. On the front thicker/stiffer 41 mm inverted front forks are externally adjustable for preload and rebound damping. The right fork leg carries a damping cartridge while both legs contain springs. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> is adjustable for rebound damping. Suspension preload is adjustable {{in the rear}} via a screw collar on the shock. 2015+ models have an external adjuster. The rear shock/spring is directly connected, without linkages, to a non symmetrical, gull wing, aluminum swing arm instead of the more basic steel swing arm used on the Ninja and ER-6.|$|E
50|$|The {{base model}} Tuono (known as the Tuono Fighter in the US market for 2003 {{and as the}} RSV Tuono for the 2004-2005 models) and the high spec Tuono Factory all share the same frame-mounted bikini fairing and body covers, either in plastic for the base model or carbon fibre for the Factory models. The frame and {{swingarm}} of the 2003 Tuono (Tuono Fighter in the US market) was a light bronze color, whereas the 2004 and 2005 models sported a black frame and swingarm. This contrasted with the frames used on the RSV Mille which were a chrome finish for the base models and black for the Racing/Factory models. The Tuono base models feature an adjustable Sachs <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and Showa front suspension.|$|E
50|$|The Scrambler also {{featured}} a high, wide handlebar, a higher seat position, twin chromed Kayaba <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> (with increased 106 mm travel), 41 mm Kayaba front forks with 120 mm travel and rubber fork gaiters, a small single headlight {{with a simple}} speedo, and chunky, knobbly Bridgestone tyres on the thin 36-spoke 19 x 2.5-inch front wheel and the 40-spoke 17 x 3.5-inch rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|The electric-starting Triumph T140W TSS was {{launched}} in 1982 and featured an eight-valve cylinder head (derived from Weslake Engineering, hence the 'W' suffix) and a revised crankshaft designed to reduce vibration. All T140W had an electric start, the new Italian-made 4 gallon petrol tank, twin front disc brakes and Marzocchi Strada <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> as standard with Morris alloy wheels and an anti-vibration frame as options.|$|R
5000|$|From a {{price of}} $6000-$7250 for the S1, the Excalibur SII went up to $12,000 -$13,000 but {{justified}} that extra cost with its supplementary equipment. This included air conditioning, variable ratio power steering, adjustable steering column, servoed brakes, [...] "Positraction" [...] differential, chromed wire wheels, stereo radio, two spare tires mounted in the front fenders, driving lamps, air horns and constant level <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
