40|$|The study {{develops}} univariate (ARIMA and ARCH/GARCH) {{and multivariate}} models (VAR, VECM and Bayesian VAR) to forecast short- and long-term rates, viz., call money rate, 15 - 91 days Treasury Bill rates {{and interest rates}} on Government securities with (<b>residual)</b> <b>maturities</b> of one <b>year,</b> five years and ten years. Multivariate models consider factors such as liquidity, Bank Rate, repo rate, yield spread, inflation, credit, foreign interest rates and forward premium. The study finds that multivariate models generally outperform univariate ones over longer forecast horizons. Overall, the study concludes that the forecasting performance of Bayesian VAR models is satisfactory for most interest rates and their superiority in performance is marked at longer forecast horizons. ...|$|R

The analysis covers Treasury Bills with <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> of 15 - 91 days and Government securities of <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> one, five and ten years respectively. The empirical estimates show that a long-run relationship exists between each of these interest rates and the policy rate, {{rate of growth of}} money supply, inflation, interest rate spread, foreign interest rate and forward premium. At the same time, the empirical results also show that the relative importance of the determinants varies across the maturity spectrum.

40|$|Corporate {{bond yields}} {{are not easy}} to {{approximate}} on account of their limited trading frequency and irregularity in issuance. The corporate bond market in India demonstrates poor investor participation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an account of piece wise cubic spline methodology of yield estimation that can be feasibly implemented by practitioners. This paper attempts to approximate the corporate bond yield using <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> for listed and traded bonds using traded data from the period January 2001 to October 2014. We use a two stage process, where in the first stage, we model the yield behavior of corporate bonds against their <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> nodes of 3 years, 5 years and 20 years, respectively. In the second stage, we identify the significant factors of bond liquidity that impacts the cubic spline residual to improve accuracy in estimation. The first step of piece wise cubic spline estimates the 3 node parameters to predict the logarithmic yield to maturities against their remaining <b>maturity</b> in <b>years.</b> The second step intends to analyze the prediction errors and provides for correction in accuracy incorporating factors of bond liquidity such as issuer, issue and liquidity factors, respectively. The dual approach explains the variation in yields and could be used for identifying quality papers and the reasons for lower investor participation in bond markets and for arriving at term structure in related markets. This does not include pure central govt. loans, state loans, treasury bills, dated securities, bond of departmental undertaking or india development bonds...|$|R

50|$|Ratios {{relating}} {{reserves to}} other external sector variables are popular among credit risk agencies {{and international organizations}} to assess the external vulnerability of a country. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total external debt to gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money to short-term external debt, and short-term external debt to short-term external debt on <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics accumulate reserves to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.|$|R

Assets and liabilities are put into <b>residual</b> contractual <b>maturity</b> buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2–3 months' etc. These <b>residual</b> contractual <b>maturities</b> may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.|$|R

Analysing daily information on secondary market trading in Gov-ernment of India bonds, we find that <b>residual</b> <b>maturity,</b> time since issuance, current yield and issue size account for most of the variation in pricing errors off an estimated term structure.

40|$|Estimating a risk free Term Structure of Interest Rates or Zero Coupon Yield Curve {{from the}} {{observed}} bond prices would involve {{controlling for the}} effects of security specific non-interest rate factors that affect bond prices. In this paper we propose a new framework to estimate benchmark- default and liquidity risk free- yield curve along with an illiquidity discount using the stochastic frontier functions. The methodology explicitly models the effects of security specific factors such as age, issue size, coupon and <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> on illiquidity discounts implicit in bond prices. Using the daily secondary market data from National Stock Exchange-Wholesale Debt Market for Government of India bonds for the period January 1997 to July 2002, we find that the new methodology not only identifies frontier yield curve that is significantly different from the standard zero coupon yield curve and gives reasonable estimates of illiquidity discounts, but also performs better than the standard yield curve models in terms of tracking observed bond prices...|$|R

40|$|An Analysis of the Government of India Bond Market Research on term {{structure}} estimation has {{in recent}} years shifted from the specification and testing of alternative functional forms of the pricing equation {{to the analysis of}} factors over and above the present value relation that determine the pricing of a bond. Many studies have accordingly examined the importance of various security specific attributes for bond pricing. The present exercise contributes to the existing empirical literature with an analysis of the Government of India bond market. The term structure is estimated using the Nelson-Siegel functional form, using daily information on secondary market trades in Government of India securities from NSE-WDM for the period January 2000 to June 2001. We find that significant pricing errors exist when Government bonds are priced using the term structure alone. The security specific factors such as <b>residual</b> <b>maturity,</b> time since issuance or age, current yield and issue-size account for most of the variation in pricing errors.
