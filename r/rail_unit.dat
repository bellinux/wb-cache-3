5000|$|The Highway Patrol Bureau {{is divided}} into three {{divisions}}: the Radar and Alcohol Detection Unit, the Expressway Patrol Unit, and the Metro <b>Rail</b> <b>Unit.</b> The first two divisions share the same primary objectives of preventing and investigating traffic accidents, arresting drunk drivers, arresting street racers and confiscating vehicles used for street racing. The Metro <b>Rail</b> <b>Unit</b> specifically protects the San Juan Metropolitan Area Rail System, or [...] "Tren Urbano" [...] in Spanish.|$|E

50|$|Some {{industrial}} railways are {{military in}} purpose, and serve ammunition dumps or transportation hubs and storage facilities.The world's largest industrial railway serves the Baikonur Cosmodrome, {{and has been}} long operated by a military <b>rail</b> <b>unit</b> of the Russian Armed Forces. The railway closely participates in space launches, transporting space vehicles to their immediate launch pads.|$|E
50|$|The {{class was}} {{upgraded}} {{in the early}} 1990s. All units carry a more powerful Cummins engine - 230 bhp per car, which equals 460 bhp (340 kW) per twin-car unit - and Voith two-stage hydraulic transmission, starting with a torque converter which switches to fluid coupling drive once the unit is up to 45 mi/h km/h. This has proven successful, although incidents have occurred, such as when a Northern <b>Rail</b> <b>unit</b> derailed en route from Blackpool to Liverpool in June 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Brown was {{chair of}} the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) in both 2000 and 2001. He {{previously}} worked in British Rail's freight business, migrating to BR's InterCity Planning division. He was heavily involved with BR's [...] "Organising For Quality" [...] project separating the traditional British Railway into separate businesses. With that Brown headed up the combined InterCity Cross Country and Midland Mainline. Brown moved to Derby and continued {{as the head of}} Midland Mainline before, during and after the privatisation of British Rail. The franchise win by National Express Group led to Brown becoming head of their new <b>rail</b> <b>unit,</b> and a commercial director of NEG itself.|$|E

40|$|Rail support modulus is an {{important}} factor in safety of railway track. This parameter is defined as support force imposing on rail length unit per <b>rail</b> <b>unit</b> displacement in vertical direction. Rail support modulus is important because it affects track performance and maintenance requirements. Both low and large modulus is undesirable. Low modulus of the rail support has been shown to cause differential settlement that then increases maintenance needs. On the other hand, higher value of rail support causes axle load to be distributed on fewer sleepers and therefore received dynamic loads for any sleeper and rail-sleeper fastening will be increased. Sandy desert areas are critical regions about the contamination of ballast. In these areas, flowing sand grains influence between ballast aggregates and increase the stiffness of ballast layer and the rail support modulus. In this paper, the results of a field investigation about the effect of ballast contamination on the values of the rail support modulus in sandy desert areas are presented...|$|E
40|$|In article {{the meaning}} of railway {{transport}} for economic, {{social and cultural development}} of the region has been emphasized. There have been studied the main problems of building of Prydniprovsk railway during the inter­war period, among them are impossibility to procure transportation of all industrial cargos to the full extent and high damage rate caused by bad condition of <b>rail</b> <b>unit,</b> old age and failure of steam trains and carriages, weakness of material and technical resources and insufficiency of qualified staff. Core measures of soviet government directed to optimization of railway operation have been examined. Since 1935 process of its reconstruction has been activated, steam and carriage stocks have been renewed partially, range of loading­unloading operations has been mechanized, railway junctions have been extended, new bridges, terminal stations, locomotive depots and car­repair yards have been built, numerous kilometers have been railed. All aforementioned helped to improve key performance indicators of the railway. In article methods to have been used by communist party and government in order to force and increase quality of railway employees’ work have been shown, namely moral incentives, socialist competitions of best employees and innovators, encourage of the Stakhanov and Krivonos movement and also material incentives of employees, raise in wages, bonus awards for the best labor collectives. Based on materials of «Steel Trunk» newspaper authors of the article have revealed the following nonconformance in railway operation: breach of train schedule, non­fulfillment of loading plan, carriage failure, low quality of repair operations, numerous accidents etc. In addition the conclusion of unsatisfactory social conditions of railway employees, their bad living conditions, insufficiency and bad sanitary condition of dormitories and canteens has been made based on newspaper publication...|$|E

25|$|As the Thameslink {{service was}} to use a route with 25kV AC OHLE north of Farringdon and along the branch to Moorgate, and 750V DC third-rail {{electrification}} south of Farringdon, the Class 319 trains were built with dual-voltage capabilities, making them very versatile. They were also the first British <b>Rail</b> <b>units</b> to use modern thyristor control {{in place of a}} camshaft and resistor bank.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Railway (SR) in the UK {{gave the}} {{designation}} SL to the fleet of AC overhead electric multiple units {{used on the}} South London Line between Victoria and London Bridge station. These had been built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1909, but with the abandonment of the Elevated Electric service in 1928 they were converted to DC third <b>rail</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1980 the Tyne and Wear Metro opened {{over the}} Tyneside Electrics route, {{diverted}} through tunnels on {{parts of the}} line. New trains were introduced based on German Stadtbahnwagen B light <b>rail</b> <b>units</b> and power was taken from an overhead line at 1500 V DC. In London the automatic Docklands Light Railway opened in 1987; trains are staffed by a train captain who can drive the train in abnormal situations.|$|R
