50|$|The {{original}} Salvage Committee {{established a}} set of rules and regulations for all warehouses and sheds seeking to do business in the Liverpool area and who wanted to buy insurance cover. These rules set out in minute detail how premises were to be constructed, maintained and managed. Each building was given a classification which dictated what goods were allowed to be stored therein. Fire prevention and minimising the spread of fire were of paramount importance. Each <b>registered</b> <b>premises</b> was inspected in detail every year against the original classification and was randomly visited 2 or 3 times a week to make sure storage and housekeeping was of a high standard. All warehouse keepers had to be registered with the Liverpool Salvage Corps and licensed by the City Council. By these rules and regulations a great deal of order and organisation was brought to Liverpool's warehousing industry and in return for cooperating the warehouse owners enjoyed a preferential rate of insurance.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} obtain baseline data from a survey on biosecurity practices and investigate risk factors associated with positive findings of avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease (ND), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Salmonella Enteritidis (SE). Serum, tracheal, and cloacal swabs were randomly collected from 262 birds among 39 <b>registered</b> <b>premises.</b> Analysis revealed flock prevalence and seroprevalence respectively for the following: AI (0 %, 23 %), ND (0 %, 23 %), ILT (26 %, 49 %), MG (3 %, 13 %), SE (0 %, ND). Vaccine status could not be confirmed for ND, ILT, or MG. Premises positives were identified by partial nucleotide sequencing. No statistically significant associations were identified, however, AI seroprevalence was positively associated with exposure to waterfowl (Relative Risk [RR] = 3. 14, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1 - 8. 9) and absence of pest control (RR= 2. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 6 - 10. 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Background English Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) immunized {{the poultry}} worker {{population}} with the seasonal influenza vaccine in the 2007 winter season. Methods In Warwickshire, {{the provision of}} vaccinations progressed in two phases: four weekday evening clinics were offered initially, then one weekend clinic was offered, plus on-site vaccination at three farms and vaccination in general practice. Results There were 253 <b>registered</b> <b>premises</b> in Warwickshire. Eighty-eight persons were vaccinated in five clinics; 131 persons were immunized on-site. Nobody attended their general practice for vaccination; the overall uptake rate was 32 %, far exceeding the expected 20 %. Conclusion On-site vaccination during working hours {{was by far the}} most effective method of vaccinating this population; community clinics were not cost-effective, nor were general practices apparently accessed. The number of workers recorded in the contact list of registered poultry premises provided by DEFRA/DH {{has been shown to be}} unreliable; this has implications for the future implementation and evaluation of this programme.

40|$|Major {{implications}} on a country’s economy, food source, {{and public}} health. With recent {{concern over the}} highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks around the world, government agencies are carefully monitoring and inspecting live bird markets, commercial flocks, and migratory bird populations. However, there remains limited surveillance of non-commercial poultry. Therefore, a cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} backyard poultry flocks using a convenience sampling method across three regions of Maryland from July 2011 to August 2011. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza by investigating the prevalence and seroprevalence in this potentially vulnerable population and by evaluating biosecurity risk factors associated with positive findings. Serum, tracheal, and cloacal swabs were randomly collected from 262 birds among 39 <b>registered</b> <b>premises.</b> Analysis indicated bird and flock seroprevalence as 4. 2 % (11 / 262) and 23. 1 % (9 / 39), respectively. Based on RT-qPCR analysis, none of the samples were found to be positive for AI RNA and evidence of AI hemagglutinin subtypes H 5, H 7, or H 9 were not detected. Although no statistically significant biosecurity associations were identified (p# 0. 05), AI seroprevalence was positively associated with exposure to waterfowl, pest control, and location. AI seropositive flocks exposed to waterfowl were 3. 14 times as likely to be AI seropositive than those not exposed (p = 0. 15). AI seropositive flocks that did not use pest control were 2. 5 times as likely to be AI seropositive compared to those that did and AI seropositive flocks located in the Northern region of Maryland wer...|$|E

Self-administered pre-tested 34 -item semi-structured questionnaires were used to carry out this study among superintendent pharmacists’ of <b>registered</b> pharmacy <b>premises</b> in two south-western states in Nigeria. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentages), Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to appropriately summarize the data obtained. All the respondents who consented to take part had ordered laboratory tests for patients prior to this study. The types of invasive and non-invasive tests ordered, ranged from simple dipstick pregnancy test to more varied tests like: fasting blood glucose 24 (36. 9 %), blood pressure measurement 58 (89. 2 %), malaria parasite test 47 (72. 3 %), full blood count 16 (24. 6 %), widal reaction test 45 (69. 2 %), urinalysis 10 (15. 4 %) mantoux test 3 (4. 6 %) and hepatitis B & C test 3 (4. 6 %).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTed C. SchroederElectronic animal {{identification}} systems {{are becoming more}} common in livestock auction markets because of increased numbers of cattle being electronically identified. More cattle are being individually identified because of increasing enrollment in marketing alliances and verification programs. Also, the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has increased awareness and perhaps use of electronic identification. In this study, individual characteristics of livestock markets were analyzed to determine how they relate to a livestock market operator's views, concerns, {{and knowledge of the}} NAIS as well as adoption of RFID reading equipment. Investments in RFID tagging services and RFID reading equipment by livestock markets were estimated and price premiums associated with RFID tagged and preconditioned cattle were estimated. Data were from a national survey of livestock auction markets and cattle transaction data were obtained from three Kansas livestock markets. Auction markets that indicated they currently plan to add a RFID tagging service are likely to have more knowledge of the NAIS program standards, how to adopt the NAIS practices, and the probable costs involved. Managers of facilities that sell a large volume of livestock annually tend to have a higher level of understanding of how to adopt the NAIS practices and be more knowledgeable of the NAIS standards than operators of smallvolume facilities. Managers of markets that have operating RFID reader systems tend to be more understanding of how to adopt the NAIS practices and of costs associated with adopting the NAIS.

40|$|Objectives: Licensed {{premises}} {{are associated}} with a considerable level of alcohol-related harm. This study examined the effectiveness of an educational policing strategy, implemented as routine policing practice, {{to reduce the number of}} patrons of licensed premises involved in police-recorded incidents of violence, disorder and motor vehicle crashes. Participants: The educational policing strategy targeted on-licensed <b>premises</b> <b>registered</b> as operating in 2003. The strategy was delivered by police and was overseen by the research team. Setting: The intervention was conducted in 21 non-metropolitan New South Wales Police Force commands. Intervention: On the basis of routinely collected and recorded police data, premises received one of three levels of police response on three separate occasions from December 2002 to July 2003. The police responses were letters, incident reports, covert audits and feedback meetings. Outcomes: The rate of patrons who had last consumed alcohol on licensed premises before being involved in police-recorded incidents decreased from 1. 24 per premises in the 4 -month baseline period to 1. 11 in the 4 -month follow-up period (p= 0. 08). There was a significant reduction, from 7. 08 to 5. 65 patrons (p= 0. 03), in such a rate for high-risk premises that received the most intensive police response. High-risk premises also recorded a significant reduction in the rate of intoxicated patrons involved in such incidents, from 5. 50 to 4. 40 (p= 0. 05).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare the costs of correcting anterior crossbite with functional shift, using fixed or removable appliances (FA or RA) and to relate the costs to the effects, using cost-minimization analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two patients with anterior crossbite and functional shift were randomized in blocks of 10. Thirty-one patients were randomized to be treated with brackets and arch wire (FA) and 31 with an acrylic plate (RA). Duration of treatment and number and estimated length of appointments and cancellations were <b>registered.</b> Direct costs (<b>premises,</b> staff salaries, material, and laboratory costs) and indirect costs (the accompanying parents' loss of income while absent from work) were calculated and evaluated with reference to successful outcome alone, to successful and unsuccessful outcomes and to re-treatment when required. Societal costs were defined as the sum of direct and indirect costs. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with FA or RA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between FA and RA with respect to direct costs for treatment time, but both indirect costs and direct costs for material were significantly lower for FA. The total societal costs were lower for FA than for RA. LIMITATIONS: Costs depend on local factors and should not be directly extrapolated to other locations. CONCLUSION: The analysis disclosed significant economic benefits for FA over RA. Even when only successful outcomes were assessed, treatment with RA was more expensive.

40|$|Over 1 billion {{ornamental}} fish comprising more than 4000 freshwater and 1400 marine species are traded internationally each year, with 8 - 10 million imported into Australia alone. Compared to other commodities, the pathogens and disease translocation {{risks associated with}} this pattern of trade have been poorly documented. The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct an appraisal of the effectiveness of risk analysis and quarantine controls as they are applied according to the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) agreement in Australia. Ornamental fish originate from about 100 countries and hazards are mostly unknown; since 2000 there have been 16 -fold fewer scientific publications on {{ornamental fish}} disease compared to farmed fish disease, and 470 fewer compared to disease in terrestrial species (cattle). The import quarantine policies of a range of countries were reviewed and classified as stringent or non-stringent based on the levels of pre-border and border controls. Australia has a stringent policy which includes pre-border health certification and a mandatory quarantine period at border of 1 - 3 weeks in <b>registered</b> quarantine <b>premises</b> supervised by government quarantine staff. Despite these measures there have been many disease incursions as well as establishment of significant exotic viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal and metazoan pathogens from ornamental fish in farmed native Australian fish and free-living introduced species. Recent examples include Megalocytivirus and Aeromonas salmonicida atypical strain. In 2006, there were 22 species of alien ornamental fish with established breeding populations in waterways in Australia and freshwater plants and molluscs have also been introduced, proving a direct transmission pathway for establishment of pathogens in native fish species. Australia's stringent quarantine policies for imported ornamental fish are based on import risk analysis under the SPS agreement but have not provided an acceptable level of protection (ALOP) consistent with government objectives to prevent introduction of pests and diseases, promote development of future aquaculture industries or maintain biodiversity. It is concluded that the risk analysis process described by the Office International des Epizooties under the SPS agreement cannot be used in a meaningful way for current patterns of ornamental fish trade. Transboundary disease incursions will continue and exotic pathogens will become established in new regions as a result of the ornamental fish trade, and this will be an international phenomenon. Ornamental fish represent a special case in live animal trade where OIE guidelines for risk analysis need to be revised. Alternatively, for countries such as Australia with implied very high ALOP, the number of species traded and the number of sources permitted need to be dramatically reduced to facilitate hazard identification, risk assessment and import quarantine controls.

These professional establishments require a license to conduct commercial activities. Compliance with Swedish and EU legislation pertaining {{to the welfare of}} animals is routinely assessed by educated inspectors. Complete data from official animal welfare control of premises with dogs in Sweden (21 counties), from January 2012 to December 2014, was provided by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. The objectives of the study were to identify missing data on dog welfare from the animal welfare control database; to determine the occurrence of poor welfare in general, and between professional and non-professional premises that keep dogs; to investigate whether the welfare status of dog daycare/boarding can be determined using the animal welfare control database; and recommend improvements for assessment, especially for dog daycare/boarding in Sweden. A species specific animal welfare checklist was used to assess compliance with legislation pertaining to the welfare of dogs. There were 40 control points based on animal, resource, and management-based measures on the animal welfare checklist. There were only four animal-based control points assessing social contact, cleanliness and grooming of the animals, body condition, and claw condition.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that {{data from the}} Emergency Department is a better measure {{of violence in the}} community than police statistics. But other data sources should also be used where possible. Cairns is a large regional centre in far north Queensland. Around one-quarter of injuries due to violence requiring treatment in the ED at Cairns Base Hospital can be linked with the Cairns late night entertainment precinct, a tiny area of less than one square kilometre in the inner city. Alcohol is involved in the overwhelming majority of injuries due to violence in Cairns generally. In this study, a surveillance system for incidents of person-to-person violence was developed and tried in the Cairns late night entertainment precinct. In the ED, clinicians and triage nurses flagged incidents believed to have happened in the late night entertainment precinct, Queensland Police Service provided data on alcohol-related assaults occurring there, Cairns Regional Council CCTV camera room operators described incidents of concern and venue security reported incidents from <b>registers</b> on licensed <b>premises.</b> The combined results captured by the surveillance tool were consistent with local understandings and experiences and with the published evidence; i. e. they made sense. This makes the tool potentially useful for monitoring, surveillance and evaluating the effects of targeted intervention strategies if methodological shortcomings can be addressed. A methodologically rigorous and robust surveillance system would include at least i) a clear definition of the target area, ii) sound ways to repeatedly and comprehensively count and describe incidents of person-to-person violence in the target area, iii) sound ways of estimating the population exposed to the risk of violence for the target area and iv) strong local coalitions of stakeholders with the capacity to use such a surveillance system and to provide sustained support for intervention strategies. Importantly, the study was able to engage with the ED and QPS, but also with security providers and the Cairns Regional Council.

40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) {{outbreaks}} can cause enormous losses in naïve pig populations. How to best minimize the economic damage {{and number of}} culled animals caused by CSF is therefore an important research area. The baseline CSF control strategy in the European Union and Switzerland consists of culling all animals in infected herds, movement restrictions for animals, material and people within a given distance to the infected herd and epidemiological tracing of transmission contacts. Additional disease control measures such as pre-emptive culling or vaccination have been recommended {{based on the results}} from several simulation models; however, these models were parameterized for areas with high animal densities. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore whether pre-emptive culling and emergency vaccination should also be recommended in low- to moderate-density areas such as Switzerland. Additionally, we studied the influence of initial outbreak conditions on outbreak severity to improve the efficiency of disease prevention and surveillance. A spatial, stochastic, individual-animal-based simulation model using all <b>registered</b> Swiss pig <b>premises</b> in 2009 (n= 9770) was implemented to quantify these relationships. The model simulates within-herd and between-herd transmission (direct and indirect contacts and local area spread). By varying the four parameters (a) control measures, (b) index herd type (breeding, fattening, weaning or mixed herd), (c) detection delay for secondary cases during an outbreak and (d) contact tracing probability, 112 distinct scenarios were simulated. To assess the impact of scenarios on outbreak severity, daily transmission rates were compared between scenarios. Compared with the baseline strategy (stamping out and movement restrictions) vaccination and pre-emptive culling neither reduced outbreak size nor duration. Outbreaks starting in a herd with weaning piglets or fattening pigs caused higher losses regarding to the number of culled premises and were longer lasting than those starting in the two other index herd types. Similarly, larger transmission rates were estimated for these index herd type outbreaks. A longer detection delay resulted in more culled premises and longer duration and better transmission tracing increased the number of short outbreaks. Based on the simulation results, baseline control strategies seem sufficient to control CSF in low-medium animal-dense areas. Early detection of outbreaks is crucial and risk-based surveillance should be focused on weaning piglet and fattening pig premises...|$|R
