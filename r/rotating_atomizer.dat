50|$|The {{circular}} {{air inlet}} behind the reduction gear has a de-icing device using hot air. The compressor's two axial stages use blisks. The shaft runs on ball bearings. Air {{flow through the}} annular combustion chamber is S-wise, with fuel being added in radial direction by a <b>rotating</b> <b>atomizer</b> disc. The blades of the three-stage turbine's wheels, also blisks, are air-cooled from the inside. The jet nozzle is fixed with an interior cone. Auxiliary drives are mounted on a mounting plate behind the inlet, which also has the connections for starter motor/generator, oil and fuel pumps, engine speed control and tachometer. There are also optional drives for an AC generator and a hydraulic pump. The whole engine is mounted at three points, two trunnions {{on the right and}} left front of the turbine casing and one on its underside to the rear. Speed control is effected automatically by governing the injection volume, with a thermal regulator allowing for short-term overloads.|$|E

The centrifugal high-speed atomizer is running at high speed, it makes micron liquid-drop in order that chemical reaction happened between micron drop and harmful gas. Its function has direct impact to the emission produced from WTE（waste to energy）plant. The different driving form affects the atomizer’s stability of high speed movement, atomization effect and the running life directly. For a long time, the transmission quality of belt drive or direct coupling drive {{is one of the}} focus issues. Based on the high speed centrifugal atomizer, this paper introduces the two commonly used driving forms of the atomizer, and compares their performance through the experiments...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{feedstock}} fuel powder for irradiation testing, the Idaho National Laboratory has produced a <b>rotating</b> electrode type <b>atomizer</b> to fabricate uranium-molybdenum alloy fuel. Operating with the appropriate parameters, this laboratory-scale atomizer produces fuel in the desired size range for the RERTR dispersion experiments. Analysis of the powder shows a homogenous, rapidly solidified microstructure with fine equiaxed grains. This powder {{has been used to}} produce irradiation experiments to further test adjusted matrix U-Mo dispersion fuel...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} {{collaborative}} effort with the Ford Motor Company, our research aims to develop practical and efficient trajectory planning tools for automotive painting. Not only must the paint applicator pass over all points on the surface, it must do so in a manner that ensures the uniformity of the coating thickness. This is non-trivial given the complexity of automotive surfaces. This report documents our efforts to develop analytic deposition models for electrostatic <b>rotating</b> bell (ESRB) <b>atomizers,</b> which have recently become widely used in the automotive painting industry. Conventional deposition models, used in earlier automatic trajectory planning tools, fail to capture the complexity of deposition patterns generated by ESRB atomizers. The models presented here take into account both the surface curvature and the deposition pattern of ESRB atomizers, enabling planning tools to optimize atomizer trajectories to meet several measures of quality, such as coating uniformity. In addition to the development of our models, we present experimental results used to evaluate our models, and verify the interaction between the deposition pattern, trajectory, and surface curvature...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing trajectory planning tools for the automotive painting industry. The geometric complexity of automotive surfaces and {{the complexity of the}} spray patterns produced by modern paint atomizers combine to make this a challenging and interesting problem. This paper documents our efforts to develop computationally tractable analytic deposition models for electrostatic <b>rotating</b> bell (ESRB) <b>atomizers,</b> which have recently become widely used in the automotive painting industry. The models presented in this paper account for both the effects of surface curvature as well as the deposition pattern of ESRB atomizers in a computationally tractable form, enabling the development of automated trajectory generation tools. We present experimental results used to develop and validate the models, and verify the interaction between the deposition pattern, the atomizer trajectory, and the surface curvature. Limitations of the deposition model with respect to predictions of paint deposition on highly curved surfaces are discussed. Note to Practitioners—The empirical paint deposition models developed herein, which are fit to experimental data, offer a significant improvement over models that are typically used in industrial robot simulations. The improved simulation results come without the computational cost and complexity of finite element methods. The models could be incorporated, as is, into existing industrial simulation tools, provided the users are cognizant of the model limitations with respect to highly curved surfaces. Although the models are based on readily available information, incorporating the models into existing robot simulation software would likely require support from the software vendor...|$|R
