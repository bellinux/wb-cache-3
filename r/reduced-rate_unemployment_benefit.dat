40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} finds correlations between unemployment and health. This {{raises the question of}} whether <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> programs, which aim to alleviate financial stress associated with job loss, have their own health effects. Although existing studies indicate that receiving <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> is likely protective for health, most studies do not account for the potentially endogenous relationship between <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt and individual characteristics. Since not all unemployed people are eligible for, or receive <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits,</b> estimates of the health effects of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> may be biased. This thesis aims to better understand whether <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> have a causal effect on health by taking advantage of quasi-experimental variations in <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> programs in the United States. In the first study, I investigate whether the presence of generous State <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> programs results in fewer suicides during labour market downturns. In the second study, I use longitudinal data to explore whether State <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> generosity buffers the impact of job loss on self-reported health. The third study examines whether <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> eligibility expansions lead to greater participation in physically active leisure. Lastly, I use an instrumental variables approach to estimate the self-reported health effects of receiving <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits.</b> Across all four studies, I consistently find evidence that <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> have a health promoting effect in the short-term: <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> are associated with lower suicide rates, better self-reported health and increased physical activity. While the precise mechanisms remain uncertain, I argue that <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> may positively affect health by subsidizing income and leisure time, both of which can be beneficial for physical and mental health. Although <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> are unlikely to be a costeffective approach to improve health, the results indicate that policymaker efforts to reduce or limit access to <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> may lead to unanticipated adverse health effects...|$|R

However, if the <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> system is net Bismarckian then the unemployment rate does not depend on how the system is financed. Besides, in a Beveridgean system the labor tax composition does not affect the unemployment rate if and only if the unemployed do not pay taxes and the employed pay a constant marginal tax rate.

40|$|It {{has become}} a {{conventional}} wisdom in economic policy debate {{that in order to}} minimise adverse effects on employment, <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> should decrease with the unemployment spell. This paper, using a series of simple search models, shows that the theoretical result regarding the optimality of a declining <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> profile is largely a result of specific modeling assumptions and fails to hold in a more general setting. While any pure reduction of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> always improves employment, a redistribution of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> from the long-term unemployment in favour of the short-term unemployed can either increase or decrease <b>unemployment</b> and <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> expenditure.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes on {{individual}} productivity. We created employment and unemployment {{in the field and}} compared workers' productivity under no <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> to productivity under two different unemployment schemes. In one scheme, the unemployed received an unconditional monetary transfer. In the other, the monetary transfer was obtained conditional on the unemployed spending some time on an ancillary activity. Our results challenge the standard economic theory prediction that <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits,</b> especially unconditional compensations, hinder workers' effort. We find that workers employed under the unconditional scheme are more productive than workers under the conditional one, and both schemes make workers more productive than having no <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit.</b> We discuss two possible explanations for our results based on reciprocity and differential psychological costs of <b>unemployment</b> across <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, {{institutional}} changes put {{even more}} pressure on the unemployed in general, and they additionally abolish special treatments in favor of older people. The present German system of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> consists of status-oriented <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> I (UB I) financed by the unemployment insurance and a means-tested tax-based <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> II (UB II) financed by federal taxes. The new design of the <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> {{was one of the}} main results of the so-called “Hartz-reforms” which took place in the period between 2002 and 2005. The level of social protection became less generous especially for long-term unemployed. In 2004, the duration of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> for older workers was reduced from a maximum of 32 months to a maximum of 18 months. Before this reform the entry rate in unemployment grew considerably while it decreased after the reform has been implemented (Dlugosz et al. 2009).|$|R

The concern when deciding on unemployment is the possible effect of raising <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits</b> on those who receive them. This consideration by the government seemed to make some people feel settled while unemployed. The question then is, does the <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit</b> really lead them deciding to put off looking for work and thus keep the unemployment rate high?
