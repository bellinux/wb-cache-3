40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} dissemination of nutritional knowledge in textbooks of household schools between 1890 and 1940. It starts by considering the nature of food <b>recommendations</b> in <b>manuals</b> {{that are used in}} Belgian household schools, and then deals with the sources that are referred to by those who give food advice, comparing the latter to {{the state of the art}} of nutritional knowledge. If, prior to 1925, school manuals referred to working-class households, paid attention to abundant and economical food, recommended meat, hardly cared about breakfast and connected food to health in a general way, the manuals of the late 1920 s and 1930 s discussed the average consumer, advised limited meat consumption, warned against unbalanced diets that could lead to specific diseases and recommended required amounts of calories and vitamins. Textbook authors rarely referred to their sources – and if they did, international names were hardly mentioned – which raises the question of the value of the information in these textbooks. Yet from the late 1920 s onwards, more direct references were made to science and researchers, which may be linked to the strengthening of scientific authority within society...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} income and other variables on the demand for residential domestic service in London in 1901 and presents the first estimated model of the demand for residential service known to the author. It uses previously unexploited data consisting of the incomes and household details of some 500 civil servants. An extension of Becker's model of household production is set out and an ordered probit statistical model of servant demand is estimated. The results confirm the importance of income but also show that the demographic composition of the household was of significance. These results are interpreted in terms of age- and gender-related differences in the supply of labour {{and the demand for}} market goods. The results are consistent with the view that middle-class Edwardian households should be understood as sites of production as well as consumption. A comparison of the statistical results with contemporary <b>recommendations</b> in <b>manuals</b> of household management suggests that those recommendations were typically over-optimistic.

When the lifting height is increased, the intra-abdominal pressure produced relatively goes up. Also, the combination of symmetrical stoop posture, waist-belt use, and inspiration and holding at the same time is the most efficient in carrying out lifting tasks. Simultaneously, the research discovers that for any posture, the volume of the intra-abdominal pressure is much bigger when using the waist-belt compared to when it is not used.

Consideration of these factors {{was an integral part of}} the development of the manual which progressed in four steps: seek opinions of frozen fruit and vegetable industrial professionals, literature search, development of the manual, and analysis. A ten member expert panel comprised of five industrial personnel and five related and regulatory personnel evaluated the contents of the manual by use of a questionnaire. Panel members expressed their interest in the cleaning, sanitation, and inspection section of the manual. Responses from the panel indicated that the manual would serve as a useful industrial tool. The Student "t" test was used to determine if significant differences existed between response means of the industrial and related professional expert panel members. No significant differences were found between group members for the two major sections of the manual; the Physical Aspects of the Plant, and Training. A significant difference in response means was noted for the section, Microbiology of Frozen Foods, where industrial personnel rated the section higher than did related personnel. This indicated that industry felt it was more important to include the section than did the related professionals.

In implementing the WFD in Sweden expert knowledge in areas relating to the WFD was much needed resulting in establishment of national water management authorities, as the five water authorities, boarded in appointed county administrative boards across the country. As much noted in literature, uncertainties appear when implementing the WFD. Previous literature,with the exception of e. g.

There are also few studies in Sweden, such as Gipperth & Elmgren (2010), Hammer et al (2011) and Entson & Gipperth(2010), touching upon the subject although not entirely focusing on practical experiences of uncertainty.
