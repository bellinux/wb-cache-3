40|$|A microshutter array (MSA) {{has been}} {{developed}} for use as an aperture array for multi-object selections in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) technology. Light shields, molybdenum nitride (MoN) coating on shutters, and aluminum/aluminum oxide coatings on interior walls are put on each shutter for light leak prevention, and to enhance optical contrast. Individual shutters are patterned with a torsion flexure that permits shutters to open 90 deg. with a minimized mechanical stress concentration. The shutters are actuated magnetically, latched, and addressed electrostatically. Also, micromechanical features are tailored onto individual shutters to prevent stiction. An individual shutter consists of a torsion hinge, a shutter blade, a front electrode that is coated on the shutter blade, a backside electrode that is coated on the interior walls, and a magnetic cobalt-iron coating. The magnetic coating is patterned into stripes on microshutters so that shutters can respond to an external magnetic field for the magnetic actuation. A set of column electrodes is placed on top of shutters, {{and a set of}} <b>row</b> <b>electrodes</b> on sidewalls is underneath the shutters {{so that they can be}} electrostatically latched open. A linear permanent magnet is aligned with the shutter rows and is positioned above a flipped upside-down array, and sweeps across the array in a direction parallel to shutter columns. As the magnet sweeps across the array, sequential rows of shutters are rotated from their natural horizontal orientation to a vertical open position, where they approach vertical electrodes on the sidewalls. When the electrodes are biased with a sufficient electrostatic force to overcome the mechanical restoring force of torsion bars, shutters remain latched to vertical electrodes in their open state. When the bias is removed, or is insufficient, the shutters return to their horizontal, closed positions. To release a shutter, both the electrode on the shutter and the one on the back wall where the shutter sits are grounded. The shutters with one or both ungrounded electrodes are held open. Sub-micron bumps underneath light shields and silicon ribs on back walls are the two features to prevent stiction. These features ensure that the microshutter array functions properly in mechanical motions. The MSA technology can be used primarily in multi-object imaging and spectroscopy, photomask generation, light switches, and in the stepper equipment used to make integrated circuits and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) devices...|$|E

40|$|Sardinia has to {{deal with}} {{significant}} environmental problems related to heavy-metal contamination, mainly located at its abandoned mining districts. In particular, acid mine drainage management and groundwater pollution are typical problems associated with mining activities which constitute a serious threat to human health. To prevent contaminant spread over the adjacent environment, it is of great interest to consider using an electric field as a containment fence to counteract pollutant transport. In this application, contaminant transport due to a hydraulic gradient driving force is prevented by the combined effect of electro-osmosis and electro-migration. Although there are other alternative containment technologies, the electrokinetic fence offers many advantages, as it is easy to operate, there is a minimal exposure to the operating personnel and {{it is likely to be}} effective for a wide range of contaminants. In this work, both one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) tests have been carried out. In the 1 D tests, the efficiency of an electrokinetic barrier to prevent cadmium from polluting an uncontaminated sample was investigated; soil pH, metal concentration and current intensity have been monitored; results indicate that the barrier can prevent or significantly reduce heavy-metal contamination from spreading against a hydraulic gradient of 7.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested {{that the field}} of a premature (S 2) stimulus, interacting with relatively refractory tissue, can create unidirectional block and reentry {{in the absence of}} nonuniform dispersion of recovery.

S 1 pacing from a <b>row</b> of <b>electrodes</b> {{on one side of the}} mapped area generated parallel activation isochrones followed by uniform parallel isorecovery lines. Cathodal S 2 shocks of 25 to 250 V lasting 3 ms were delivered from a mesh electrode along one side of the mapped area to scan the recovery period, creating isogradient electric field lines perpendicular to the isorecovery lines. Circus reentry was created following S 2 stimulation; initial conduction was distant from the S 2 site and spread towards more refractory tissue. Reentry was clockwise for right S 1 (near the septum) with top S 2 (near the pulmonary valve) and for left S 1 with bottom S 2; and counterclockwise for right S 1 with bottom S 2 and left S 1 with top S 2. The center of the reentrant circuit for all S 2 voltages and coupling intervals occurred at potential gradients of 5. 1 +/- 0. 6 V/cm (mean +/- standard deviation) and at preshock intervals 1 +/- 3 ms longer than refractory periods determined locally for a 2 mA stimulus. Thus, when S 2 field strengths and tissue refractoriness are uniformally dispersed at an angle to each other, circus reentry occurs around a "critical point" where an S 2 field of approximately 5 V/cm intersects tissue approximately at the end of its refractory period...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} reorganization in cuneate nucleus (CN) {{in juvenile}} rat following forelimb amputation (n= 34) and in intact controls (n= 5) {{to determine whether}} CN forms a substrate for large-scale reorganization in forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) cortex. New input from the shoulder first appears in the FBS 4 weeks after amputation, and by 6 weeks, the new shoulder input comes to occupy most of the FBS. Electrophysiological recording was used to map CN in controls and in forelimb amputees during the first 12 weeks following deafferentation and at 26 and 30 weeks post-amputation. Mapping was confined to a location 300 μm anterior to the obex where a medial-to-lateral <b>row</b> of <b>electrode</b> penetrations traversed through a complete complement of cytochrome-oxidase stained clusters (called barrelettes) {{that are associated with}} the representation of the glabrous forepaw digits and pads and adjacent non-cluster zones that are associated with the representation of the wrist, arm, and shoulder. Following amputation, non-cluster zones became occupied with new input from the body/chest and head/neck, while the cluster zone remained largely devoid of new input except at the border. A regression analysis comparing controls and amputees over the first 12 weeks post-amputation found significant differences for the total area of new input from the body/chest and head/neck in the non-cluster zones, while {{no significant differences were found}} for any new input into the cluster zone. When the averaged areas of a body-part representation were re-examined as a percentage of the averaged zonal area, a non-significant increase in new input from the body was observed within the cluster zone during post-amputation weeks 2 – 3 that returned to baseline in the subsequent weeks. In contrast, significant differences in averaged area of body-part representations for body/chest and head/neck were found in non-cluster zones over the first 12 weeks post-amputation. The present findings suggest that reorganization occurs only within the non-cluster zones whereby new input from the body/chest and head/neck moves in and occupies the deafferented territory immediately after amputation. Additionally, the lack of significant differences in new shoulder input in either cluster or non-cluster zones over the first 12 weeks after amputation suggests that CN provides an unlikely substrate for large-scale reorganization in the FBS...|$|R
40|$|Background. As {{interest}} on wearable computing [1] increases, researchers {{are looking for}} new materials {{to use as a}} support for electronics. A fabric substrate is very appealing: it is elastic and extensible [2], supported by a well known technology and produced at low-cost. State of the art. Some smart pressure-sensors interfacing with a flexible substrate have been developed, but they are either based on electro-optical fabric ([3]) which is not suitable for the low cost market, or they need expensive and cumbersome PCB electronics ([4]). Our contribution. This paper introduces an approach for decoding the pressure information exerted over a broad piece of fabric by means of capacitive sensing. The system is composed of a distributed passive array of capacitors (i. e. an array where no active elements like transistors are involved), whose capacitance varies according to the pressure exerted over a surface, as well as an electronic system that collects and computes the subsequent capacitance variations. Capacitors can be realized in different ways, though, in our demonstrator they have been implemented between rows and columns of conductive fibers patterned on the two opposite sides of an elastic synthetic foam. When the dielectric layer between a given <b>row</b> and column <b>electrodes</b> is squeezed, as a pressure is exerted over the corresponding fabric area, the coupling capacitance between the two is increased.

40|$|A {{next-generation}} microshutter array, LArge Microshutter Array (LAMA), {{was developed}} as a multi-object field selector. LAMA consists of small-scaled microshutter arrays that can be combined to form large-scale microshutter array mosaics. Microshutter actuation is accomplished via electrostatic attraction between the shutter and a counter electrode, and 2 D addressing {{can be accomplished by}} applying an electrostatic potential between a row of shutters and a column, orthogonal to the <b>row,</b> of counter <b>electrodes.</b> Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology is used to fabricate the microshutter arrays. The main feature of the microshutter device is to use a set of standard surface micromachining processes for device fabrication. Electrostatic actuation is used to eliminate the need for macromechanical magnet actuating components. A simplified electrostatic actuation with no macro components (e. g. moving magnets) required for actuation and latching of the shutters will make the microshutter arrays robust and less prone to mechanical failure. Smaller-size individual arrays will help to increase the yield and thus reduce the cost and improve robustness of the fabrication process. Reducing the size of the individual shutter array to about one square inch and building the large-scale mosaics by tiling these smaller-size arrays would further help to reduce the cost of the device due to the higher yield of smaller devices. The LAMA development is based on prior experience acquired while developing microshutter arrays for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), but it will have different features. The LAMA modular design permits large-format mosaicking to cover a field of view at least 50 times larger than JWST MSA. The LAMA electrostatic, instead of magnetic, actuation enables operation cycles at least 100 times faster and a mass significantly smaller compared to JWST MSA. Also, standard surface micromachining technology will simplify the fabrication process, increasing yield and reducing cost...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{final report}} of the project DANTEQ (2010 - 2015). Through this project new {{competence}} and new methods for optimal handling of whitefish onboard with respect to raw material quality and energy efficiency have been developed. The project was divided into four research areas; (1) catch handling, (2) chilling and freezing, (3) energy systems and (4) modelling. The main results are given below: Short time live storage of fish befare killing: When towing times are short and catches are small a survival of 50 - 80 % was found for cod (density of fish in the storage tank varied from 120 to 550 kg/m 3). The fishing depth has influence on survival rate. The stress level of the fish was lower straight after catch than after storage in live holding tanks onboard (not always significant differences). Less blood was found in fillets from live stored fish and fish processed straight after catch compared to commercial processed fish. Electro stunning of fish: Voltage of 40 V DC is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilizing and easier handling of catch in connection with further processing (bleeding/gutting/heading) for cod, haddock and saithe. Three <b>rows</b> of <b>electrodes</b> on the stunner (current load for 4 - 6 seconds) is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilization. Electro stunning of saithe lead to broken backbone and bloodspots on 10 to 40 % of the fish. Freezing of cod: Pre-rigor cod frozen in a magnetic field ((ell Alive System) achieved minimal differences in quality compared to traditional tunnel freezing and freezing in a cold room, in spite of different freezing rates. The mechanism for freezing of fish in magnetic field appeared {{to be similar to}} that of traditional freezing methods. Chilling of cod and haddock: Fish stored in slurry had a different microstructure and different water distribution, measured by low field NMR, than those stored in flake ice. Differences in colour and QIM­score were found for haddock stored under the two conditions. Logging of operational data: Software for acquisition and storage of operational data has been developed. Systems for acquisition and storage of operational data, as well as transfer of the data to an on-shore server, have been installed on-board two trawlers. Software for efficient analysis of operational data has been developed and used to generate operational profiles. Model development: Methods and models for simulating catch handling processes have been developed, along with proof-of-concept software that demonstrates their practical use. Discrete event simulation seems to be a very suitable method for 5 imulating and evaluating fish processing lines, though more work needs to be done with regards to model quality and validation. Acquiring high-quality data about catch handling processes for modelling purposes is difficult and labour-intensive. Future experiments should be designed to focus more on individual processes and less on the whole line, and should aim to keep better track of the "human factors" that add noise and affect the outcome...|$|R
40|$|Subdural {{recordings}} from 8 patients via <b>rows</b> {{of eight}} <b>electrodes</b> with either 5 or 10 mm spacing plus depth recordings from 3 patients {{with rows of}} 8 - 12 electrodes either 6. 5 or 9 mm center-to-center were searched for signs of significant local differentiation of coherence calculated between all possible pairs of loci. EEG samples of 2 - 4 min were taken during four states: alertness, stage 2 - 3 sleep, light surgical anesthesia permitting the patient to respond to questions or commands, and electrical seizures. Coherence was computed for all frequencies from 1 - 50 Hz or 0. 3 - 100 Hz and then compared for 6 or 7 narrower bands between 2 and 70 Hz. In both the subdural surface samples and those from temporal lobe depth electrode arrays coherence declines with distance between electrodes of the pair, on the average. This is nearly {{the same for all}} frequency bands. Whether computed for 5, 20 or 60 s epochs, coherence pooled across all pairs of a given separation, in a given subject, differs only slightly, in the direction of lower coherence for longer samples, indicating good stationarity of the samples chosen. For middle bands like 8 - 13 and 13 - 20 Hz, mean coherence typically declines most steeply in the first 10 mm, from values indistinguishable from 1. 0 at < 0. 5 mm distance to 0. 5 at 5 - 10 mm and to 0. 25 in another 10 - 20 mm in the subdural surface data. Temporal lobe depth estimates decline ca. half as fast; coherence 0. 5 extends for 9 - 20 mm and 0. 25 for another 20 - 35 mm. Low frequency bands (1 - 5, 5 - 8 Hz) usually fall slightly more slowly than high frequency bands (20 - 35, 35 - 50 Hz) but the difference is small and variance large. The steepness of decline with distance in humans is significantly but only slightly smaller than that we reported earlier for the rabbit and rat, averaging < one half. Local coherence, for individual pairs of loci, shows differentiation in the millimeter range, i. e. nearest neighbor pairs may be locally well above or below average and this is sustained over minutes. Local highs and lows tend to be similar for widely different frequency bands. Coherence varies quite independently of power, although they are sometimes correlated. Regional differentiation is statistically significant in average coherence among pairs of loci on temporal vs frontal cortex or lateral frontal vs subfrontal strips in the same patient, but such differences are usually small. We could not test how consistent they are over hours or between patients. Differences between left and right hemispheres, whether symmetrical pairs or pooled from two or more lobes on each side, can be quite large; in our patients the right side is usually higher, especially in the waking state. Brain state has a large influence. Slow wave sleep usually shows slightly more coherence at each distance, in all bands, compared to the waking EEG, but not consistently. Coherence at a given distance or its rate of decline with distance is a more direct measure of synchrony than naked-eye "synchronization," which is dominated by the power spectrum. Among the range of EEG states classified as seizures, coherence varies widely but averages higher by 0. 05 - 0. 2 than in pre-ictal states, usually in all frequencies when computed over the whole seizure but much more in the higher bands {{during the height of the}} electrical paroxysm. The findings point to still finer structure and more variance with closer spacing of electrodes. They could not predict the known large scale coherence between scalp electrodes, but are not in conflict with them. Scalp recording blurs the finer spatial structure, but reveals macrostructure missed by subdural and depth recording with limited numbers of channels. The strong tendency for correlated fluctuations across frequency bands is contrary to expectation from the common model of independent oscillators...|$|R
