40|$|AbstractRegulators, {{industry}} and other stakeholders {{will need to}} {{have confidence in the}} predictions made by risk assessment studies for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) activities. To gain such confidence {{it will be necessary to}} understand the different approaches available for risk assessments and the underlying assumptions. This led to the establishment of the IEA GHG Risk Assessment network in 2005. The purpose of the network is to bring together the key groups wo rking on risk assessment for CO 2 storage from around the world and to address what the regulators are expecting in regard to CCS assurance and whether risk assessment can provide the answers they require. At the launch meeting, it was agreed that the network should aim to address the expectations of regulators, and determine whether risk assessment can satisfy these expectations. The scope of the network was divided into separate areas of interest; data management and risk analysis, regulatory engagement, an d environmental impacts. Corresponding working groups focus on these issues, running alongside the research network, and report back to the whole group at the network meetings. Network activities include overviews of other related international research activities that may impact on the risk assessment network, such as the IEA GHG wellbore integrity network, provision of feedback to the working groups, reviewing risk assessment status using case studies, assessing the role of risk assessment in a <b>risk</b> <b>man</b> agement framework and determining communication strategies for results of risk assessment studies. Site characterisation was identified as an element of CCS that was heavily reliant on risk assessment, and risk assessment plays an important role in all stages of site characterisation and selection from the initial pre-screening to permitting and implementation. Natural analogues have been identified as a means of instilling confidence in CCS by generating a better understanding of leakage and trapping mecha nisms, providing verification of numerical models, and helping to communicate the safety of CO 2 storage. The network has also raised the questions of the role of risk assessment guidelines in CCS, the confidence that can be felt in numerical modelling results, the length of time monitoring programmes are required for after injection has stopped, and what value does the accident/worst case scenario hold for risk assessment. The future work for the network will be maintaining the individual working groups, and continuing to monit demonstration projects as these will provide valuable information to support numerical models and verify t worthiness of studies on analogues...|$|E

40|$|Women’s sexual {{decision}} making is a complex process balancing the potential rewards of conception and pleasure against the risks of possible low paternal care or sexually transmitted infection. Although neural processes underlying social {{decision making}} are suggested to overlap with those involved in economic decision making, the neural systems associated with women’s sexual decision making are unknown. Using fMRI, we measured the brain activation of 12 women while they viewed photos of men’s faces. Face stimuli were accompanied by information regarding each man’s potential risk as a sexual partner, indicated by a written description of the man’s number of previous sexual partners and frequency of condom use. Participants were asked to evaluate how likely they {{would be to have}} sex with the man depicted. Women reported that they {{would be more likely to}} have sex with low compared to high <b>risk</b> <b>men.</b> Stimuli depicting low <b>risk</b> <b>men</b> also elicited stronger activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), midbrain, and intraparietal sulcus, possibly reflecting an influence of sexual risk on women’s attraction, arousal, and attention during their sexual decision making. Activation in the ACC was positively correlated with women’s subjective evaluations of sex likelihood and response times during their evaluations of high, but not low, <b>risk</b> <b>men.</b> These findings provide evidence that neural systems involved in sexual decision making in women overlap with those described previously to underlie nonsexual decision making. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which differences in <b>risk</b> preferences between <b>men</b> and women explain why women have a lower entrepreneurship rate, earn less, and work fewer hours than men. � Data from the NLSY 79 confirms previous findings that women are more <b>risk</b> averse than <b>men.</b> �However, while less <b>risk</b> averse <b>men</b> tend to become self-employed and more <b>risk</b> averse <b>men</b> are likely to choose paid-employment, there is no significant effect of risk preferences on women’s entrepreneurship decisions. � Similarly, more risk aversion is associated with higher earnings for male entrepreneurs, but it has no effect on female entrepreneurial earnings. Rising rates of risk aversion lower earnings for women, consistent with theoretical effects of risk preferences on labor earnings, but the effects are of modest magnitude. � Risk preferences do not explain variation in hours of work for either men or women. � These findings suggest that widely reported differences in risk preferences across genders play only a trivial role in explaining differences in labor market outcomes between <b>men</b> and women. <b>risk</b> aversion; earnings; labor supply; gender gap; self-employment; Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Multiple DNA {{sequence}} variants in {{the form}} of single-nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) {{have been found to be}} reproducibly associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk. METHODS. Absolute risk for PCa among men with various numbers of inherited risk alleles and family history of PCa was estimated in a population-based case–control study in Sweden (2, 893 cases and 1, 781 controls), and a nested case–control study from the Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial in the U. S. (1, 172 cases and 1, 157 controls). RESULTS. Increased number of risk alleles and positive family history were independently associated with PCa <b>risk.</b> Considering <b>men</b> with 11 <b>risk</b> alleles (mode) and negative family history as having baseline <b>risk,</b> <b>men</b> who had 14 risk alleles and positive family history had an odds ratio (OR) of 4. 92 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 64 – 6. 64] in the Swedish study. These associations were confirmed in the U. S. population. Once a man’s SNP genotypes and family history are known, his absolute risk for PCa can be readily calculated and easily interpreted.

The author describes how a group of Zambian men learnt sex and gender and highlights the importance of the peer group in constructions of masculinity.

He argues that many expressions of masculinity are best understood as fragile entities and that this fragility, inculcated in childhood and adolescence, explains, in part, the <b>risks</b> <b>men</b> may take in their sexual conduct in spite of the threat of HIV/AIDS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{investigated}} the prognostic significance of exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia in both {{high and low}} <b>risk</b> <b>men</b> with no prior coronary heart disease (CHD). BACKGROUNDSilent ischemia predicts future coronary events in patients with CHD, {{but there is little}} evidence of its prognostic significance in subjects free of CHD. METHODSWe {{investigated the}} association of silent ischemia, as defined by ST depression during and after maximal symptom-limited exercise test, with coronary risk in a population-based sample of men with no prior CHD followed for 10 years on average. RESULTSSilent ischemia during exercise was associated with a 5. 9 -fold (95 % CI 2. 3 to 11. 8) CHD mortality in smokers, 3. 8 -fold (95 % CI 1. 9 to 7. 9) in hypercholesterolemic men and 4. 7 -fold (95 % CI 2. 4 to 9. 1) in hypertensive men adjusting for other risk factors. The respective relative risks (RRs) of any acute coronary event were 3. 0 (95 % CI 1. 7 to 5. 1), 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 3. 1) and 2. 2 (95 % CI 1. 4 to 3. 5). These associations were weaker in <b>men</b> without these <b>risk</b> factors. Furthermore, silent ischemia after exercise was a stronger predictor for the risk of acute coronary events and CHD death in smokers and in hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive men than in <b>men</b> without <b>risk</b> factors. CONCLUSIONSExercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia was a strong predictor of CHD in men with any conventional risk factor, emphasizing the importance of exercise testing to identify asymptomatic high <b>risk</b> <b>men</b> who could benefit from risk reduction and preventive measures...|$|R
