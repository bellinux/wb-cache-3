First, the loudness functions of speech and three types of artificial speech having an equispectrum to speech were compared. The slight deviation was noticed but the tendency was nearly similar. Secondly, the measurements of the <b>reference</b> <b>equivalent</b> on the typical transmission system were made. The differences of the measured values for speech and artificial speech were within about 2 dB on the average, and for the statistical analysis of the dispersion on these values the differences due to signals were no significant.

DESIGN : The investigation comprised three studies. Study 1 evaluated calibration accuracy across four Samsung S 5301 smartphones (Android v 4. 0. 4) using commercial Sennheiser HD 202 headphones. Study 2 involved referencing smartphone microphone sensitivity to narrowband noise intensity as measured in octave bands by a sound-level meter between 30 and 75 dB SPL (5 dB increments). Study 3 compared screening outcomes of smartphone based and conventional hearing screening. STUDY SAMPLE : Study 2 : 15 normal-hearing subjects (age range, 18 – 22 years; all female). Study 3 : 162 children (324 ears) aged 5 to 7 years. RESULTS : Smartphone calibration at 20, 30, and 40 dB was within 1 dB of recommended <b>reference</b> <b>equivalent</b> thresholds levels. Microphone calibration for noise monitoring had maximum variability across phones of 0. 9, 0. 6, and 2. 9 dB at 1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively, from reference intensities (30 to 75 dB SPL). Screening outcomes demonstrated no signifi cant difference between smartphone and conventional audiometry with an overall referral rate of 4. 3 % and 3. 7 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS : The newly developed smartphone application can be accurately calibrated for audiometry with valid real-time noise monitoring, and clinical results are comparable to conventional screening.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : This report {{presents}} {{data from}} four studies to examine standard bone-conduction <b>reference</b> <b>equivalent</b> threshold force levels (RETFL), especially at 4 kHz where anomalous air-bone gaps are common. DESIGN : Data were mined from studies that obtained air- and bone-conduction thresholds from normal-hearing and {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SNHL) participants, using commercial audiometers and standard audiometric transducers. STUDY SAMPLE : There were 249 normal-hearing and 188 SNHL participants. RESULTS : (1) Normal-hearing participants had small air-bone gaps at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 kHz (- 1. 7 to 0. 3 dB) and larger air-bone gaps at 4 kHz (10. 6 dB). (2) SNHL participants had small air-bone gaps at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 kHz (- 0. 7 to 1. 7 dB) and a larger air-bone gap at 4 kHz (14. 1 dB). (3) The 4 -kHz air-bone gap grew with air-conduction threshold from 10. 1 dB when the air-conduction threshold was 5 - 10 dB HL to 21. 1 dB when the air-conduction threshold was greater than 60 dB. (4) With the 4 -kHz RETFL corrected by the average SNHL air-bone gap, the relationship between RETFL and frequency is linear with a slope of - 12 dB per octave. CONCLUSIONS : The 4 -kHz air-bone gaps for listeners with SNHL could be avoided by adjusting the 4 -kHz RETFL by - 14. 1 dB.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : This study {{examined}} the statistical properties of normal air-conduction thresholds obtained with automated and manual audiometry {{to test the hypothesis}} that thresholds are normally distributed and to examine the distributions for evidence of bias in manual testing. DESIGN : Four databases were mined for normal thresholds. One contained audiograms obtained with an automated method. The other three were obtained with manual audiometry. Frequency distributions were examined for four test frequencies (250, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). STUDY SAMPLE : The analysis is based on 317 569 threshold determinations of 80 547 subjects from four clinical databases. RESULTS : Frequency distributions of thresholds obtained with automated audiometry are normal in form. Corrected for age, the mean thresholds are within 1. 5 dB of <b>reference</b> <b>equivalent</b> threshold sound pressure levels. Frequency distributions of thresholds obtained by manual audiometry are shifted toward higher thresholds. Two of the three datasets obtained by manual audiometry are positively skewed. CONCLUSIONS : The positive shift and skew of the manual audiometry data may result from tester bias. The striking scarcity of thresholds below 0 dB HL suggests that audiologists place less importance on identifying low thresholds than they do for higher-level thresholds. We refer to this as the Good enough bias and suggest that it may be responsible for differences in distributions of thresholds obtained by automated and manual audiometry.

Early evolution of the Galaxy can effectively be studied by observing stars with low metallicity values since they are the oldest stars still visible. Due to the formation of the Galaxy, the oldest stars can predominantly be found in the halo and thick disk regions. G 2 0701 + 6247, G 2 0934 + 3614, and G 2 1540 + 3200 are the three stars selected from a survey of very metal-poor star candidates for high-resolution spectroscopy {{in order to determine the}} chemical composition and metallicity. Two standard very metal-poor stars, HD 88609 and HD 122563, were also chosen to compare to previous research to verify the methods used. Echelle spectra were collected by a spectrograph on the Mayall 4 -m telescope at the Kitt Peak Nation Observatory for each star in March 2010. The charge coupled device images are reduced using Image Reduction and Analysis Facility. Background noise from the equipement is eliminated using bias frames.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{apparent}} masking-level differences (MLDs) in users of bilateral bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) provide evidence of binaural hearing. However, there is considerably less acoustical isolation between the two ears with bone conduction (BC) compared to air conduction (AC). The apparent MLDs may have arisen, at least in part, from inter-cranial interference between signals arising from the two BAHAs (i. e. monaural effect). That might also explain some of the inter-individual variation in both the magnitude and the direction of the MLDs reported in BAHA users. The present study was composed of three experimental stages with the main aim to investigate the influence of interference in normal hearing participants by measuring masking level difference in AC and BC to explore the conditions contributing to the reported variation. An additional aim was to investigate the performance of a newly designed BC transducer; the balanced electromagnetic separation transducer (BEST), for bone conduction research as well as more general clinical use. Stage 1 evaluated the performance of the BEST in comparison to the clinically used RadioEar B 71 in a series of acoustical (sensitivity and harmonic distortion) and psychoacoustical (hearing thresholds and vibrotactile thresholds) measurements. The results from these studies led {{to the use of the}} BEST in the second and third stages because they produced significantly lower harmonic distortion at low frequencies (mainly 250 Hz). The psychoacoustic measurements alluded to the need to use different calibration values with the BESTs. Stage 2 was a preliminary investigation comparing the MLDs with standard bilateral configurations between the AC and BC in nine normal-hearing participants. Signals were pure tones at one of three frequencies (250, 500, 1000 Hz), presented via AC or BC. Broadband noise (100 - 5000 Hz) was always presented via AC at 70 dB SPL. Thresholds were estimated using a three-alternative forced choice procedure combined with an adaptive staircase. Transducers used were insert earphones and the BESTs for BC testing. The results from this stage showed a statistical significant difference between AC and BC MLDs at 250, 500 and 1000 Hz (mean difference is 9. 4, 6. 6 and 3. 5 dB respectively). Evidence of the change in the MLDs direction is observed at 250 Hz in three participants. Stage 3 consisted of the investigation of inter-cranial interference in eighteen normal hearing participants. This stage was composed of three main measurements. The first measurement compared the AC and BC MLDs at three test frequencies. The second measurement evaluated the transcranial attenuation (TA). The third measurement was the novel feature of the study it evaluated the monaural interference effect through the measurement of the diotic and dichotic conditions in one test ear. A significant discrepancy was found between the AC and BC MLDs of approximately 6, 1. 5 and 2. 5 dB at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz, respectively. The TA was found to be lower than 10 dB at the three test frequencies. Measurable MTLDs were reported in some of the participants, high inter-subject variability was observed in the direction of the MTLDs. The BEST can reliably replace the B 71 in clinical setup. Formal adjustment of the <b>reference</b> <b>equivalent</b> threshold force levels is advised. Binaural hearing was achieved through bilateral BC stimulation to a lesser magnitude compared to AC MLDs in normal hearing participants. The discrepancy between the AC and BC MLDs was reduced with the increase in the frequency. The discrepancy can partially be explained by the cross-talk of the signal in one ear. The results showed that in some participants the magnitude of the monaural tone level difference was similar to the magnitude of the BC MLD. Further investigation is recommended to investigate the association of the transcranial delay with the discrepancy between the AC and BC MLDs. This investigation also recommends the investigation of the AC and BC MLDs in patients fitted with bilateral BAHAs...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The EPA {{is proposing}} {{to revise the}} ambient air {{monitoring}} requirements for criteria pollutants. This proposal establishes ambient air monitoring requirements {{in support of the}} proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter published elsewhere in today’s Federal Register, including new minimum monitoring network requirements for PM 10 - 2. 5 and criteria for approval of Federal <b>reference</b> and <b>equivalent</b> methods for PM 10 - 2. 5 (to supplement the Federal reference method for PM 10 - 2. 5 proposed elsewhere in today’s Federal Register). This proposal also requires each State to operate one to three monitoring stations that take an integrated, multipollutant approach to ambient air monitoring. The proposed amendments modify the requirements for ambient air monitors by focusing requirements on populated areas with air quality problems and significantly reducing the requirements for criteria pollutant monitors that have measured ambient air concentrations well below the applicable NAAQS. Other proposed amendments revise the requirements for <b>reference</b> and <b>equivalent</b> method determinations (including specifications and test procedures) for fine particulate monitors, monitoring network descriptions and periodic assessments, quality assurance, and data certification. The purpose of the proposed amendments is to enhance ambient air quality monitoring to better serve current and future air quality management and research needs.
