25|$|Taíno {{groups in}} the more {{developed}} islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important root crops, such as the staple yuca, were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called conucos. This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique. Typically, conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows. The primary <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> was yuca/cassava, a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy tuberous root. It was planted using a coa, a kind of hoe made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread. Batata (sweet potato) was the next most important <b>root</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parsley grows best in moist, well-drained soil, {{with full}} sun. It grows best between , and usually is grown from seed. Germination is slow, taking {{four to six}} weeks, and it often is {{difficult}} because of furanocoumarins in its seed coat. Typically, plants grown for the leaf crop are spaced 10cm apart, while those grown as a <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> are spaced 20cm apart {{to allow for the}} root development.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{breeding}} grounds were initially at Newton-le-Willows but moved to Acton Grange, {{two and a}} half miles south west of Warrington before settling in about 1930 at Little Leigh near Northwich in Cheshire. A seed development farm was located in Essex, and <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> trials were located on farms in the north of England and in Scotland. Traditionally groups of farmers were invited in mid-summer to inspect the {{plant breeding}} grounds and be entertained by the Company.|$|E

25|$|The Ifugao people {{practice}} traditional farming {{spending most}} of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation. The Ifugaos have also been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao’s rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped {{the lives of the}} community members.|$|E
25|$|Nicaragua is {{primarily}} an agricultural country; agriculture constitutes 60% {{of its total}} exports which annually yield approximately US $300 million. Nearly two-thirds of the coffee crop comes from {{the northern part of}} the central highlands, in the area north and east of the town of Estelí. Soil erosion and pollution from the heavy use of pesticides have become serious concerns in the cotton district. Yields and exports have both been declining since 1985. Today most of Nicaragua's bananas are grown in the northwestern part of the country near the port of Corinto; sugarcane is also grown in the same district. Cassava, a <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> somewhat similar to the potato, is an important food in tropical regions. Cassava is also the main ingredient in tapioca pudding. Nicaragua's agricultural sector has benefited because of the country's strong ties to Venezuela. It is estimated that Venezuela will import approximately $200 million in agricultural goods. In the 1990s, the government initiated efforts to diversify agriculture. Some of the new export-oriented crops were peanuts, sesame, melons, and onions.|$|E
500|$|Sugar beet {{became a}} major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. It is a {{biennial}} plant, a cultivated variety of Beta vulgaris in the family Amaranthaceae, the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant. Here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion. Milk of lime is added to the raw juice [...] and carbonatated in a number of stages in order to purify it. Water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum. The syrup is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The white sugar that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried. It requires no further refining.|$|E

500|$|Joni's {{impact on}} Fiji was {{generally}} {{confined to the}} Western Division, with the islands of Yasawa, Mamanuca, Viti Levu, Kadavu and Vatulele being the worst affected areas. The system caused high seas and widespread flooding including in several rivers on Viti Levu, {{which led to a}} substantial loss of livestock. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} system a total of ten people were left missing, including a group of three fishermen in the Yasawa Islands. A group of three females on a fishing trip also went missing and were later found on an offshore island. A search party of four men went missing off Vanua Levu, while looking for the women, however, one swam ashore, while the other three were picked up by a cargo ship. Parts of Fiji's main cities of Suva, Nadi, and Lautoka were left without power, as falling trees brought down power lines. The Fijian Government reported that coconut plantations had been extensively damaged and that there was limited communications with the Western Division. Despite Joni's eye passing directly over Kadavu during December 11, the damage on the island was limited to wave induced coastal erosion, <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> damage and the loss of a few trees. The system passed near the wave rider station on the island, which recorded a peak wave height of about [...] as Joni made its closest point of approach. During December 12, an army helicopter was deployed to conduct a damage survey of offshore islands. A total of six people were subsequently arrested in Suva and Nadi on December 14, in relation to a series of burglaries, committed during power blackouts caused by the cyclone. Joni's damage in both Tuvalu and Fiji was exacerbated a month later, by Severe Tropical Cyclones Nina and Kina interacting with each other.|$|E
