40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} self-tuned criticality as a general mechanism for signal detection in sensory systems. In the case of hearing, we argue that active amplification of faint sounds is provided by a dynamical system that is maintained {{at the threshold of}} an oscillatory instability. This concept can account for the exquisite sensitivity of the auditory system and its wide dynamic range as well as its capacity to respond selectively to different frequencies. A specific model of sound detection by the hair cells of the inner ear is discussed. We show that a collection of motor proteins within a hair bundle can generate oscillations at a frequency that depends on the elastic properties of the bundle. Simple variation of bundle geometry gives rise to hair cells with characteristic frequencies that span the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>audibility.</b> Tension-gated transduction channels, which primarily serve to detect the motion of a hair bundle, also tune each cell by admitting ions that regulate the motor protein activity. By controlling the bundle's propensity to oscillate, this feedback automatically maintains the system in the operating regime where it is most sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli. The model explains how hair cells can detect sounds that carry less energy than the background noise...|$|E
40|$|A single phase, 440 VRMS, 20 kHz power {{distribution}} system with a regulated sinusoidal wave form is discussed. A single phase power system minimizes the wiring, sensing, and control complexities required in a multi-sourced redundantly distributed power system. The single phase addresses only the distribution link; mulitphase lower frequency inputs and outputs accommodation techniques are described. While the 440 V operating potential was initially selected for aircraft operating below 50, 000 ft, this potential also appears suitable for space power systems. This voltage choice recognizes a reasonable upper limit for semiconductor ratings, yet will direct synthesis of 220 V, 3 power. A 20 kHz operating frequency was selected to be above the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>audibility,</b> minimize the weight of reactive components, yet allow the construction of single power stages of 25 to 30 kW. The regulated sinusoidal distribution system has several advantages. With a regulated voltage, most ac/dc conversions involve rather simple transformer rectifier applications. A sinusoidal distribution system, when {{used in conjunction with}} zero crossing switching, represents a minimal source of EMI. The present state of 20 kHz power technology includes computer controls of voltage and/or frequency, low inductance cable, current limiting circuit protection, bi-directional power flow, and motor/generator operating using standard induction machines.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out for 5 listeners with a cochlear implant, 2 male and 3 female at implantation age 13 – 62 years. The deafness for 4 subjects was recognized as postlingual and for 1 – as perilingual. All listeners were using the hearing aid on the opposite ear to the implant. The speech intelligibility was determined in two cases: when transmission was only via the implant and when the hearing aid was also used. Additionally, the ability of discrimination {{of male and female}} voices was performed. The presentation of tests was conducted for three angles (0 ◦, − 90 ◦ and+ 90 ◦) in relation to the listener’s head for the levels equal to 50, 65 and 80 dB SPL. The Polish monosyllabic word tests (PRUSZEWICZ et al., [4]) were applied. The improvement of the speech intelligibility was affirmed when the process of hearing via the implant was supported with a hearing aid.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sufficient perceptual cues used in the recognition of four voiceless fricative consonants [s, f,, f] followed by the same vowel [i:] in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adult listeners. Subjects identified the four CV speech tokens in a closed-set response task across a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> presentation levels. Fricative syllables were either produced by a human speaker in the natural stimulus set, or generated by a computer program in the synthetic stimulus set. By comparing conditions in which the subjects were presented with equivalent degrees <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> for individual fricatives, it was possible to isolate the factor <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> from that <b>of</b> loss of suprathreshold discriminability. Results indicate that (a) the frication burst portion may serve as a sufficient cue for correct recognition of voiceless fricatives by normal-hearing subjects, whereas the more intense CV transition portion, though it may not be necessary, can also assist these subjects to distinguish place information, particularly at low presentation levels; (b) hearing-impaired subjects achieved close-to-normal recognition performance when given equivalent degrees <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> <b>of</b> the frication cue, but they obtained poorer-than-normal performance if only given equivalent degrees <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> <b>of</b> the transition cue; (c) the difficulty that hearing-impaired subjects have in perceiving fricatives under normal circumstances may be due to two factors: the lack <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> <b>of</b> the frication cue and the loss of discriminability of the transition cue.

40|$|Ultrasonic is {{the study}} of sound {{propagated}} at frequencies beyond the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> human <b>audibility</b> which is above 18 kHz. Ultrasonic techniques are very widely used for the detection of internal defects in materials, but they can also be used for the detection of small cracks.

The ultrasonic tomography consists of three types of sensing techniques namely the transmission-mode, reflection-mode and the diffraction-mode method [2, 7]. It involves the application of noninvasive ultrasonic sensors to obtain the information in order to develop the concentration map of the dynamic characteristics of process vessels in industries. This information together with the concentration map will derive the result to the mass flow rate,which will then provide the quantity of flowing volume in process vessels[1, 6]. In the study of tomography the physical principle of a sensing system depends on the reconstructed image of the cross sectional distribution of the constituent parameter. It is evaluated by arraying ultrasonic sensors non-invasively {{on the surface of the}} vessel.

Exposure to a loud sound results in an acute increase of the threshold <b>of</b> <b>audibility,</b> especially for frequencies similar to those of the given sound. However, the hearing goes back to normal after a certain period of time.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate how audibility influences speech recognition and measures of working memory in children with normal hearing. Specifically, audibility limitations related to background noise and limited bandwidth were analyzed, as these factors are characteristic of the listening conditions encountered by children with hearing loss who wear hearing aids. ^ In the first study, speech recognition was measured for 117 children and 18 adults with normal hearing. Stimulus bandwidth {{and the level of}} background noise were varied systematically in order to evaluate predictions <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> based on the Speech Intelligibility Index. Results suggested that children with normal hearing required greater audibility to reach the same level of speech understanding as normal-hearing adults. However, differences in performance between adults and children did not vary across frequency bands as anticipated. ^ In the second study, 18 children with normal hearing completed two tasks of working memory to examine how background noise and limited bandwidth might limit memory processes in children. In a non-word repetition task, significant reductions in speech recognition and increases in response time were observed for both the noise and limited bandwidth conditions. These results suggest that listening effort increased and phoneme recall decreased when the speech signal was degraded. For recall of real words, no differences in recognition were observed for two conditions with the same signal-to-noise ratio but differing bandwidths. However, recall was significantly inhibited in the limited bandwidth condition, supporting the hypothesis that a limited bandwidth may negatively impact working memory performance in children, even when recognition is preserved. ^ Collectively, these studies suggest that methods <b>of</b> calculating <b>audibility</b> based on adults are likely to be inadequate for predicting speech recognition and listening effort for children. Models <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> that incorporate the linguistic and cognitive dynamics of children are necessary to maximize communication outcomes for children with hearing loss. ...|$|R
