The disadvantage is that {{the water in the}} resultant slurry has to be removed subsequently, and this usually requires a lot of energy. While energy was cheap, wet grinding was common, but since 1970 the situation has changed dramatically, and new wet process plant is now rarely installed.

Since dispersion of CNT in polymer matrices has been comprehensively studied in the literature, the focus here is to understand the spatial or temporal evolution of the process. Dispersion showed a far from gradual evolution and good correlation with the composite electrical resistivity. The effect of composite reprocessing on nanotube <b>re-agglomeration</b> and subsequent dispersion was also investigated. A large nanotube <b>re-agglomeration</b> was detected on composite re-melting, matching an increase in electrical resistivity.

40|$|The surface, {{interfacial}} and dispersion {{properties of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the mechanical {{properties of the}} CNT/epoxy composites affected by CNT functionalization are investigated. It is demonstrated that there exists strong correlations between amino-functionalization, dispersion, wettability, interfacial interaction and <b>re-agglomeration</b> behaviour of CNTs and the corresponding mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of CNT/epoxy composites. The amino-functionalized CNTs exhibit higher surface energy and much better wettability with epoxy resin than the pristine CNTs, and the attached amine molecules arising from the functionalization effectively inhibit the <b>re-agglomeration</b> of CNTs during the curing of resin. These ameliorating effects along with improved interfacial adhesion between the matrix and functionalized CNTs through covalent bonds result in improved flexural and thermo-mechanical properties compared with those without functionalization.

The effect of surface functionalization on the dispersion kinetics, nanoparticle <b>re-agglomeration</b> and interface bonding with the polymer is investigated. Nanocomposites with 2 or 10 wt% of as-received and functionalized graphite nanoplates were prepared in a small-scale prototype mixer coupled to a capillary rheometer.

40|$|In the gluten-starch {{separation}} process gluten is formed {{first as a}} result of breakdown of the gliadin-glutelin structures during mixing followed by their <b>re-agglomeration.</b> To date the effect of pentosans and enzymes have not been studied separately. A simple modification of TNO Glutomatic system enables pentosans, enzymes, and other materials to be added after the mixing step allowing the effect of these additives to be studied separately. Using this technique, we observed that re-aggregation of gluten proteins starts immediately after the first mixing step during the dough dilution phase. Xylanase addition prior to dough mixing can lead to 'overdose effects' but these were not observed when xylanase was added later during the <b>re-agglomeration</b> phase. We were able to distinguish between physical and chemical effects of pentosans on gluten formation. The effect of water-extractable pentosans is only partly related to its viscosity, a ferulic acid (FA) related reaction is more important. Pentosans affect the affect the agglomeration by increasing the size of the glutenin macropolymer particles. When the water-extractable pentosan effect is prevented by xylanase or FA addition, aggregation during dilution is more extensive and the glutenin macropolymer has a lower average particle size with a resulting difference in gluten rheology. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} {{multiple}} extrusions on nanostructure and properties of nylon 6 nanocomposites was investigated. Nanocomposites at different silicate loadings were produced by melt compounding and submitted to further reprocessing by using single and twin screw extruders. Rheological, morphological and mechanical analyses {{were carried out}} on as-produced and reprocessed samples in order to {{explore the influence of}} the number and the type of extrusion cycles on silicate nanodispersion. Rheological measurements, correlated to TEM analyses, were used to probe the nanoscale arrangement developed with the reprocessing as well as the thermo-mechanical degradation involving both the neat matrix and the organoclay. The results have shown that the reprocessing by single screw extruder can modify the initial morphology since the <b>re-agglomeration</b> of the silicate layers can occur. On the other hand, a better nanodispersion was observed in the hybrids reprocessed by twin screw extruder. This was attributed to the additional mechanical stresses able to realizing a dispersive mixing that contributes to avoid <b>re-agglomeration</b> phenomena. The high shear stresses produced with twin screw geometry determined also a significant degradation of neat matrix, principally based on chain scission mechanism. A strong correlation between the rheological behaviour and mechanical properties was observed and all as-produced and reprocessed hybrids showed a substantial enhancement in tensile modulus with the adding of silicate. However, the entity of performance enhancements displayed by the reprocessed hybrids was found to be highly dependent on the degradation of both organoclay and polymer matrix as well as the silicate amount, the number and the type reprocessing...|$|E

Before substituting these nanocomposites in commercial applications, there are many problems, like dispersion, agglomeration, cost effectiveness etc., which need to be sorted.

Apart from the other major obstacles, <b>re-agglomeration,</b> because of strong van der walls forces between carbon nanotubes, is one of the latest problems that has been always underestimated and ignored. In this study, different carbon nanotubes (Single-wall nanotubes (SWNT), Double wall nanotubes (DWNT), Amino-modified double wall nanotubes (DWNT-NH 2), Thin Multi wall nanotubes (MWNT) and COOH-modified thin multi wall nanotubes (MWNT-COOH)) at different concentrations (0. 025, 0. 05 and 0. 1 %wt) in two-part epoxy system (Liquid Epoxy, Liquid hardener and Liquid epoxy-hardener mixture) were studied involving nano-particle size analyzer. After a study of 3 hours, it was observed that there is a strong dependence of re-aggregation profile on the employed homogenizing technique, i. e. high-power bath ultrasonication in this study. Apart from nanotubes/epoxy mixture, higher concentrations yielded higher aggregates profile and vice versa. <b>Re-agglomeration,</b> with the passage of time, in liquid epoxy was found to be least as compared to liquid hardener and liquid epoxy-hardener mixture. Hardener in liquid-epoxy mixture was the main culprit responsible for re-aggregation.

40|$|We present here {{results of}} a Master thesis [1] {{carried out in the}} frame of EURHEO: the Erasmus Mundus Master in Engineering Rheology, which is a Master {{programme}} funded by the European Union (EACEA) and described elsewhere in these proceedings. One of the key technological issues in nanocomposites is the effective dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNT) into the polymeric matrix. The lack of nano scale dispersion is at the origin of the observed gap between predicted enhanced physical properties and actual nanocomposites performances. Despite successful efforts in improving CNT dispersion by chemically functionalizing them or by the study of the interplay between processing conditions and final nanocomposite structure, there is a phenomenon called “re-agglomeration” responsible for dispersion recovery and destruction of the CNTs inside the matrix, which occurs during the shaping of nanocomposite batches into final products. Theory suggests that <b>re-agglomeration</b> process highly depends on the processing conditions and more important on the thermo-mechanical history of the material in its compounding step prior to processing. Here, efforts have been made in order to study the effect of thermo mechanical history on the nanocomposite structure and properties, thus contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the reagglomeration process [1]. In order to study the evolution of the CNT dispersion during the processing and the re-processing of the nanocomposite, a special set up has been used to obtain data in different mixing times and conditions. CNT-Polypropylene composites have been produced, and then submitted to reprocessing under controlled conditions, using a modified Capillary Rheometer. Optical microscopy, SEM and electrical conductivity tests have been performed for dispersion assessment. Results of the microscopy and electrical conductivity tests show a “percolation time” during the processing and reprocessing sections, which corresponds to an abrupt change in dispersion state as well as electrical properties.

It was found that hydrogen bonds were formed between nano-silica and caprolactam, in the meantime, ultrasound helped to break the nanoparticles aggregations into smaller ones or even mono-dispersing particles. Therefore, the agglomerated nanoparticles were pulled apart and stabilized by caprolactam. Additionally, the rapid anionic polymerization of caprolactam also contributed to the avoidance of <b>re-agglomeration</b> and deposition of nanoparticles during the polymerization process, leading to the uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix.

Current state-ofthe-art industrial methods analyze these streaming sources using only simple, aggregate metrics. There are few existing scalable algorithms for monitoring complex global quantities like decomposition into community structure. Using our framework STING, we present the first known parallel algorithm specifically for monitoring communities in this massive, streaming, graph-structured data. Our algorithm performs incremental <b>re-agglomeration</b> rather than starting from scratch after each batch of changes, reducing the problem’s size to that of the change rather than the entire graph. We analyze our initial implementation’s performance on multithreaded platforms for execution time and latency. On an Intel-based multithreaded platform, our algorithm handles up to 100 million updates per second on social networks with one to 30 million edges, providing a speed-up from 4 × to 3700 × over statically recomputing the decomposition after each batch of changes.

30|$|The current {{synthesis}} {{methods can}} be generally {{divided into two}} types, namely, the two-step method and the one-step method[3, 4]. For the two-step method, nanoparticles are either synthesized or purchased first {{in the form of}} dry powders, and the nanofluid formulation process involves the proper separation of the aggregated dried particles into individual particles and keeping them from <b>re-agglomeration</b> under suitable ionic or surfactant conditions[5]. It is a very complicated process, and the performance of the obtained nanofluid will be affected by several factors. In contrast, the one-step method requires less operation. Nanofluids are synthesized through physical or chemical reactions[5, 6]. The advantage of this process lies in the minimized nanoparticle agglomeration. The stability of nanofluids is guaranteed by proper surface functionalization without involving mechanical facilities. Since noble metal shows chemical and physical affinity with many species, the one-step method is usually adopted to fabricate noble metal nanofluids such as gold nanofluids (AuNFs). However, this approach suffers the problem of impurities. For example, residual reactants are generally left in the nanofluids because of incomplete reaction or stabilization. It is difficult to elucidate the nanoparticle effect without eliminating this impurity effect[5].|$|E

However, they are susceptible to physical ageing, leading {{to a reduction in}} permeability over time. An improvement in membrane permeability, control over diffusion selectivity and a reduction of the effect of physical ageing is expected by adding graphene as a nanofiller.

The effect of different parameters, ultrasound intensity, number of cycles, type of blade, gears speed on the nanofiller dispersion were analyzed. The inclusion of the nanofiller in the resin causes a drastic increase in the viscosity, preventing the homogenization of the resin and a drastic increase in temperature in the zones closest to the ultrasound probe. To overcome these challenges, the application of high speed agitation simultaneously with the application of ultrasonic radiation was used. This allows on the one hand a homogeneous dispersion, on the other hand an improvement of the dissipation of heat generated by ultrasonic radiation.

The uncemented spoil materials break down on excavation to extract coal and bulk up to a very loose density on end-dumping by haul truck in spoil piles. These loose materials then undergo three forms of settlement: due to their self-weight, "collapse" settlement on wetting by rainfall, and settlement due to degradation on exposure to weather, resulting in {{a substantial increase in}} density. Due to their lack of cementation, these spoil materials degrade rapidly on exposure to the weather, leading to significant settlement, followed by some reversal on <b>re-agglomeration</b> and swell. Collapse and degradation-induced settlements, both being associated with exposure to water, occur simultaneously on wetting. Wetting also causes a substantial reduction in the shear strength of the materials. The cemented spoil materials undergo more limited breakdown on excavation, dumping and wetting.

Previous studies have extensively shown that the resulting filler dispersion {{is strongly dependent on}} the characteristics of the melt mixing equipment. It is also known that the dispersion level of nanofillers strongly affects the final nanocomposite properties. The present work focuses on the study of the dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in polypropylene using a prototype mixer that develop high thermomechanical stress. The distribution and dispersion of the CNT was evaluated by optical and electron microscopy. The level of dispersion achieved was analysed, and the electrical resistivity of the composite, along the mixing cycles, was measured. The enhancement of the CNT dispersion along the mixing process correlated with a large decrease in electrical resistivity of the composite. A “percolation time”, defined as the time, or number of mixing cycles, required to achieve electrical conductivity, was measured, and correlated with mixing conditions. The composite formed was re-heated and reprocessed using the same mixing system. <b>Re-agglomeration</b> and loss of electrical conductivity was observed, and the final dispersion level varied with the mixing conditions imposed.

They found that the adsorption of SRFA greatly improved the suspending stability of TiO 2 nanoparticles at pH values of 4, 6, and 8, and they thought that this mainly caused by the sharp rise of negative charges on the particles’ surface. He et al.

The nanofluids with the optimal pH value can keep stable for several months. Also, Vakili et al. [82] and Sen et al.

It has been shown [1] that in the presence of nanoclay in the polymer based (epoxy, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyamide 6, polyimide) composites percolation threshold is reduced and electrical conductivity, as well as elastic modulus is increased generally due to improved dispersion degree of the conductive nanofiller (graphene, SWCNT, MWCNT, CB) because of reduced <b>re-agglomeration</b> tendency during processing.

In this edition of Debates and Surveys, Ann Markusen argues that much of this recent regional analysis has increasingly retreated into a mode of discourse in which concepts lack substantive clarity. She also suggests that such fuzzy conceptualization makes it diYcult for students and practitioners to operationalize and/or to subject this body of work to scrutiny by applying real world evidence. Descriptive characterizations of `processes ’ are believed to have replaced the application of behavioural and structural causality, compounding these conceptual problems. With methodologies underdeveloped, the case study or anecdote approach to analysis is often used to illustrate theoretical contentions, while the results of more comprehensive tests and instances which do not uphold the theory are frequently ignored. Comparing with some of the classic texts which addressed the problems of regions and so were located in a concern with real world policy and political engagement, the article contends that these recent tendencies are symptomatic of a body of scholarship that is increasingly abstract.

In this work, nanofluids were prepared by a top down approach in which commercially bought nanoparticles were mechanically dispersed into a base fluid (in this work, water). Ultrasonic baths and homogenizers are common tools used in breaking the agglomerates of nanoparticles compared to magnetic and high shear stirrers[30]. Stabilization of the nanofluids was then carried out using an electrostatic stabilization technique where the pH of the nanofluid suspensions was kept away from the isoelectric pH value. The pH values of the nanofluids were kept {{in the range of}} 5.5 to 6 by adding reagent grade nitric acid. In this work, initially, appropriate amounts of SiO 2 nanoparticles (approximately 20 -nm average diameter, Sigma Aldrich, # 637238, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dispersed in deionized water using an ultrasonic bath (VWR ultrasonic cleaner, VWR International, LLC, Radnor, PA, USA; 35 kHz) for 30 min. Furthermore, this colloidal suspension was subjected to intensified ultrasonication by immersing a probe type sonicator (QSonica S- 4000, Misonix, Qsonica, LLC, Newtown, CT, USA; 20 kHz). Cyclic ultrasonic pulses were then given to the suspension for about 30 min to achieve maximum possible de-agglomeration of particles. Four particle weight concentrations, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 wt.%, were considered for this investigation as they exhibited acceptable optical properties required in the experiment and a good colloidal stability over time.

40|$|Theme 5 This paper {{reports on}} work {{undertaken}} for the European Commission (EC) between 1996 and 1999. It is shown that despite reforms {{initiated by the}} EC Directive 91 / 440, the performance of 17 state owned western European rail operators is poor. Work using non-parametric index numbers indicates only modest productivity growth and mixed financial and commercial performance. Work using cost functions indicates that many railways appear {{to be of the}} wrong size and the wrong density to minimise costs. Work using demand functions indicates that there may be substantial scope for pricing up and for reconfiguring service levels. Modelling of cross border flows suggests that international services require increases in service levels and quality. It is argued that Europe s railways are in need of radical reform. A first phase of reform would build on the process already initiated by the EC and involve separate infrastructure authorities, continued commercialisation and privatisation of train operations, creation of rolling stock leasing companies, development of transparent infrastructure access and pricing, the promotion of off-track competition and of coach deregulation. However, it is possible that this first phase of reforms may not be sufficient to achieve the desired results. It is therefore likely that a second phase of reforms will be required including horizontal separation and <b>re-agglomeration</b> of train operations, vertical re-integration and network re-configuration.

40|$|A {{postulated}} severe loss of coolant {{accident in}} a nuclear reactor can lead to significant core damage due to residual heat generation. Subsequently, melted core materials (i. e.; corium) could migrate downward and impinge upon the lower head of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). During this relocation, the complexity of the reactor structure could segregate the molten corium into various flow paths. A perforated flow plate could readily provide the mechanism to segregate the molten corium. The resulting small (a few cm) diameter melt streams, driven by gravity, could then penetrate the remaining coolant in the RPV and cause any of the following events: impingement of the high temperature melt streams on the lower head could breach the RPV; <b>re-agglomeration</b> of the corium melt on the lower head could influence the coolability of the debris bed; {open_quotes}pre-mixing{close_quotes} of the melt streams with the coolant could lead to a vapor explosion; or, sufficient quenching of the melt streams by the coolant could produce a stabilized debris bed. An overview of the thermo-science issues related to core-melt accidents is presented by Theofanous. Thus, insight into the melt stream breakup mechanisms (i. e.; interfacial conditions, fragmentation, and geometric spacing) during the melt-coolant interactions is necessary to evaluate the plausibility, and characteristics, of these events. Molten Fuel Stream Breakup Simulation (MFSBS) experiments have been performed at Argonne National Laboratory in which simulant materials were used to determine a `boiling` jet breakup length correlation and to visualize the melt fragmentation mechanisms during the penetration of a single molten metal jet into a volatile liquid. The goal was to characterize the hydrodynamics of the corium-water interactions in a postulated core melt accident. The present experiment closely follows the procedures of the MFSBS...|$|E
30|$|Two {{methods are}} {{generally}} used for nanofluid formulation, namely, the top-down method through size reduction (the two-step method), and the bottom-up approach through simultaneous production and dispersion of nanoparticles (the one-step method) [5, 6]. For the two-step method, nanoparticles are either synthesized or purchased {{first in the}} form of dry powders, and the nanofluid formulation process involves properly separating the aggregated dried particles into individual particles and keeping them from <b>re-agglomeration</b> under suitable ionic or surfactant conditions. How well the final dispersion is achieved depends on (i) the degree of agglomeration of the dried nanoparticles (which depends {{on the nature of the}} manufacturing, handling and storage process), (ii) the shear forces applied in separating agglomerations (weakly bonded agglomerates could be broken to their primary sizes by high shearing, but strongly bonded ones are difficult to be separated), and (iii) the liquid environment (pH or ionic conditions to keep separated particles from re-aggregation). As a result of these complicated factors and a lack of detailed characterization of the content and morphology of the liquid and solid phases, it is very difficult to compare the result from one study with another even using same nanoparticles. The formulation of nanofluids by the bottom-up approach through physical or chemical reactions has been gaining increasing interests [7]. Such a method has been practiced for a long time in the colloid industry, i.e., colloidal gold. A number of other nanofluids have also been formulated including copper and iron nanofluids through a modified physical vapor deposition method and a hydrothermal chemical reduction of salts [8, 9]. For nanofluids formulated through the one-step method, the stability of nanofluids can be improved through proper surface functionalization without involving mechanical facilities. This approach, however, suffers the problem of impurities, i.e., residual reactants are generally left in the nanofluids because of incomplete reaction or stabilization. It is difficult to elucidate the nanoparticle effect without eliminating this impurity effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{consolidation}} of WC-Co powder with a ∼ 50 nanometer (nm) WC grain size (nWC) was investigated using high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) thermal spray deposition. Initial baseline data {{representative of the}} state-of-the-art of thermal spray deposition of WC-Co coatings was established using Diamalloy™ 2003, a premium grade WC-Co powder, and a Sulzer-Metco Diamond Jet™ (DJ) system. An increased understanding of the HVOF thermal spray process was established via a correlation of DJ process variables to the mechanisms of WC-Co coating defect formation. The critical HVOF process variables were identified as WC-Co particle size, DJ gun-to-substrate distance, DJ gun translation velocity, and powder feed rate, and a mechanism for controlled porosity formation in coatings was identified. These data were used to formulate a HVOF optimizing procedure which was used for DJ thermal spray of nWC-Co coatings. ^ As-synthesized nWC-Co particles are hollow shells with diameters of 25 – 125 μm. Incomplete matrix melting of as-synthesized nWC-Co occurred during W thermal spray and indicated the need for higher density particles. Heat treatments at 900 – 1400 °C reveal that insignificant densification of the hollow shell nWC-Co particles occurred prior to their sintering at contact points, and indicated that mechanical reprocessing was required. To this end a process using ultrasonic disintegration of nWC-Co powder and spray dry <b>re-agglomeration</b> was developed. ^ DJ thermal spray of reprocessed nWC-Co and nWC-Co+VC (vanadium carbide is a WC grain growth inhibitor) powders demonstrated that VC did not effect nWC grain size of coatings. DJ thermal sprayed nWC-Co coatings were near fully dense with a mean WC grain size of ∼ 200 nm, but displayed extensive nWC oxidation. The addition of 2. 5 and 5 wt % C during reprocessing of nWC- 8 Co powder significantly lowered the oxidation of nWC during DJ thermal spray. Addition of 5 wt % C produced a slightly lower nWC- 8 Co coating hardness than 2. 5 wt% C, due to η carbide formation. The W thermal spray of nWC- 8 Co- 2. 5 C powder using nitrogen DJ gun cooling demonstrated that exclusion of oxygen from the cooling gas caused a significant additional reduction in the oxidation of nWC, yielding a coating hardness value superior to Diamalloy 2003 coatings. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} {{project was}} aimed at thermoplastically processible polymers containing inorganic fibre structures of few nanometers size as reinforcing elements to be generated by chemical reaction. Analogously produced ferroelectric inorganic structures in nanometer size were to lead to materials with high dielectric values or broad band absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The materials were to combine thermoplastic processibility with the properties of functional ceramics. From barium hydroxide and tetraalkyl orthotitanate derived barium titanate (5 to 50 nm) as nonagglomerated dispersion was mixed with thermoplast melts without <b>re-agglomeration.</b> Depending on the temperature, a hyperproportional increase of the dielectric number occurred in polar polymers. Thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl in polymer solution followed by solvent removal resulted in thermoplast containing iron particles (5 - 60 nm). Both mixtures are thermoplastically processible. Thermoplasts with increased tenacity and toughness at high modulus were obtained via separate controlled preparation of the reinforcement phases, subsequent dispersion and mixing with the thermoplast melt. From aluminium alkoxides very fine Boehmit (AlOOH) platelets of 10 - 100 nm length were produced and as equally unagglomerated material introduced into thermoplasts. Needle-shaped iron oxides result in composites of higher stiffness, based on volume, than glass fibres. Tenacity and toughness rise, too. Submicrometer-sized Boehmit leads to clearly higher stiffness increase than expected according to Halpin-Tsai, but {{at the expense of}} decreasing toughness. (orig.) Ziel des dokumentierten Projekts waren thermoplastisch verarbeitbare Polymere, die durch chemische Umsetzungen erzeugte anorganische Faserstrukturen mit Durchmessern von wenigen Nanometern als Verstaerkungselemente enthalten. Analog erzeugte ferroelektrische anorganische Strukturen in Nanometergroesse sollten zu Materialien mit hoher Dielektrizitaetszahl oder breitbandiger Absorption elektromagnetischer Strahlung fuehren. Weiteres Ziel war die Kombination thermoplastischer Verarbeitbarkeit mit den Eigenschaften funktionskeramischer Materialien. Aus Bariumhydroxid und Tetraalkylorthotitanat hergestelltes Bariumtitanat (5 bis 50 nm) wurde als nichtagglomerierte Dispersion mit Thermoplastschmelzen ohne Reagglomeration gemischt. In Abhaengigkeit von der Temperatur ergab sich in polaren Polymeren ein ueberproportionaler Anstieg der Dielektrizitaetszahl. Thermische Zersetzung von Eisenpentacarbonyl in Polymerloesungen und anschliessende Loesungsmittelentfernung lieferte Thermoplaste mit Eisenteilchen (5 bis 60 nm). Beide Mischungen sind thermoplastisch verarbeitbar. Thermoplaste mit erhoehter Festigkeit und Zaehigkeit bei hohen Steifigkeiten konnten ueber kontrollierte gesonderte Herstellung der anorganischen Verstaerkungsphasen, anschliessende Dispergierung und Mischung mit den Thermoplastschmelzen erhalten werden. Aus Aluminiumalkoxiden wurde sehr feinteiliger, plaettchenfoermiger Boehmit (AlOOH) mit Dimensionen im Bereich von ca. 10 - 100 nm Laenge hergestellt und dieser ebenfalls unagglomeriert in Thermoplaste eingebracht. Die nadelfoermigen Eisenoxide ergeben, bezogen auf das Volumen, eine hoehere Steifigkeit der Verbunde als Glasfasern. Auch Festigkeit und Zaehigkeit steigen an. Der submikrometergrosse Boehmit fuehrt zu einer deutlich ueber der nach Halpin-Tsai maximal zu erwartenden Steifigkeitserhoehung, jedoch unter Abnahme der Zaehigkeit. (orig.)
