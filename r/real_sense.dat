25|$|Early {{forms of}} analogical reasoning, {{inductive}} reasoning and categorical syllogism {{were introduced in}} Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century {{with the process of}} Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term Qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a <b>real</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E

Our motivation is {{to suppress the}} unnecessary transmitted data values between ordinary sensors and aggregator by data prediction. We first presented the ARIMA prediction model and then described how the ARIMA prediction model could be built and applied in data aggregation scheme to decrease the number of transmitted messages within the network.

25|$|In The Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch {{defines a}} narcissistic culture as one where every {{activity}} and relationship {{is defined by}} the hedonistic need to acquire the symbols of wealth, this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social hierarchies. It is a culture where liberalism only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even art, sex and religion lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> of community is undermined—or even destroyed—to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — An {{unsupervised}} classification method provides the interpretation, feature extraction and endmember estimation for the {{remote sensing image}} data without any prior knowledge of the ground truth. We explore such method and construct an algorithm based on the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). The use of the NMF is to match the non-negative property in sensing spectrum data. The data dimensionality is estimated by using the partitioned noise-adjusted principlal component analysis (PNAPCA). The initial matrix used to start the NMF is obtained by using the fuzzy c-mean (FCM). This algorithm is capable to produce a region- or part-based representation of objects in images. Both simulated and <b>real</b> <b>sensing</b> data are {{used to test the}} algorithm. I...|$|R

30|$|Data {{aggregation}} is a {{very important}} method to conserve energy by eliminating the inherent redundancy of raw data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this article, we developed an automatic auto regressive-integrated moving averagemodeling-based data aggregation scheme in WSNs. The main idea behind this scheme is to decrease the number of transmitted data values between sensor nodes and aggregators by utilizing time series prediction model. The proposed scheme can effectively save the precious battery energy of wireless sensor nodes while keeping the predicted data values of aggregators within application-defined error threshold. We show through experiments with real data that the predicted data values of our proposed scheme fit the <b>real</b> <b>sensed</b> data values very well and fewer messages are transmitted between sensor nodes and aggregators than the native data aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the characteristics of the proposed data aggregation scheme are also discussed in this article.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} mobile camera robots with camera rotation capabilities. The motivation behind mobile camera robots {{is that as}} they rotate their camera their <b>real</b> <b>sensing</b> range {{moves from}} a FoV coverage to a disk coverage, therefore allowing neighboring nodes to decrease their activity level, thus their energy consumption. As a sensing node’s activity {{is based on a}} criticality or risk approach, we proposed 2 interaction behaviors between fixed image sensors and mobile camera robots to dynamically adapt the activity level without decrease the surveillance quality. The performance of the interaction models is evaluated through simulation. The results show that mobile camera robots can successfully help to increase the network lifetime but, depending on the number of deployed mobile camera robots, care must be taken with the interaction behaviors to not decrease the detection quality.
