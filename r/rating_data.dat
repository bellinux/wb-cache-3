50|$|The {{analysis}} will isolate the underlying factors that explain the data using {{a matrix of}} associations. Factor analysis is an interdependence technique. The complete set of interdependent relationships is examined. There is no specification of dependent variables, independent variables, or causality. Factor analysis assumes that all the <b>rating</b> <b>data</b> on different attributes can be reduced down to a few important dimensions. This reduction is possible because some attributes {{may be related to}} each other. The rating given to any one attribute is partially the result of the influence of other attributes. The statistical algorithm deconstructs the rating (called a raw score) into its various components, and reconstructs the partial scores into underlying factor scores. The degree of correlation between the initial raw score and the final factor score is called a factor loading.|$|E
