5|$|Men's {{professional}} {{basketball in the}} United States (notably the National Basketball Association) widened it further to 16feet (4.9m) in the 1964–65 NBA season to lessen the effectiveness of centers, especially Wilt Chamberlain.

30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm {{can effectively}} <b>retain</b> <b>the</b> detail {{features of the}} model.

50|$|World {{traveller}} Nápoles began 1973 by <b>retaining</b> <b>the</b> title against Lopez again, by knockout in seven, then {{he visited}} Grenoble, France, where he <b>retained</b> <b>the</b> crown with a 15-round decision over Roger Menetrey, and Toronto, Canada where he beat Clyde Gray, once again <b>retaining</b> <b>the</b> world title with a 15-round decision.|$|R

5|$|The {{computer}} <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> diver's pressure exposure history, and continuously updates {{the calculated}} tissue loads on the surface, so the current tissue loading {{should always be}} correct according to the algorithm, though {{it is possible to}} provide the computer with misleading input conditions, which can nullify its reliability.|$|E
5|$|The game <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> classic pastel / crayon visuals {{from its}} predecessor.

5|$|The zoo still <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} charter, which drives its active breeding programme, and biodiversity, {{conservation and}} sustainability initiatives.

5|$|Umberto Eco compares Joyce to {{the ancient}} episcopi vagantes (wandering bishops) in the Middle Ages. They left a discipline, not a {{cultural}} heritage or a way of thinking. Like them, the writer <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> sense of blasphemy held as a liturgical ritual.|$|E

5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E
50|$|Nine matches (including two dark matches) were contested at the event. The {{main event}} saw Triple H defeat Dean Ambrose to <b>retain</b> <b>the</b> WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> antigen-specific variable region.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E
5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E
50|$|Upon being re-tendered, Transdev London <b>retained</b> <b>the</b> route {{with a new}} {{contract}} commencing on 4 July 2009. London United again <b>retained</b> <b>the</b> route with a {{new contract}} commencing on 5 July 2014.|$|R

50|$|The CBS/Viacom split {{essentially}} {{resulted in}} the de-merger of Spelling and Republic. Spelling <b>retained</b> <b>the</b> rights to the television side of the Spelling/Republic library, while Republic <b>retained</b> <b>the</b> theatrical and direct-to-video sides of the library.|$|R
5|$|First {{described}} by Claude Casimir Gillet, the species <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> name {{which it was}} first given, but {{has a number of}} taxonomic synonyms. Its specific name honours Louis-Luc Godey. Within the genus Inocybe, it has been classified in a number of ways, but appears to form part of a clade (that is, a group sharing a common ancestor) with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica.|$|E

Willis also <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> world record for most Test wickets without a single 10-wicket haul in a match.|$|E
5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller <b>retains</b> <b>the</b> right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013, {{the club}} again {{successfully}} <b>retained</b> <b>the</b> Union Cup in Bristol after a final against Ireland's Emerald Warriors. The club managed to <b>retain</b> <b>the</b> cup without conceding a single try throughout the tournament.|$|R
