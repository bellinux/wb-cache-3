40|$|Our {{problem of}} {{interest}} consists of minimizing a separable, convex and differentiable function over a convex set, defined by bounds on the variables and an explicit constraint {{described by a}} separable convex function. Applications are abundant, and vary from equilibrium problems in the engineer-ing and economic sciences, through resource allocation and balancing problems in manufacturing, statistics, military operations research and production and financial economics, to subproblems in algorithms {{for a variety of}} more complex optimization models. This paper surveys the history and applications of the problem, as well as algorithmic approaches to its solution. The most common technique is based on finding the optimal value of the Lagrange multiplier for the explicit constraint, most often {{through the use of a}} type of line search procedure.

40|$|Let L/F be a cyclic {{extension}} of number fields. Chevalley's "ambiguous class formula " gives {{the number of}} G(L/F) -invariant ideal classes (of L) {{in terms of the}} class of number of F, the ramification indices of the places of F in L, and an index of units. In this paper we generalize his formula to S-ideal classes where S is any finite set of places of F. When S is empty and [L:F] prime, this is Gras ' formula for the number of ambiguous narrow classes [5] and when S contains all the infinite places of F, our formula was first pointed out by Ferrero [4] and is discussed in [3]. Our proof will be Galois cohomological. When S is the set of infinite places of F, it is Lang's [6] proof of the ambiguous class formula. When S is missing some of the infinite places, we must generalize some of the Gras ' [5] lemmas concerning the signature map. I would like to thank Yuji Kida for his helpful <b>remarks.</b> <b>õ</b> 1. Preliminaries on S-class groups. Let F be a number field (i. e., a finite {{extension of}} Q). By Soo we signify the set of infinite places of F. Fix a finite set S of places ofF and write S * for the union of S with So,. By F • we denote he subring of F x consisting of elements which have positive images under all the real embedrings missing from S: F • = {odo • G F x, 'y(o 0 > 0 for all real 'y G S *- S}.

40|$|Abstract: The {{primary focus}} of this {{communication}} is to present an updated and advanced version {{of the theory of}} close-contact association of molecules and ions through the spatial fixation and ag-gregation of the adsorbing sites. The last sections of the text also review a collection of relevant in vitro and in vivo experimental findings gathering since seventy years ago. Though some of these findings were published before the theory, old and new, they all support the theory that close-contact association with the β-, and γ-carboxyl groups of intracellular proteins causes the selective accu-mulation of potassium ions (K+) in living cells. “POTASSIUM IS of the soil and not the sea; it is of the cell but not the sap. ” With this thought-provoking <b>remark,</b> W. <b>O.</b> Fenn launched his 1940 Physiological Review article o...|$|R

40|$|With a broad {{understanding}} or {{definition of}} “work” {{as something that}} includes unpaid labour, this paper examines the relationship between numeracy and work, and analyses specific forms and constraints of workplace related numeracy. This is done by highlighting and commenting on existing literature {{that focuses on the}} role of workplace mathematics and the identification of vocational mathematics. Following a numeracy framework suggested by Goos et al. (2014), the paper analyses three case studies, and pays special attention to mathematical knowledge, dispositions to mathematics, and the role of tools in industrial contexts. Workplace related mathematics often mixes mathematical and extra-mathematical knowledge and procedures into one “instrument”, hiding and/or changing mathematics as it is encountered in or known from classrooms. Insights gained from case studies are complemented by an analysis of the PIAAC survey study. The paper leads to four major results, including a comment {{on the use of the}} term “numeracy” and a <b>remark</b> on “critical <b>o...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Different {{levels of}} order of {{amorphous}} silicon (a-Si) samples have been measured by XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) and EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine structure) analysis. The EXAFS analysis {{has been carried}} out by using a first-shell fitting procedure while in the XANES part we have extracted the high-frequency residuals which change with the level of order. From this analysis a continuous increase of local ordering has been found {{as a function of the}} substrate deposition temperature of the a-Si films. In this contribution we want to present a XAS (X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy) investigation on several amorphous silicon (a-Si) films prepared by using the ion beam sputtering technique. The aim of this analysis is to investigate changes in the x-ray absorption experimental spectra through a comparison with the model compound (crystalline silicon) and calculated single and multiple scattering contributions [l- 3]. This analysis allows understanding of some of the characteristics of local ordering obtained increasing the substrate deposition temperature (SDT) during the growth. It is important <b>o</b> <b>remark</b> that other techniques, such as x-ray or neutron diffraction, are not able to detect differences in the local structure between a-Si samples prepared in different conditions...|$|R

40|$|This {{bibliography}} is {{a companion}} to G 110, 'A bibliography on post-harvest losses in cereals and pulses with particular reference to tropical and sub-tropical countries', by J. M. Adams (TPI, 1977). Whereas G 110 covered storage, the present bibliography deals with the post-harvest processes from threshing to milling, with some abstracts on the secondary processes (cooking, baking, fermentation etc). The present world food situation has led technologists to look critically at all aspects of food production {{in order to increase}} the world's food resources. One aspect only recently studied with any great seriousness is the assessment and reduction of food processing losses. Losses occur at all stages of the food chain. Moreover, some losses made manifest at one point are caused earlier in the chain. Some obvious examples come to mind: failure to apply fertilizer leads to low yields; over-ripeness leads to threshing losses; bad threshing or drying techniques with paddy lead to broken rice at the mill, and so on. lt is always possible to reduce loss empirically, without prior assessment of the loss. However, to justify the necessary inputs of finance, labour etc, to reduce loss it is wise to assess the loss and measure its cost. In assessing loss two basic methods are available: (a) measurement of whole system, and (b) comparison of one process with a standard or optimal process. In (a) the loss itself is weighed. For example, by removing and weighing grain left on the stalk after threshing. In (b) the process is compared, in terms of yields and values, with an optimized, usually laboratory, process. All other unit operations in the processing chain are carried out in an identical way. For example, identical samples of maize cobs are dried to different moisture levels and then shelled: kernel damage is then compared. In this bibliography are abstracts of many useful technical papers on processing losses of cereals and grain legumes. Some areas are much better covered_than others, and it is hoped that this bibliography will spur researchers to concentrate on neglected areas. The introductory <b>remarks</b> 1 <b>o</b> some sections are taken from the AACC/LI FE publication 'Post-harvest Grain Loss Assessment Methods' (see page 3, A 1). NOTE: The lay-out of this bibliography is similar to that which has been so successfully used in the Composite Flour Bibliographies (G 89 and G 111), and it is hoped that users will find the system appropriate in the present case...|$|R
40|$|The amateur naturalist S. Hailstone, {{who lived}} in Hastings, England, was much {{interested}} in the Crustacea of his area and made collections of these. At several occasions in 1834 and 1835 he sent observations on interesting specimens, often together with the material, to J. C. Loudon, the editor of "The Magazine of Natural History, and Journal of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology, and Meteorology", one of the forerunners of the well known "Annals and Magazine of Natural History". Hailstone often accompanied his notes with requests for identification of the species, which he had either not at all or only tentatively identified. Loudon passed Hailstone's notes and the material (if the latter was available) on to J. O. Westwood, the well known entomologist, who at that time lived in Hammersmith. Westwood gave his remarks on the material {{and in some instances}} provided new names when he thought the species to be new and at several occasions he made illustrations of the species. Loudon published Hailstone and Westwood's observations in his Magazine interspersed with his own remarks. He very carefully identified the author of each piece of text by giving the name and/or address of Hailstone and Westwood {{at the end of their}} text, and by placing his own words in square brackets. It is clear that he furthermore also inserted Westwood's new names and Westwood's figures in Hailstone's text. The first observations were published in the May issue of 1835 of the Magazine of Natural History (vol. 8 no. 49) as Article V of that issue, under the title "Descriptions of some Species of Crustaceous Animals; by S. Hailstone, Jun. Esq. : with Illustrations and <b>Remarks,</b> by J. <b>O.</b> Westwood, Esq. F. L. S. &c". The article starts on p. 261, but it is extremely difficult to find out where it ends...|$|R
5000|$|The fourth {{programme}} of {{the second}} season examined the case of Garda Michael Clerkin and was broadcast on 9 February 2009. On the night of 16 October 1976, Gardaí were deliberately lured to an isolated abandoned farmhouse in County Laois. The house had been booby trapped with explosives, and 24-year-old Garda Michael Clerkin, from Monaghan and only {{four years in the}} force, was killed. Detective Tom Peters was also seriously injured and left both deaf and blind, whilst colleagues Jim Cannon, Ben Thornton and Gerry Bohan survived the attack unscathed. It occurred just after President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh signed the Emergency Powers Bill into law, which during turbulent times aimed to increase the period of detention without charge from two to seven days. Gardaí in Portlaoise received an anonymous phone call stating that subversive activity was ongoing at a disused house at Garryhinch, with a plot to kill local Fine Gael TD Oliver J. Flanagan. Portlaoise phoned the local Portarlington Station, just three miles from Garryhinch and Sergeant Jim Cannon was advised to go to the disused house. Cannon brought two uniformed Gardaí with him, Gerry Bohan and Michael Clerkin, and the two joined forces with Detectives Tom Peters and Ben Thornton on the way. Clerkin used an open rear window to enter the house, opening the front door from the inside to let the others in, triggering the booby trap and killing himself instantaneously. The house had to be demolished in the aftermath. The next day, the Minister for Defence Paddy Donegan, made what became known as his infamous [...] "thundering disgrace" [...] <b>remarks,</b> aimed at <b>Ó</b> Dálaigh for his actions regarding the Emergency Powers Bill. The President subsequently resigned.|$|R
