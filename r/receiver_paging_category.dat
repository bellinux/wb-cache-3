40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the use of a}} neuro-fuzzy {{strategy}} to develop a Web personalization system that dynamically suggests interesting <b>page</b> <b>categories</b> for the current user. As a preliminary step, log files are analyzed to identify user access patters. Then, groups of users which exhibit a common browser behavior (i. e. user categories) are discovered by applying a fuzzy clustering algorithm to the user access patterns. Finally, a hybrid approach based on the combination of the fuzzy reasoning and the neural paradigm is applied in order to derive fuzzy associations between user <b>categories</b> and Web <b>pages</b> <b>categories</b> to be suggested to users. The derived knowledge is ultimately used by an online recommendation module to dynamically point out Web <b>pages</b> in the <b>category</b> judged interesting for the current user. Some preliminary experimental results are presented on a specific Web site...|$|R

50|$|What {{data can}} get formalized also varies. One {{may be able}} to specify types for <b>pages,</b> <b>categories</b> or {{paragraphs}} or sentences (the latter features were more common in pre-web systems). Links are usually also typed. The source, property and target may be determined by some defaults, e.g. in Semantic MediaWiki the source is always the current page.|$|R
30|$|To {{provide a}} better picture of {{fruition}} patterns with respect to different information, we continue our analysis by zooming in {{at the level of}} posts. Recalling that the division of <b>pages</b> in <b>categories</b> accounts for the very distinctive nature between political discussion and kind of information used (mainstream or alternative), we focus on the coexistence in the political discussion of mainstream news and conspiracy-like information. Firstly, we analyze general fruition patterns in terms of number of comments, likes and shares for posts grouped by <b>page</b> <b>category.</b> Then, to characterize the online discussion around qualitatively different information, we measure the duration of collective debates for each post diffused by the different pages.|$|R

Link information is used for relevance propagation and {{in the form of}} a document link prior. Both sources of information have value, but using category information leads to the biggest improvements. ...|$|R

The system, which operates {{in the domain}} of automobiles, automobile parts, and related objects, reads the user's request in simple English, analyzes it and represents it in terms of the system's conceptual primitives. From this, the system tries to figure out the intent of the request and formulate a Yellow Pages query.

40|$|Abstract. The Wikipedia is {{the largest}} online {{collaborative}} knowledge sharing system, a free encyclopedia. Built upon traditional wiki architectures, its search capabilities are limited to title and full-text search. We suggest that semantic information can be extracted from Wikipedia by analyzing the links between categories. The results {{can be used for}} building a semantic schema for Wikipedia which could improve its search capabilities and provide contributors with meaningful suggestions for editing the Wikipedia pages. We analyze relevant measures for inferring the semantic relationships between <b>page</b> <b>categories</b> of Wikipedia. Experimental results show that Connectivity Ratio positively correlates with the semantic connection strength. ...|$|R

Low usability web pages, 94. 4 % (17 pages / 18 pages = detectable pages / low usability pages) were detectable from the moving speed of gazing points and the amount of wheel rolling of a mouse.

30|$|Importantly, {{we found}} that {{scrambling}} the text significantly decreased performance by 4.34 % (p <[*] 4 E- 4, collapsing over all subjects and categories); the categorization task is more difficult when the text is unreadable. This implies that participants in Experiment 1 A were in fact inferring the category in part from readable text. Since performance in the scrambled condition was well above chance, however, readable text was clearly not the only cue. Further examining the individual web <b>page</b> <b>categories,</b> {{we found that}} performance was significantly better with intact than scrambled text for three categories: company (15.5  pp), news (22.14  pp), and society (11.62  pp) (p <[*] 5 E- 3 per category, see Table 2 for standard deviation). Thus, readable text provided a better cue for some categories than for others; we examine this finding in more detail in the discussion.|$|R
