25|$|The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is {{a legend}} from Southern folklore, {{centered}} on the 19th-century Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. John Bell Sr., who made his living as a farmer, resided with his family along the Red River in northwest Robertson County in an area currently within the town of Adams. According to legend, from 1817-1821, his family and the local area came under attack by an invisible entity subsequently described as a witch. The entity was able to speak, affect the physical environment and change forms. Some accounts record the spirit with the capability to be {{in more than one}} place at a time, cross distances with <b>rapid</b> <b>speed</b> and the power of prophecy.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{was equipped}} with an uncovered tail boom, outfitted with twin fins and a rudder; both directional control and stability of the vehicle were provided via the controlled deflection of exhaust gases from the engine. As {{a consequence of the}} torque-free method of rotor propulsion, the Djinn did not require the presence of an anti-torque tail rotor. A simplistic wheel-equipped twin-skid arrangement was also present; this was retractable via the same manually-operated crank handle used for engine ignition. The Djinn could also be deployed with multiple armaments. In the ground-attack role, it could be equipped with a single machine gun, which was manned from the second seat of the cockpit. For performing anti-tank warfare, the Djinn was able to equip a guided missile; when deployed in an effective manner against an adversary, the manufacturer claimed the combination to be extremely difficult for an opposing tank to sight its adversary and to defend itself during the anticipated <b>rapid</b> <b>speed</b> of engagements.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} {{will have a}} total of 59 elevators, five {{of which will be}} double-deck elevators, as well as 12escalators. It will also have the highest observation deck in the world, to which high speed elevators will travel at up to 10 metres (33feet) per second (slightly over [...] ) in both directions. The elevators cannot go faster because the change in air pressure at such a <b>rapid</b> <b>speed</b> could cause nausea; at , the air pressure is over 10 kPa (1.5 psi) lower than at ground level (a 10% reduction in air pressure). They must also be efficient so the cables are not unbearably heavy. Jeddah Tower will have three sky lobbies where elevator transfers can be made, and no elevator will go from the bottom to the highest occupied floor. No official floor count has been given; however, Smith stated in a television interview that it will be about 50 floors more than the Burj Khalifa, which has 163occupied floors, leading to the inference that Jeddah Tower will have over 200floors. The tower will also feature a large, roughly [...] diameter outdoor balcony, known as the sky terrace, {{on one side of the}} building for private use by the penthouse floor at level 157; it is not the observation deck. It was originally intended to be a helipad, but it was revealed to be an unsuitable landing environment by helicopter pilots. The building's large notches will also serve as shaded terraces for other areas of the tower and the exterior of the {{building will}} use low-conductivity glass to save on cooling costs by reducing thermal loads. In addition, the lower air density, exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere, will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air, which will provide natural cooling. There is also significantly more air flow (wind) at heights, which is very strong at one kilometre and had a large impact on the structural design of the tower. The Burj Khalifa actually takes in the cooler, cleaner air from the top floors and uses it to air condition the building. Jeddah Tower will be oriented such that no façade directly faces the sun; it will also use the condensate water from the air conditioning system for irrigation and other purposes throughout the building.|$|E

50|$|Callander Bay is an eroded Proterozoic {{volcanic}} pipe {{formed by}} the violent, supersonic eruption of a deep-origin volcano.

A very questionable, or indeed for them an unquestionable thing. Reform Bill, free suffrage of Englishmen? Why, the Royalists themselves, silenced indeed but not exterminated, perhaps outnumber us; the great numerical majority of England was always indifferent to our Cause, merely looked at it and submitted to it. It is in weight and force, not by counting of heads, that we are the majority! And now with your Formulas and Reform Bills, the whole matter, sorely won by our swords, shall again launch itself to sea; become a mere hope, and likelihood, small even as a likelihood? And it is not a likelihood; it is a certainty, which we have won, by God's strength and our own right hands, and do now hold here. Cromwell walked down to these refractory Members; interrupted them in that <b>rapid</b> <b>speed</b> of their Reform Bill;--ordered them to begone, and talk there no more.--Can we not forgive him? Can we not understand him? John Milton, who looked on it all near at hand, could applaud him. The Reality had swept the Formulas away before it.
