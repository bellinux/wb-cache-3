5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than {{an interpretation of the}} law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Suter even {{concludes that}} the peasant war of 1653 thwarted a further {{advancement}} of absolutist trends in Switzerland and prevented a development similar to that which occurred in France following the Fronde. The authorities of the Swiss cantons had to act much more carefully and were forced to <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> rural subjects. The Bernese for instance instructed their district sheriffs to employ a far less pompous and less authoritarian attitude to minimize the conflict potential. The city council even opened legal procedures against a few of its district sheriffs against whom there were many complaints from the rural population, accusing them of corruption, incompetence, and unjustified enrichment. The district sheriff of Trachselwald, the same Samuel Tribolet who had captured Niklaus Leuenberger, was dismissed, tried, and exiled in early 1654. Abraham Stanyan, who had been ambassador of England in Bern from 1705 to 1713, published in 1714 an extensive treatise entitled An account of Switzerland, in which he described the authorities' rule as particularly mild, mentioning explicitly the low taxation in comparison to other European states and giving {{as the reason for}} the comparatively soft-gloved government the fear of rebellions.|$|E

Support for efficacy and mattering specifically focuses on youth being active, instrumental agents of change in their communities, collective decision-making and adults listen to and <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> voice.|$|E

25|$|The superior–subordinate {{relationship}} {{is an important}} relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with their supervisors are more often to use articulated dissent. They feel their supervisors <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> opinions {{and that they have}} mutual influence and persuasion over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. They feel that there is no room to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).|$|E

HenryV rescued the city with his troops. In 1217 the city of Bremen deserted Valdemar's party. Now HenryV, OttoIV and their troops ravaged the Prince-Archbishopric (so-called Valdemarian Turmoils, 1217–1218). In 1218 GerhardI and ValdemarII allied to expel Henry and Otto from the Prince-Archbishopric. Gerhard's troops approached the fortress of Vörde disguised as sick, lining up for a treatment by the faith healer and farmer Otbert. Once arrived they overthrew Henry's soldiers in the fortress. After the deaths of Otto in 1218 and GerhardI in 1219, HenryV reached {{an agreement with the}} new Prince-Archbishop Gerhard II, to maintain the County of Stade as prince-archiepiscopal vassal.|$|E

25|$|In November 1937, Ribbentrop {{was placed}} in a highly {{embarrassing}} situation, when his forceful advocacy of the return of the former German colonies led the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos to offer to open talks on returning the former German colonies, in return for which the Germans would make binding commitments to <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> borders in central and eastern Europe. Since Hitler was not interested in obtaining the former colonies, especially if the price was a brake on expansion into eastern Europe, Ribbentrop was forced to turn down the Anglo-French offer that he had largely brought about. Immediately after turning down the Anglo-French offer on colonial restoration, Ribbentrop, for reasons of pure malice, ordered the Reichskolonialbund to increase the agitation for the former German colonies, a move that exasperated both the Foreign Office and the Quai d'Orsay.|$|E
25|$|The Fazenda Real (Royal Treasury) paid 112$000 in 1731 for {{paintings}} and gilding of interior woodwork. This saw {{the beginning of}} expenses on the church, and included a similar payment of 1785 for 42$000 reis, worth of improvements. Bishop D. Frei Valério do Sacramento referred to the interior chapel of Bom Jesus as the chapel of Santo Cristo, and ordered that it be redressed and decorated. Yet, on a visit by licentiate Pedro Ferreira de Medeiros, on 15 December 1746, he found a churchyard that was {{badly in need of}} repair, full of rubble, and that hindered access to the chapel. The treasury delayed investment until 1758 (42$000). On 29 October 1764, Bispo D. Frei Lourenço de Castro visited the church, and created a polemic when he indicated the administrators of the chapel of Bom Jesus did not <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> functions. He ordered the creation of a brotherhood and through donations he had the chapel repaired and redecorated.|$|E
