The {{purpose of the study}} is to evaluate the toxicity of Apollo moon dust in rodents through inhalation to assess the health risk of dust exposures to humans and to identify the mechanisms and potential pathways involved in lunar dust-induced toxicity. Ccl 3, Ccl 12, Cxcl 2, Cxcl 5, Itgb 8, Tnf, Ldhc, Clec 4 e, Bmp 7, and Smad 6, showed persistently significant expression changes in the lung tissue. The expression of several of these genes were dose- and time- dependent, and were significantly correlated with other pathological. Our previous data showed that no pathological changes were detected in low dose groups. However, several genes, primarily produced by lung epithelial, were significantly altered persistently in response to low-dose dust exposure. The data presented in this study, for the first time, explores the molecular mechanisms of lunar dust induced toxicity, contributing not only the risk assessment for future space exploration, but also understandings of the dust-induced toxicity to humans on earth...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fine</b> {{fractions}} of <b>dusts</b> occurring in occupational settings are of high relevance {{for the safety}} at workplaces and therefore are strictly regulated by authorities. Appropriate threshold values should guarantee that lung diseases are not induced in workers exposed up to long periods. Respirable biopersistent granular dusts (GBS) are defined as <b>respirable</b> <b>fine</b> <b>dusts</b> with a negligible solubility in physiological lung fluid that do not exhibit a specific chemistry-related toxicity at volumetric non-overload conditions. In 2012, the MAK Commission derived a new threshold value of 0. 3 mg/m 3 for GBS, recognizing that in concentrations exceeding the physiological lung clearance capacity GBS can cause chronic inflammation and increase the lung cancer risk in animal experiments. - The objectives were to investigate, whether a general value for the term 'low soluble' can be derived (e. g. a solubility in lung fluid of approx. 1 mg/l). In addition, measuring the inflammatory response in lung lavage fluid, it was investigated whether nanoscaled dusts could possibly fulfill the criteria {{to be included in}} the GBS class. - Six micro- and nanoscaled dusts (some of them of commercial relevance) were compared analysing the solubility in the lung fluid (day 3, 28 and 90) and the lung toxicity after intratracheal instillation in rats (day 3 and 28) : TiO 2 (rutile, micro), TiO 2 (anatase, nano), Eu 2 O 3 (micro-nano mixed), BaSO 4 (micro), ZrO 2 (micro) and amorphous SiO 2 (nano). Two doses of 0. 5 and 1. 5 l per rat were administered to Wistar rats; these volume doses resulted in a non-overload and moderate overload of lungs, resp. - The differential cell count showed only slight inflammatory cell levels after treatment with TiO 2 (rutile) and BaSO 4 (PMN 30 % after 3 days). The rare earth Eu 2 O 3 (micro-nano) dust showed the strongest effect (approx. 40 % PMN) including a red-coloured lung lavage fluid (BAL after 28 days and solubility analysis are still underway). - New dusts {{to be included in the}} GBS group have to fulfill the criteria of low solubility and a non-significant inflammatory response at doses below the overload range.

The {{purpose of the study}} is to analyze the dynamics of global gene expression changes in lung tissues of rats exposed to lunar dust particles. F 344 rats were exposed for 4 weeks (6 h/d; 5 d/wk) in noseonly inhalation chambers to concentrations of 0 (control air), 2. 1, 6. 8, 21, and 61 mg/m 3 of lunar dust. Animals were euthanized at 1 day and 13 weeks after the last inhalation exposure. After being lavaged, lung tissue from each animal was collected and total RNA was isolated. Four samples of each dose group were analyzed using Agilent Rat GE v 3 microarray to profile global gene expression of 44 K transcripts. After background subtraction, normalization, and log transformation, t tests were used to compare the mean expression levels of each exposed group to the control group. Correction for multiple testing was made using the method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekuteli (1) to control the false discovery rate. Genes with significant changes of at least 1. 75 fold were identified as genes of interest. Both low and high doses of lunar dust caused dramatic, dosedependent global gene expression changes in the lung tissues. However, the responses of lung tissue to low dose lunar dust are distinguished from those of high doses, especially those associated with 61 mg/m 3 dust exposure. The data were further integrated into the Ingenuity system to analyze the gene ontology (GO), pathway distribution and putative upstream regulators and gene targets.

Tests were conducted on small laboratory scale ID- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones to demonstrate the reduction in emission concentrations resulting when a pre-cyclone collector is used to collect large trash particles prior to cyclone <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> collection. Cyclones were tested as <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> collectors, simultaneous <b>fine</b> dust/trash collectors, and in series with a baffle-type pre-collector placed upstream of the cyclone. Cotton gin trash was utilized as the trash component while corn dust, sieved to less than 100 []m Aerodynamic Equivalent Diameter (AED), was utilized as the <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> component. Results indicated that cyclones, if designed and operated properly as <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> collectors, can be utilized as particulate abatement devices in situations where filtration technology is perceived as the only suitable solution. Emission concentrations below 23 mg/m 3 (0. 01 gr/dscf) were achieved using the ID- 3 D cyclones. It was shown that the ID- 3 D cyclone will have lower emission concentrations as compared to the 2 D- 2 D cyclone at similar loading conditions. Tests showed that using ID- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones to simultaneously collect trash and <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> will result in significantly higher emission concentrations as compared to emissions from cyclones collecting only <b>fine</b> <b>dust.</b> Significant reductions in emissions can be achieved if a baffle-type pre-collector is utilized to remove trash particles prior to cyclone <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> removal.

Studies found <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> (with aerodynamic diameter less than 2. 5 microns) {{is an important}} component of the total PM 2. 5 mass in the western and central U.

S. using station data from the Interagency Monitoring Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network during 1990 â€“ 2015. The variations of the <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> concentration can be largely explained by the variations of precipitation, surface bareness, and 10 â€‰m wind speed. Moreover, including convective parameters such as convective inhibition (CIN) and convective available potential energy (CAPE) better explains the variations and trends over the Great Plains from spring to fall. While the positive trend of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> concentration in the Southwest in spring is associated with precipitation deficit, the increasing of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> over the central Great Plains in summer is largely associated with an enhancing of CIN and a weakening of CAPE, which are related to increased atmospheric stability due to surface drying and lower troposphere warming. The positive trend of the Great Plains low-level jet also contributes to the increasing of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> concentration in the central Great Plains in summer via its connections with surface winds and CIN.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{whether or not there is}} a relationship between the lung function of school children and the ability of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> particles in the air to generate radicals. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: Six primary schools in locations with different traffic volumes were selected in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Air samples were taken in these schools over a period of 4 days; the concentration of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> was measured in the 6 pooled samples. Lung function tests were performed in children in the age of 8 - 13 and their parents filled out a questionnaire on the state of their children's health. RESULTS: An average of 66 % of the children (184 girls and 158 boys, with an average age of 10 years (range: 8 - 13 years)) participated. The average FEV 1 for the children from the 6 schools was not related with the total amount of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> particles in the air. However, a lower average FEV 1 was associated with a higher radical-generating capacity in the air samples. No direct association was observed between the radical-generating capacity of the dust and the traffic intensity. CONCLUSION: There was a clear relationship between lung function and the radical-generating capacity of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> in the air.
