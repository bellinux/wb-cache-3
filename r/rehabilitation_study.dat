50|$|IPS {{was first}} studied in a {{randomized}} controlled trial in 1996. Between 1996 and 2011, IPS was evaluated in 15 randomized controlled trials. This research has established IPS as an evidence-based practice in community psychiatry. Studies in {{this body of}} research typically compare IPS to another approach to vocational <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Study</b> participants are randomized to receive services {{from one of the}} vocational approaches being studied. Researchers observe the proportion of participants in each group who get jobs within some fixed period of time. This follow-up period varies across studies from 6 months to 30 months, averaging 18 months. On average, 60% of research participants get a competitive job during the follow-up period when they receive IPS, whereas 24% of participants get a competitive job when receiving other vocational services. These results, along with data from non-research implementations of IPS, have resulted in the establishment of benchmark employment rates for IPS programs.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of a web-based audit and feedback (A&F) intervention with outreach visits to support decision-making by multidisciplinary teams. We performed a multicentre cluster-randomized trial within the field of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in the Netherlands. Our participants were multidisciplinary teams in Dutch CR centres who were enrolled in the study between July 2012 and December 2013 and received the intervention for at least 1 year. The intervention included web-based A&F with feedback on clinical performance, facilities for goal setting and action planning, and educational outreach visits. Teams were randomized either to receive feedback that was limited to psychosocial <b>rehabilitation</b> (<b>study</b> group A) or to physical <b>rehabilitation</b> (<b>study</b> group B). The main outcome measure was the difference in performance between study groups in 11 care processes and six patient outcomes, measured at patient level. Secondary outcomes included effects on guideline concordance for the four main CR therapies. Data from 18 centres (14, 847 patients) were analysed, of which 12 centres (9353 patients) were assigned to group A and six (5494 patients) to group B. During the intervention, a total of 233 quality improvement goals was identified by participating teams, of which 49 (21 %) were achieved during the study period. Except for a modest improvement in data completeness (4. 5 % improvement per year; 95 % CI 0. 65 to 8. 36), we found no effect of our intervention on any of our primary or secondary outcome measures. Within a multidisciplinary setting, our web-based A&F intervention engaged teams to define local performance improvement goals but failed to support them in actually completing the improvement actions that were needed to achieve those goals. Future research should focus on improving the actionability of feedback on clinical performance and on addressing the socio-technical perspective of the implementation process. NTR 325...|$|E
40|$|A memory <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>study</b> was {{conducted}} with two patients with contrasting impairments in verbal short-term memory (STM) : one with impaired phonological STM (pSTM) and one with impaired semantic STM (sSTM). Two treatments were employed, each designed to improve separate aspects of STM: phonological and semantic. The pSTM treatment selectively improved sensitivity to phonological effects in STM, and the sSTM treatment brought about increased lexical effects on verbal STM performance. There was also some evidence of type-specific generalisation to sentence comprehension, in that the pSTM patient showed post-treatment improvement on sentence repetition after the pSTM treatment, and the sSTM patient showed improved sentence anomaly judgement after the sSTM but not the pSTM treatment. The findings are discussed in relation to theories on the components involved in STM, {{and the role of}} STM in sentence processing...|$|E

Stool and blood samples were taken on admission and 3 days after initial stabilization to determine exocrine pancreatic function via fecal elastase- 1 (FE- 1) and serum trypsinogen and amylase levels. Results A total of 33 children (37. 1 %) had nonedematous severe acute malnutrition, whereas 56 (62. 9 %) had edematous severe acute malnutrition. On admission, 92 % of patients showed evidence of pancreatic insufficiency as measured by FE- 1 57 ng/mL) in 28 % and amylase in 21 % (> 110 U/L) of children, suggesting pancreatic inflammation. Conclusion Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is prevalent in children with severe acute malnutrition and especially in children with edematous severe acute malnutrition. In addition, biochemical signs suggestive of pancreatitis are common in children with severe acute malnutrition. These results have implications for standard rehabilitation treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition who may benefit from pancreatic enzyme replacement therap...|$|E

40|$|Speech {{production}} impairment is {{a frequent}} deficit observed in aphasic patients and rehabilitation programs have been extensively developed. Nevertheless, {{there is still no}} agreement on the type of rehabilitation that yields the most successful outcomes. Here, we ran a detailed meta-analysis of 39 studies of word production rehabilitation involving 124 patients. We used a model-driven approach for analyzing each rehabilitation task by identifying which levels of our model each task tapped into. We found that (1) all rehabilitation tasks are not equally efficient and the most efficient ones involved the activation of the two levels of the word production system: the phonological output lexicon and the phonological output, and (2) the activation of the speech perception system as it occurs in many tasks used in rehabilitation is not successful in rehabilitating word production. In this meta-analysis, the effect of the activation of the phonological output lexicon and the phonological output cannot be assessed separately. We further conducted a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>study</b> with DPI, a patient who suffers from a damage of the phonological output lexicon.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} ethics of parental refusal of auditory–oral hearing <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Study</b> Design: Case study with medical ethical {{discussion}} and review. Methods: Two young brothers present with severe-to-profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss. The parents, both of whom have normal hearing and work as sign language interpreters, have decided {{to raise their children}} with American Sign Language as their only form of communication. They have chosen not to pursue cochlear implantation nor support the use of hearing aids. Discussion: This case raises significant questions concerning whether hearing rehabilitation should be mandated, and if there are circumstances in which parental preferences should be questioned or overridden with regard to this issue. In addi-tion, legal concerns may be raised regarding the possible need to file a report with Child Protective Services. Although similar cases involving the Deaf community have historically favored parental rights to forego hearing rehabilitation with either coch-lear implantation or hearing aids, we explore whether conclusions should be different because the parents in this case are not hearing impaired. Conclusions: The ethics of parental rights to refuse hearing rehabilitation are complex and strikingly context-dependent. A comprehensive appreciation of the medical, practical, and legal issues is crucial prior to intervening in such challenging situations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} how a multilevel item response theory (IRT) model for longitudinal dependent data could provide average and individual quality-of-life outcomes of low-vision <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Study</b> Design and Setting: In a nonrandomized longitudinal design, visually impaired older patients (n = 296) {{were referred to}} multidisciplinary rehabilitation or to an optometric service. The five-dimensional Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire was administered at four time points. The IRT model was characterized by the graded response model for rating scales. Covariates {{were added to the}} model, mainly to correct for missing data. The invariance assumption across time points was investigated. Results: Average and individual rehabilitation effects were estimated. For multidisciplinary rehabilitation, significant average deterioration was seen on three dimensions after 4. 4 years. Many individuals in the optometric service group significantly improved on the "reading small print" dimension (18. 5 %); in both groups, many individuals significantly deteriorated on "visual (motor) skills" (22. 2 - 30. 0 %). Invariance across time points could be assumed for all dimensions, except for "adjustment. " Gender, education, visual acuity, and health status were significantly associated with the outcome.

Design: A cross-sectional survey was employed. Methods: Elite athletes (Study 1 : N = 214; Study 2 : N = 533) completed the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire and psychometric measures of constructs from the TPB, {{with respect to their}} rehabilitation from sport injury in a hypothetical scenario (Study 1), or their injury prevention experiences (Study 2). Results: Partial least squares path analytic models indicated acceptable fit of the hypothesised model in all samples, and consistently found in both studies that autonomous motivation from SDT was positively associated with attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control from the TPB, and these three TPB variables positively predicted intentions of injury rehabilitation and prevention. Controlled motivation from SDT was, unexpectedly, positively linked to intentions, but the effect was smaller than that for autonomous motivation. Conclusions: Motivational regulations from SDT might serve as sources of information that influence athletes' intentions through their impact on the attitude, perceived social norm and controllability of injury rehabilitation and prevention. © 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
