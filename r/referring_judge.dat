40|$|In {{the order}} under examination, the Constitutional Court {{declared}} manifestly ill-founded the issue concerning the conformity with the Fundamental Chart {{of the temporal}} application regime set forth in article 4 -ter of Law Decree 7 April 2000, no. 82, {{with respect to the}} possibility to access summary trial (‘giudizio abbreviato’), according to the new regulation introduced by Law 16 December 1999, no. 479 and amended by article 7 of the same Law Decree no. 82 / 2000. The Constitutional Court held unequivocally that the above provision, being strictly procedural in its nature, is not subject to the criminal statute on the succession of law provided for by article 2 of the Criminal Code. The Court escaped the demand for adaptation by the <b>referring</b> <b>Judge</b> of the enforcement phase, who reported an inequality of treatment for those defendants not entitled to request to have access to the ‘new’ special procedure, due to the exhaustion of the remedies in the merit of the case. This although they could claim a similar - but not identical at all – position to the one which has been the object the previous ruling of the ECHR in the case Scoppola v. Italy...|$|E
40|$|By {{an order}} of 21 March 2013, the Court of Cassation {{referred}} to the Constitutional Court the question of constitutionality of the current Italian electoral law {{on the grounds that}} it runs counter to the constitutional principles of free and equal suffrage. The Constitutional Court has been called by the <b>referring</b> <b>judge</b> to focus on three main aspects of law: the closed list system; the majority bonus in the Chamber of Deputies, by which the coalition that wins the highest number of votes receives at least 55 % of the seats; and the majority bonus in the Senate, which is assigned on a regional level. While the Court of Cassation affirmed that the constitutional principles on the right to vote have to be interpreted in the light of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the ECHR, it did not make any reference to the ECtHR Case-Law on political rights. However, in this article it will be argued that, while this Case-Law cannot give strong arguments in favour of the constitutional illegitimacy of the different aspects of the electoral law, if they are considered separately, it becomes very interesting instead, if these aspects are considered as a whole. The article defends the position that the combined effects of those multiple aspects on the composition of the Italian Parliament produce a problem of respect of the “will of the people”, in breach of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the ECHR...|$|E

Although Peruzzi did not <b>refer</b> directly to <b>Judge</b> X in the circulatory letter, it was evident that the criticism was aimed at Judge X specifically.|$|R

Typically these complaints have no effect on the reputation of the judge in question.
