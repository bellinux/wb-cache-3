40|$|Ion beams in the {{kiloelectronvolt}} energy range impinging on crystal {{surfaces are}} atomic-size probes of the nanoscale magnifying and focusing "lenses" {{formed by the}} periodic structures, These lenses disperse the scattered and <b>recoiled</b> <b>atom</b> trajectories into macroscopic projections according to their velocities {{as a function of}} projectile/target atom masses and deflection angles. The resulting patterns reflect the near-surface interatomic vectors. The spatially and temporally resolved images of these patterns can now be acquired by means of new developments in ion scattering spectrometry, providing direct, element-specific. real-space projections of surface structure. The resulting scattering and recoiling imaging spectrometry (SARIS) provides unique capabilities for analyzing surface composition and structure and for investigating the interactions of ions with surfaces. A classical ion trajectory program called scattering and recoiling imaging code (SARIC) that simulates the spatial and time intensity distributions of the SARIS images has been developed. A quantitative comparison of experimental and simulated images is achieved by means of a two-dimensional reliability (R) factor. Examples of applications include experimental stereographic projections of the Ni(110) and Pt(111) surfaces, the termination layer of the CdS(0001) surface, the chemisorption of Cl- 2 on Ni(110) and H- 2 On Pt(111), and the atomic lenses in the Pt(111) surface...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} two models which exhibit equilibrium BEC superradiance. They {{are related to}} {{two different types of}} superradiant scattering observed in recent experiments. The first one corresponds to the amplification of matter-waves due to Raman superradiant scattering from a BE condensate, when the recoiled and the condensed atoms are in different internal states. The main mechanism is stimulated Raman scattering in two-level atoms, which occurs in a superradiant way. Our second model is related to the superradiant Rayleigh scattering from a BE condensate. This again leads to a matter-waves amplification but now with the <b>recoiled</b> <b>atoms</b> in the same state as the atoms in the condensate.

By using ion exchange column chromatography as a new method of separation of the mixed Re 77 BrBr 5 -nCl 2 -n species larger amounts of the irradiated material could be separated following the dissolution. The yield of Re 77 BrBr 2 - 5 increases, the yield of Re 77 BrCl 2 - 5 decreases significantly with increasing K 2 ReBr 6 concentration, all the other mixed hexabromochlororhenates and the free bromide-(77 Br) are only little dependent of the mixed crystal composition at least at concentrations below 50 mol-% K 2 ReBr 6. For zero K 2 ReBr 6 content we obtained by extrapolation : 77 Br- 16 % Re 77 BrBr 2 - 5 3 % Re 77 BrBr 4 Cl 2 - 5 % Re 77 BrBr 3 Cl 2 - 2 5 % Re 77 BrBr 2 Cl 2 - 3 6 % Re 77 BrBrCl 2 - 4 16 % Re 77 BrCl 2 - 5 49 % The total bromine content (active 77 Br and inactive 79, 81 Br) of the recoil labelled species amounts to 31 % at zero K 2 ReBr 6 concentration clearly indicating that on the average two bromide ligands (one of them being 77 Br, the other inactive) of the original six survive the nuclear process and are still bonded to their original Re central atom. Especially {{the appearance of the}} more intimately mixed species cannot be explained by models discussed hitherto in the literature [6] (billiard ball impact, ligand vacancy exchange followed by combination [7], hot spot reaction).
