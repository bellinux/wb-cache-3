The generation of the hydrocarbon containing two { 7, 5 } ring pairs {{appears to be an}} innate process compared with the honeycomb lattice when the C 2 fragment is inserted into the vacant space of the hexagonal belt. A very small amount of excitation energy (0. 0108 kcal/mol) is required for the annihilation of a { 7, 5 } <b>ring</b> <b>pair</b> to a { 6, 5 } <b>ring</b> <b>pair.</b> Considering two common frames, the motion of the { 7, 5 } and { 6, 5 } ring pairs are studied.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the optimal flight trajectories {{in the presence of a}} three-dimensional windshear. Both the take-off and abort landing problems are studied. A mathematical model of a three-dimensional windshear is developed by the superposition of the flow fields of two symmetric vortex rings with appropriate parameters (circulation strength, radius, height). The flow field produced by this vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pair</b> is close to that of a real microburst. The wind components are functions of the geometric coordinates and can be obtained using either the Biot-Savart law or the properties of the stream function. With this wind model, the strongest windshear and downdraft are located in a vertical plane passing through the central axis of the vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pair.</b> Therefore, in the computation of flight trajectories, the aircraft is assumed to fly in this vertical plane. Two cases are considered: (A) at the initial time, the aircraft is located in the region of strongest headwind; (B) at the initial time, the aircraft is located in the region of weak-to-moderate headwind. Case A implies late detection, while Case B implies early detection of windshear. Optimal trajectories are computed for both take-off and abort landing. For the take-off problem, the performance index being minimized is the peak value of the deviation of the absolute path inclination from a reference value; for the abort landing problem, the performance index being minimized is the peak value of the altitude drop. The resulting optimal control problems are Chebyshev problems, which are converted into Bolza problems via suitable transformations. Then, the Bolza problems are solved by using the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm (SGRA). Numerical computations for both the take-off and abort landing problems lead to the following conclusions: (i) The survival capability of the optimal trajectory is superior to that of the constant pitch trajectory and the maximum angle of attack trajectory; this means that near-optimal guidance schemes should be developed to improve the survival capability of an aircraft in a severe windshear. (ii) For the optimal trajectories, the survival capability in Case B (early detection) is superior to that in Case A (late detection); this indicates that early detection of a windshear can enhance the safety of flight...|$|E

A series of hairpin polyamides with tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR) attached to an internal pyrrole ring were synthesized, and the fluorescence properties of the polyamide-fluorophore conjugates in the presence and absence of duplex DNA were examined. We observe weak TMR fluorescence in the absence of DNA. Addition of ≥ 1 : 1 match DNA affords a significant fluorescence increase over equimolar mismatch DNA for each polyamide-TMR conjugate. Polyamide-fluorophore conjugates offer a new class of sensors for the detection of specific DNA sequences without the need for denaturation. The polyamide-dye fluorescence-based method can be used to screen in parallel the interactions between aromatic ring pairs and the minor groove of DNA even when the binding site contains a non-Watson-Crick DNA base pair.

40|$|Proteasome {{assembly}} is a {{rapid and}} highly sequential process that occurs {{through a series}} of intermediates. While the quest to understand the exact process of assembly is ongoing, there remains an incomplete understanding of what happens early on during the process, prior to the involvement of the β subunits. A significant feature of proteasome assembly is the property of proteasomal subunits to self-assemble. While archaeal α and β subunits from Thermoplasma acidophilum can assemble into entire 20 S units in vitro, certain α subunits from divergent species have a property to self-assemble into single and double heptameric rings. In this study, we have shown that recombinant α subunits from Methanococcus maripaludis also have a tendency to self-assemble into higher order structures when expressed in E. coli. Using a novel cross-linking strategy, we were able to establish that these higher order structures were double α rings that are structurally similar to a half-proteasome (i. e. an α-β <b>ring</b> <b>pair).</b> Our experiments on M. maripaludis α subunits represent the first biochemical evidence for the orientation of rings in an α ring dimer. We also investigated self-assembly of α subunits in S. cerevisiae and attempted to characterize a highly stable and unique high molecular weight complex (HMWC) that is formed upon co-expression of α 5, α 6, α 7 and α 1 in E. coli. Using our cross-linking strategy, we were able to show that this complex is a double α ring in which, at the least, one α 1 subunit is positioned across itself. We were also able to detect α 1 -α 1 crosslinks in high molecular weight complexes that are formed when α 7 and α 1 are co-expressed, and when α 6, α 7 and α 1 are co-expressed in E. coli. The fact that we able to observe α 1 -α 1 crosslinks in higher order structures that form whenever α 7 and α 1 were present suggests that α 1 -α 1 crosslinks might be able to serve as potential trackers to detect HMWCs in vivo. This would be an important step in determining if these HMWCs represent bona fide assembly intermediates, or dead-end complexes whose formation must be prevented in order to ensure efficient proteasome assembly. ...|$|E

The structural diversity of proteins makes them highly attractive as self-assembling bio-bricks or 'tectons' for the fabrication of biocompatible materials. In the current study, ring-forming Lsm proteins were exploited to construct novel nanostructures via supramolecular engineering. The Lsm family of proteins comprise {{the core of the}} ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, crucial to RNA metabolism. They assemble into oligomeric rings of six to eight protein chains in vitro to generate an RNA-binding scaffold. Synthetic ring tectons composed of individual or fused Lsm sequences from S. cerevisiae were engineered so as to self assemble into simplified ring structures. My work focused on two polyprotein forms, fusions of Lsm[4 + 1] and Lsm[2 + 3]. In solution these recombinant Lsm polyproteins self-organise into robust string structures (7. 5 nm x 5. 0 nm), that maintain their intrinsic RNA-binding ability. Elevated levels of overlaid <b>ring</b> <b>pairs</b> are favoured at low ionic strength, indicating electrostatic mediated packing of Lsm rings. SAXS output reveals these <b>ring</b> <b>pairs</b> to be assembled in a staggered conformation rather than coaxially stacked. Using chemical modification, Lsm tectons were further fabricated into new coherent architectures. Cys residues engineered into two opposing tecton faces promoted covalent interactions between rings, generating disulfide-bonded Lsm[4 + 1]₄ clusters (11 - 12 nm) that were readily disengaged by reduction agents. This cluster coordination, resulting in organisations that are sensitive to EDTA, salt concentration and pH. A Ni²⁺-chelated Lsm[4 + 1]₄ cluster displayed structural similarities to its Cys-linked counterpart; this four-ringed assembly possessing an increased stability compared to Lsm[4 + 1]₄, although RNA-binding was compromised. In the presence of Cu²⁺ or Co²⁺ the tecton Lsm 3 ₈ organised as <b>ring</b> <b>pairs</b> that were coaxially organised, so displaying potential as a precursor to an Lsm-based tubule. This thesis also describes crystallisation progress towards and atomic-resolution structure of the Lsm[4 + 1]₄ tecton. With highly pure samples, screening and optimisation across a range of conditions and crstallisation avenues allowed collection of six native datasets (at ̃ 3 Å). This data could serve to solve the first crystal structure of an Lsm polyprotein ring at high resolution. The use of Lsm rings to construct new and functional nanostructures is still in its infancy. However, this project illustrates their potential as robust and highly stable tectons, suitable for engineering endeavours. The construction of Lsm tectons into controllable higher-order superstructures, discussed in this thesis, may have future applications in RNA housing and delivery capsules or as next-generation bio-inspired nanosensors.
