40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of reciprocating hydraulic seals radically decreased {{the efficiency and}} immensely reduced the seal housing volumes and also the overall economy of high pressure hydraulic drives. To reveal tribological behaviour of reciprocating seals {{it is necessary to}} analyse the relationships of seal design, tribological features and the main operating characteristics. For environmental protection leakage control has great importance. Leakage calculation of reciprocating high pressure hydraulic seals is based on the sealing pressure distribution profiles, i. e. diagrams which are playing an important role in research and {{development of}} piston and piston <b>rod</b> <b>seals</b> too.

The seal was pressurised to reproduce actual working conditions. A data postprocessing methodology was developed for an indirect evaluation of contact pressure starting from the experimental data set of the radial force exerted by the seal on the rod.

40|$|Reciprocating rod seals {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} systems to prevent the hydraulic fluid from leaking into and polluting the environment. In this research an elastohydrodynamic model of a generalized reciprocating hydraulic <b>rod</b> <b>seal,</b> including mixed lubrication and surface roughness, has been successfully developed. This model consists of coupled fluid mechanics, contact mechanics, thermal analysis and deformation analyses. Such model is capable of predicting the key seal performance characteristics, especially net leakage and friction force. This allows evaluation of potential seal designs and serves as design tools. Also as this model has been developed, the basic physics of seal operation has been clarified, which stimulates the development of innovative seal concepts, such as seals with engineered sealing surfaces. The {{results of this study}} indicate that in general, hydraulic rod seals operate in the mixed lubrication regime, although under certain conditions full film lubrication may occur over a portion of the sealing zone. The roughness of the seal surface and the rod speeds play important roles in determining whether or not a seal will leak. Cavitation during the outstroke and partial full film lubrication during the instroke tend to prevent net leakage. The behavior of a reciprocating hydraulic <b>rod</b> <b>seal</b> with a double lip or two seals in tandem arrangement can be very different from that of a similar seal with a single lip. For the double lip seal, the secondary lip can strongly affect the behavior of the primary lip by producing an elevated pressure in the interlip region. The same seal characteristics that promote effective sealing in a single lip seal and, in addition structural decoupling of multiple lips, are found to promote effective sealing in a multiple lip seal. The model is validated through comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements and observations by industry partners. The results have shown the predicted leakage and friction force for various seal and operation conditions are consistent with the measurements. A seal with micro-pattern on the sealing surface also has been investigated. The results indicate that an elaborately designed pattern can improve the sealing characteristics of the seal, without significantly affecting the friction force. In the end, the selection of the <b>rod</b> <b>seal</b> for a specific application using this analytical model is demonstrated. The best design can be picked up before a prototype being built. Ph. D.

40|$|The sealing {{efficiency}} {{and the extent}} of the friction force in an elastomeric seal - counterpart sliding contact depend highly on the contact characteristics at the interface. In particular, a deep knowledge of the interface contact pressure is needed. The work herein described deals with the design of a new test bench for an indirect contact pressure measurement. In particular, the radial force exerted by a <b>rod</b> <b>seal</b> sliding on a sensor-equipped portion of a cylinder rod is measured; during the seal displacement, the contact area between the seal and the sensorequipped rod increases, so that the radial force trend during time can be acquired. Taking the sliding velocity at a low constant value, contact pressure can be indirectly computed by differentiating the force signal. This way it is possible to perform measurements without introducing a third body between the seal and its counterpart, so avoiding any modification of the contact surface. Initially, the test bench working principle is described, highlighting all critical aspects related to the radial force transmission from the seal to the load sensor; subsequently, the test bench requirements were defined. Finally, the design solution was presente...|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic and {{pneumatic}} {{linear actuators}} move unsteady when they start-up from a standstill or {{a reversal of}} the direction occurs {{at the end of the}} stroke. In high dynamic special applications, the friction significantly affects the moving behaviour. In contrast to previous steady-state investigations, the seal friction is considered in the context of this work as a function of acceleration. For this purpose, experimental as well as numerical methods are developed. Measurements of the friction forces of hydraulic <b>rod</b> <b>seals</b> are carried out using a test rig driven by a crank mechanism. The results for different seal geometries, varying pressures and temperatures at speeds of up to 10 m/s are discussed. In addition, a newly developed measurement principle for pneumatic <b>rod</b> <b>seals</b> is designed and enables to detect the seal friction with minimised disturbances. The influence of seal geometry, material, installation situation, pressure, grease and seal dimensions are systematically investigated using the pneumatic test rig. Due to the increasing importance of analytical and numerical methods in the development process of sealing systems, two simulation approaches are presented to calculate the friction force. The well-known inverse hydrodynamic approach (IHL) is a simplified calculation method, whereas the developed elastohydrodynamic model (EHD or EHL) allows a physically more accurate reproduction. Finally, comparisons between measurements using an O-ring operated at different conditions and corresponding simulations show the suitability of the numerical models for hydrodynamic lubrication conditions...|$|R

40|$|Non-linear seal {{friction}} can {{impede the}} performance of hydraulic actuation systems designed for high precision positioning with favourable dynamic response. Methods for predicting seal friction are required to help develop sealing systems {{for this type of}} application. Recent simulation techniques have claimed progress, although have yet to be validated experimentally. A conventional reciprocating <b>rod</b> <b>seal</b> is analysed using established elastohydrodynamic theory and the mixed lubrication Greenwood-Williamson-average Reynolds model. A test rig was used to assess the accuracy of the simulation results for both instroke and outstroke. Inverse hydrodynamic theory is shown to predict a U 0. 5 power law between rod speed and friction. Comparison with experimental data shows the theory to be qualitatively inaccurate and to predict friction levels an order of magnitude lower than those measured. It was not possible to model the regions very close to the inlet and outlet due to the high pressure gradients {{at the edges of the}} contact. The mixed lubrication model produces friction levels within the correct order of magnitude, although incorrectly predicts higher friction during instroke than outstroke. Previous experiments have reported higher friction during instroke than outstroke for rectangular seals, suggesting that the mixed lubrication model used could possibly be suitable for symmetric seals, although not for seal tribology in general...|$|E
40|$|There is {{observed}} deviation of endurance in dynamic and static sealings in the hydrau-lic system {{of an airplane}} which is suspected {{to be caused by}} differences in material and quality between different manufacturers. In order to find out and verify these dif-ferences series of comparing tests were conducted on specifically made test equip-ment. The main goal of this Master’s Thesis was to perform the needed tests on the seals and to evaluate the test results. The test system consisted of a hydraulically driven test cylinder which was able to test both the dynamic and static seal. The test cylinder was designed {{in such a way that}} it could be used to test two sealing systems at the same time. The test was conducted in conditions that resembled real life usage. The main points were that pressure, tempera-ture and movement speed were the same as in the original application. Control logic was used to run the test cylinder continuously from one end to the other. During the test the force needed to move the cylinder was monitored. From this force the friction and the deviation of friction behavior in dynamic seal during the test were computed. Leakage was monitored both on the dynamic seal and on the static seal. Pressures, position and temperature were also used as survey measures. Speed of the test cylinder was calculated from position. The system allowed testing of two piston seals, two rod seals and two O-rings simultaneously. Both piston seal and <b>rod</b> <b>seal</b> were T-seals. T-seals consist of a T-shaped elastomer sealing element supported by back-up rings on both sides. The wearing of seals was determined by change of weight before and after the experiment. The possible effect of absorption of fluid on the mass and properties of the sealing was examined with separate tests. The properties of the seals between the two manufacturers differed in the present study and the seals of manufacturer 2 lasted wearing better than the seals of manufacturer 1. This result is based on the leakage during the test, weighting after the test and friction behavior during the test. Also visual observation of the seals supports this finding...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{describes}} the phenomena {{connected with the}} sealing for water hydraulic systems. Design/methodology/approach: For the durability tests two types of sealings, made of three polymeric materials recommended for use in water hydraulics systems have been used. In all investigation arrangements the same guide elements have been used. The tests have been performed maintaining water pressure on the sealing {{at a level of}} p = 8 ± 1 MPa and the average speed of the piston rod of v ≈ 0. 35 m/sec. Water temperature during investigations was regulated within the range of Tmin = 291 K and Tmax = 305 K. The leakage was distributed to the measurement hoses with the internal diameter of 5 mm. For the investigations, the working piston rod with ø 45 f 7 with the following parameters has been used: Material: chromium-nickel steel AISI 431 (Cr= 16. 7 %, Ni= 2. 08 %) covered with hard chromium plating of ≥ 20 μm, micro-cracks number ≤ 5 000 /mm 2, Ra = 0. 07 μm. Findings: Weibull method, thanks to its multifunctionality, helps to select elements for certain applications (required long failure-free mileages → high characteristic durability – sealings series 30413). Equipment which works sporadically → low characteristic durability but e. g. lower weight and sizes of sealing element – sealing series 30412.

40|$|When {{operating}} the anvil hammers there occur impacts of die tooling {{and as a}} consequence, virtually instantaneous impact stops of motion of drop hammer parts. Such operating conditions come with accelerated failures of the anvil hammer rods because of emerging significant wave stresses. Engineering practice widely uses variation, difference, and integral methods to calculate wave stresses. However, to use them a researcher has to acquire certain skills, and the special programs should be available. The paper considers a method for estimating the wave stress changes in the anvil hammer rods, {{which is based on}} the wave equation of the Laplace transform. It presents a procedure for generating differential equations and their solution using the operator method. These equations describe the wave processes of strain and stress propagation in the anvil hammer rod under non-rigid impact with the compliance obstacle of the drop hammer parts. The work defines how the piston and rod mass and also the mechanical and geometric parameters of the rod influence on the stress level in the <b>rod</b> <b>sealing</b> of the hammer ram. Analysis of the results shows that the stresses in the <b>rod</b> <b>sealing</b> are proportional to the total amount of wave stresses caused by the rod and piston impact included in the total weight of the system. The piston influence on the stresses in the rod under impact is in direct proportion to the ratio of its mass to the mass of the rod. Geometric parameters of the rod and speed of drop parts before the impact influence on the stress value as well. It was found that if the time of impact is less than the time of the shock wave running in forward and backward direction, the impact with a compliance obstacle is equivalent to that of with a rigid obstacle, and the dependence of the wave stresses follows the Zhukovsky formula of direct pressure shock. The presented method of stress calculation can be successfully used to select the optimal mass and the rod and piston geometric parameters under non-rigid impact without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation until stiff stop of drop hammer parts...|$|R
