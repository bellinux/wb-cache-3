50|$|The Hornet was {{developed}} in the 1950s to provide British and Australian airborne units with an air-dropped long-range anti-tank capability. Based on the British Army's FV1611 Humber Pig one-tonne (0.98 tons) 4X4 armoured truck, it carried two Malkara, missiles on a <b>retractable</b> <b>boom</b> at the rear, as well as two reloads. It could be transported by air in a Blackburn Beverley and air-dropped on a cluster of 6 special parachutes.|$|E
40|$|The Tethered Satellite System (TSS) is {{scheduled}} for launch, on STS- 46 in mid- 1992. The major mission objective is to investigate electrodynamic phenomena associated with long electrically conductive tether, in the earth orbital environment. A spherical Satellite (1. 6 -m diameter), remains connected to the Orbiter throughout TSS- 1 mission by a conductive tether. The Satellite operates at up to 20 km above the Orbiter during the TSS mission. The Tip Canister (TPC), that is mounted {{on the end of}} a 12 -m <b>retractable</b> <b>boom,</b> contains mechanisms that control and monitor tether movement. The TPC is an independent thermal system from the base 'Deployer/Spacelab Pallet'. This paper presents the TPC thermal design verification approach that includes a description of thermal design and thermal balance testing. Flight TPC temperature predictions are also presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{simultaneous}} control of three dimensional translation and rotation of an underactuated multibody space robot using sliding masses that are configured as ideal prismatic actuators. A crucial {{assumption is that}} the total linear and angular momenta of the space robot are zero. The prismatic actuators may be intentional actuation devices {{or they may be}} dual-use devices such as <b>retractable</b> <b>booms,</b> tethers, or antennas that can also serve as space robot actuation devices. The paper focuses on the underactuation case, i. e., the space robot has three independent prismatic actuators, which are used to control the six base body degrees of freedom. Controllability results are developed, revealing controllability properties for the base body translation, base body attitude, and actuator displacement. Based on the controllability results, an algorithm for rest-to-rest base body maneuvers is constructed using a Lie bracket expansion. An exampl...|$|R
50|$|Unusually for a radio telescope, {{the primary}} {{reflector}} is an off-axis segment of a paraboloid. This {{is the same}} design used in familiar home satellite television (e.g., DirecTV) dishes. The asymmetric reflector allows the telescope's focal point and feed horn to be located {{at the side of}} the dish, so that it and its <b>retractable</b> support <b>boom</b> do not obstruct the incoming radio waves, as occurs in conventional radio telescope designs with the feed located on the telescope's beam axis.|$|R
40|$|To realize design concepts, predict dynamic {{behavior}} and develop appropriate control strategies for high performance {{operation of a}} solar-sail spacecraft, we developed a simple analytical model that represents dynamic behavior of spacecraft with various sizes. Since motion of the vehicle is dominated by retractable booms that support the structure, our study concentrates on developing and validating a dynamic model of a long <b>retractable</b> <b>boom.</b> Extensive tests with various configurations were conducted for the 30 Meter, light-weight, retractable, lattice boom at NASA MSFC that is structurally and dynamically {{similar to those of}} a solar-sail spacecraft currently under construction. Experimental data were then compared with the corresponding response of the analytical model. Though mixed results were obtained, the analytical model emulates several key characteristics of the boom. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of issues observed during the study...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{in-orbit}} performance of the longest <b>retractable</b> <b>boom</b> (OSSâ€™ AstroTube) that has ever been deployed and retracted from a 3 U Cubesat. AstroTube is hosted by AlSat- 1 N, a 3 U technology demonstrator CubeSat collaboration between the space agencies of the UK and Algeria. Agile development of the boom payload saw it progressed to TRL 6 in less than 20 months; further platform-level integration and testing through to launch were completed within 30 months. AstroTube combines novel, proprietary materials and proven actuation principles to deploy a low mass 1. 5 m-long 1 -DOF motion structure. It incorporates a novel deployment mechanism for actuation and a flexible composite structure for the boom element. The boom element possesses very low length-density with tuneable bending and torsional stiffness characteristics. The boom payload is housed within a 1 U volume and has a total mass of 0. 61 kg. A {{brief description of the}} payload and the test campaign is provided together with relevant results from this project phase. The AlSat- 1 N platform carries high definition cameras (supplied by the Open University in UK) which enabled visual confirmation of successful boom commissioning and deployment. Relevant data and high definition in-orbit images are also provided in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Space travel {{propelled}} by solar sails {{is motivated by}} the fact that the momentum exchange that occurs when photons are reflected and/or absorbed by a large solar sail generates a small but constant acceleration. This acceleration can induce a constant thrust in very large sails that is sufficient to maintain a polar observing satellite in a constant position relative to the Sun or Earth. For long distance propulsion, square sails (with side length greater than 150 meters) can reach Jupiter in two years and Pluto in less than ten years. Converting such design concepts to real-world systems will require accurate analytical models and model parameters. This requires extensive structural dynamics tests. However, the low mass and high flexibility of large and light weight structures such as solar sails makes them unsuitable for ground testing. As a result, validating analytical models is an extremely difficult problem. On the other hand, a fundamental question can be asked. That is whether an analytical model that represents a small-scale version of a solar-sail boom can be extended to much larger versions of the same boom. To answer this question, we considered a long deployable boom that will be used to support the solar sails of the sail-craft. The length of fully deployed booms of the actual solar sail-craft will exceed 100 meters. However, the test-bed we used in our study is a 30 meter <b>retractable</b> <b>boom</b> at MSFC. We first develop analytical models based on Lagrange s equations and the standard Euler-Bernoulli beam. Then the response of the models will be compared with test data of the 30 meter boom at various deployed lengths. For this stage of study, our analysis was limited to experimental data obtained at 12 ft and 18 ft deployment lengths. The comparison results are positive but speculative. To observe properly validate the analytic model, experiments at longer deployment lengths, up to the full 30 meter, have been requested. We expect the study to answer the extendibility question of the analytical models. In operation, rapid temperature changes can be induced in solar sails as they transition from day to night and vice versa. This generates time dependent thermally induced forces, which may in turn create oscillation in structural members such as booms. Such oscillations have an adverse effect on system operations, precise pointing of instruments and antennas and can lead to self excited vibrations of increasing amplitude. The latter phenomenon is known as thermal flutter and can lead to the catastrophic failure of structural systems. To remedy this problem, an active vibration suppression system has been developed. It was shown that piezoelectric actuators used in conjunction with a Proportional Feedback Control (PFC) law (or Velocity Feedback Control (VFC) law) can induce moments that can suppress structural vibrations and prevent flutter instability in spacecraft booms. In this study, we will investigate control strategies using piezoelectric transducers in active, passive, and/or hybrid control configurations. Advantages and disadvantages of each configuration will be studied and experiments to determine their capabilities and limitations will be planned. In particular, special attention will be given to the hybrid control, also known as energy recycling, configuration due to its unique characteristics...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of CubeSats, {{research}} in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) becomes possible for universities and small research groups. Only a handful of launch sites can be used, due to geographical and political restrictions. As a result, common orbits in LEO are becoming crowded due to the additional launches made possible by low-cost access to space. CubeSat design principles require a maximum of a 25 -year orbital lifetime {{in an effort to}} reduce the total number of spacecraft in orbit at any time. Additionally, since debris may survive re-entry, it is ideal to de-orbit spacecraft over unpopulated areas to prevent casualties. The Drag Deorbit Device (D 3) is a self-contained targeted re-entry subsystem intended for CubeSats. By varying the cross-wind area, the atmospheric drag can be varied {{in such a way as}} to produce desired maneuvers. The D 3 is intended to be used to remove spacecraft from orbit to reach a desired target interface point. Additionally, attitude stabilization is performed by the D 3 prior to deployment and can replace a traditional ADACS on many missions. This paper presents the hardware used in the D 3 and operation details. Four stepper-driven, repeatedly <b>retractable</b> <b>booms</b> are used to modify the cross-wind area of the D 3 and attached spacecraft. Five magnetorquers (solenoids) over three axes are used to damp rotational velocity. This system is expected to be used to improve mission flexibility and allow additional launches by reducing the orbital lifetime of spacecraft. The D 3 can be used to effect a re-entry to any target interface point, with the orbital inclination limiting the maximum latitude. In the chance that the main spacecraft fails, a timer will automatically deploy the booms fully, ensuring the spacecraft will at the minimum reenter the atmosphere in the minimum possible time, although not necessarily at the desired target interface point. Although this does not reduce the risk of casualties, the 25 -year lifetime limit is still respected, allowing a reduction of the risk associated with a hardware failure...|$|R
