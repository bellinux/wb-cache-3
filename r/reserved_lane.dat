40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} an NP-hard lane {{reservation}} problem on transportation network. By selecting <b>lanes</b> to be <b>reserved</b> {{on the existing}} transportation network under some special situations, the transportation tasks can be accomplished on the <b>reserved</b> <b>lanes</b> with satisfying the condition of time or safety. Lane reservation strategy is a flexible and economic method for traffic management. However, <b>reserving</b> <b>lanes</b> has impact on the normal traffic because the <b>reserved</b> <b>lanes</b> can only be passed by the special tasks. It should be well considered choosing <b>reserved</b> <b>lanes</b> to minimize the total traffic impact when applying the lane reservation strategy for the transportation tasks. In this paper, an integer linear program model is formulated for the considered problem and an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solve method is proposed. Some new techniques are developed for the cut-and-solve method to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical computation results of 125 randomly generated instances show that the proposed algorithm is much faster than a MIP solver of commercial software CPLEX 12. 1 to find optimal solutions on average computing time...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper studied {{an optimal}} lane {{reservation}} problem with time-dependent link travel times. It aims to design time-guaranteed paths by converting some existing general-purpose <b>lanes</b> to <b>reserved</b> <b>lanes</b> {{with the objective}} of minimizing the total traffic impact of <b>reserved</b> <b>lanes</b> on general-purpose lanes. The traffic impact is caused by <b>reserved</b> <b>lanes</b> because they can be used by some special road users only and the adjacent general-purpose lanes may be more congested. The considered problem is to NP-hard. We propose a new mixed integer nonlinear programming model and transform it to an equivalent tractable linear model. We propose a cut-and-solve based algorithm in which new strategies are developed for generating piercing cuts. Computational results show that it is much more efficient to solve the proposed new model in the paper than the model in the literature and the overall performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms a direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX on randomly generated instances...|$|R

40|$|Highways {{tend to get}} {{congested}} {{because of}} {{the increase in the number}} of cars travelling on them. There are two solutions to this. The first one, which is also expensive, consists in building new highways to support the traffic. A much cheaper alternative consists in the introduction of advanced intelligent traffic control systems to manage traffic and increase the efficiency of the already existing highways. Intelligent lane reservation system for highways (ILRSH) is such a software control system. It is designed to assist and automate the use of a highway lane as a <b>reserved</b> <b>lane.</b> The idea is to allow and support drivers to travel at a speed higher, if in return they are willing to pay a small fee to reserve an empty virtual slot on the <b>reserved</b> <b>lane.</b> This slot is valid for a portion and of the highway and a time window, so each driver pays the fee depending thier its travelling needs. In return, drivers are guaranteed a congestion-free travel on that portion. In this paper, we present the proposed architecture of the ILRSH and its subsystems. The system is based on several proposed algorithms designed to assist the drivers, enter or exit the <b>reserved</b> <b>lane,</b> based on real-world driving observations. We present extensive simulation results showing the feasibility of the proposed approach, that can easily be implemented with little costs on already-existing highways, and the increase in traffic efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work studies a lane {{reservation}} {{problem in}} a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity {{that can be used}} for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this <b>reserved</b> <b>lane</b> is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this <b>reserved</b> <b>lane</b> generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demonstrated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solve method is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} safety and {{operations}} of <b>reserved</b> <b>lane</b> facilities, with multiple interactions between vehicles. Currently, there are {{a limited number of}} studies that investigated the effects of various geometric designs impact on traffic operations along reserved-lanes, especially the specific factors that control for frequent opportunities of merging/diverging and crossing maneuvers. In this study, a VISSIM simulation model has been developed to model vehicular interactions of reserved-lanes facilities, along an arterial with interrupted traffic setup and along an uninterrupted highway segment, both located in the Montreal metro area. The model was used to evaluate {{the safety and}} traffic operations along the selected corridors by comparing the status quo with some proposed alternative design and assuming the prevailing traffic conditions. The simulation model was calibrated with real-world vehicle headways and the generated vehicle trajectories were used in a Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). An improvement of the SSAM model was achieved via a binary matrix calibration methodology, in order to identify the vehicle conflicts more accurately. This improvement helps traffic analysts to identify the potential traffic operations measures that could contribute to a reduction of vehicular conflicts. The results show that traffic operations along the corridor can be significantly improved if a different geometric alignment is used, one that would reduce the number of interaction opportunities. For example, it is shown that a 30 -meter weaving section along the analysed arterial and a 50 -meter merging section {{at the end of the}} highway bus-on-shoulder segment leads to improvements vehicles’ travel time as well as improvements in traffic safety...|$|E
40|$|Iberia Africa plate boundary, cross, roughly W-E, {{connecting}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Azores triple junction to the Continental margin of Morocco. Relative movement {{between the two}} plate change along the boundary, from transtensive near the Azores archipelago, through trascurrent movement in the middle at the Gloria Fracture Zone, to transpressive in the Gulf of Cadiz area. This study {{presents the results of}} geophysical and geological analysis on the plate boundary area offshore Gibraltar. The main topic is to clarify the geodynamic evolution of this area from Oligocene to Quaternary. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} new plate boundary is represented by a 600 km long set of aligned, dextral trascurrent faults (the SWIM lineaments) {{connecting the}} Gloria fault to the Riff orogene. The western termination of these lineaments crosscuts the Gibraltar accretionary prism and seems to reach the Moroccan continental shelf. In the past two years newly acquired bathymetric data collected in the Moroccan offshore permit to enlighten the present position of the eastern portion of the plate boundary, previously thought to be a diffuse plate boundary. The plate boundary evolution, from the onset of compression in the Oligocene to the Late Pliocene activation of trascurrent structures, is not yet well constrained. The review of available seismics lines, gravity and bathymetric data, together with the analysis of new acquired bathymetric and high resolution seismic data offshore Morocco, allows to understand how the deformation acted at lithospheric scale under the compressive regime. Lithospheric folding in the area is suggested, and a new conceptual model is proposed for the propagation of the deformation acting in the brittle crust during this process. Our results show that lithospheric folding, both in oceanic and thinned continental crust, produced large wavelength synclines bounded by short wavelength, top thrust, anticlines. Two of these anticlines are located in the Gulf of Cadiz, and are represented by the Gorringe Ridge and Coral Patch seamounts. Lithospheric folding probably interacted with the Monchique – Madeira hotspot during the 72 Ma to Recent, NNE – SSW transit. Plume related volcanism is for the first time described on top of the Coral Patch seamount, where nine volcanoes are found by means of bathymetric data. 40 Ar- 39 Ar age of 31. 4 ± 1. 98 Ma are measured from one rock sample of one of these volcanoes. Analysis on biogenic samples show how the Coral Patch act as a starved offshore seamount since the Chattian. We proposed that compression stress formed lithospheric scale structures playing as a <b>reserved</b> <b>lane</b> for the upwelling of mantle material during the hotspot transit. The interaction between lithospheric folding and the hotspot emplacement can be also responsible for the irregularly spacing, and anomalous alignments, of individual islands and seamounts belonging to the Monchique - Madeira hotspot. ...|$|E
