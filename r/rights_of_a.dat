5|$|<b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is {{laid down}} in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal enclave, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is criminal or civil. If the federal property is not an enclave, the federal government either has concurrent jurisdiction (shared authority with the state) or proprietary jurisdiction (only the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{provided}} for the recognition of unmarried partnerships, both same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting couples. It defined eligibility for a civil partnership {{and the process of}} registering a civil partnership. Rather than listing all the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil partner, it specified that all the rights of marriage would apply to anyone in a civil partnership. However, it specifically defined the dissolution process and the process for recognising foreign civil partnerships.|$|E

5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled {{by political}} and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly {{established himself as a}} man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E
5|$|Although Mapenor's time as bishop was short– {{just over}} two years– over 20 of his {{charters}} survive. These include a number for Leominster Priory and Reading Abbey. He also dealt with a dispute over the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Norman abbey, Lyre Abbey, over churches it possessed in the diocese of Hereford, settling it by making the churches part of a prebend in Hereford Cathedral held by the abbot of Lire. Mapenor supported the new king Henry III {{in his efforts to}} suppress the rebellion begun under Henry's father, King John. Mapenor was with the forces of the king before the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217. The bishop was also present when the king and Llywelyn of Gwynedd, a Welsh prince, concluded a peace treaty at Worcester in March 1218. The king employed Mapenor in April as a diplomatic escort, ordering the bishop to bring some of the southern Welsh princes to Woodstock to swear fealty to Henry III. In June of that year, Mapenor attended the consecration of the new Worcester Cathedral. He was the recipient of {{one of a series of}} writs sent to bishops to stop the persecution of Jews. These writs may have resulted from a decision of the king's council to oppose some acts of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which placed restrictions on Jews.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation of {{the causes}} of the war and its {{aftermath}} has been a controversial topic in the histories of participating countries, especially in Paraguay.

The thesis issues from the European guarantee <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to counsel and subsequently from the constitutionally guaranteed <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accused which result from the Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> and Freedoms. Then the thesis {{deals with the}} individual partial rights to counsel, while it is systematically structured to the physical defence, i. e. the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accused to serve as one's own counsel, and to the formal defence, i. e. {{the right to choose}} counsels and to consult them. The thesis also includes the survey of judicial decisions, especially concerning contentious issues of the interpretation of particular rules. The thesis does not omit the discretion de lege ferenda to current legal regulation as well...|$|R

25|$|One {{solution}} for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving {{the new owner}} an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite {{the tragedy of the}} commons as an example of what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resource, that is, to privatize it.|$|E
25|$|Children {{born out}} of {{adultery}} suffered, until recently, adverse legal and social consequences.
