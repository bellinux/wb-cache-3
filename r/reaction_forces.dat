5|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> exactly balance all the other {{internal}} and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> applied by their supports. For example, a person {{standing}} on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> is {{necessary}} for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
40|$|Background: Individuals post hip {{fracture}} decrease {{force on}} the involved limb during sit to stand tasks, creating an asymmetry in vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> Joint specific differences that underlie asymmetry of the vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> are unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare differences in vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and joint kinetics at the hip and knee in participants post-hip fracture, who were recently discharged from home care physical therapy to controls. Methods: Forty-four community-dwelling older adults, 29 who had a hip fracture and 15 elderly control participant’s completed the sit to stand task on an instrumented chair with 3 force plates. T-tests were used to compare clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, activity balance confidence and gait speed, isokinetic knee strength) and vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables. Two-way analyses of variance compared vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and kinetics at the hip and knee between hip fracture and elderly control groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations between clinical and vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables. Findings: Vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables were significantly lower on the involved side for the hip fracture group compared to the uninvolved side and controls. Lower involved side hip and knee moments and power contributed to lower involved side vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> Vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and strength had moderate to high correlations with clinical measures. Interpretation: Uninvolved side knee movements and powers were the largest contributors to asymmetrical vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> in participants post-hip fracture. The association of vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and clinical measures of function suggesting reducing vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> asymmetry may contribute to higher levels of function post-hip fracture.

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundGround <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> {{parameters}} in a sit-to-stand (STS) movement {{can be used}} {{to evaluate}} lower extremity function. Few reports, however, are available on whether the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> parameters in an STS movement reflect dynamic knee and ankle strength or power. The aims of this study were to examine associations among ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> parameters in an STS movement and isokinetic knee and ankle strength and power in healthy older adults, and to compare associations with the five-times STS test. MethodsThe following five ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> parameters were measured in 19 men and 28 women: peak <b>reaction</b> <b>force,</b> two rate of force development (RFD) parameters and two time-related parameters. ResultsRFD (Δ 90  ms) /body weight correlated significantly with average isokinetic knee extension/flexion power in both sexes (partial-r =  0. 39 – 0. 54) and average ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion power (partial-r =  0. 50 and partial-r =  0. 49, respectively), in women. No isokinetic parameters were significantly related to the five-times STS test. ConclusionGround <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> parameters in an STS movement can accurately reflect the dynamic strength and power in the lower limbs, which is approximately equal to or better than the strength and power reflected by the five-times STS test...|$|R
30|$|In Fig. 6, {{showing the}} axial <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> vs. axial {{displacement}} curves, the first linear elastic phase {{is followed by}} a plastic plateau when stirrups are not considered. The <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> remains practically constant from 2.8 mm axial displacement until concrete failure, shown by the sudden decrease in the <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> at 5.3 mm axial displacement. The almost constant normal force in the column without stirrups is explained by a sectional level balance between the exponential softening behaviour of concrete and the non-linear hardening behaviour of steel in the uniaxial constitutive laws of the layers. Concrete fails in crushing when its ultimate strain (ϵ _u^c = 0.0053) is reached and only the steel reinforcement then contributes to the axial <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> from this point on. Due to the uniaxial loading condition concrete failure occurs simultaneously in all layers, which also corresponds to the final structural failure. At 5.3  mm axial displacement the <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> suddenly drops from 19.9 to 4.2  MN due to concrete crushing.|$|R
5|$|While {{many of the}} failings in Australian command {{arrangements}} {{evident from}} {{the initial stages of}} the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard operating procedures, future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without them. Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry.|$|E

40|$|Parameters {{associated}} {{with the performance of}} countermovement jumps were identified from vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> recordings during fatigue and resting conditions. Fourteen variables were defined, dividing the vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> into negative and positive external working times and times in which the vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> values were lower and higher than the participant's body weight. We attempted to explain parameter variations by considering the relationship between the set of contractile and elastic components of the lower limbs. We determined that jumping performance is based on impulsion optimization and not on instantaneous ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> value: the time in which the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> was lower than the body weight, and negative external work time was lower under fatigue. The results suggest that, during fatigue, there is less contribution from elastic energy and from overall active state. However, the participation of contractile elements could partially compensate for the worsening of jumping performance...|$|R
