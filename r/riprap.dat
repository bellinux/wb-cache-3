5|$|Several tributaries of Aliso Creek—the Dairy Fork, Aliso Hills Channel, Munger Creek, {{and other}} smaller ones—have been {{replaced}} by storm drains. Wood Canyon Creek remains much like its original condition, despite degradation due to polluted water. Sulphur Creek has been channelized and diverted into culverts in several stretches, and English Canyon Creek has received some <b>riprap</b> stabilization and bank protection.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and <b>riprap</b> installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted <b>riprap.</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Siletz Bay is a drowned {{river valley}} filled with Holocene {{alluvial}} and estuarine sediments and {{is separated from}} the ocean by a sand spit 3. 8 km in length. Since the area was settled by white man in the 1890 's, the bay has apparently experienced rapid siltation, due to increased farming and logging. This along with the damming of the Siletz River sloughs has altered circulation patterns in the bay. Deflection of the Siletz River flow by the prograding Drift Creek delta has caused 105 m of erosion since 1912 {{on the east side}} of Siletz Spit. The ocean side of the spit suffers periodic erosional episodes separated by periods of accretion and dune building. The most recent and publicized erosion occurred during the winter of 1972 - 73 when it was feared that the spit might be breached; one partially constructed house was lost and three others were saved only by timely <b>riprapping.</b> A sand mining operation may have aggravated the recent erosion by disrupting the sand budget, the balance of sand additions and losses from the beach. All of the foredune on the spit has been stabilized by dune grass and much of it has been <b>riprapped.</b> The long term effects of stabilization and <b>riprapping</b> are uncertain...|$|R
5|$|<b>Riprap</b> {{was laid}} on the {{upstream}} face of the dam beginning November 9 of that year. In 1962, a series of labor strikes impacted communities in the Central Valley, also affecting construction of the dam, which was temporarily halted on May 3 of that year. After work restarted on June 26, pervious core material for the dam was soon out of supply, so impervious material was used to complete the dam core.|$|E
5|$|The {{valley of}} Darby Creek is {{considerably}} narrower in its upper reaches, but widens out as it approaches the Delaware River. Numerous {{reaches of the}} creek have been armored with boulders or <b>riprap.</b> Upstream of the tributary Cobbs Creek, the stream's channel is sinuous and the creek flows through a narrow valley bordered by low, steep hills. From Cobbs Creek downstream to its mouth, the creek is in a tidal flat.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a <b>riprap</b> channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E

40|$|The {{stresses}} {{the need to}} study potential environmental problems and to provide conceptual design of mitigative and compensatory measures such as excavations to enhance off-channel rearing areas and instream rock placements to reduce adverse effects of stream channelization caused by river diversions and bank armoring. Some of the other factors that minimized adverse effects of construction activities included stipulation of clearing restrictions, <b>riprapping</b> at culverts and in drainage channels, reseeding of cut-and-fill slopes, <b>riprapping</b> of cut-and-fill slopes extending into the river, inclusion of specifications for environmental protection in the contract documents, use of steel-pile bridge abutments rather than concrete, and employment of environmental monitors to inspect construction activities and assist contractors in resolving environmental problems.

50|$|Channelization {{work was}} done on 1.5 mi of Fall Brook in Carbondale by the United States Bureau of Mines in 1965. In the 1960s and 1970s, Fall Brook {{and one of its}} tributaries were {{relocated}} to help with the Carbondale mine fire project. In the 1980s, a reach of the stream near the Carbondale High School was <b>riprapped</b> to counter erosion. By the early 2000s, a United States Army Corps of Engineers project had been proposed to alleviate flow loss in the stream.|$|R
5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel girder bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective <b>riprap</b> around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective <b>riprap.</b> By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is <b>riprap</b> on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1935, the {{building}} shifted to within 2.5 {{feet from the}} edge of the cliff following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper <b>riprap</b> was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the {{watershed}} of Fall Brook are mainly forested. However, some disturbed land is in the watershed's lower reaches. Lakes in the watershed include Fall Brook Lake. A number of sawmills were built along the stream in the 19th century and a number of bridges were constructed across it in the 20th century. Projects such as channelization and <b>riprapping</b> have been done on reaches of the stream {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Fall Brook is a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.

25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on erodible soil, consisting of layers of gravel, sand and silt, inter-bedded with folded and tilted till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with <b>riprap</b> stone, but instead was back-filled with erodible soil and topped off with dry <b>riprap.</b> <b>Riprap</b> protection, inspection, and maintenance were determined to have been inadequate.|$|E
25|$|As an {{emergency}} measure, 500 tons of <b>riprap</b> was dumped along the highway, and one last {{attempt was made}} to free the vessel.

50|$|The {{lock gates}} were 56 ft wide and 90 ft high. The locks were {{carefully}} {{designed to address}} the great variation in {{the height of the}} river, the difference between high and low water being 55 ft. This condition made it necessary to build a series of three sets of gates, increasing in height from the lower entrance to the huge upper guard gate, only two sets being used at one time. When the river was low, the upper guard gates remained open continually and the lower sets were operated. When the water rose enough to drown the lower gates, they were swung open and the lifting work was done by the others. The upper approach was formed by masonry wall extending from the guard gate in a long sweep of 1200 ft, and the bank behind was armored against floods with <b>riprapped</b> stone.|$|R

During its history, extensive watershed efforts have been ongoing. However, as farmland for cropland has become more valuable and demand has increased, hilly land once used for dairy farming, grazing, and CRP has been put into row crop production.

40|$|From 1984 to 1986, the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department reconstructed and {{upgraded}} {{a portion}} of St. Hwy. 123 west of St. Hwy. 7 at Pelsor, Arkansas. As {{a result of the}} construction, portions of Haw Creek, Johnson County, Arkansas, a third order stream in the Boston Mountains Ecoregion, were straightened and channelized. In reconstructing specific stream reaches, stream banks were <b>riprapped</b> and vegetated, gabions constructed and positioned, stream substrates and pool-riffle ratios altered. Instream and riparian habitat and fish biomass and diversity in altered reaches were radically altered. Channelized reaches became wide and shallow, lacking overstory cover and pools. Substrate particle size changed from boulder/rubble to rubble/gravel/sand and velocity increased. Fish communities in channeled reaches simple; Campostoma anomalum, Notropis boops, and Etheostoma spectabile accounted for more than 80 percent of all fish captured. This represented a shift from piscivore and insectivorepiscivore to herbivore and insectivore dominated feeding guilds. Natural channel reaches had more complex fish communities and greater abundance of centrarchids and ictalurids, primarily deeper water groups. Immediately after channelization, altered reaches had a larger biomass than natural reaches (0. 43 - 0. 26 g/m^ 2). The summer following alteration, channeled segments were basically dewatered, and biomass decreased dramatically (0. 06 - 0. 1 1 g/m^ 2).

40|$|International audienceThe Sillon de Talbert {{is a large}} swash-aligned gravel barrier spit. It {{began to}} form around 6, 000 cal BP when {{relative}} sea-level rise began to slow. The spit’s sediment volume {{is estimated to be}} 1. 23 x 106 m 3 that stretch over 3. 5 km. Over the last decades, the spit experienced landward migration by rollover reaching 1. 1 m/yr at least since 1930, with maximum retreat rates of 1. 35 m/yr affecting the proximal section. This evolution has led to the construction of jetties and <b>ripraps</b> during the 70 ’s and 80 ’s in order to stabilize the spit. In 2001, management of the Sillon de Talbert was transferred to a public office (Conservatoire du Littoral), which adopted a different coastal erosion management strategy. This involved the restoration of the site and small scale occasional sediment recharge and barrier reprofiling. At the same time, a topographic yearly survey was undertaken to characterize and better understand the processes of landward displacement of the spit. This monitoring began in 2002 and is still ongoing. It is based on DGPS field measurements and/or aerial drone stereoscopic photography. The results show that the spit displacement occurs when a high tide level coincides with storm waves as it was the case during the storm event on the 10 th of March, 2008 and during the 2013 - 2014 winter storms. In that context, sluicing overwash and/or inundation regime affects the whole upper part of the spit profile, inducing retreat reaching between 20 to 30 m. Following such episodes of overwash and landward migration, the crest spit may be reformed rapidly during fair meteorological periods...|$|R
