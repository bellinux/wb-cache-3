On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to be installed in a single drift. The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, <b>reamed</b> out to a smooth bore with a diameter of , which were to use {{a new type of}} long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of Rheinbote missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.|$|E
25|$|The dulcian is {{generally}} {{made from a}} single piece of maple, with the bores being drilled and <b>reamed</b> first, and then the outside planed to shape. The reed is attached {{to the end of a}} metal bocal, inserted into the top of the small bore. Unlike the bassoon it normally has a flared bell, sometimes made from a separate piece of timber. This bell can sometimes be muted, the mute being either detachable, or built into the instrument. The outside of the instrument can also be covered in leather, like the cornett.|$|E
500|$|When {{drilling}} deep holes, {{which require}} drilling fluid, the hole must be cased (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the drilling fluid will be {{absorbed by the}} snow and firn. [...] The casing has to reach down to the impermeable ice layers. [...] To install casing a shallow auger {{can be used to}} create a pilot hole, which is then <b>reamed</b> (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for reaming. [...] An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ream</b> {{of paper}} is a {{quantity}} of sheets {{of the same size}} and quality. International standards organizations define the <b>ream</b> as 500 identical sheets. This <b>ream</b> of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) is also known as a 'long' <b>ream,</b> and is gradually replacing the old value of 480 sheets, now known as a 'short' <b>ream.</b> <b>Reams</b> of 472 and 516 sheets are still current, but in retail outlets paper is typically sold in <b>reams</b> of 500. As an old UK and US unit, a perfect <b>ream</b> was equal to 516 sheets.|$|R

2500|$|The {{solution}} is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the <b>reamed</b> hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.|$|E
2500|$|Such [...] "indestructible" [...] style {{cylinders}} are {{arguably the}} most durable form of sound recording produced in the entire era of analog audio media; they can withstand {{a greater number of}} playbacks before wearing out than later media such as the vinyl record or audio tape. Their only serious shortcoming is that the celluloid slowly shrinks over the years, so that if it is on a core of plaster, metal or other very unyielding material, the ever-increasing tension can ultimately cause the celluloid to split lengthwise. A typical Lambert cylinder will have shrunk by approximately 3mm in length in the 100years or so since its manufacture (the actual amount is very dependent on storage conditions). Thus the grooves will no longer be 100 per inch, and the cylinder will skip if played on a typical feed-screw-type machine. The diameter will also have shrunk and many such cylinders will no longer fit on the mandrel unless very carefully <b>reamed</b> to fit. Such cylinders can still be played quite satisfactorily on suitable modern equipment. The Lambert company was put out of business in 1906 due to repeated actions from Edison for patent infringement, which Lambert had not actually committed - it was the cost of defending the actions that eventually sank Lambert.|$|E
2500|$|The White-Forster was {{of simple}} construction, with tubes that {{had only a}} gentle {{curvature}} to them. This was sufficient {{to allow them to}} be replaced in-situ, working through the manhole {{at the end of the}} large steam drum. Each tube was sufficiently curved to allow it to be extracted through the steam drum, but sufficiently straight that a single tube could be replaced from a tube bank, without requiring other tubes to be removed so as to permit access. This was one of many features of the White-Forster intended to make it reliable in naval service and easy to maintain. These tubes were of particularly small diameter, only [...] and especially numerous, a total of 3,744 being used in some boilers. The tubes were arranged in 24 rows to a bank, each requiring a different length of tube, and 78 rows per drum. All tubes were curved to the same radius, facilitating repair and replacement on board, but requiring the tube holes in the drums to be <b>reamed</b> to precise angles on a jig during manufacture. This small tube diameter gave a high heating surface, but probably too much: the ratio of surface to volume became excessive and gas flow through the tube banks was affected, giving the boiler furnaces something of a reputation as poor burners.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} sheets in a <b>ream</b> has varied locally over the centuries, often {{according}} to the size and type of paper being sold. <b>Reams</b> of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) were known in England in c1594; in 1706 a <b>ream</b> was defined as 20 quires, either 24 or 25 sheets to the quire. In 18th- and 19th-century Europe, {{the size of the}} <b>ream</b> varied widely. In Lombardy a <b>ream</b> of music paper was 450 or 480 sheets; in Britain, Holland and Germany a <b>ream</b> of 480 sheets was common; in the Veneto it was more frequently 500. Some paper manufacturers counted 546 sheets (21 quires of 26 sheets). J.S. Bach's manuscript paper at Weimar was ordered by the <b>ream</b> of 480 sheets. In 1840, a <b>ream</b> in Lisbon was 17 quires and 3 sheets = 428 sheets, and a double <b>ream</b> was 18 quires and 2 sheets = 434 sheets; and in Bremen, blotting or packing paper was sold in <b>reams</b> of 300 (20 quires of 15 sheets). A mid-19th century Milanese-Italian dictionary has an example for a risma (<b>ream)</b> as being either 450 or 480 sheets.|$|R

2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be <b>reamed</b> out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, in full {{expectation}} of these distinguished guests, Luckie Macleary had swept her {{house for the}} first time this fortnight, tempered her turf-fire to such a heat as the season required in her damp hovel even at Midsummer, set forth her deal table newly washed, propped its lame foot with a fragment of turf, arranged four or five stools of huge and clumsy form upon the sites which best suited the inequalities of her clay floor; and having, moreover, put on her clean toy, rokelay, and scarlet plaid, gravely awaited the arrival of the company, in full hope of custom and profit. When they were seated under the sooty rafters of Luckie Macleary's only apartment, thickly tapestried with cobwebs, their hostess, who had already taken her cue from the Laird of Balmawhapple, appeared with a huge pewter measuring-pot, containing at least three English quarts, familiarly denominated a Tappit Hen, and which, in the language of the hostess, <b>reamed</b> (i.e., mantled) with excellent claret just drawn from the cask.|$|E

50|$|To achieve highly {{accurate}} and consistent diameters with a reamer, one must consider process variables that {{can influence the}} overall quality of the hole being <b>reamed.</b> Variables such as reamer material, reamer design, material being <b>reamed,</b> temperature at the <b>reamed</b> surface, reamer speed, machine or operator movement, etc. must be addressed.

5000|$|<b>Reamed</b> {{holes are}} used to create holes of precise {{circularity}} and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008") This will allow the force fitting of locating dowel pins, which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them. Other holes, <b>reamed</b> slightly larger in other parts, will fit these pins accurately, but not so tightly as to make disassembly difficult. This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines. After joining the halves, the assembled case may then be line bored (using what is in effect a large diameter reamer), and then disassembled for placement of bearings and other parts. The use of <b>reamed</b> dowel holes is typical in any machine design, where any two locating parts have to be located and mated accurately to one another - typically as indicated above, to within 0.02 mm or less than [...]001".|$|E
