25|$|Territorial {{authority}} {{districts are}} not subdivisions of regions, {{and some of}} them fall within more than one region.

Regional councils are responsible for the administration of many environmental and public transport matters, while the territorial authorities administer local <b>roading</b> and reserves, sewerage, building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management, and other local matters. Some activities are delegated to council-controlled organisations.|$|E

Auckland still ranks quite low in its use of public transport, having only 46 public transport trips per capita per year, while Wellington has almost twice this number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips.

25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}}, much of {{the area}} of The Flat was poorly drained and marshy. Early settlement of the area took place along the hill fringes at Caversham and St. Clair. The arrival at St Clair of William Henry Valpy (1793–1852) in 1849 led to the first development of permanent <b>roading</b> in the area; Valpy, reputedly the wealthiest man in New Zealand, had a branch dray road built from Dunedin's central settlement to his St. Clair farm which ran {{along the edge of}} what is now South Dunedin.
