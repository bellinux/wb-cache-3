50|$|Even though padded sticks {{are used}} in the sport, players {{regularly}} retain large bruises that last for weeks and sometimes minor injuries to joints and because of the sheer amount of force generated by conditioned practitioners. Sometimes the stuffing commonly comes off from the harder hitting players and one cause of injury is when a player is struck by the exposed <b>rattan</b> <b>core.</b> Still, these are relatively minor as compared to injuries sustained when practitioners spar with live sticks.|$|E
50|$|Any {{part of the}} body, {{from head}} to toe, is fair game as a targetâ€”except for {{the back of the}} head, which the {{headgear}} does not protect. Stabs to the face are not allowed, because the thin <b>rattan</b> <b>core</b> may penetrate the padding and slip through the grills of the headgear into the player's eye. Thrusts to the body score points, but are harder to present to judges for scoring because they make less noise {{and it is difficult to}} determine impact.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving with <b>rattan</b> <b>core</b> (also {{known as}} reed) {{is one of}} the more popular {{techniques}} being practiced, because it is easily available. It is pliable, and when woven correctly, it is very sturdy. Also, while traditional materials like oak, hickory, and willow might be hard to come by, reed is plentiful and can be cut into any size or shape that might be needed for a pattern. This includes flat reed, which is used for most square baskets; oval reed, which is used for many round baskets; and round reed, which is used to twine; another advantage is that reed can also be dyed easily to look like oak or hickory. The type of baskets that reed is used for are most often referred to as [...] "wicker" [...] baskets, though another popular type of weaving known as [...] "twining" [...] is also a technique used in most wicker baskets. Wicker baskets are often used to store beer, grain, and even in some human sacrificing tribes, the heads of the sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|Padded {{weapons are}} {{typically}} built on similar cores as listed for the boffer weapon, but some {{groups such as}} Markland use <b>rattan</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One {{major problem}} with the ARPI system is that because the padded sticks with light <b>rattan</b> <b>cores</b> are used, they tend to flex and [...] "lag", thus making the {{experience}} significantly different from using a live stick and in that sense, lessens the [...] "realism" [...] of this system. This is acceptable though as again, {{the emphasis is on}} safety.|$|R
50|$|The Arnis Philippines {{system uses}} foam-padded sticks {{about an inch}} in {{diameter}} with thin <b>rattan</b> <b>cores</b> roughly a centimeter in diameter. These sticks are meant to break before serious injury occurs. For protection, the same headgear used in the WEKAF system, and a large groin guard is required for males. Vests (optional for men, required for women), optional armguards, shinguards and leg wraps are used. Scoring is more similar to fencing where fighters are separated after solid clean hits are made (observed by multiple judges stationed at different positions to observe if hits were clean and unblocked, and determine {{the strength of the}} strike by the loudness of the impact). Alternative ways to score are to disarm one's opponent or to force him to step outside the ring.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to; (1) Determine the optimal order quantity of raw rattan at Palunesia Collection Team Rattan Furniture 2014, (2) Knowing the amount of safety stock of raw rattan to be available at Palunesia Collection Team Rattan Furniture 2014, (3) Know the reorder point materials rattan conducted by Palunesia Collection Team Rattan Furniture 2014, (4) To Find out the total inventory cost of raw material should be issued by the rattan at Palunesia Collection Team Rattan Furniture 2014. Selection of {{a study conducted by}} purposive (deliberately) with the consideration that Rattan Furniture Palunesia Collection Team is one of the rattan furniture industry is still active to this day of 12 rattan furniture industry in Palu, on the other hand Palunesia Rattan Furniture Collection Team simply producing furniture as the main product. This study was conducted from April to May 2015. The data analysis that used in this research included Economiq Order Quantity (EOQ), Safety Stock, Reorder Point, and Total Inventory Cost. The results indicate that the optimal number of reservations of raw materials for fine rattan in 2014 for rattan poles Amounted to 105. 61 kg, for Rattan pitrit optimal order quantity Amounted to 127. 34 kg and <b>rattan</b> <b>core</b> optimal order quantity Amounted to 52. 20 kg.

Reorder point to be done in 2014 for the types of rattan poles when the amount of raw materials Amounted to 30. 54 kg, rattan pitrit at the time the raw material Amounted to 55. 39 kg, and the types of <b>rattan</b> <b>core</b> when the amount of raw materials Amounted to 14, 32 kg. Total inventory costs incurred in 2014 for this kind of rattan poles Rp. 124, 003. 00, for a type of rattan pitrit Rp. 119, 109. 95 and for the types of <b>rattan</b> <b>core</b> Rp. 123, 207. 14...|$|E
50|$|Some core {{materials}} can be bent {{into a number}} of shapes to give variety and uniqueness to a weapon. A common way to bend a PVC core is with a blow torch or kitchen stove; however, heat guns or boiling water are preferred by some as these methods deliver even heat, to prevent burning or weakening of the <b>core.</b> <b>Rattan</b> is generally soaked in water and then moulded to fit a shape.|$|R
