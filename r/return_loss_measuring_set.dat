40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} design, {{simulation}} and characterization of adaptable band pass filter, planar microstrip antenna and filtenna for GPS and ITS (intelligent transportation systems) applications. The designed microstrip slotted antenna has a 300 MHz of measured bandwidth and 5. 7 dBi of measured gain, which {{is sufficient to}} cover the ITS band (5. 85 – 5. 925 GHz). On the other hand, the developed filtenna operates in dedicated ITS band at 5. 9 GHz and have 1. 5 dBi of measured antenna gain. The reduction in filtenna gain {{is due to the}} additional insertion loss introduced by the hairpin bandpass filter incorporated in the feed of the proposed filtenna. Two adaptable bandpass filters have also been designed for GPS applications. First tunable filter operates at 1575 MHz (GPS L 1 frequency) while rejects 1227 MHz frequency (GPS L 2 frequency band). The (<b>measured)</b> <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the filter is better than 20 dB from 1. 5 GHz to 1. 6 GHz; while insertion loss at 1575 MHz is ∼ 5. 5 dB.

The <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> (<b>measured)</b> of this filter is better than 10 dB from 1. 15 GHz to 2. 15 GHz, and insertion loss is ∼ 5. 5 dB.

This includes the study of novel circuit integration schemes, packaging concepts {{as well as new}} measurement and characterisation techniques. As the main result, a novel broadband waveguide integrated sideband separating (2 SB) receiver topology for future Earth observation submillimetre wave instruments is proposed. The 2 SB receiver topology has an inherent low RF and LO port voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and high sideband ratio (SBR). It is based on subharmonic (x 2) Schottky diode double sideband (DSB) mixers with embedded IF low noise amplifiers (LNA's) and LO and RF 90 degree waveguide hybrids. Access to the IF IQ-paths makes it possible to implement phase and amplitude imbalance compensation schemes. Sideband separation is done in the analog domain by the use of an IF 90 degree hybrid or in the digital domain by using an IQ-correlator spectrometer. The use of embedded LNA's reduces the IF losses and leads to a low ripple and broadband response. Measured results on a prototype 2 SB receiver operating in the 320 GHz to 360 GHz frequency range show an untuned SBR of 15 dB over the whole band and mixer noise consistent with the optimal performance of a DSB mixer. The LO <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> is <b>measured</b> to be approximately 15 dB (broadband) and the RF <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> is estimated to have similar performance. A 340 GHz DSB receiver with an embedded custom designed 3 - 15 GHz LNA has also been developed.

Coupling, <b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> etc are <b>measured.</b> The experimental results are in close agreement with the theoretical predictions. A 20 dB directional coupler finds a variety of other applications i. e. power monitoring, reflectometer, power divider, in radar systems, for the measurement of frequency etc in RF and microwave communications where as a 3 dB coupler may be used for power-monitoring device in antenna application...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a comparison of}} the <b>return</b> <b>losses</b> caused by misalignment of the junctions in both metallic and dielectric waveguides. The practical measurements of these <b>return</b> <b>losses</b> for dielectric guides show that they are much smaller than the minimum <b>return</b> <b>losses</b> for metallic guides. The paper concludes with a summary of the features of dielectric guide which make it a viable alternative to metallic guide above 100 GHz...|$|R
