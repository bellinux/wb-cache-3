5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse <b>rate</b> <b>reduction</b> and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Breath-holding ability and, hence dive performance, is a {{function}} of on-board oxygen stores, scope for metabolic <b>rate</b> <b>reduction,</b> efficient oxygen utilization, and hypoxia tolerance. Various athletes attempt to accomplish this in various ways. Most divers rely on increasing fitness by increasing lung capacity. Some use `packing´ which increases lung volume beyond normal total lung capacity. Simple breath-holding practice is highly effective for increasing lung capacity. In addition, training is allocated to enhance blood and muscle oxygen stores, to a limited extent.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart <b>rate</b> <b>reduction</b> leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E

The soundtrack to the game was also praised as being an improvement on more recent installments in the series; use of an orchestral score, rather than rock as in more recent games, was appreciated.|$|E
500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax <b>rate</b> <b>reduction</b> to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned {{on the notion that}} it was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev, which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E

2500|$|Among other provisions, the act {{accelerated}} certain tax changes {{passed in}} the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, increased the exemption amount for the individual Alternative Minimum Tax, and lowered taxes of income from dividends and capital gains. JGTRRA continued on the precedent established by the 2001 EGTRRA, while increasing tax reductions on investment income from dividends and capital gains. JGTRRA accelerated the gradual <b>rate</b> <b>reduction</b> and increase in credits passed in EGTRRA. The maximum tax rate decreases originally scheduled to be phased into effect in 2006 under EGTRRA were retroactively enacted {{to apply to the}} 2003 tax year. Also, the child tax credit was increased to what would have been the 2010 level, and [...] "marriage penalty" [...] relief was accelerated to 2009 levels. In addition, the threshold at which the alternative minimum tax applies was also increased. JGTRRA increased both the percentage rate at which items can be depreciated and the amount a taxpayer may choose to expense under Section 179, allowing them to deduct the full cost of the item from their income without having to depreciate the amount.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the link}} between termination <b>rate</b> <b>reductions</b> and retail prices. It draws on in-depth case studies of South Africa, Namibia and Kenya where regulators have reduced termination rates towards {{the cost of an}} efficient operator. To varying degrees these have all led to lower retail prices and a significant market expansion. While both Namibia and Kenya, experienced significant retail price reduction following substantial termination <b>rate</b> <b>reductions,</b> the case of South Africa demonstrates that termination <b>rate</b> <b>reductions</b> are not automatically passed through to consumers. In South Africa only the second reduction in March 2012 allowed smaller operators to reduce their off-net prices to a level could tempt subscribers from dominant operators to switch. The case studies confirm that retail prices do not go up in response to termination rates going down, in CPNP (calling-party's-network-pays) markets as contended by dominant mobile operators. This is also in contrast to a body of academic literature stating that termination rates and mobile retail prices constitute a two-sided market and that termination <b>rate</b> <b>reductions</b> will lead to a so called waterbed effect. This study draws on a database of all prepaid products available in 46 African countries which were collected monthly for the period January 2011 to June 2012. The OECD price basket methodology is used to compare prices between countries and between operators. In-depth face-to-face interviews on termination rate regulations were also held with regulators in Kenya, Namibia and South Africa. The analysis is further supplemented with an analysis of audited financial statements of dominant operators in each market, namely Vodacom South Africa, MTN South Africa, Telkom South Africa, MTC 2 in Namibia, and Safaricom in Kenya...|$|R
40|$|Responses of anteroventral {{cochlear}} nucleus (AVCN) neurons {{in developing}} gerbils were obtained to single-tone stimuli, and twotone stimuli elicited by best frequency probes presented over {{a range of}} intensities. Neurons displayed Type I, Type I/III, and Type III receptive field patterns. Best frequencies ranged from 1. 5 to 10. 0 kHz. Two-tone suppression (2 TS) was first observed in 5 of 16 neurons examined at 14 dab, and in all neurons examined in gerbils aged 15 to 60 dab. Suppression areas grew larger, and discharge <b>rate</b> <b>reductions</b> became greater with age. Features of the two-tone responses that were highly correlated with single-tone responses across age groups include maximum <b>rate</b> <b>reductions</b> and suppression area thresholds. The intensity level of the CF probe-tone also influenced these features of 2 TS. Maximum <b>rate</b> <b>reductions</b> to below spontaneous rate levels of activity were common across age groups. Results suggest that the cochlear amplifier is present and fundamentally adult-like by 15 dab for the regions of the cochlea coding the mid frequencies in gerbil. Over the subsequent week, contributions to the developing two-tone responses by the cochlear amplifier increase slightly. Two-tone responses are influenced by central inhibitory mechanisms as early as 14 dab. z 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.
