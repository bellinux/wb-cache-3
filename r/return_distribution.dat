To test the intertemporal stationarity of variance estimates, monthly returns for 464 securities on the CRSP monthly return file, having no missing observations during the period January 1959 -December 1979, were gathered.

This allows us to examine speci?c parts of the <b>return</b> <b>distribution</b> such as the tails or the center, and for a suf?ciently ?ne grid of quantiles we can trace out the entire distribution. A univariate quantile regression model is used to examine stock and bond return distributions individually, while a multivariate model is used to capture their joint distribution. An empirical analysis on US data shows that certain parts of the return distributions are predictable as a function of economic state variables. The results are, however, very different for stocks and bonds. The state variables primarily predict only location shifts in the stock <b>return</b> <b>distribution,</b> while they also predict changes in higher-order moments in the bond <b>return</b> <b>distribution.</b> Out-of-sample analyses show that the relative accuracy of the state variables in predicting future returns varies across the distribution.

The coefficient of the risk premium is estimated by a GARCH-M model, and the robust measurement of skewness is calculated by Groeneveld-Meeden method. The empirical evidences for the composite indexes from 33 securities markets in the world indicate that the risk compensation requirement in the market where the <b>return</b> <b>distribution</b> is positively skewed is virtually zero, and the risk compensation requirement is positive in a significant level in the market where the <b>return</b> <b>distribution</b> is negative skewed.

However, there is another stream of research that advocates that the choice of performance measure does not influence the evaluation of hedge funds.
