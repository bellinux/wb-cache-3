5|$|Lina Leandersson (born 27 September 1995) is a Swedish actress. She {{played the}} lead role of Eli in the 2008 Swedish romantic vampire film Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In, {{based on the novel}} by the same name. Born in Falun, Leandersson started {{performing}} at an early age. She acted in local amateur theatre performances, and had a few brief television appearances in 2006. At the age of eleven, Leandersson was cast to play one of the two leads in Tomas Alfredson's film, Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In, after applying for the role through a web-based casting service. The film was an international success, and Leandersson's performance as the vampire Eli brought her widespread critical acclaim as well as several awards and nominations. She has stated that she wants to continue acting.|$|E

5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{occurred after}} Spielmann, Hunt, and Lucas published a 2006 paper mentioning that the holotype of Redondasuchus {{was not a}} left paramedian but a <b>right</b> <b>one.</b> In 2002, Martz came {{to the same conclusion}} in an unpublished thesis.

5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion. Being released on 24 October 2008, the film {{would normally be}} eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E

In an attic, the beggar woman is {{removing}} the clothing from the child; the dog enters and is driven off by the beggar.|$|E

5|$|Let Me In is a 2010 American-British romantic horror film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Matt Reeves and starring Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloë Grace Moretz, Elias Koteas, and Richard Jenkins. It is a remake of the 2008 Swedish film Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In (2008).

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian iconography. The front right arm is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of grass or another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back right arm is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front left hand holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back left hand holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg is firmly rooted in the ground while the <b>right</b> <b>one</b> is slightly bent, suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's iconography and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's iconography is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E
5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above the other at {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water.

The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the <b>right</b> <b>one</b> for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the <b>right</b> <b>one,</b> and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish premiere was {{originally}} planned for April 18, 2008, but following the positive {{response from the}} festival screenings, the producers decided to postpone the release until autumn, {{to allow for a}} longer theatrical run. At one time there was a plan to release the film for a special series of screenings in Luleå, beginning September 24 and lasting seven days. This was canceled when the Swedish Film Institute announced that Everlasting Moments had been selected over Let the <b>Right</b> <b>One</b> In as Sweden's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The distributors released it on October 24, 2008 in Sweden, Norway, and as a limited release in the United States. In Australia, the film was released on March 19, 2009. The film was released in cinemas in the United Kingdom on April 10, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{two teams}} found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already {{concluded}} they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle). As neither company had experience {{in the use of}} high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the <b>right</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and <b>right,</b> <b>one</b> {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E
