5|$|The NBA <b>relocation</b> {{committee}} {{gave its}} {{approval for the}} move to Memphis in late June, and on July 3 the Board of Governors unanimously approved the <b>relocation.</b> This also permitted Hyde to purchase a minority share of the franchise. By then the team administration had already relocated, and {{the day before the}} final decision, the team set up its rookie camp at Rhodes College. A <b>relocation</b> party was held on July 7. A week before the move, the Grizzlies traded away two of the top players, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and guard Mike Bibby, who therefore never played for Memphis.|$|E

A similar deadline was also awarded to the Charlotte Hornets, who were also considering a <b>relocation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{controversy}} and {{the demolition of}} the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place in early 2007, activists declared Queen's Pier the next battle-ground against the conservation policy of the Government of Hong Kong. The criticism received over its handling of the Star Ferry Pier caused Michael Suen, the Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands, to propose a piece-by-piece <b>relocation</b> of the pier to a new location on the reclaimed waterfront during a Legco session on 21 March 2007. The Government later unveiled four design options for such <b>relocation.</b> The intended closure of the pier was 26 April 2007.|$|E

40|$|From {{the late}} 19 th century {{up until the}} post-war period, Swedish Sámi policy was {{dominated}} by {{an image of the}} Sámi as nomadic reindeer herders. As nomads, the Sámi connection to the land they used was generally considered weaker than that of the settled population, and forced <b>relocations</b> were part of the Sámi policy for several decades as a solution to international developments that affected reindeer husbandry. These <b>relocations</b> have had and still have an effect on reindeer hus bandry in Sweden today. The article examines and analyses forced <b>relocations</b> of Sámi reindeer herders, and specifically the effects of these <b>relocations</b> on the situ ation in one Reindeer Herding District: Vapsten. Strong intra-Sámi conflicts in the district today have historical roots in the forced <b>relocations</b> to the area, and the article analyses these {{and the role of the}} state both in causing the conflicts as well as solving them.   </div...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of the New Orleans Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the <b>relocation</b> of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the <b>relocation</b> of the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979. In November 2002, the Timberwolves made their first trip to New Orleans since the failed <b>relocation</b> efforts of the Top Rank group in 1994.|$|E

40|$|Military {{deployments}} and job assignments {{provide an}} opportunity to estimate the impact of parental absences and household <b>relocations</b> on children's academic achievement. Combining U. S. Army personnel data with children's standardized test scores from Texas, I find that parental absences adversely affect children's test scores by a tenth of a standard deviation. Likewise, household <b>relocations</b> have modest negative effects on children's test scores. Both parental absences and household <b>relocations</b> have the greatest detrimental effect on test scores of children with single parents, children with mothers in the army, children with lower-ability parents, and younger children. ...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic Ambulance Management (DAM) is {{generally}} believed to provide means {{to enhance the}} response-time performance of emergency medical service providers. The implementation of DAM algorithms leads to additional movements of ambulance vehicles compared to the reactive paradigm, where ambulances depart from the base station when an incident is reported. In practice, proactive <b>relocations</b> are only acceptable {{when the number of}} additional movements is limited. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the effect of the number of <b>relocations</b> on the response-time performance. We formulate the <b>relocations</b> from one configuration to a target configuration by the Linear Bottleneck Assignment Problem, so as to provide the quickest way to transition to the target configuration. Moreover, the performance is measured by a general penalty function, assigning to each possible response time a certain penalty. We extensively validate the effectiveness of <b>relocations</b> {{for a wide variety of}} realistic scenarios, including a day and night scenario in a critically and realistically loaded system. The results consistently show that already a small number of <b>relocations</b> lead to near-optimal performance, which is important for the implementation of DAM algorithms in practice...|$|R

5|$|The Grizzlies {{were the}} first NBA <b>relocation</b> since the Kansas City Kings {{relocated}} to Sacramento, California and became the Sacramento Kings in 1985. It was followed by two others in the same decade. The first was the <b>relocation</b> of the original Charlotte Hornets to New Orleans in 2002, with the team becoming the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans). (That <b>relocation</b> is no longer treated by the league as such; after the 2013–14 season, the franchise then known as the Charlotte Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name and also received sole rights {{to the history of}} the Hornets in Charlotte.) The second was in 2008, when the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the NHL, two teams were moved from Canada to the U.S. during the mid-1990s: the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, and the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and were rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014 (a new Winnipeg Jets team returned to the city by <b>relocation</b> of the Atlanta Thrashers in 2011). In 2005, one of Canada's two Major League Baseball teams (the Montreal Expos) relocated to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The failure of the Vancouver franchise was part of the reason the NBA changed the expansion drafting rules following the return of Charlotte to the league as the Bobcats in 2005. The Bobcats were allowed to pick fourth in their first draft, and were later not restricted from first picks.|$|E
40|$|The {{family and}} {{residential}} environments {{are critical to}} children’s wellbeing and, hence, moving home can affect children’s developmental outcomes. In this research, we study the associations between residential <b>relocations</b> and academic performance in the Australian context using longitudinal data of {{a representative sample of}} 3, 481 children born in the late 1990 ’s from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). We examine the impact of residential <b>relocations</b> from infancy to middle childhood and pay special attention to the distance, frequency and developmental age-stage of <b>relocations</b> on academic test scores from the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) of 3 rd, 5 th and 7 th graders. We use hybrid models and random coefficients models. Our results confirm findings of modest associations from previous research in the US context. Frequent residential mobility relates to poor academic performance, but the association is largely due to family and home circumstances. After controlling for a number of predictors, we find that moderate levels of residential mobility, particularly <b>relocations</b> to a different local area, are associated with improvements in academic performance over time. Further, our multivariate results show a modest negative effect of <b>relocations</b> around the time of school entry (i. e. ages 4 / 5 to 6 / 7). We conclude that the associations between residential change and cognitive development are nuanced by the circumstances and contexts of childhood <b>relocations...</b>|$|R

5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform <b>Relocation</b> Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in <b>relocation.</b> For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, <b>relocation</b> expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E
5|$|While {{political}} maneuvering {{was continuing}} in Minnesota, by early April {{it was reported}} that Nashville had become the favored place for <b>relocation</b> over New Orleans. The Nashville offer became the preferred option as it included $80 million for the franchise from Gaylord Entertainment and an additional $20 million to be paid to the city of Minneapolis to pay down debt at the Target Center. New Orleans later reemerged as the lead candidate for <b>relocation</b> by the end of April when Top Rank announced a purchase price of $152.5 million. By early May, the Minnesota state legislature approved a bill that would use public funds to purchase the Target Center for $48 million. The purchase by the state was contingent on ownership agreeing to keep the franchise in the arena for 30 years. However, ownership could not find a local suitor willing to pay what Top Rank had offered for the franchise setting the stage for <b>relocation.</b>|$|E
