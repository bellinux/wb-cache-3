Modeling our experiment after this study, we directly examined the effect of viscous resistance on the perceived roughness magnitude of virtual gratings using a PHANTOM. For each virtual grating, the resistance level encountered at the ridges was varied by altering the viscosity coefficient. Perceived roughness systematically increased as the value of the viscosity coefficient was increased. The ridge-to-groove ratio contributed a small additional effect of microgeometry. These results suggest that simple models of viscous resistance may be used to simulate varying levels of surface roughness...|$|R

Previous {{studies have shown that}} there is rapid, precise coordination between grip and load forces that deteriorates with digital nerve block. Obviously, mechanoreceptive afferents innervating fingerpad skin contribute essential information. We quantify human capacity to scale <b>tangential</b> and normal <b>forces</b> using only cutaneous information. Our paradigm simulated natural manipulations (a <b>force</b> <b>tangential</b> to the skin superimposed on an indenting force normal to the skin). Precisely controlled forces were applied by a custom-built stimulator to an immobilized fingerpad. Using magnitude estimation, subjects (n = 8) scaled the magnitude of <b>tangential</b> <b>force</b> (0. 25 - 2. 8 N) in two experiments (normal force, 2. 5 and 4 N, respectively). Performance was unaffected by normal <b>force</b> magnitude and <b>tangential</b> <b>force</b> direction.

In gaining optimum cutting conditions, the investigation of the relationship between cutting conditions and technical performance factors such as <b>tangential</b> <b>forces</b> generated during machining is of great importance. This work presents an experimental study on the material removal rate (MRR), horsepower generated at spindle and <b>tangential</b> <b>forces</b> of CNC milling machine tool at 50 mm/min federate by varying depths of cut (DOC). The objective of this research work is to relate the resultant surface roughness measured in arithmetic average mean roughness, Ra to the MRR, horsepower and <b>tangential</b> <b>forces</b> generated by each depth of cut in analyzing their respective behavior / trend. The experiments were carried out using 6 varying depths of cut beginning from 0. 5 mm with an increment of 0. 5 mm each depth until the final depth of cut reaches 3. 0 mm utilizing a new cutting tool at each depth. At each depth of cut, the material removal rate and horsepower were formulated to obtain the cutting forces in the form of <b>tangential</b> <b>forces</b> exerted on the Al 6061 -T 6511 workpiece.

The handle was constrained, such that it could only move up and down, and rotate about a horizontal axis. In addition, the moment arm of the thumb <b>tangential</b> <b>force</b> was 1. 5 times the moment arm of the virtual finger (VF, an imagined finger with the mechanical action equal to that of the four fingers) force. Unlike the situation when there are equal moment arms, the experimental setup forced the subjects to choose between (a) sharing equally the increase in load force between the thumb and VF but generating a moment of <b>tangential</b> <b>force,</b> which had to be compensated by negatively co-varying the moment due to normal forces, or (b) sharing unequally the load force increase between the thumb and VF but preventing generation of a moment of <b>tangential</b> <b>forces.</b> We found that different subjects tended to use one of these two strategies.
