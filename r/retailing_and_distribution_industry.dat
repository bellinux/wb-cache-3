The <b>retail</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>industry</b> in Botswana's {{deregulated}} {{economy is}} one of the largest and most difficult sectors in which to operate, mainly because of levels of competition amongst Botswana companies and the global competitive industry, in general. Hill (2000 : 539) postulates that competition in free market economies generally tends to be tense depending on differences between distribution systems such as retail concentration, channel length and channel exclusivity. At the same time the retail industry grapples with other complex social and structural problems as they face ever increasing marketing problems that relate to attracting and maintaining customers (Luh, 2006 : 1). In view of the intense competition, it is more expensive to obtain a new customer than to retain and maintain an existing customer. Consequently, retailers should develop competitive and sustainable ways to maintain the customers that they have and should develop strategies to retain any new customers that the business acquires (Naylor and Frank, 2000 : 37). Botswana practices a free market and a heavily deregulated economy, which causes an increase in competition (Luh, 2006 : 1) and creates greater expectations from customers in pursuit of satisfaction and value (Peter and Donnelly, 2007 : 179) for their money. In Botswana, petrol and diesel prices are regulated by government, there is therefore no competition between the rivals based on prices. The competition landscape therefore shifts to amongst others, namely; service provision, location of the petrol station, and fuel brand in general. Petrol <b>and</b> diesel <b>retail</b> outlets should focus on areas of operations that will give them a sustainable competitive advantage over their competitors without altering the price of products. Mehta, Lalwani and Li Han (2000 : 21) posit that increased competition between retail businesses forces rivals to focus on good customer service as the only critical factor in the operation of their business (Zairi, 2000 : 332). Customer loyalty is therefore, the most effective way to keep customers and to maintain profitability through repeated purchases (Luh, 2006 : 2). Loyalty is used to describe the behaviour of repeat customers, their ratings of the business, positive testimonials, and business from existing customers, as well as overall perception, about the business from the existing customers. The study focuses on the petroleum industry in an environment where there are several competitors, relative. to the size of the country, offering goods and services that are close substitutes. The industry in Botswana is characterised by five competitors that offer heavily substitutable products (BP Report, 2006 : 1 - 4). These rivals are BP, Shell, Caltex, Engen and Total...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{logistics}} and general literature reveals three forces at work which are changing the nature of global business: The globalisation of economies; The homogenisation of products; The advancement of technology Different sectors have a different level of awareness and achievement. Manufacturing is generally still somewhat inward looking, whereas retailing {{is the source of}} a good deal of innovation and change. In the United States the “Efficient Customer Response” initiative is a major factor in reshaping the channels of supply from manufacturing to <b>retailing,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>distribution</b> <b>industry</b> more than any other is suffering the effects of change. The more progressive participants in the distribution sector are trying to achieve a more dominant position, by offering a wider range of value-added services than simple transportation and storage of goods. The banking and payment clearing services sector is not seen as a major factor, despite the very significant opportunity to develop and improve payment services, and to link them more tightly with operational activity. The management of supply chain operations is becoming more sophisticated. Systems thinking, benchmarking and customer service imperatives are all causing a wave of new interest in the best ways to manage supply chain and logistics operations. The prospects for further significant developments in the future continue to expand, {{and it is difficult to}} see any limit or ultimate end to the development of logistics practices around the world. A version of this paper has been published in "Global Logistics" - a Management Review puiblished by MCB University Press, Bradford, which also includes extensive abstracts from the logistics literature.

40|$|This thesis {{takes as}} its {{underlying}} theoretical framework the market structure-conduct-performance paradigm of industrial organisation {{as applied to}} consumer service <b>industries,</b> notably <b>retail</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>and</b> tourism (including hotels). The addition to knowledge arises from the disciplined application of industrial organisation principles to define, describe, explain and predict real-world behaviour of a selection of service firms and {{on the basis of}} observable data, whether government and supra-national policies can improve service market performance if it is found to be failing in clearly defined respects. The problem addressed is how the behavioural processes of competition arise from and shape the identified market structures to be found in consumer service markets. The work begins by examining in detail the development of the main hypotheses and empirical testing of the market structure-conduct-performance framework, followed by the identification of the main strands of past and current economic thought concerning service industries and service firms. Following on from this fundamental analysis of service industries, the definition of markets, industries and firms (basic underlying conditions and parameters linked to market structure) is undertaken, taking hotel and restaurant markets in a spatial dimension, with a novel empirical identification, definition and measurement of the size and growth of hotel markets in particular localities. Moving on from this analysis, the measurement of concentration in the hotel <b>and</b> <b>retail</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>industries</b> is considered with the first attempt at systematically measuring such concentration using an extensive database of companies. Entry to markets (a further element of market structure) is carefully examined with the entry of new firms into local hotel markets and evaluation of the possible impact of a new hotel business on existing hotels. Market conduct or behaviour is examined, first, the reactions of hotel managers to new competition, based on a survey of 250 UK hotel managers followed by a rigorous analysis of market behaviour in grocery retaining markets (especially the analysis of oligopolistic behaviour). Further chapters examine an innovation and diversification in a stable hotel market - the introduction of the budget or economy hotel Finally, service market performance is considered in detail at various points (impact of new hotels and behaviour in grocery retail markets) but is principally considered in teh definition and enhancement of performance by a wide ranging and unique empirical study of European Union (EU) tourism policies within each member state of the EU...|$|R
