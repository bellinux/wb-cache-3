50|$|Socio-economic {{disparities in}} the European Union {{countries}} are considerable. Strong differences between neighboring regions create both, threats and opportunities. In terms of opportunities we understand goods, capital and labour in relatively closely defined regions; in the threats perspective it is mainly appearance of large differences between wealth and lagging regions. Described threats are highlighting {{the importance of}} geographical range (thus influence on socio-economic standards). In terms of economic development, disparities between European countries have been reduced {{over the last two}} decades, showing a clear “convergence” between the countries. The imbalances occurred particularly due to a large agglomeration, where geographically advanced regions {{play a significant role in}} growing GDP. Although poorer and more peripheral regions of the EU have shown a significant economic growth, in terms of the whole European economy they represent only a smart part of contribution. In rapidly growing economies such as Ireland, Estonia and Latvia regional differences lead to a positive outcome and relative decline in the more peripheral parts. Socio-economic differences due to <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> occur particularly in Finland, France and Spain, where the high unemployment rate has increased in more peripheral regions.Migration into rapidly growing areas seems in most European countries as an emerging issue.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedIn this study, I study what determines {{entrepreneurship}} {{development in}} a given industry. I argue for a dynamic view of "regional advantage". When considering the entrepreneurship {{development in a}} broader context and {{its relationship with the}} globalization, localization does not mean that only the local and national institutions exercise strong regulatory control over the entrepreneurship development process, entrepreneurship can be empowered and transformed by its linkages to the institutions in diverse social contexts. Thus <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantages</b> can be overcome under certain conditions.; Specifically, I ask why quite a few competitive firms could emerge in China's internet industry and are growing into world class companies despite Beijing's disadvantages in nurturing private firms. My account of this puzzle is that the competitiveness of China's internet industry is determined by its connection with the entrepreneurship institutions abroad (including educational, professional, and financial institutions). This industry is populated by the returnee firms, the domestic entrepreneurship institutions are underdeveloped in relation to the requirement of internet industry but the returnee entrepreneurs' access to some key western institutions has given them an advantage...|$|R
40|$|The free-market economy {{introduction}} {{into the}} Hungarian agriculture also {{passes through a}} noticeable transition phase with {{a great number of}} structural and socio-economic adaptation and transition phenomena. In Hungary, the orientation towards the national and international market is accompanied by internal and external economic and social radical change phenomena which in return resulted in a production decline and market loss for the agriculture at home and abroad. The sales loss due to the breakdown of the COMECON market is the most important phenomenon. Production declines and sales losses concern both the crops and animal production. The relationship with the decline of the manufacturing industry is clearly demontrated. With the transition to the free-market economy the significance assessment of the previous production locations change. The increasing removal of subsidy and the uncertain sales situation bring about completely changed advantage and disadvantage evaluations of agricultural production locations in connection with their natural and social locational conditions. Market requirements and natural production factors determine more distinctly than before the production profile and the efficiency of the Hungarian farms. <b>Regional</b> <b>disadvantages</b> are not longer notably compensated by subsidies. Another leg bearing the main weight of the Hungarian agriculture, namely the, since more than 20 years existing production of agricultural raw materials for the industry, has almost complety disappeared {{in the wake of the}} nation-wide recession process. The, with the social drastic change in the country associated, reprivatisation process in agriculture results in the installation of many small farms poor in soil and deprived of financial means. Their long-term competitiveness is low and depends on the speed of Hungary's economy opening itself to the EC. The relatively unfavourable natural provisions of the Scabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg territory complicate the transition to the free-market economy for agriculture in this komitat.

40|$|BackgroundDiarrhoea {{and acute}} {{respiratory}} infection (ARI) are leadingcauses of mortality and morbidity in children under the ageof five in developing countries. On the African continent,pneumonia (14 %) and diarrhoea (17 %) cause more childdeaths than Malaria (16 %), HIV/AIDS (4 %), and measles (1 %) combined. This paper set out to investigate the factorsassociated with the occurrence of diarrhoea and ARIincidence for children under five years in Uganda. MethodWe used a nationally representative Uganda Demographicand Health Survey (UDHS) (2006). Sampling was done in twostages. In the first stage 321 clusters were selected fromamong a list of clusters sampled in the 2005 / 06 UgandaNational Household Survey (UNHS), 17 clusters from the 2002 Census frame from Karamoja, and 30 internallydisplaced camps (IDPs). In the second stage, households ineach cluster were selected as per UNHS listing. In addition 20 households were randomly selected in each cluster. Questionnaires were used during data collection. During theanalysis, a maximum likelihood probit model was used inorder to ascertain the probability of occurrence of diseases. ResultsOn average, 32 % and 48 % {{of children in the}} survey sufferedfrom diarrhoea and ARI in the two weeks prior to the surveydate. The occurrence was concentrated amongst childrenaged 0 – 24 months. Mother’s education, especially at postsecondarylevel, reduced the probability of diarrhoeaoccurrence but had no effect on ARI occurrence. First hourinitiation and exclusive breastfeeding reduced theprobability occurrence of both diarrhoea and ARI. Othersignificant factors associated with the occurrence of bothdiseases include: regional and location differentials, wealthstatus, type of dwelling, mother’s occupation, child age, andchild nutritional status. ConclusionPolicy interventions should target female education,eliminate location and <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantages,</b> and educatethe population to adopt breastfeeding practicesrecommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

40|$|Despite Australia enjoying {{unprecedented}} growth {{since the}} early 1990 s, pockets of socio-demographic and <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> persist.

At the aggregate level, high growth regions appear to have had more equitable rates of growth across occupations relative to low or medium growth regions.

From the use of longitudinal individual data (1990  –  2002), controlling for factors such as age, sex, income, and social relations, the results show that the composition of regional economies influences labour-market dynamism. We identify two cases of intraregional agglomeration mobility, that is, positive effects on job mobility, due to the concentration of similar activities (localisation economies) {{and the size of the}} labour market (urbanisation economies). The results also show that localisation economies compensate for <b>regional</b> structural <b>disadvantages</b> connected to small population numbers, as localisation effects in small regions have a significantly positive effect on intraregional job-mobility rates, even compared with localisation effects in large and diversified metropolitan areas. The results indicate that the concentration of similar activities may be useful for small regions, if high levels of job mobility are crucial for the transfer of knowledge and the performance of firms. ...|$|R

The issue of theoretical and practical interest that this article examines is whether this phenomenon of deferral constitutes a disadvantage for these young people. Are these deferrers ‘lost’ to the system? Do they eventually take up their places? Are some groups less likely to take them up than others? What happens to the rest? Of particular interest is the question regarding what barriers might prevent some groups from taking up their place. And finally, what is the experience of those who enter university?

This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} regional government quality in health-related participation in sport and physical activity among adults (18 - 64 years) in 28 European countries. The importance of the analysis rests in the relative autonomy that regional (and local) governments have over policy decisions connected with sport and physical activity. While existing {{studies have focused on}} economic and infrastructural investment and expenditure, this research investigates the quality of regional governments across 208 regions within 28 European countries. The individual-level data stem from the 2013 Eurobarometer 80. 2 (n= 18, 675) and were combined with regional-level data from Eurostat. An individual’s level of participation in sport and physical activity was measured by three variables reflecting whether an individual’s activity level is below, meets, or exceeds the recommendations of the World Health Organization. The results of multi-level analyses reveal that regional government quality has a significant and positive association with individual participation in sport and physical activity at a level meeting or exceeding the guidelines. The impact is much larger than that of regional gross domestic product per capita, indicating that <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> in terms of political quality is more relevant than being disadvantaged in terms of economic wealth...|$|E
40|$|In 2004, Democratic Governor Philip Bredesen of Tennessee {{announced}} {{a plan to}} reform TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program. The reform package proposed to remove 323, 000 adults from the program, which represented the most drastic cuts to Medicaid since its creation in 1965. The reform measure also allowed beneficiaries disenrolled from the program to appeal the decisions to the state Department of Human Services. This study examines how race and policy backlash—that is the backlash against Medicaid expansion—influenced the appellate process for beneficiaries removed from the program in Tennessee. The main argument is that race—especially the predisposition of African Americans—influenced {{the outcome of the}} appellate proceedings. The theoretical framework advanced in this study explains how procedural deliberations (legal decisions, policy disputes, administrative hearings) exacerbate disparities and produce differential outcomes that correspond with racial and other ascriptive hierarchies. The data for this research, comprising more than 60, 000 former TennCare beneficiaries, were obtained through Open Records Requests in compliance with Tennessee state law. Using logistic regressions, the findings reveal a relationship between race and appellate proceedings. African Americans were treated unfairly in the early stage of the appellate process and those from racially polarized voting areas were less likely to receive fair rulings by hearing examiners. Additional findings identified age-related disparities between younger and older appellants, as well as a <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> between rural and urban beneficiaries...|$|E

This paper provides a critical analysis of project outcomes and identifies criteria that may form a suitable framework {{for the assessment of}} proposals for sexual health promotion using performing arts-based approaches in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander settings. Methods: A case study method was used. The first phase of analysis assessed whether project objectives were met using data collected during project planning and implementation. The second phase used these findings, augmented by interviews with key personnel, to respond to the question 'How could this be done better?'. Results: The Project required significant human and organisational implementation support. The project was successful in facilitating event-specific community mobilisation. It raised awareness of sexual health disadvantage and engaged effectively with the target group. It laid important groundwork to progress school-based and community mechanisms to address <b>regional</b> youth <b>disadvantage.</b> Against these benefits are issues of opportunity cost and the need for ongoing resources to capitalise on the opportunities created.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{awareness of}} pre-diabetes or {{type 2 diabetes}} and associated factors in people with psychosis, a known high-risk group. Methods: Cross sectional analysis of a national sample with psychosis who were aged 18 – 64 years, gave a fasting blood sample (n = 1155), had pre-diabetes or diabetes based on testing (n = 359) and reported if {{they knew they had}} high blood sugar or diabetes at survey (n = 356). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with awareness of pre-diabetes or diabetes prior to testing. Results: The prevalence of pre-diabetes (19. 0 % 219 / 1153) or type 2 diabetes (12. 1 %, 140 / 1153) was 31. 1 % (359 / 1153); 45 % (160 / 356) were known prior to testing. Factors associated with detection were higher fasting blood glucose, older age, a perception of poor health, severe obesity, dyslipidaemia or treatment with a lipid regulating drug, a family history of diabetes, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, decreased cognitive functioning, <b>regional</b> economic <b>disadvantage,</b> treatment with an antihypertensive drug, and an elevated 5 -year risk for cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes/diabetes was highest in those aged 25 – 34 years at 34. 2 %. Conclusions: Clinical detection of pre-diabetes or diabetes in people with psychosis was strongly dependent on established risk factors for type 2 diabetes in the population but not on current antipsychotic drug treatment or psychiatric case management which should ensure regular screening.

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{significant}} regional economic disparities, attention is turning away from traditional accounts of <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> towards the insights offered by institutional and evolutionary economics. Such accounts have highlighted the institutional, social and cultural capabilities that drive regional economic success. One aspect of this literature relates {{to the theme of}} institutional learning. In particular, a distinction has been made between incremental and radical institutional learning capabilities. Whilst incremental learning facilitates institutional adaptation to changing economic circumstances through the application of established interpretations and solutions, radical learning requires the development of an 'adaptability' capacity that reflects upon the applicability of past actions and promotes institutional innovations that break with existing understandings. Yet despite the importance attached to radical institutional learning capabilities, the internal organisational factors influencing actual learning processes - especially within the context of public sector bodies - have received little attention. This thesis explores these features through a comparative investigation of the institutional learning processes occurring within public sector based economic development organisations in Teesside, England and Cracow, Poland. The research presents the key arguments made regarding the centrality of learning to the regional rediscovery debate and examines the significance attached to the themes of institutional learning and cognition. Through reference to empirical evidence the research discusses the place specific and historically dependent nature of institutional learning processes and considers the extent to which institutional cognition, organisational memories, management systems and techniques act as barriers or stimuli to radical learning...|$|E
40|$|In Turkey, large {{regional}} inequalities {{were found}} in maternal and child health. Yet, evidence on regional inequalities in adult health in Turkey remains fragmentary. This study aims to assess regional and rural/urban inequalities in the prevalence of poor self-rated health and in disability among adult populations in Turkey, and to measure the contribution of education and wealth of individual residents. The central hypothesis was that geographical inequalities in adult health exist even when the effect of education and wealth were taken into account. We analyzed data of the 2002 World Health Survey for Turkey on 10791 adults aged 20 years and over. We measured respondents' rating of their own general health and the prevalence of five types of physical disability. Logistic regression was used to estimate how much these two health outcomes varied according to urban/rural place of residence, region, education level and household wealth. We stratified the analyses by gender and age (‹ 50 and ≥ 50 years). Both health outcomes were strongly associated with educational level (especially for older age group) and with household wealth (especially for younger age group). Both health outcomes also varied according to region and rural/urban place of residence. Higher prevalence rates were observed in the East region (compared to West) with odd ratios varying between 1. 40 - 2. 76. After controlling for education and wealth, urban/rural differences in health disappeared, while regional differences were observed only among older women. The prevalence of poor self-rated health was higher for older women in the Middle (OR[*]=[*] 1. 69), Black Sea (OR[*]=[*] 1. 53) and East (OR[*]=[*] 2. 06) regions. In Turkey, substantial geographical inequalities in self-reported adult health do exist, but can mostly be explained by differences in socioeconomic characteristics of residents. The <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> of older women in the East, Middle and Black Sea may have resulted from life-long exposure to gender discrimination under a patriarchal ideology. Yet, not geographic inequalities, but the more fundamental socioeconomic inequalities, are of key public health concern, also in Turke...|$|E
40|$|Are {{regional}} communities disadvantaged in {{the administration}} of the law, compared with their metropolitan counterparts? Executive Summary Much of the hallmark Australian research undertaken {{over the past two decades}} around ‘Access to Justice’ has focussed on access to public and private legal services for socio-economic disadvantaged groups. However, there has been little research that looks at equity {{in the administration}} of the law in regional communities, through courts and tribunals and associated services. Postcode Justice, 1 a research project undertaken by Deakin University School of Law, responds to this gap and asks the question: Are regional communities disadvantaged {{in the administration of}} the law, compared with their metropolitan counterparts? Following 62 interviews and 117 survey responses drawing on the views of regional services and organisations participating in the justice system, together with an examination of relevant literature and research, the answer is strongly in the affirmative. ‘Administration of justice’ refers to the justice system services established to administer both criminal and civil laws, largely courts and tribunals, and associated services, programs and legal processes. This research examined and tested issues raised by interviewees. Topics discussed under each of the chapters, including courts, penalties, regional services, practitioner and cross-border issues, and regional engagement, deserve further consideration in their own right. There are also many other issues and factors relating to the administration of justice in regional Victoria not included within the scope of this report, which are deserving of further exploration. Postcode Justice identifies a myriad of factors and combinations of factors that create disadvantage for people living in rural and regional Victoria when using justice system services. These factors are not universal but will vary across geographic areas, with smaller and more remote population centres generally experiencing greater disadvantage. Despite improvements to technologies and transportation over the last half century, distance from courts and related services continues to raise a ‘natural barrier’ for many justice system service users and prospective users in Victoria, causing both financial cost and personal hardship. Government response has been inconsistent, creating a form of ‘postcode justice’, where outcomes are determined by the vagaries of where you live, in conjunction with the level of justice system services and programs present in your location. This report identifies issues relating to the physical amenity of regional courts which affects outcomes for users and the likelihood of their attendance, particularly given security, video-conferencing facilities, waiting areas and confidential interview areas are unavailable at many regional and ‘satellite’ courts. The therapeutic jurisprudence (problem solving courts) model embraced by Victorian courts provides a progressive response to applying justice in criminal courts. However, it relies on a level of court based programs, and local support and rehabilitation services, often not available to smaller rural centres. Limited and inconsistent roll-out of programs such as CISP (Court Integrated Services Program) and Credit Bail; and Specialist Magistrates’ Courts such as the Family Violence Division and the Drug Court, is likely to result in inequitable outcomes for court participants in regional centres not covered by the program. In relation to criminal offences, the sentencing data available provides limited opportunity to examine regional and metropolitan differences. However, it is evident that, where they are available, court programs, local services and specialist courts provide significant benefits to the individual recipients and communities; conversely, those in locations where such programs, services and specialist courts are not available, are disadvantaged. ‘Efficiencies’ in court management within criminal and civil jurisdictions can result in inequitable procedures and levels of service between rural/regional and metropolitan areas. For example, County Court circuit courts give litigants and their counsel no certainty of a hearing date until only a matter of days prior to their hearing. This system has been designed to ensure the sitting circuit Judge hears a constant flow of cases but it creates an inequity in the ability to prepare and present cases not experienced by participants using the Melbourne County Court. Postcode Justice investigates the impact of legal and related professional services in rural and regional communities. Disadvantage is experienced as a result of the limited availability of senior barristers and senior Crown Counsel at circuit County Courts. A declining ratio of private law firms to regional populations and demands on Legal Aid services is resulting in an increasing frequency of ‘conflict of interest’ issues. A growing complexity of laws is requiring a greater level of expertise from regional practitioners, who traditionally offer generalist practice services and therefore, are not always able to provide the requisite level of competence to appropriately respond to the specialised assistance required. The report examines how the lack of local human service agencies in rural and regional areas affects justice system outcomes. Limited availability of mental health services and other human service agencies (such as drug and alcohol services, youth services, disability services, domestic violence services, supervised accommodation services, and counselling services) in rural and regional areas, increases the likelihood of involvement in the criminal justice system, placement in remand and recidivism (re-offending). The research also explores the additional challenges for legal practitioners and local human service agencies based near State borders. Variation in laws and government program policies across borders, compound the difficulties rural and regional services and their clients already face. Providing an equal level of court and related service to rural and regional communities can be costly and runs contrary to notions of budgetary efficiency. How then do we maintain a balance between cost, on the one hand, and equity of service provision and justice, on the other? The balance must constantly be reviewed. State Governments have introduced measures in response to rural and <b>regional</b> <b>disadvantage</b> but there is little consistency of approach that commits to maintaining mechanisms that recognise and respond to ‘spatial disadvantage’ within the justice system. Governments must first acknowledge and address the limitations of centralised decision making. They need to establish structures that build an understanding of the impact of laws and justice system policies and programs on rural and regional communities; and which will have meaningful and ongoing engagement with those communities.  ...|$|E

This study investigates different types of community involvement, levels of perceived social support, and self-reported life satisfaction among regional people with disability relative to their counterparts living in major cities.

40|$|There are {{two primary}} sources of {{information}} for studies of large-scale land-cover and land-use, space-borne remote sensing and ground-based census statistics, each with advantages and <b>disadvantages.</b> <b>Regional</b> remote sensing products typically provide high spatial resolution (∼ 1 km^ 2) maps of land-cover (e. g., deciduous vs. evergreen forest). Census statistics provide more information on land-use (e. g., grazed vs. non-grazed forested land), but at lower spatial resolution; data are typically aggregated by political units like counties (∼ 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 4 km^ 2), states (∼ 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 km^ 2), or nations (∼ 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 7 km^ 2). Neither of these {{sources of information}} alone is sufficient for applications, such as terrestrial ecosystem modeling, that require spatially-explicit information on land-use. However, a synthesis of these two data sources may provide the necessary information. Here we develop a correlation between (1) the IGBP DISCover 1 -km remote sensing land-cover map of the coterminous U. S. and (2) state-level statistics from the USDA Major Land Uses dataset. We evaluate the consistency between these two views of the U. S. landscape. We also generate a hybrid land-use product: an 0. 5 x 0. 5 land-use map for the coterminous U. S...|$|R
40|$|The Aegean Region, {{which is}} the focus of this study, is the second most {{developed}} region of Turkey. Its share in the GDP has remained relatively stable around 17 percent during 1990 - 2000 periods according to data provided by State Planning Organization of Turkey. The region enjoys a number of advantages like; high quality human resources, rich experience in manufacturing industry going back to the 19 th century, small and medium sized industries comprising the majority of enterprises, a promising potential for inter-firm network development particularly in industries like food, wearing apparels, leather, metal wares and automotive,relatively more foreign direct investment in various branches, an international port, universities,geographic location. However, despite these advantages, the region also has some disadvantages which can be summarized as follows: the lack of implementation of an effective regional development policy,limited number of regional institutions, inadequate institutional coordination between these institutions,poor vocational training, high level of brain drain, foreign trade of the traditional commodities of the region,inefficient R&D, low technology level, etc. In order to overcome these <b>disadvantages,</b> <b>regional</b> resources need to be reallocated according to the requirements of a global competitive environment in the framework of new regional policy. The study aims to identify manufacturing-based clusters across the Aegean Region and these clusters’ provincial locations, so that a base can be formed for potential regional policies. Department of Trade and Industry’s analysis of UK clusters is taken as the basis of methodology to be applied in this paper. ...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The “What if” in the {{evaluation}} of public programs: An appraisal of methodologies and practices Three papers on related topics concerning methodologies and practices of {{the evaluation}}s of public programs constitute the dissertation. The first paper demonstrates the applicability of observational methods for the assessment of the program level contributions of two Financial Schemes and two Governmental intervention programs from the prede- cessors of Innovation Norway in the early nineties: The Regional Venture Capital Loans program aims at compensating presumed <b>regional</b> funding <b>disadvantages,</b> the Investment Grants at stimulating physical investments in buildings, machinery, and equipment. The FRAM program aims at enhancing leadership skills while the Network program tries to encourage cooperation between companies. The raison d’être for all four initiatives is a presumed market failure and the public benefits from compensating an assumed funding gap when positive externalities are expected. The paper is based upon the view that matching routines are nonparametric pre- processing methods that facilitate further analysis. A combination of covariate matching and difference-in-differences analysis is employed for finding the best possible estimates for the effects of the programs under scrutiny. The analyses suggest that {{at least two of the}} four initiatives produce positive contribu- tions and produce lasting impacts that are observable for a considerable period following par- ticipation. The second paper concerns a leadership-training program for SME’s. Over a period of eight to fourteen years after key managers completed the program we have traced the effects of the program on the performance of participating firms. Transition rate methods are applied in order to assess the survival of participating firms. The key findings are that the impact of the training program with respect to survival is negligible and that this overall effect can be decomposed into a positive impact upon the mature participating firms and a catastrophic negative effect on the newcomers; the newly established firms that participated. The third paper discusses the methodological cleavages with{{in the evaluation}} commu- nity. The history of evaluation has produced a number of sub-fields based on different parent disciplines. Strong paradigmatic commitment to own sub-discipline and corresponding rejec- tion of competing world-views may lower the overall trust in evaluations. Since New Public Management predominantly is based on a popular notion of economics, this is the story of how pluralism meets monism. The conclusion is that the methodological heterogeneity of evaluation research may be deteriorating with respect to public trust in social science based evaluations. nhhph...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the Community Innovation Survey for Belgium to {{evaluate}} to what extent regional concentration (clusters) of firms, also known as agglomeration economies, may be enhancing for innovation. These agglomeration economies are positive externalities that benefit firms in various ways. For innovative performance, especially externalities related to knowledge spillovers matter. Knowledge spillovers or learning externalities typically emerge between firms that {{belong to the same}} industry, often through worker mobility between firms carrying along job specific knowledge and expertise. But it can also occur through technological transfers, sharing of common technology platforms and imitation strategies of firms operating in the same sector. This paper uses data of more than 3000 firms with detailed information on R&D intensity, product innovation, firm size and other characteristics to show that agglomeration economies or regional knowledge spillovers matter for firm level innovation. Controlling for research and development intensity, export intensity, foreign ownership, size, region-specific effects such as urbanization economies and heterogeneity across sectors; localization economies as measured by employment concentration are shown to be a serious conduit in the innovation and renewal process of firms. product portfolio. On the other hand, firms also enjoy a significantly positive impact from regional agglomeration in the form of urbanization economies, particularly in Flanders. These findings have implications both for firms and for policymakers. For firms in regionally clustered sectors, this means that their research and development is put to better use. The return on investment in innovation -that is expenditure on research and development- is more productive in relatively more clustered sectors. These regions accumulate sources of spillovers, which in turn attract and support innovators. This adds a regional dimension to the cumulative nature of the innovation process, and this has implications for the balance between regional and national industrial R&D policy. For policymakers, this implies that clustering can be an important channel in the overall promotion of innovation. Funding, however, is currently more awarded to firms in less-clustered sectors. Although it is encouraging to see that R&D funding has a significantly positive effect on product innovation and renewal, the results show that funding could be used more effectively and efficiently in more clustered industries. The Walloon region, in particular, could reduce its significantly lower product innovation and renewal by linking its current cluster policy with its innovation funding. As such, they could get more innovation output with less R&D input and try to overcome their <b>regional</b> urbanization <b>disadvantage.</b> nrpages: 30 status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In 2010 a new {{suite of}} scholarships, the Student Start Up Scholarship and the Relocation Scholarship {{developed}} {{as part of}} the Rudd Government's response to the Bradley Review of Higher Education were stalled in the Senate as a result of opposition by the Liberal-National Opposition and Senator Fielding to related changes to eligibility requirements for Youth Allowance. This left an estimated 150,000 students waiting for the changes to pass parliament two weeks {{before the start of the}} academic year in March. The government abolished the old scholarship system that helped around 21,000 students per year as result of concerns that it was not adequately means tested and that (as a result of being administered by the Universities) many scholarships were not allocated. The new scholarship system was a massive extension of the system of support, provided as an entitlement and based on parental income and administered by Centrerlink. However, the Government abolished the old scholarships prior to securing passage for the new scholarships which were included in a bill which also tightened eligibility for Youth Allowance to reduce access to student from high income families by reforming the 'work test' coupled with a loosening of the parental income test. These changes were recommended by the Bradley Review of Higher Education.http://www.innovation.gov.au/highereducation/ResourcesAndPublications/ReviewOfAustralianHigherEducation/Pages/default.aspx. However, the Government was criticised by the National Party who claimed the changes would <b>disadvantage</b> <b>regional</b> students and for abolishing the old scholarships (many of which were provided on the basis of 'regionality' and not parental income) before securing passage of the new scheme. One university in Queensland topped up its foodbank, anticipating that the number of students regularly going without food would increase.|$|R
40|$|There is an interdependent {{relationship}} between enterprises {{and the region}} {{in which they are}} located: On the one hand the conditions of this location influence turnover, costs, profits and thus the economic situation of the individual firm. On the other hand the economic situation of the regional firms is an important determinant of regional economic success and the wel-fare of the people living in that region. This happens directly because the firms stabilize regional income and employment; but there are also indirect effects running via income and input-output-linkages. Regional economic success and welfare in turn determine the regional tax receipts and the regions? possibilities for positively influencing the location conditions. These interdependencies give an explanation for the high interest firms, politicians and researchers normally have in regional location conditions and their quality. The better a region?s information about these issues, the better its possibilities to promote its location advantages and the more efficiently it can use its scarce financial means to reduce the locational <b>disadvantages.</b> <b>Regional</b> marketing and improvements of the region?s location conditions aim at the acquisition of new firms, at additional private investment in the region, at the creation and stabilization of employment and the population?s welfare. In recent years the Niederrhein Institute for Regional- and Structural Research (NIERS) has surveyed firms to thoroughly analyze the location conditions of Middle Lower Rhine Area ? a German region located {{in the western part of}} Northrhine-Westphalia. This research especially aimed at judging the location conditions? quality in Middle Lower Rhine Area. But as the firms had to evaluate not only the local quality but also the general importance of the location factors and as firms? participation in these surveys has been sufficiently high the results also give the opportunity to rank the location factors by its relevance and to differentiate this kind of analysis by industry. So, the aim of the proposed paper is twofold: It firstly describes which locational factors are ? on the basis of the above mentioned surveys ? most important from the firms? point of view. To find out whether energy-intensive industries have special location requirements it secondly compares these general results with those from energy-intensive industries...|$|R
40|$|From Introduction. Regional {{economic}} disequilibria {{was viewed}} as both an obstacle to and result of integration (European Commission 1965; European Commission 1962; European Commission 1969). Even within the Treaty of Rome, the Community tried to establish mechanisms to alleviate regional inequality. However, {{it was not until}} 1975 that the main mechanism of regional policy was established as a result of British and Irish enlargement: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Since then, cohesion policy has become a significant EU expenditure accounting for € 347 bn, or 35. 7 % of the total EU budget for 2007 - 13 (European Commission Regional Policy-Info Regio 2012). It has also become a key policy linked to enlargement. The underlying principle of cohesion policy assumes that the market alone cannot solve development problems and therefore government intervention is needed. This notion is in direct contrast to the underlying principle of EU competition policy, which asserts that the free market can solve economic development problems (Meadows, interview by author, 2003). The logic underlying cohesion policy is not only counter to EU competition policy, but also regulatory policies. Unlike other EU policies, cohesion policy is not a sectoral policy, but rather territorial in nature (Leonardi, 2006). Thus at times EU regulatory policy has also unintentionally worked counter to the goals of <b>regional</b> policy, sometimes <b>disadvantaging</b> poorer regions (Dudek, 2005). As the Community has sought to ameliorate regional disparities, it meant that all levels of government: local, regional, national and supranational would need to be involved, however, member states have different territorial governance and European regional development programs have to varying degrees impacted the relationship and policy responsibility of different levels of government (Leonardi, 2006; Bachtler and Michie 1993; Marks, 1993). The very nature of regional development policy has provoked a re-examination of subsidiarity, or which level of government is the lowest and most appropriate level. The discussion of policy formulation and implementation at the lowest level possible also addresses the issue of the democratic deficit. Some argue that the closer government is to the people the more responsive and representative it is. Democracy, however, also implies that public funds are used in a transparent way and for public rather than private good. Yet, as we examine the history and current situation of EU regional funds we find that corruption and misuse still abound. Thus, to understand the history of regional policy it is imperative to look at the major transformations of the policy, how regional policy has impacted subsidiarity and the quality of democracy, become an important instrument of enlargement and contradicted or conflicted with other EU policies...|$|R
