5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> being slow or disruptive.|$|E
5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting <b>rod.</b> <b>For</b> vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E

25|$|Bradford Reed {{invented the}} pencilina, a {{custom-made}} string instrument in the 1980s. It is a double-neck 3rd bridge guitar {{that is similar}} in construction to two long, thin zithers connected by a stand. Wedged over and under the strings in each neck is an adjustable rod, a wooden drum stick for the guitar strings and a metal <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> the bass strings. In addition, there are four bells. The pencilina is played by striking its strings and bells with sticks. The strings may also be plucked or bowed.|$|E

25|$|Modulus {{refers to}} the {{stiffness}} of the graphite, not the amount of material used {{or the number of}} graphite fibres incorporated into the sheets. Buying a rod based solely on the modulus rating is a mistake because other factors must be considered, for example, if the fisherman does not want the stiffest <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> light line techniques or cranking. In addition, other qualities must be incorporated in the graphite itself and the rod must be designed correctly to ensure the best performance and durability of the rod. The other components that go into a quality rod can also add significantly to the cost.|$|E
25|$|At SL-1, {{control rods}} would {{get stuck in}} the control rod channel sporadically. Numerous {{procedures}} were conducted to evaluate control rods to ensure they were operating properly. There were rod drop tests and scram tests of each rod, in addition to periodic rod exercising and rod withdrawals for normal operation. From February 1959 to November 18, 1960, there were 40 cases of a stuck control <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> scram and rod drop tests and about a 2.5% failure rate. From November 18, 1960 to December 23, 1960, there was {{a dramatic increase in}} stuck rods, with 23 in that time period and a 13.0% failure rate. Besides these test failures, there were an additional 21 rod sticking incidents from February 1959 to December 1960; 4 of these had occurred in the last month of operation during routine rod withdrawal. The central control rod, No. 9, had the best operational performance record even though it was operated more frequently {{than any of the other}} rods.|$|E

Hal Halpin, president of the Entertainment Consumers Association, described Grand Theft Auto III as the [...] "lightning <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> the violence-in-games debate". Metros Roger Hargreaves wrote that it [...] "emboldened a whole new wave of games that were ... fixated with violence, gang culture". Greg Ford of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that the game allowed the medium to handle mature subject matter in a more serious manner than previously perceived, and noted the improvement of video game classification {{as a result of}} the game's controversy.|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein {{made several}} {{alterations}} {{to the original}} work: he eliminated various non-essential figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the side rather than the end. At the same time, he kept Donald and Mickey in almost the same positions {{as they were in}} the original. Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and fishing <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition. Walt Disney said about Donald Duck: [...] "He's got a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject." [...] Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features.|$|E
500|$|Five singles were {{released}} from the album, including Madonna's first US number-one [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and her first UK number-one [...] "Into the Groove". To promote the album, she embarked on The Virgin Tour, which had shows in cities of North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 1980s. Madonna proved {{that she was not}} a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, [...] "Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment." ...|$|E

A high range radiation dose rate probe was used to screen these metal pieces for radioactivity. A fluorescent screen was used to ultimately determine the exact location of the source, but the team had to wait for cloud cover to reduce moonlight enough to see properly.

500|$|Bourque was a {{frequent}} lightning <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> attention in 2011–12. [...] Following a slow start to his season offensively, Bourque was criticized on national television by Hockey Night in Canada commentator Kelly Hrudey, who questioned the player's dedication and suggested Bourque didn't care about the game. Bourque expressed his offence at Hrudey's comments, while his teammates spoke out in his defence. [...] He was then suspended twice within a month for illegal hits. [...] He received a two-game ban on December 19, 2011, for a check from behind against Chicago's Brent Seabrook, and then earned a five-game suspension on January 4, 2012, for an elbow {{to the head of}} Washington's Nicklas Bäckström.

500|$|Inevitably, the Manual {{became a}} {{lightning}} <b>rod</b> <b>for</b> controversy.

[...] Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the Manual. [...] According to journalist Lynn Coady, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press's offices. [...] In addition, Anansi co-founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBI–RCMP concerns. [...] Many people {{did not want the}} Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the Manual encouraged emigration. [...] But few observers believed him, then or later. [...] The first sentence of an article in The New York Times from 1968 describes the Manual as [...] "a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription". [...] Canadian essayist Robert Fulford remembers the Manual as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers. [...] Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 concedes that the Manual is [...] "coyly titled".|$|E
