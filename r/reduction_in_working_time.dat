40|$|A {{reduction}} in working hours is being considered to tackle {{issues associated with}} ecological sustainability, social equity and enhanced life satisfaction - a so-called triple dividend. With respect to an environmental dividend, the authors analyse the time use rebound effects of reducing working time. They explore how an increase in leisure time triggers a rearrangement of time and expenditure budgets, and thus the use of resources in private households. Does it hold true that time-intensive activities replace resource-intensive consumption when people have more discretionary time at their disposal? This study on environmental issues is complemented by introducing the parameters of voluntary social engagement and individual life satisfaction as potential co-benefits of rebound effects. In order to analyse the first dividend, a mixed methods approach is adopted, enabling two models of time use rebound effects to be applied. First, semi-standardised interviews reveal that environmentally ambiguous substitutions of activities occur following a {{reduction in}} working hours. Second, estimates for Germany from national surveys on time use and expenditure show composition effects of gains in leisure time and income loss. For the latter, we estimate the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to time use.

Using a union bargaining framework, I show that working time reduction leads to wage moderation in terms of annual remuneration.

As a result, the relation between hourly wages and working time {{is likely to be}} U-shaped. The level of working time where {{the impact of}} hours on hourly wages changes sign, is typically higher than the individual hours supply, unless the latter is strongly upward sloping. Extending these partial equilibrium results to the general equilibrium, this also leads to a U- shaped relation between equilibrium unemployment and working time: For relatively long working times, a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> will decrease the unemployment rate; whereas unemployment may increase for shorter working times. ...|$|E
40|$|Denmark {{is one of}} the European {{countries}} which has been able to reduce unemployment drastically in recent years; the unemployment figure has fallen by more than 120, 000 since its peak of 340, 000 in 1994. This success deserves particular attention because the policy followed in Denmark differs very clearly from that in the other countries with employment policy success; {{there is no sign of}} an accentuated liberalisation of the labour market, nor does the secret behind the Danish success lie in promoting part-time work or enforcing <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> As is shown in this report, the reduction of unemployment goes back to several policies acting in combination which tackled the problem almost simultaneously: a fiscal policy which first (in 1994) gave an expansionary impulse of a total of 1. 2 % of the GDP and reformed the tax and social security systems; a labour market policy which increased the pressure on people to take up employment, used existing instruments (early retirement regulations) to a greater extent and developed new ones (sabbatical models), thus reducing the labour force potential by some 100, 000 at short notice; and finally a wages policy which pursued a moderate course in spite of strong economic expansion and arranged wage determination more flexibly. One key to success is the fact that a stronger macroeconomic growth came about in Denmark not least as a result of this change in policy, but the higher growth explains the increase in employment only partially; the other policies also contribute to this. The method used to solve the employment problem in Denmark can not easily be applied to Germany, in view of the difference in size alone and the special problems of eastern Germany. Nevertheless this report emphasises three elements of reform that could also point the way ahead for Germany: firstly the concerted procedure mentioned which also led to the various measures having an increased effect especially in the initial phase. Secondly keeping to the schedule. Virtually all the measures taken were limited in time and in the following period the plans for phasing them out were also adhered to. Thirdly Denmark is an example of how a high level of social security need not stand in the way of reducing unemployment, provided that the other conditions are appropriate for this. In particular the high level of basic security probably contributed to the acceptance of the cuts which are also unavoidable in Denmark.

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the high unemployment, there has been {{discussion}} <b>in</b> Germany of <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours, also for employment policy reasons, as a means of avoiding the threat of redundancies or - for lack of additional jobs - to spread the work available over more people to reduce unemployment. In addition to traditional concepts such as cuts <b>in</b> the statutory <b>working</b> week and increased part-time work, new forms of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements move into focus here which lead, for example via annual <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts, to operating hours and working hours being made more flexible and less closely bound, as well as to an increase in the time sovereignty of the employees. The economic effects of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours, <b>in</b> particular the effects on employment are, however, judged very differently, and not only by the two sides of industry. This article demonstrates economic connections of a general <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours. As a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours influences the economy in several ways, some of which compensate for others, {{it is very difficult to}} deduce definite statements from economic theory, so macroeconomic simulation studies have to be used. For this reason a series of simulations were carried out on the effect of general <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> annual <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> using the lAB/Westphal model, which was developed from the SYSIFO model. The following results can be deduced from the simulation experiments: - A <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours has a positive effect on employment, both with and without compensatory increases in wage rates, whereby, however, the employment effect is clearly less significant in the case of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours with full compensatory increases in wage rates. - The upswing in employment induced by the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours is paid for with price increases and a loss of affluence and growth. - The effects of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours which increase employment, wages and prices, result in reduced state transfer payments and in the medium term also in additional tax revenue for the state. If this is then put back into the economic circulation, the positive employment impulse of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours increases and the losses in affluence and growth can begin to be compensated. - The most advantageous strategy from a employment policy point of view is a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours under the following conditions: - without a compensatory increase in wage rates - use of the state's savings in expenditure and additional revenue to reduce taxes and non-wage labour costs To qualify this it must be stressed that the employment promoting impulses can only be deduced with the model for the national economic average. Disaggregation by trades or industries, regions, occupations or qualifications could result in differing effects. Also, the positive statements are valid only for <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours which do not differ greatly in type and scope from the previous development of annual <b>working</b> <b>time</b> observed <b>in</b> the past. More extensive drops in the average annual <b>working.</b> <b>time</b> could lead to reactions which cancel the connections deduced from the past and are therefore not taken into account in the model. Limitations for the extent of <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours also arise from the international competition connections. It can also be expected that in the case of a completely different pattern of <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours, such as a definite increase in voluntary transitions into part-time employment as well as more extensive flexibility and independence of operating and working hours, other effects will occur. There is something to be said for the fact that in the latter case the negative attendant circumstances could presumably be avoided to a large extent. As a result of its defensive character, an isolated <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours occurring purely for employment policy reasons due to a lack of sufficient jobs available elsewhere, and not embedded in a more extensive strategy of job creation, could hardly be suitable to solve the problems on the labour market permanently.

40|$|Paid working {{patterns}} are currently regulated by governments {{around the world}} for a range of social and economic reasons: to increase labour supply and skills; to provide a strong tax base to support an ageing population; to help people reconcile work and family life over increasingly diversified life courses; and to be in line with the general principle of the activating, employment led welfare state. Environmental considerations rarely feature in the design or evaluation of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> policy. Nevertheless, various authors working on policies for sustainable development argue that <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> average paid <b>working</b> <b>time</b> could lead to environmental benefits: as people work less, they in turn earn less, and so consume less, resulting in lower environmental impacts from lower levels of production of products. This thesis takes this argument as its starting point, and synthesises these distinct perspectives on <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and its regulation to address two key questions: what level of environmental benefits could arise from such <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> paid <b>working</b> time?; and what are the implications for the design of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> policy?

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} reasons for the {{exceptionally}} robust performance of the German labour market during the Great Recession. While GDP dropped by more than five per cent in 2009, employment remained constant and started to increase soon after. We compare this recession to other major recessions in Germany and analyse to what extent changes in hourly productivity and working time cushioned their impact on employment. We find that reductions in hourly productivity {{played a significant role in}} all recessions while working time reductions helped to safeguard jobs only occasionally. However, in the Great Recession, temporary working time reductions were amply used to stabilise employment. Using a time series model, we show that the reduction in hourly productivity during the Great Recession is predictable with historical data, while the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> was unexpectedly pronounced.

40|$|Over and again, the {{reduction}} of working time is praised as the instrument against unemployment in Europe. While the first round argument appears obvious – less work for some will create more work for others – second round repercussions, such as consequential labor cost increases, put doubt on the validity of the argument. As frequently, empirical evidence would be helpful to shed light on this important debate. This paper reviews the theoretical arguments and the empirical evidence on the effects of reduced weekly working time on unemployment. Given the prominence in the European popular discussion, the scientific literature is astoundingly thin on the topic. The main findings can be summarized as follows: There are theoretical arguments that can form the basis for a positive effect on employment in response to a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> However, they rest on strong assumptions that appear counterfactual. Econometric studies show little or negative effects on employment in Germany. Only a set of simulation studies predicts a positive employment effect – but again, they appear to rest on counterfactual assumptions. Hence, while {{the reduction}} of work hours may have increased workers’ utility – a legitimate goal of the unions – it {{does not appear to be}} justified as a cure against unemployment. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} for Germany's economic development {{are good at}} present. Nonetheless there are also uncertainties and downsides. For this reason our labour market forecast for 2000 {{is based on a}} range of assumptions for the actual economic growth. The overview includes the basic data of these alternative calculations. Today we consider the middle variant (GDP + 2. 5 %) the most likely to come true. This should bring about a change in the previous employment trend. The gradual, accelerated {{increase in the number of}} people in employment is supported by the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> annual <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> We reckon with an increase in the employment figure of 0. 4 % or + 160, 000 in the annual average. Unlike in the previous year, when employment stagnated over the year and the increase in the annual average had resulted from a statistical surplus alone, the increase in 2000 follows entirely from the dynamics in the course of the year. The stimulation of labour demand is, however, concentrated on the old Länder. The labour market policy measures should level off at a somewhat lower level. They continue to constitute a strong support of the eastern German labour market, though. In eastern and western Germany the tension on the labour market is easing once again on the supply side, since the labour force potential decreases by a total of 0. 2 million people. There should be a further decreasing trend in the number unemployed in the course of the year 2000 and it should fall by 225, 000 to about 3. 88 million in the annual average. A provisional outlook at the year 2001 leads us to expect this trend to continue. A look across the national borders shows that positive impulses for the economy and labour demand should result once again from the improved world economy. A deeper component analysis of the labour force potential underlines the fact that demographic changes on the supply side are easing the tension on the labour market. Finally productivity- and employment-stabilising effects are derived from the increasing move towards flexibility through <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts.

40|$|Architectural {{surveying}} has {{for many}} years been approached in a manner which was so amateur that it left many people wondering whether {{it really was a}} separate discipline. Nowadays, the researcher's operational and algorithmic mentis form rejects this conception and suggests working on the methods, techniques and sequences of operations which are feasible and led to results; it also suggests recording every minute of this work, to describe it down to the minutest detail and be completely open about the errors committed and the choice criteria. The research presented here concerns a small piece of the mosaic which could be called «New Operative Methods for Architectural Surveying ». It is a programme involving. several Italian universities and concerns a method which simplifies and makes planimetric surveys quicker and more reliable. The method simplifies surveying, because the procedures 'can be carried out even by a single operator and makes it quicker because the field tests have shown a considerable <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>working</b> <b>times</b> and finally it is more reliable because the procedure allows checking for any errors made during measurement. The method is based, in short, on the use of a theodolite equipped with an infra-red ray diastimeter which can operate even without a reflecting prism, i. e., by exploiting its own reflection on the surface under study. The diastimeter is accompanied by a laser which, thanks to a simple system of mirrors, produces a ray which is coaxial to the viewpoint of the diastimeter and allows sighting which does not require collimation via the spyglass. It is evident that while allowing a rather rapid surveying for polar coordinates, this method can free the surveyor from the tiring operations of trilateration and interacting with a computer and allows an almost immediate or even on-line results, i. e., at the very moment of measurement, attaining a sort of tracing of the building. To check both the quantity and quality errors made by the instrument, in our case, a WILD DIOR 3002 DISTOMAT, a simple and effective measuring instrument was prepared in the basement of Pescara University's Faculty of  Architecture. The instrument's performance was checked on various materials as were the different situations of the incidence of the ray of the surface being studied. The results obtained showed that the error is very constant and can therefore be checked by using a suitable procedure which consists in calibrating the instrument in the field. Three procedures were then experimented for collecting measurements and linking the models: the first, or «central» consisted in placing the instrument in a first position from which one could correspond all the other positions, measuring their three-dimensional coordinates vis-a-vis a reference system which originates from the first position. The second, or «tracking», is nothing more than the typical polygonal procedure. The third, or «support points» is that which furnished the best results, in terms of both precision and feasibility. In conclusion, research on surveying procedures is still an open field and there is much to discover as regards both the philological aspect and also the use of new technologies. When these studies are completed, architectural surveying, as regards both its practice and teaching, will be seen in a completely different light. The method will be appreciated to the same extent that the graphic quality of a plan is today, the traditional 'plan' will find itself in a context which no longer comprises tables, but various information and coordinates, which are however nonetheless aimed at satisfying the common objective of any scholar of architecture: knowledge...|$|R
