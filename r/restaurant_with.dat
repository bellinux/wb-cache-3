5|$|On 31 March 2014, Heston Blumenthal {{announced}} he would be closing the restaurant for renovations for 6 months and temporarily relocating it with its entire team to Crown Towers, Melbourne, Australia. The restaurant will be called The Fat Duck for 6 months before being renamed Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. This will be the second <b>restaurant</b> <b>with</b> that name and will be Blumenthal's first restaurant outside of Britain, and his sixth in total. This temporary closure of the Bray location caused the restaurant to become ineligible for assessment for the 2016 Michelin Guide, thus losing its 3-starred status which it regained the following year.|$|E

5|$|Zion Cinema was {{the central}} {{landmark}} of Zion Square from the 1920s until its closure in 1972. Located {{on the south side}} of Zion Square, it was originally a 400-seat silent-movie hut and, after snowfall destroyed the structure, was rebuilt into a 600-seat theatre that staged plays, concerts, lectures, and films. In the 1920s and 1930s the Zion Cinema was the cultural center of Jerusalem. After its closure, the building was demolished and a high-rise containing the Kikar Zion Hotel and a branch of Bank HaPoalim was erected in its place. In 2013 the 117-room hotel was purchased by Orchid Hotel Management Ltd., which is renovating the property for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. The hotel will have 137 rooms and suites, and a kosher rooftop <b>restaurant</b> <b>with</b> a 360-degree panoramic view.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{receives}} a card from Carvel that entitles her to free ice cream cakes for life. She gets a free cake with the card {{but it has}} a mistake in the decoration so NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) returns it to the restaurant. When he gets a refund for the free cake, Jenna decides to scam the <b>restaurant.</b> <b>With</b> Kenneth's help, she orders several more cakes and gets refunds for them. Eventually Jenna is banned from Carvel. The two then enlist actor Kelsey Grammer to assist them in a bigger scam. Jenna and Kenneth submit a sketch to TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) in Liz's name that requires dozens of cakes. Grammer orders the cakes and later gets refunds for all of them. The gang has now collected money from both TGS and Carvel for 21 free cakes, a windfall of nearly 800 dollars. Kenneth runs into one of the Carvel employees (Jen Ponton) and learns that she was fired because of the scam. Realizing the negative effect of their actions, Kenneth decides not {{to take part in the}} scams anymore.|$|E

5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a <b>restaurant</b> <b>with</b> only subdued {{artificial}} lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded to a team of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of the chefs moved from Harveys to The <b>Restaurant</b> <b>with</b> him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team of four or five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, larder and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de partie heading the team, and then commis chefs under them. By 1994, Éric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between the results of routine inspections and foodborne outbreaks in restaurants, we conducted a matched case-control study using available data from Seattle-King County, Washington. Case <b>restaurants</b> were facilities <b>with</b> a reported foodborne outbreak between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1987 (N = 28). Two control <b>restaurants</b> <b>with</b> no reported outbreaks during this period were matched to each case restaurant on county health district and date of routine inspection (N = 56). Data from the routine inspection that preceded the outbreak (for case restaurants) or the date-matched routine inspection (for control restaurants) were abstracted from computerized inspection records. Case restaurants had a significantly lower mean inspection score (83. 8 on a 0 to 100 point scale) than control restaurants (90. 9). <b>Restaurants</b> <b>with</b> poor inspection scores and violations of proper temperature controls of potentially hazardous foods were, respectively, five and ten {{times more likely to}} have outbreaks than <b>restaurants</b> <b>with</b> better results. Although this study demonstrates that Seattle-King County's routine inspection form can successfully identify restaurants at increased risk of foodborne outbreaks, it also illustrates that more emphasis on regulation and education is needed to prevent outbreaks in <b>restaurants</b> <b>with</b> poor inspection results...|$|R
