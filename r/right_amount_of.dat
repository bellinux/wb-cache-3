5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level.

5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with just the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

25|$|A {{successful}} ramming {{was difficult}} to achieve; just the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets {{that did not have}} well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule.

If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.|$|E

25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant {{the difference between life}} and death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{organizational}} ambidexterity has been resonated and applied in diverse areas of management research.

We investigate this trade-off by building {{on the notion that}} research institution need to reconcile the paradoxical demands of exploitation and exploration in their orientation. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of social network, funding, and productive organizational energy on knowledge exploration, knowledge exploitation and the capability of organizational ambidexterity in the context of research institution. A sample of 130 research institutions such as laboratory, study center and training center was collected through questionnaire survey. We tested the hypotheses using Partial Least Square (PLS). Findings of the study indicate that social network and funding are positively related to knowledge exploration and exploitation. However, productive organizational energy has no positive effect on knowledge exploration and exploitation. It is also confirmed that knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation have a significant influence on the capability of organizational ambidexterity, but knowledge exploitation has a dominant role on that effect. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Precise {{management}} of irrigation quantity {{along with the}} rate and timing of nutrient application are of critical importance to obtain desired results in terms of productivity and nutrient use efficiency (NUE). The fertigation allows application <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> plant nutrients uniformly to the wetted root volume zone {{where most of the}} active roots are concentrated and this helps enhance nutrient use efficiency. It has been found to improve the productivity and quality of crop produce along with improved resource use efficiency.

However, to get the desired results knowledge of the system and efficient management are essential. A review is made of the current literature on the use of fertigation covering various aspects of vegetable production including its advantages and constraints to its adoption and nutrient behaviour especially at the practical agriculture level in India...|$|R

40|$|Biologically active {{proteins}} without stable {{tertiary structure}} {{are common in}} all known proteomes. Functions of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are typically related to regulation, signaling and control.

Functions of IDPs are controlled by binding to specific partners, alternative splicing, and posttranslational modifications among other means.
