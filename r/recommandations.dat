40|$|The {{context of}} this thesis work is dynamic recommendation. Recommendation is the action,for an {{intelligent}} system, to supply a user of an application with personalized content so as toenhance what is refered to as ”user experience” e. g. recommending a product on a merchantwebsite or even an article on a blog. Recommendation is considered dynamic when the contentto recommend or user tastes evolve rapidly e. g. news recommendation. Many applications thatare of interest to us generates {{a tremendous amount of}} data through the millions of online usersthey have. Nevertheless, using this data to evaluate a new recommendation technique or evencompare two dynamic recommendation algorithms is far from trivial. This is the problem weconsider here. Some approaches have already been proposed. Nonetheless they were not studiedvery thoroughly both from a theoretical point of view (unquantified bias, loose convergencebounds [...] .) and from an empirical one (experiments on private data only). In this work we startby filling many blanks within the theoretical analysis. Then we comment on the result of anexperiment of unprecedented scale in this area: a public challenge we organized. This challengealong with a some complementary experiments revealed a unexpected source of a huge bias:time acceleration. The rest of this work tackles this issue. We show that a bootstrap-basedapproach allows to significantly reduce this bias and more importantly to control it.

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{filtering}} and, more generally, recommender systems {{represent an}} increasingly popular and important set of personalization technologies that help people navigate through the {{vast amounts of}} information. The performance of recommender systems can be evaluated along several dimensions, such as the accuracy of recommendations for each user and the diversity of recommendations across different users. Intuitively, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and diversity, because high accuracy may often be obtained by safely recommending to users the most popular (“bestselling”) items, {{which can lead to}} the reduction in recommendation diversity, i. e., less personalized recommendations. And conversely, higher diversity can be achieved by trying to uncover and recommend highly idiosyncratic/personalized items for each user, which are inherently more difficult to predict and, thus, may lead to a decrease in recommendation accuracy. In our research we explore different ways to overcome this accuracy-diversity tradeoff, and in this paper we discuss a variance-based approach that can improve both the accuracy and diversity of recommendations obtained from a traditional collaborative filtering technique. We provide empirical results based on several real-world movie rating datasets. Résumé.
