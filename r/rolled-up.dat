5|$|Before his {{match with}} Bret Hart, Lawler {{introduced}} a woman obviously younger than himself as his mother, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. Moments before the contest, Hart revealed that his knee injury was fake. During the contest, referee Earl Hebner became tied {{upside down in}} the ropes after being distracted by Shinja. While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he <b>rolled-up</b> Hart for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi usually lays eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the}} top of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs. P. schultzi has been seen laying eggs in a <b>rolled-up</b> leaf in a web of Ischnothele karschi.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a {{standard}} match between Bret Hart and Hakushi (managed by Shinja). Bret announced before the contest {{that he was}} dedicating his performances to his mother because it was Mother's Day. Jerry Lawler, who faced Bret later in the pay-per-view, watched the match backstage on a monitor. Bret won the contest, when he <b>rolled-up</b> Hakushi to gain a pinfall and end Hakushi's six-month-long undefeated streak. As Hart jumped to the arena floor after the contest, he appeared to legitimately injure his knee.|$|E

25|$|The dish may {{be served}} with {{toppings}} or accompaniments; grated cheese, diced onions, {{and sour cream}} are common toppings, as are saltine crackers, tortilla chips or corn chips, cornbread, <b>rolled-up</b> corn or flour tortillas, and pork tamales. Chili can also be served over rice or pasta such as spaghetti.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} match, Shelton Benjamin faced Maven for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. After Maven taunted the fans for {{speaking}} Spanish outside the ring, Benjamin <b>rolled-up</b> Maven {{to retain the}} title. Immediately after the match, Maven demanded a re-match. Benjamin executed a T-Bone suplex on Maven to retain the title.|$|E
25|$|When {{rolled into}} a ball, G. marginata can be {{distinguished}} from a <b>rolled–up</b> pill woodlouse by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill woodlice roll into much more perfect spheres. The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. The head and tail of a woodlouse have {{a greater number of}} small plates, while the head of Glomeris is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of woodlice at the read end. Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur.|$|E
25|$|The system {{gradually}} {{ended with}} the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and {{took the opportunity to}} map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The <b>rolled-up</b> payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.|$|E
25|$|Lontong, {{popular in}} Indonesia and {{also can be}} found in Malaysia, is made of {{compressed}} rice that is then cut into small cakes. It is traditionally made by boiling the rice until it is partially cooked and packing it tightly into a <b>rolled-up</b> banana leaf. The leaf is secured and cooked in boiling water for about 90minutes. Once the compacted rice has cooled, it can be cut up into bite-sized pieces. The dish is usually served cold or at room temperature with sauce-based dishes such as gado-gado and salads, although it can be eaten as an accompaniment to other dishes such as Satay and curries.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of plates and dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values {{can be made by}} multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the <b>rolled-up</b> plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the event Shelton Benjamin faced Chris Jericho for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. When the match began, Benjamin had the upper hand. Benjamin then {{performed}} a springboard off the ropes, but Jericho countered with a hurricanrana off the ring apron to the floor. Jericho utilized a chinlock on Benjamin. Jericho then {{climbed to the top}} rope, but Benjamin stopped Jericho, leaping to the top rope and superplexing Jericho. Jericho then hit a running enzuigiri, but only got a near fall. Benjamin performed the T-Bone Suplex, but Jericho put his foot under the bottom rope to void the pin. Jericho locked in the Walls of Jericho, but Benjamin got to the rope. Jericho then locked in the Walls of Jericho again but Benjamin <b>rolled-up</b> Jericho to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
25|$|The fifth match pitted Kurt Angle against Chris Benoit. The match {{started with}} mat wrestling {{between the two}} but Angle soon punched Benoit out of {{frustration}} and threw {{him out of the}} ring, so he could throw him into the broadcast table and the steel steps. Back in the ring, both men tried to submit their opponent using the other's signature hold with Benoit using the ankle lock on Angle, and Angle using the Crippler Crossface on Benoit. Benoit eventually succeeded in forcing Angle to tap out to the Crippler Crossface but the referee was knocked down and didn't see it. Near the end of the match, Benoit tried to pin Angle after a diving headbutt but was met with a two-count. Angle then quickly <b>rolled-up</b> up Benoit, using the tights for leverage to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Her {{battered}} {{body was}} found 18 March 2004, in a <b>rolled-up</b> carpet {{on the grounds of}} Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. It weighed only six stone (84 lb or 36kg), and was covered with burns and bruises. There were a total of 60 separate injuries. Her ear was scarred and swollen, had split in half, and become infected; her mouth was injured so much that her bottom lip had detached. She had eleven broken ribs. The ultimate cause of death had been thrombosis from a blood clot in her brain, brought on by septicaemia, dehydration and repeated assaults. The injuries were such that police at first thought they had found the body of a young boy. Police took weeks to identify her, launching an appeal on the BBC TV programme Crimewatch and consulting Interpol. She was 20 years old.|$|E
500|$|Euryattus, another {{jumping spider}} from Queensland, has a partly {{overlapping}} range with P. fimbriata′s and is abundant in their common range, and adult and large juvenile P. fimbriatas hunt Euryattus adopting specific tactics. Unlike most jumping spiders, Euryattus makes a nest by suspending a dead <b>rolled-up</b> leaf by silk lines from vegetation. P. fimbriata catches Euryattus females by mimicking the vibrations made by Euryattus males {{as part of}} their courtship, and this deception lures Euryattus females out of their nests. In tests, a Euryattus from P. fimbriata′s range recognises the predator and defends itself, while Euryattus specimens from outside P. fimbriata′s range seldom recognise the threat. P. fimbriata finds it easier to catch [...] a Euryattus from outside the predator's home range than to capture the same species from P. fimbriata′s range. This may be an example of an evolutionary arms race.|$|E
500|$|On the Broadway beat, Broderick swiftly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for violence. His fists were once described as [...] "huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat," [...] and to [...] "broderick" [...] became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch. His knuckles were broken many times. Once he knocked out the gangster Francis [...] "Two Gun" [...] Crowley with a single punch, even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him. He {{was said to have}} demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him, and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the Hudson Dusters gang and spat in his eye. Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper, which allowed him to beat gangsters while it looked like he was giving them a friendly swat with a <b>rolled-up</b> newspaper.|$|E
500|$|Ash, {{absent from}} the {{original}} screenplay by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, was conceived by David Giler and Walter Hill when Brandywine Productions acquired it. Although Giler and Hill believed that Alien required a secondary story element, O'Bannon said in the film's audio commentary that he saw it as unnecessary. Shusett praised Giler and Hill's addition of the Ash story line in the 2003 documentary, The Beast Within: The Making of 'Alien, calling it [...] "one {{of the best things}} in the movie". In the special-edition DVD audio commentary, director Ridley Scott interprets some of Ash's inhuman behavior (such as the attempted suffocation of Ellen Ripley with a <b>rolled-up</b> pornographic magazine) as reflecting Freudian sexual frustration from being anatomically incorrect. Critic Roz Kaveney analyzes Ash in From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, seeing him as a menacing robot who exists before his creators would impose programming alluded to in Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.|$|E
500|$|The re-enactment at {{the first}} festival was a simple affair {{compared}} to later years: approximately 100local enthusiasts, kitted out in crude imitations of medieval gear, fought {{each other on the}} fields of Tewkesbury. [...] They wore woollen chainmail or armour made of fibreglass. [...] Their swords and pole arms were made from wood; arrows were <b>rolled-up</b> wallpaper. [...] As the festival became more popular over the years, the scale and quality of the re-enactment changed. [...] Re-enactors {{from other parts of the}} United Kingdom joined the event, as well as those from Poland, Germany and other European countries. [...] The armour and weapons used in the later years were faithful steel reproductions that could cost thousands of pounds sterling (£). [...] By 2002, the Battle of Tewkesbury was re-enacted by approximately 2,000men and women, and the British Broadcasting Corporation called the next year's re-enactment the largest in Europe. [...] Aside from the battle, the storming of Tewkesbury Abbey is also re-enacted during the festival. [...] The subsequent trial and execution of the prisoners are acted out in a mock fashion.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{references}} Nixon's dog Checkers. In addition, the veterinarian is {{a reference}} to Vince Edwards, who played Ben Casey on the 1960s drama of the same name. Also, among the books that {{end up in the}} Simpsons' fireplace are The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Fatherhood by Bill Cosby, and a book entitled Canine Surgery. Fatherhood was heavily referenced in the episode [...] "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] earlier this season. The scene in which Mr. Burns and Smithers brainwash Santa's Little Helper is a parody of A Clockwork Orange with Beethoven's [...] "Ode to Joy". The film uses footage of a kind that would aggravate a dog: a dog being hit with a <b>rolled-up</b> newspaper, a shoe kicking a water dish, a kitten playing with a ball of string, a tank running over a doghouse, a dog being hit on the head by a falling toilet seat, and finally [...] "footage" [...] of Lyndon Johnson holding his dog up in the air by the ears, which actually occurred. Music from Peter and the Wolf, a children's story composed by Sergei Prokofiev, is played over the wanderings of Santa's Little Helper through Springfield's outer domains. This episode also references several controversies about Michael Jackson; for example, Kent Brockman's butler tells Kent that his pet llama bit Ted Kennedy, and Mr. Burns is sleeping in an iron lung as part of his longevity treatment. This episode shows the first time where someone other than Homer says [...] "Doh!". Lisa exclaims it when she is assigned to do a book report on Copernicus and she realizes she does not have any reference books. In addition, the doctor, who was played by Hank Azaria, and the music that plays when he desperately attempts to save the hamster, is {{a reference to}} Ben Casey. One of the places to where Santa's Little Helper voyages, Swartzwelder County, where he rescues a baby from a burning house, is a reference to the writer of this episode, John Swartzwelder.|$|E

However, he refuses to sell the last portrait, which is of Sir Oliver, {{out of respect for}} his benefactor; Charles will not sell it even when [...] "Premium" [...] offers as much for it as for all the rest.

2500|$|Walton's {{sexuality}} {{has been}} the subject of speculation. In the 1960s, many Washington insiders assumed he was homosexual. Walton was well known as a [...] "beard" [...] and [...] "safe" [...] date, and was frequently asked to escort married and unmarried women to White House and government functions. Artist Alice Neel, who painted numerous portraits of gay men, depicted him with <b>rolled-up</b> sleeves and an oversized watch band, coded indications of his homosexuality, and the painting has been read as a political commentary on homophobia. Modern historians such as C. David Heymann and Greg Lawrence state outright that Walton was gay.|$|E
2500|$|Mack's {{strength}} {{as a manager}} was finding the best players, teaching them well and letting them play. [...] "He {{did not believe that}} baseball revolved around managerial strategy." [...] He was [...] "one of the first managers to work on repositioning his fielders" [...] during the game, often directing the outfielders to move left or right, play shallow or deep, by waving his <b>rolled-up</b> scorecard from the bench. After he became well known for doing this, he often passed his instructions to the fielders by way of other players, and simply waved his scorecard as a feint.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time as the inquest, a tiny piece of <b>rolled-up</b> paper with the words [...] "Tamam Shud" [...] printed on it was found in a fob pocket sewn within the dead man's trouser pocket. Public library {{officials}} called in to translate the text identified it as a phrase meaning [...] "ended" [...] or [...] "finished" [...] found on the last page of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The paper's verso side was blank. [...] Police conducted an Australia-wide search to find a copy of the book that had a similarly blank verso. A photograph of the scrap of paper was released to the press.|$|E
2500|$|Wham!'s first {{manager was}} Bryan Morrison. The effect of Wham! on the public, {{especially}} teenage girls, was felt {{from the moment}} they finished their debut performance of [...] "Young Guns (Go for It!)" [...] on Top of the Pops. Michael wore espadrilles, an open suede jacket, and <b>rolled-up</b> denim jeans. Ridgeley stood behind him, flanked by backing dancers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman. Afterwards, the song shot into the Top 40 at No. 24 and peaked at No. 3 in December. The following year (1983), Dee C. Lee began her work with Paul Weller in The Style Council, and was replaced by Pepsi DeMacque. Holliman and DeMacque would later record as Pepsi & Shirlie.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, July 27, {{police arrived}} at the {{apartment}} on Emmet Street Collins shared with his roommate, Arnold Davis. Although Collins emphatically protested his innocence and insisted the eyewitnesses' identification of him had been an error, he refused {{to return to the}} police station to take a polygraph test. The following evening, Davis observed Collins emerging from his bedroom carrying a box partially covered by a blanket. As Davis opened the door for his roommate to leave the apartment, he observed that the contents of this box included a purple woman's shoe, <b>rolled-up</b> jean-like material, and a burlap purse. Later that evening, Collins informed Davis he had simply decided to [...] "get rid of" [...] the box and its contents.|$|E
2500|$|In {{most of the}} Fatal Fury and King of Fighters games, Terry wears a red {{sleeveless}} denim vest with a white star on the back, worn over a white cutoff T-shirt; {{the latter}} occasionally features tattered sleeves. In the first Fatal Fury game and The King of Fighters XIV, however, Terry wears a red leather jacket that features <b>rolled-up</b> sleeves. He also wears black fingerless gloves, blue jeans, a pair of red Chuck Taylor All Star shoes, and a [...] red-and-white baseball/trucker cap. The character has long, blonde hair, but keeps it tied in a ponytail with bangs around his forehead/cheeks. Real Bout Fatal Fury was made to end the conflict between Terry and his nemesis, Gesse Howard. Terry has been popular within the SNK staff to the point multiple members worked on his character's movesets during location tests of Real Bout Fatal Fury 2.|$|E

Debbie's trademark was her hats, usually black bowlers. She also made popular wearing tight, <b>rolled-up</b> jeans, vests over a T-shirt, friendship bracelets and two Swatch watches as on the back cover of her popular Electric Youth album and in her [...] "Staying Together" [...] music video. Her influences were Madonna and Olivia Newton-John, though she has often stated she admires Elton John and Billy Joel as favorite artists and was asked and did sing and perform live with Billy Joel and John at Elton John's Madison Square Garden show. She appeared {{on the covers of}} numerous teen magazines such as Tiger Beat.|$|E
2500|$|Author Hilary Kingsley dubbed Wicksy in 1991 as Walford's [...] "only sexy man". She added, [...] "there is a cheekiness about Simon Wicks that's very attractive. In {{his early}} days he was happy-go-lucky, {{interested}} only in girls and paying off his debts [...] Simon put it about a bit". Kate Lock, author of EastEnders official book, Who's who?, described Simon as a [...] "smoothie and a charmer [...] shallow, lazy and unreliable." [...] She suggested that {{he graduated from the}} [...] "love 'em and leave 'em school of relationships" [...] and that he could not cope with commitment. Additionally, author Rupert Smith has suggested that, [...] "with his blow-dried hair, <b>rolled-up</b> jacket and toothy grin, [...] was the apotheosis of 80s manhood. He went through the women of Walford like a dose of salts, {{but at the end of}} the day slippery Simon was a bolter".|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Buck Clayton shared {{some of his}} {{memories}} of the Dunbar. He recalled the Dunbar as “jumping” with loads {{of people trying to}} get a glimpse of the celebrities, and parties thrown by Duke Ellington and his guys with “chicks and champagne everywhere.” Clayton recalled an instance when Ellington and his orchestra came to Los Angeles shortly after the 1932 release of the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). Ellington’s band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: “So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating on the tables, instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, <b>rolled-up</b> newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm. [...] It was absolutely crazy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the prelude}} to the section, Beautiful Olympics, a short film, was {{screened}} depicting the making of paper, another of the Four Great Inventions, ending with a <b>rolled-up</b> scroll painting {{to set the stage}} for the next segment. Ceramics, porcelain vessels and other Chinese fine arts artifacts were beamed on a giant LED scroll, representing the first of the Four Great Inventions of China, paper, and displaying animated graphics, slowly unfurling. At its center was a piece of white canvas paper, which then ushered in a performance of black-costumed dancers whose hands hid brushes that had been dipped in ink. [...] They performed a dance while leaving their trails on the block of white paper, reminiscent of Chinese ink and wash painting. This was accompanied by the sounds of the guqin, China's ancient seven-string zither, as played by Chen Leiji (S: 陈雷激, T: 陳雷激, P: Chén Léijī). [...] The LED scroll then showed an old, rare painting by Wang Ximeng.|$|E
2500|$|His first {{international}} appearances {{came during the}} 1983 World Cup, when he umpired four games. In 1992, he was appointed to his first Test match, the third match in the series between England and Pakistan at Old Trafford. At {{the end of the}} fourth day, he warned the Pakistan fast bowler Aaqib Javed for intimidatory bowling against the England tail-ender, Devon Malcolm. Palmer then returned Aaqib's sweater to the bowler {{at the end of the}} over with what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack termed [...] "more emphasis than usual, probably because it was caught in his belt". Aaqib and Pakistan captain Javed Miandad protested, and a supporter ran onto the pitch with a <b>rolled-up</b> newspaper, and was restrained by security staff. Match referee Conrad Hunte ruled in favour of Palmer, fined Aaqib half his match fee and censured Pakistan tour manager Intikhab Alam, who had told the press that Palmer had insulted his team. The International Cricket Council also censured Intikhab for repeating his remarks and refusing to apologise to Palmer.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} first London {{performances}} of La Tosca, Francis Burnand and the composer Florian Pascal wrote a musical parody of the play entitled Tra-la-la Tosca or The High-Toned Soprano and the Villain Bass. In their burlesque version, Tosca murders Scarpia in the [...] "Cafe Romano allo Strando", stabbing him with a huge <b>rolled-up</b> restaurant bill and then places one of the dish covers over his face. Cavaradossi, instead, is executed by a phalanx of photographers. The show premiered at London's Royalty Theatre in January 1890 and ran for 45 performances, with the critic Cecil Howard pronouncing it one of Burnand's finest efforts. Burnand had previously parodied Sardou's Féodora as Stage-Doora (1883) and Théodora as The O'Dora (1885), both of which ran at Toole's Theatre in London. In 2004, Lucio Dalla composed an Italian musical, Tosca, Amore Disperato (Tosca, Desperate Love), based largely {{on the structure of}} Puccini's opera, but with elements from Sardou's play. The setting was updated to modern times with costumes by Giorgio Armani. Tosca, Amore Disperato continues to be performed in Italy and was broadcast on RAI television in June 2010.|$|E
