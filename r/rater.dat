5|$|On October 16, 2017, NBC {{announced}} that it would be developing a brand new Nancy Drew TV series. Tony Phelan and Joan <b>Rater</b> will once again be writing, with Dan Jinks executive producing again for CBS Studios. However, this pilot will have a different plot and cast that the team's previous effort.|$|E
5|$|Rhimes is {{the series}} head writer, or its most {{prolific}} writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account. Other {{members of the}} writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan <b>Rater,</b> and Debora Cahn. From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey Matter, where the writer of an episode discussed the motives behind the writing. Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed {{a substantial number of}} episodes. Cast members Chandra Wilson and Kevin McKidd have both directed multiple episodes.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} season to be {{produced}} by ABC Studios under its current name, after the transition from Touchstone Television in May 2007. It was also produced by ShondaLand Production Company, and The Mark Gordon Company, whereas Buena Vista International, Inc. distributed it. The executive producers were creator and show runner Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, Joan <b>Rater,</b> and James D. Parriott, {{all part of the}} production team since the series' inception. The regular directors were Rob Corn and Jessica Yu. Producer Shonda Rhimes wrote five of the seventeen episodes, two of which were along with fellow producer Krista Vernoff. Unlike the other seasons, except from the first one, which aired mid-season, the fourth season of Grey's Anatomy had a reduced number of episodes, due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which caused the production to cease from February to April, leaving the show with no writing staff during that time. Since the show had only produced ten episodes before the winter-holiday hiatus, and aired another one after the break ended, the show decided to complete the season with six new episodes, and returned on April 24, 2008. Only seventeen episodes were produced out of the twenty-three originally conceived for the season.|$|E

500|$|Fleiss' kappa is a {{generalisation}} of Scott's pi statistic, {{a statistical}} measure of inter-rater reliability. [...] It is {{also related to}} Cohen's kappa statistic and Youden's J statistic which may be more appropriate in certain instances. [...] Whereas Scott's pi and Cohen's kappa work for only two <b>raters,</b> Fleiss' kappa works {{for any number of}} <b>raters</b> giving categorical ratings, to a fixed number of items. It can be interpreted as expressing {{the extent to which the}} observed amount of agreement among <b>raters</b> exceeds what would be expected if all <b>raters</b> made their ratings completely randomly. It is important to note that whereas Cohen's kappa assumes the same two <b>raters</b> have rated a set of items, Fleiss' kappa specifically allows that although there are a fixed number of <b>raters</b> (e.g., three), different items may be rated by different individuals (Fleiss, 1971, p.378). That is, Item 1 is rated by <b>Raters</b> A, B, and C; but Item 2 could be rated by <b>Raters</b> D, E, and F.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of writing assessment, various factors have been {{identified}} to influence the validity of examinees' scores. One {{of the most prominent}} factors believed to threaten scoring validity in an assessment is the <b>raters.</b> <b>Raters</b> {{played an important role in}} any type of assessment particularly ones that involve writing. The <b>raters</b> need to be reliable in their rating ability and awarding marks which will be used to determine the examinees ability. Previous research has shown that the most concerned group of <b>raters</b> would be the novice <b>raters.</b> This study seeks to investigate the inter-rater reliability of novice <b>raters</b> in rating using holistic and analytic scoring rubrics for writing assessment, particularly in rating expository essays for BEL 120 course in UiTM Dungun, Terengganu. The three novice <b>raters</b> chosen for this study were selected based on the same characteristics. The <b>raters</b> were asked to rate 30 expository essays using Test of Written English (TWE) holistic scoring rubric first and after an interval of two days, they were asked to rate the same essays using BEL 120 analytic scoring rubric used by the faculty to mark BEL 120 final exam. The marks of the essays were computed and analyzed using SPSS Version 18. 0 for Windows to generate the results. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient was used to determine interrater reliability since it involved more than two <b>raters.</b> The results showed that the novice <b>raters</b> have low inter-rater reliability level for both scoring rubrics used. The scores discrepancies among the <b>raters</b> also varied greatly thus the <b>raters</b> have low <b>raters</b> agreement when awarding marks using both scoring rubrics. Although the <b>raters</b> were familiar with analytic scoring rubric, the results showed that the inter-rater reliability level for analytic scoring is lower than holistic scoring. The findings provide an insight on the actual level of novice raters' inter-rater reliability and appropriate action is hoped to be taken by Academy of Language Studies in the institution to increase the raters' reliability in rating writing assessment as to increase scoring validity of the examinees...|$|R
5|$|After {{having written}} three episodes {{for the first}} season and five for the second, Rhimes {{returned}} as a writer for six episodes, out of which one was written along with Marti Noxon. Krista Vernoff, Tony Phelan, Stacy McKee and Mark Wilding returned to the series {{as members of the}} writing staff, with Vernoff and Phelan writing three episodes and McKee and Wilding producing the script of two episodes. Gabrielle Stanton and Harry Werksman, Jr. worked together for the writing of one episode, after three episodes they have written for the series in the past. The season includes the first episode to be written by Debora Cahn, who would become one of the series' main writers, as well as a consulting and supervisor producer. Other writers include Kip Koenig, Carolina Paiz, Eric Buchman, Joan <b>Rater</b> and Chris Van Dusen. Rob Corn returned to the series to direct three episodes for the season, after writing two episodes in the second season. Greg Yaitanes is credited for directing two episodes during the season, the only ones to have been directed by him in the series. Other prominent directors were Jeff Melman, Michael Grossman, Julie Anne Robinson and Adam Arkin, each directing two or more episodes during the season. Danny Lux continued his position as the main music composer for the series, while Herbert Davis and Walt Fraser served as the season's cinematography directors. Susan Vaill and Edward Ornelas resumed their positions as editors, seeing David Greenspan, Matthew Ramsey and Avi Fisher being added to the team. Fisher, however, left the series {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E

30|$|The {{study has}} some limitations. Since only {{experienced}} teachers from government institutes {{participated in the}} study these results cannot be generalized to novice <b>raters</b> or <b>raters</b> associated with private institutes. Moreover, the sample size was limited to 15 <b>raters</b> and a set of three essays. Additional research with a larger sample is needed to better understand how <b>raters</b> with varied teaching and scoring experience and from different socio-cultural backgrounds assess English essay writing.|$|R
30|$|A {{considerable}} number of components for the naïve and expert <b>raters</b> had almost perfect agreement (κ or ICC value ≥ 0.9), 9 of 22 (41 %) components for naïve <b>raters</b> and 21 of 22 (95 %) components for expert <b>raters.</b> For the concussion signs, however, {{the majority of the}} rating agreement was moderate (κ value 0.6 – 0.79); both the naïve and expert <b>raters</b> had 4 of 6 (67 %) concussion signs with moderate agreement. The most difficult concussion sign to achieve agreement on was blank or vacant stare, which had weak (κ value 0.4 – 0.59) agreement for both naïve and expert <b>raters.</b>|$|R
25|$|The interrater {{reliability}} of the PCL-R can be high when used carefully in research but tend to be poor in applied settings. In particular Factor 1 items are somewhat subjective. In sexually violent predator cases the PCL-R scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in one study. The scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters. In one study {{it was estimated that}} of the PCL-R variance, about 45% was due to true offender differences, 20% was due to which side the <b>rater</b> testified for, and 30% was due to other <b>rater</b> differences.|$|E
25|$|Mistakes made by raters is a {{major source}} of {{problems}} in performance appraisal. There is no simple way to completely eliminate these errors, but making raters aware of them through training is helpful. <b>Rater</b> errors are based on the feelings and it has consequences at the time of appraisal.|$|E
25|$|Solution: The <b>rater</b> {{must use}} the same {{standards}} and weights for every employee. The manager {{should be able to}} show coherent arguments in order to explain the difference. Therefore, {{it would be easier to}} know if it is done, because the employee has done a good performance, or if it because the manager perception is distorted.|$|E
30|$|There {{appears to}} be value in expert <b>raters,</b> but less value for naive <b>raters,</b> in using the new Observational Review and Analysis of Concussion (ORAC) Form. The ORAC Form has high inter-rater {{agreement}} for most data elements, {{and it can be}} used by expert <b>raters</b> evaluating video footage of possible concussion in the NRL.|$|R
30|$|In {{a similar}} study {{conducted}} with the ‘Heads-Up Checklist’ for National Hockey League (NHL) concussions, the naïve <b>raters</b> also had worse agreement across components pertaining to the antecedent events and mechanism of injury compared to the expert <b>raters.</b> Of the 15 components in version 1 of the Heads-Up Checklist, naïve <b>raters</b> 7 (47 %) had weak or minimal agreement, compared to only 1 of the 15 (7 %) components for the expert <b>raters</b> [20]. For the Heads-Up Checklist, the acceleration of the head (which was not considered a component or review item in our form) was the single component with the worst agreement across naïve and expert <b>raters.</b> Rating secondary contact was also challenging in the hockey study {{as it was in}} the current study. The location of the playing surface where the concussion occurred and the time in the game when the concussion occurred were the two components with the strongest agreement by naïve and expert <b>raters</b> for the hockey study [20]. For the current study, the time in the game was rated well. However, the location on the field did not have a high agreement for the naïve <b>raters.</b> The discrepancy between naïve <b>raters</b> for the hockey study compared to this rugby league study may have occurred for at least three reasons. First, we divided the playing surface in our study into 12 different components and the hockey study used fewer zones. Second, the hockey study designated offensive ends and defensive ends, whereas the rugby league study required the <b>raters</b> to record the direction of the play, and some of the disagreement between the naïve <b>raters</b> for the location on the field was due to the indication of the direction of the play. Finally, the hockey study used naïve <b>raters</b> who where more familiar with their sport (i.e., ‘individuals with limited experience who might have played or coached [ice] hockey at a competitive level’), whereas our naïve <b>raters</b> were complete novices, who had limited to no experience even watching the sport as fans and certainly no experience identifying concussions.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal-directed}} {{perspective of}} performance appraisal suggests that <b>raters</b> with different goals will give different ratings. Considering the performance level {{as an important}} contextual factor, we conducted 2 studies in a peer rating context and in a nonpeer rating context and found that <b>raters</b> do use different rating tactics to achieve specific goals. <b>Raters</b> inflated their peer ratings under the harmony, fairness, and motivating goal conditions (Study 1, N = 103). More important, <b>raters</b> inflated their ratings more for low performers than for high and medium performers. In a nonpeer rating context, <b>raters</b> deflated ratings for high performers to achieve the fairness goal, and they inflated ratings for low performers to motivate them (Study 2, N = 120) ...|$|R
25|$|After {{twelve years}} {{operating}} Santa Claus, Talbot's land resale plans for Santa Claus never materialized, {{in part because}} the only inhabitants in the town were the ones working there. Talbot sold her interest in the town in 1949. Others made plans during the 1950s to improve Santa Claus, which received publicity through the writings of American novelist and famed science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein and U.S. pioneer restaurant <b>rater</b> Duncan Hines and through 1961 remailing service advertisements offering to postmark letters from Santa Claus, for a small fee.|$|E
25|$|We {{have been}} looking one by one at the {{possible}} solutions {{to each of the}} situations, which are also complicated to put into practice, thus here we have a general solution that could be apply to all the possible rating errors. It is difficult to minimized <b>rater</b> errors, since we are humans and we are not objective. Moreover, sometimes, we are not aware of our behavior of having preferences towards people but there are some tools {{in order to have a}} more objective information as using available technology to track performances and record it which enables manager to have some objective information about the process.|$|E
25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{has been that}} clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind {{to the type of}} treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the <b>rater</b> may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.|$|E
25|$|Providing Feedback to <b>Raters</b> - Trained <b>raters</b> provide {{managers}} who evaluated their subordinates with feedback, including information on ratings from other managers. This reduces leniency errors.|$|R
30|$|Then, we mixed human-generated {{questions}} with automatic generated questions and asked human <b>raters</b> to identify whether each {{question from the}} mixed set of questions had been generated by the system or by a human expert. For topic 1, we had three <b>raters,</b> and {{for each of the}} last two topics, we could only get two <b>raters.</b> Note that these human <b>raters</b> were not the same human experts who generated questions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if leniency and halo error in student ratings could be reduced by training the student <b>raters</b> and by using a Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) rather than a Likert scale. Two hypotheses were proposed. First, the ratings collected from the trained <b>raters</b> would contain less halo and leniency error than those collected from the untrained <b>raters.</b> Second, within the group of trained <b>raters</b> the BARS would contain less halo and leniency error than the Likert instrument...|$|R
25|$|Global University Ranking {{measures}} over 400 universities {{using the}} <b>RatER,</b> an autonomous, non-commercial, Russian rating agency supported by Russia's academic society. The methodology pools universities from ARWU, HEEACT, Times-QS and Webometrics and {{a pool of}} experts formed by project officials and managers to determine the rating scales for indicators in seven areas. It considers academic performance, research performance, faculty expertise, resource availability, socially significant activities of graduates, international activities, and international opinion. Each expert independently evaluates these performance indicators for candidate universities. The rating is {{the average of the}} expert evaluations. This ranking raised questions when it placed Russian Moscow State University in fifth place, ahead of Harvard and Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|To assess job performance, {{reliable}} and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through <b>rater</b> training and {{through the use of}} behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance. Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Johnny Baker {{returned as}} part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and <b>Rater</b> Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Although Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936–1937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and the Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on September 5, 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{have learned}} that for all <b>raters</b> it was not easy to {{identify}} system-generated questions from the set of mixed questions. This indicates that system-generated questions are sound as human-generated questions. The agreement between <b>raters</b> was slight or fair. This strengthens the indication that it was difficult for human <b>raters</b> to distinguish between system-generated and human-generated questions.|$|R
30|$|However, the <b>raters</b> in Freedman’s (1979) {{study said}} that {{organization}} {{was the second}} most difficult construct to assess with the content construct being the most difficult. Although <b>raters</b> find organization to be important, assessing and measuring organization is a challenge. Often, <b>raters</b> complain “that {{the exact nature of}} the construct they assess remains uncertain” (Cummings et al. 2001 : 3). In the studies by Harris (1977) and Freedman (1979), organization was not clearly defined, which makes it difficult to identify which aspects of organization <b>raters</b> find challenging to assess.|$|R
30|$|Five {{accredited}} <b>raters</b> of the GTEC for STUDENTS {{scored the}} responses. The <b>raters</b> were native speakers of English {{who worked as}} English instructors in an English school in Tokyo. Two <b>raters</b> awarded ratings on an analytic scale of 1 to 4 {{for each of the}} four rating elements: grammar, vocabulary, fluency, and pronunciation. Participants may have received ratings from a different pair of raters; this is quite a common practice for large-scale performance tests (Lee 2006). Indeed, it is usually impractical to ask the same pair of <b>raters</b> to award all ratings on a task.|$|R
500|$|The {{season was}} {{produced}} by Touchstone Television, currently ABC Studios, in association with ShondaLand Production Company and The Mark Gordon Company. Shonda Rhimes returned as the series' showrunner and executive producer. She also continued her position from the first two seasons {{as one of the}} most prominent members of the writing staff. Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Mark Wilding, and Rob Corn returned as executive producers, along with James D. Parriott, Peter Horton, and Krista Vernoff, who have been in this position since the inception of the series. Parriott, who also served as an episodic writer, left the series at the conclusion of the season. Joan <b>Rater</b> and Tony Phelan continued to serve as co-executive producers, with <b>Rater</b> being a supervising producer as well. Stacy McKee, who would be promoted to co-executive producer for the third season, returned to the series as a producer and a member of the writing staff. Having written three episodes for the first season, Rhimes returned as a writer for five episodes.

500|$|<b>Rater</b> {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's got to {{deal with the fact that}} she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, <b>Rater</b> explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, <b>Rater</b> wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings.

30|$|In {{the current}} study, {{there were a}} number of {{variables}} that appear to rely on knowledge, understanding, and experience with rugby league match play (i.e., the expert <b>raters</b> outperformed the naïve <b>raters).</b> For example, there were large differences between the coding by expert and naïve <b>raters</b> of variables such as secondary contact and anticipation of impact. There was also a large difference between the coding by expert and naïve <b>raters</b> on whether the player returned to play. This variable required the <b>raters</b> to watch the remainder of a game (following the injury) to determine if the injured athlete subsequently returned to the field of play. Interchanges can occur during play or during a stoppage in play, and they are not always announced on the broadcaster footage. It appears that the naïve <b>raters</b> were not as savvy in identifying the return to play of an interchanged athlete and/or did not identify the athlete as being re-involved in match play following their return to the field of play.|$|R
