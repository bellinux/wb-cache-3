The paper analyses whether the patterns of loan loss provisions are, in part, attributable to the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> for credit risk. It compares the national German rules with the related IFRS rules and identifies inconsistencies across different types of transactions in both regimes. The analysis of the accounting rules is combined with an analysis of incentives for under-provisioning and/or over-provisioning, emanating from the capital markets and from banking supervisory authorities. The conclusion is that, in particular, the IFRS accounting rules should be changed to require a more comprehensive accounting for expected losses that can be measured reliably, using information readily available in the markets. accounting; banks; credit risk; earnings management; fair value accounting; hedge accounting; IFRS; loan loss provisioning; Germany. ...|$|E

Information given to the principal might be sorted out {{in order to secure}} agents’ interests. This behavior is called oportunisitic behavior that encourages the practice of earnings management. To predict and explain opportunistic behavior, Watts and Zimmerman formulate three hypotheses: (1) bonus plan hypotheses, (2) debt covenant hypotheses, and (3) the political cost hypotheses. Research results based on these hypotheses prove that the practice of earnings management {{is more likely to be}} done without regard to principles of ethical values. By using cognitive and humanistic psychology, such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)) the motive for opportunistic behavior could be explained and ethical behaviour that are influenced by social norms such as religions could be reconstructed. If individual feels that opportunistic behavior is contrary to religious norms and rules (GAAP /PSAK) then he will refuse to behave opportunistically. The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> policies that provide the opportunity for agents to select based on merit, enable rationalization of the opportunistic behavior as a self reaction mechanism that could justify the behavior as efforts to protect from external threats...|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} one way to {{encourage}} much-needed attention by sociologists to accounting is by the application of ‘finitist ’ sociology of knowledge of the kind developed by Barry Barnes and David Bloor. The aspect of accounting focused on is corporate financial reporting, especially the construction of ‘profits ’ (that is, corporate earnings) [...] a topic largely neglected in empirical work by sociologically-oriented accounting scholars. After explaining ‘finitism’, the article explores its application to financial reporting, highlighting the crucial role and contingent nature of accounting classifications and discussing their relation to ‘economic reality’. A central prediction of a finitist perspective is that the imposition of <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> cannot eliminate potential discretion from the construction of financial reports. The article draws upon the quantitative literature on earnings management [...] almost entirely neglected by economic sociologists [...] to investigate the extent of such discretion in the world’s most rule-bound accounting jurisdiction, the US.
