Phipps) in nearby Pitfield Street, this became a cinema in 1910, closing in 1941. Since 2003 the site has remained empty, but in 2008 it was gutted and prepared for a <b>refurb.</b> Local opposition to the design has resulted in the project being put on hold, so it now remains empty and [...] "For Sale".|$|E

5000|$|On 18 March 2013, Karl Munro (John Michie) {{set fire}} to the pub's cellar in order to frame Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) but was caught by Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) who was knocked {{unconscious}} by Karl when he fled to the Bistro to do his [...] "Full Monty" [...] act. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) came into the restaurant to tell everyone about the fire, and Karl discovered Stella was upstairs in one of the pub's bedrooms so he went back in to save her. As he got to her, the stairs collapsed, trapping them. Luckily Paul Kershaw (Tony Hirst) managed to get to them and got Stella out while his friend and fellow-firefighter Toni Griffiths (Tara Moran) got Karl out before the roof collapsed on top of her and killed her. Shortly afterwards the fire brigade arrived, put out the fire and were able to get Sunita out. The fire caused significant damage and caused financial problems for Stella meaning that she could not afford to hire Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) to do the <b>refurb</b> but after a failed attempt of offering Owen half the pub in exchange for the <b>refurb,</b> Stella's mother Gloria (Sue Johnston) paid him the £80,000 required to complete the work. Sunita was in a coma for a while and was killed by Karl when she began to recover. The Rovers re-opened on 26 May 2013.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{met with}} {{slightly}} less fanfare than {{their first two}} records, the album was still received warmly by critics, many of whom praised the refinement of the bands songcraft. Again, Tim Sendra of the AllMusic Guide praised the bands evolution. He noted the [...] "shocking amount of <b>refurb</b> the group did... most everywhere you look there's something happening sonically that's not happened on a Crystal Stilts record before," [...] after earlier declaring that, [...] "Crystal Stilts have staked out a place as perhaps the foremost purveyors of dark psychedelic pop their generation has to offer." [...] Impact called it, [...] "their most complete effort yet; a stunning combination of 60s psychedelia, 80s post-punk and timeless noise-pop," [...] while Doug Mosurock, after pronouncing them [...] "the coolest '60s throwback NYC's known in some time," [...] summed up Nature Noir as [...] "Truly beautiful stuff from a group that only improves with each move." [...] Even Dean Wareham of Luna and Galaxie 500 fame said after hearing Nature Noir, [...] "I’ve loved Crystal Stilts from their first EP and they only get better... at this point they sound only like Crystal Stilts — and are themselves objects of imitation by bands from across the pond." ...|$|E

Miming mime itself. Gliding upwards. An angel. Flames trembling with multiple scintillations and pearls glowing like white flowers, emitting long white spirals. As a movement across the material and the divine. Half-burned carcasses, rose-tinted by the sea, ascending by insensible degrees {{to the edge of}} the sky. Luxury and fire. Crystal.
