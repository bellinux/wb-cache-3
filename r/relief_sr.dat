40|$|The {{photoinduced}} reorientation {{and surface}} <b>relief</b> (<b>SR)</b> formation behaviors {{of a novel}} photosensitive polymer, which was transparent in visible region, were investigated using linearly polarized- 313 -nm light and holographic exposure with a 325 -nm He-Cd laser. The polymer was comprised of photosensitive 4 -methoxy-N-benzylideneaniline side groups, and exhibited a sufficient photoinduced molecular reorientation with a birefringence of 0. 11. Holographic exposure generated a SR structure, which had a periodical molecular reorientation that depended on the polarization of the interference beams. The generated SR height was ∼ 212 nm, and the inscription of a double holographic exposure yielded a two-dimensional SR structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{analogue}} modulation characteristics, including second order harmonic {{and third}} order intermodulation distortion, relative intensity noise (RIN) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR), of single mode, GaAs-based 1. 28 μm vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSELs) with highly strained InGaAs quantum wells have been investigated. The VCSELs utilise an oxide aperture for current and optical confinement and an inverted surface <b>relief</b> (<b>SR)</b> for suppression of higher order transverse modes. The inverted SR structure {{also has the}} advantage of suppressing oxide modes that, otherwise, appear in VCSELs with a large detuning of the cavity resonance with respect to the gain peak, which is needed to extend the emission wavelength. RIN levels comparable with those of single mode VCSELs emitting at 850 nm are demonstrated, with values from 140 to 150 dB/Hz in the 2 5 GHz range. SFDR values of 100 and 95 dBHz 2 / 3 are obtained at 2 and 5 GHz, respectively. These values are in the range of those required in radio-over-fibre links...|$|E
40|$|The osmotic-controlled release oral {{delivery}} system (OROS (R)) is an innovative drug delivery technology that uses osmotic pressure as {{the driving force}} to deliver pharmacotherapies in many therapeutic areas. In chronic pain management requiring long-term therapy, pharmaceutical technologies that ensure the controlled release of analgesic medications are imperative. In addition, once-daily formulations ensure better patient compliance to prescribed therapies. Hydromorphone was the first opioid to be formulated as a once-daily preparation using OROS (R) technology. The purpose of this review is to discuss the application of OROS (R) technology {{in the field of}} chronic pain management and to examine clinical trial results for OROS (R) Hydromorphone. OROS (R) hydromorphone ensures the constant delivery of hydromorphone over a 24 -hour period, and its pharmacokinetic profile is only minimally affected by food and alcohol. Dose-conversion studies have shown that patients with chronic pain can be easily switched from previous opioid therapies to OROS (R) hydromorphone without a loss of pain control. These studies support the clinical utility of the 5 : 1 ratio used for the conversion of oral morphine to oral OROS (R) hydromorphone. Furthermore, once-daily OROS (R) hydromorphone {{has been shown to be}} effective in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain, and it provides similar pain <b>relief</b> to <b>SR</b> morphine and ER oxycodone. In chronic pain management, OROS (R) products can result in more stable drug concentrations, reduced dosing frequency and an improved safety profile. (Minerva Anestesiol 2010; 76 : 1072 - 84...|$|R
