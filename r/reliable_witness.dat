500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} Newsweek, David Ansen praised Rossum's performance, but criticized the filmmakers for {{their focus on}} visual design rather than {{presenting}} a cohesive storyline.

500|$|After {{nearly six}} months of investigations, the Judicial Commission {{reported}} its findings on June 12, 2012. It found that the memorandum was authentic and that Haqqani was its [...] "originator and architect". The report said the former ambassador [...] "orchestrated {{the possibility of an}} imminent coup to both persuade Mr. Ijaz to convey the message and also to give it (Memorandum) traction and credibility". [...] The justices found further that one of Haqqani's purposes was to head a new national security team in Pakistan. In an unexpected turn of the investigation, a secret fund was discovered in Pakistan's Washington embassy that Haqqani allegedly had access to and had allegedly utilized, in [...] "apparent violation of Article 84 of the Constitution of Pakistan". The Commission's report exonerated President Zardari from any prior knowledge of the memorandum, although it noted that in the [...] "considered view" [...] of the justices, Haqqani had led Ijaz to believe the memorandum had the Pakistani president's approval. Following testimony by Ijaz, the Commission deemed him a <b>reliable</b> <b>witness</b> whose credibility Haqqani had unsuccessfully sought to undermine.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Stegall {{proposed}} that the episode works on two separate layers. On the top-most superficial layer, it functions as an outright parody, mimicking both the stylings of The X-Files as well as Cops. However, on the other layer, she notes that [...] "it's a serious look at validation." [...] Throughout the episode, Mulder is attempting to capture the monster on camera and expose it to a national audience. However, all of the witnesses to the monster function as unreliable narrators: a Hispanic woman with [...] "a history of medications", a homosexual [...] "Drama Queen", a prostitute, a [...] "terrified morgue attendant, and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall argues {{that all of these}} characters are from [...] "the wrong side of the tracks" [...] and would not be accepted, let alone believed, by [...] "a placid, middle-class society". In the end, the only <b>reliable</b> <b>witness</b> is the camera, but Stegall points out that [...] "the camera, suspiciously, never quite manages to find [...]" [...] Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's biggest fear is not finding the monster. To back this idea up, she points out that Mulder not only fails to find what he is looking for, but he also fails before a live audience.|$|E

2500|$|Arguing from (for him) the <b>reliable</b> <b>witness</b> of Scripture, dogmatically defended, {{the decisive}} {{question}} for Künneth becomes {{whether or not}} the Resurrection appearances of the Risen One were basically of the same nature as the prophetic visions of the Spirit in the Old Testament, which he defined as [...] "an emerging reality which lays hold of man, and is accompanied at the same time by adutions which communicate new knowledge." [...] (p.82) This was Rudolph Otto's view, he notes, in Aufsatze, das Numinose betreffend. In the place of Yahweh, walking and eating, appears the risen Lord, bearing in his veiled garb, [...] "the marks of the Pilgrim God" [...] (citing E. Fascher, Deus Invisibilis, 1931). Künneth argues for a formal similarity between Old Testament theophany and New Testament opthe. However, noting that the early Church did not place the visions of martyrs {{on a par with the}} appearances to the disciples, and insisting that the Resurrection is sui generis among the miracles of God, he cites his old teacher Schlatter: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{report on}} 2 March 1960 described how a tsunami {{was reported to}} have come ashore shortly after the earthquake, stating [...] "A tidal wave curled in across the white beaches and lanced [...] into the town. The city dock was cut in two, a Spanish shipmaster radioed." [...] A tsunami disaster was later refuted by a report from the American Iron and Steel Institute after a team of earthquake engineers, including Ray W. Clough from the University of California, Berkeley, surveyed the damage and building failures throughout the Agadir area in March 1960. The report of their findings stated that the port facilities suffered damage due to fairly uniform subsidence in the harbor area that was responsible for knocking over five large cranes, but no evidence of nor any <b>reliable</b> <b>witness</b> to large waves was found, {{with the exception of a}} Dutch freighter crew who stated that large swells in the harbor did cause the separation of their mooring lines at the time of the earthquake. A report in a 1964 issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America also denied the existence of a destructive tsunami because of a lack of evidence from a nearby tide gauge.|$|E

Electronic editions of unique manuscript materials represent {{an important part}} of our cultural heritage, providing access to materials otherwise inaccessible to most users, serving as incubators for cutting-edge scholarship, and providing a platform for technological innovation. However, e-text projects frequently employ infrastructures from a variety of resources, and such innovative, distributed designs can result in projects that are not easily integrated into library collections, which consist primarily of traditional print and subscription digital resources. The <b>Reliable</b> <b>Witnesses</b> project will result in local best practices for meeting these challenges as well as a generalized life-cycle model that other institutions can adapt to their needs...|$|R

60|$|What {{a fellow}} Wilson is! If I could only throw the same enthusiasm into {{physiology}} {{that he does}} into psychology, I should become a Claude Bernard at the least. His whole life and soul and energy work to one end. He drops to sleep collating his results of the past day, and he wakes to plan his researches for the coming one. And yet, outside the narrow circle who follow his proceedings, he gets so little credit for it. Physiology is a recognized science. If I add even a brick to the edifice, every one sees and applauds it. But Wilson is trying to dig the foundations for a science of the future. His work is underground and does not show. Yet he goes on uncomplainingly, corresponding with a hundred semi-maniacs {{in the hope of}} finding one <b>reliable</b> <b>witness,</b> sifting a hundred lies on the chance of gaining one little speck of truth, collating old books, devouring new ones, experimenting, lecturing, trying to light up in others the fiery interest which is consuming him. I am filled with wonder and admiration when I think of him, and yet, when he asks me to associate myself with his researches, I am compelled to tell him that, in their present state, they offer little attraction to a man who is devoted to exact science. If he could show me something positive and objective, I might then be tempted to approach the question from its physiological side. So long as half his subjects are tainted with charlatanerie and the other half with hysteria we physiologists must content ourselves with the body and leave the mind to our descendants.|$|E
