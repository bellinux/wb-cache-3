5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often {{the center of attention}} among his peers.|$|E
25|$|Labor {{organizer}} Anthony Ramuglia, an anarchist in the 1920s, said in 1952 that a Boston anarchist {{group had}} asked him to be a false alibi witness for Sacco. After agreeing, he had <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been in jail on the day in question, so he could not testify.|$|E
25|$|Brajanath at once caused coins to {{be struck}} in his own name, but it was now <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ineligible for the throne, as he had {{suffered}} mutilation {{of one of his}} ears. (The Ahom considered their king from divine origin and the person of the monarch, was sacred, and any noticeable sear or blemish, even a scratch received in play, a pit of small pox, or a wound received in action, operated as a bar to succession). Therefore, Brajanath's son Purandar, then only ten years old, was brought from Silmari, who arrived in time and was acclaimed as sovereign of the Ahom kingdom of Assam, in February 1818 CE. A few days later Biswanath Marangikhowa Gohain, brother of Ruchinath Burhagohain effected the slicing off of Chandrakanta's right ear in order to disqualify him from again sitting on the throne.|$|E

25|$|Other works {{followed}} at intervals of longer or shorter duration – Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States (1840); Way of Life (1841, republished in England, translated into other languages, and circulated {{to the extent}} of 35,000 copies in America); Commentary on Ephesians (1856); on First Corinthians (1857); on Second Corinthians (1859). His magnum opus is the Systematic Theology (1871–1873), of 3 volumes and extending to 2,260 pages. His last book, What is Darwinism? appeared in 1874. In addition to all this it must be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> contributed upward of 130 articles to the Princeton Review, many of which, besides exerting a powerful influence {{at the time of their}} publication, have since been gathered into volumes, and as Selection of Essays and Reviews from the Princeton Review (1857) and Discussions in Church Polity (ed. W. Durant, 1878) have taken a permanent place in theological literature.|$|E
25|$|Owen's {{detailed}} memoirs {{and descriptions}} require laborious attention in reading, {{on account of}} their complex terminology and ambiguous modes of expression. The fact that very little of his terminology has found universal favour causes {{them to be more}} generally neglected than they otherwise would be. At the same time, it must be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a pioneer in concise anatomical nomenclature and, so far at least as the vertebrate skeleton is concerned, his terms were based on a carefully reasoned philosophical scheme, which first clearly distinguished between the now-familiar phenomena of analogy and homology. Owen's theory of the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton (1848), subsequently illustrated also by his little work On the Nature of Limbs (1849), regarded the vertebrate frame as consisting of a series of fundamentally identical segments, each modified according to its position and functions. Much of it was fanciful and failed when tested by the facts of embryology, which Owen systematically ignored, throughout his work. However, though an imperfect and distorted view of certain great truths, it possessed a distinct value {{at the time of its}} conception.|$|E

Blackmore's guitar work is {{generally}} praised by critics. However, in a recent interview, the guitarist defined the album as [...] "lame" [...] and <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not yet found his own style of guitar playing {{at the time of}} recording.|$|E
500|$|The intense {{collaboration}} between Dylan and The Hawks {{that produced the}} basement recordings {{came to an end}} in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album, John Wesley Harding, with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he {{received a phone call from}} Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group. In his autobiography, Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings The Hawks had made with Dylan, and <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "could tell that hanging out with the boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in: blues, rockabilly, R They had rubbed off on him a little." ...|$|E

500|$|Bach {{conducted}} the first performance of [...] on 20 May 1714. His son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> often conducted and played first violin: [...] "he played the violin cleanly and penetratingly, and thus kept the orchestra in better order {{than he could}} have done with the harpsichord". The parts for the first performance are lost, but the score and performing material for later performances have survived. Bach performed the cantata again, possibly in Köthen between 1717 and 1722, and several times as [...] in Leipzig. For the performance on 28 May 1724, he changed the instrumentation slightly and transposed the work from C major to D major. He reverted to C major for a performance on 13 May 1731. An organ part for a later performance of movement 5 is extant.|$|E
500|$|... "Hold Tight" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, with additional writing by Diplo, Toby Gad, MoZella, Ariel Rechtshaid and MNEK; the latter also provided background vocals. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon and Nick Rowe were the song's engineers, while Castellon and Mike Dean did the song's mixing. Additional recording {{was done by}} Angie Teo, while additional Pro Tools editing was made by Ron Taylor. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] was recorded in three different places: The Ritz (Moscow), Grand Marina Hotel (Barcelona) and Patriot Studios (Denver, Colorado/Venice, California). MNEK, who co-wrote and provided background vocals on the track, <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was working with English duo Gorgon City in 2014, when they recommended him to Diplo, for working on Rebel Heart. Together they started out with an idea for [...] "Hold Tight", and Madonna loved it. After finishing writing the lyrics, she invited MNEK to the recording studio to finish its production.

500|$|Frank Mula {{wrote the}} episode, and Wes Archer served as director. Michael Carrington guest-starred as Rex. Al Jean, show runner of the episode, {{came up with}} the idea for the story when he <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{received}} a valentine from a girl in third grade that read [...] "I Choo-Choo-Choose You". The episode features cultural references to songs such as [...] "Monster Mash" [...] and [...] "Break On Through", as well as a reference to the fictional character Droopy. Since airing, [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] has received mostly positive reviews from television critics; Entertainment Weekly placed the episode twelfth on their top 25 The Simpsons episodes list. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.9 and was the highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. The staff received an angry letter from a Vietnam veteran because of a flashback scene depicting the fatal shooting of a Vietnam soldier.|$|E

500|$|In {{seeking to}} {{establish}} through song Liliom's {{motivation for the}} robbery, Rodgers <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Hart had a similar problem in Pal Joey. [...] Rodgers and Hart had [...] overcome the problem [...] with a song that Joey sings to himself, [...] "I'm Talking to My Pal". [...] This inspired [...] "Soliloquy". [...] Both partners later told a story that [...] "Soliloquy" [...] was only {{intended to be a}} song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl. [...] However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: [...] "Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number {{for the end of the}} scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely." ...|$|E
500|$|Julia {{started seeing}} Dykins {{a year after}} Victoria's birth (although they {{had known each other}} before) when she was working in the café near Lennon's primary school; Mosspits. Dykins was a good-looking, well-dressed man who worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward. She later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins. He enjoyed luxuries, and had access to rationed goods like alcohol, chocolate, silk {{stockings}} and cigarettes, which was what initially attracted her. The Stanley sisters called him [...] "Spiv", because of his pencil-thin moustache, margarine-coated hair, and pork-pie hat, and the young Lennon called him [...] "Twitchy" [...] because of a physical tic/nervous cough. Julia's family and friends <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also had a fiery temperament, which could result in his being violent when drunk. Lennon remembered seeing his mother during a visit to Mimi's, when her face was bleeding after being hit by Dykins.|$|E
500|$|Tucson, Arizona based Big Splash Games {{was formed}} in late 2005 by three {{veterans}} of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this {{for a few months}} when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co-founder Stephen Lewis <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been told that some people, in particular women, [...] "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they [...] "had {{hit the nail on the}} head".|$|E
