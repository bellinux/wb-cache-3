40|$|The project which {{extended}} from November 2005 to May of 2010 demonstrated {{the application of}} Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) with engine out NOx levels of 0. 2 g/bhp-hr throughout the program target load of 12. 6 bar BMEP. The project showed that the range of loads could be extended to 16. 5 bar BMEP, therefore matching the <b>reference</b> <b>lug</b> line of the base 2007 MY Navistar 6. 4 L V 8 engine. Results showed that the application of LTC provided a dramatic improvement over engine out emissions {{when compared to the}} base engine. Furthermore LTC improved thermal efficiency by over 5 % from the base production engine when using the steady state 13 mode composite test as a benchmark. The key enablers included improvements in the air, fuel injection, and cooling systems made in Phases I and II. The outcome was the product of a careful integration of each component under an intelligent control system. The engine hardware provided the conditions to support LTC and the controller provided the necessary robustness for a stable combustion. Phase III provided a detailed account on the injection strategy used to meet the high load requirements. During this phase, the control strategy was implemented in a production automotive grade ECU to perform cycle-by-cycle combustion feedback on each of the engine cylinders. The control interacted on a cycle base with the injection system and with the Turbo-EGR systems according to their respective time constants. The result was a unique system that could, first, help optimize the combustion system and maintain high efficiency, and secondly, extend the steady state results to the transient mode of operation. The engine was upgraded in Phase IV with a Variable Valve Actuation system and a hybrid EGR loop. The impact of the more versatile EGR loop did not provide significant advantages, however the application of VVA proved to be an enabler to further extend the operation of LTC and gain considerable benefits in fuel economy and soot reduction. Finally, the transient demonstration was performed in Phase IV. The project demonstrated the achievement of meeting US 10 emissions without NOx aftertreatment. The successful execution of the project has served to highlight the effectiveness of closely matched combustion predictive tools to engine testing. It has further served to highlight the importance of key technologies and future areas of research and development. In this regard, recommendations are made towards further improvements in the areas of engine hardware, fuel injection systems, controls and fuels...|$|E
50|$|Arthur C. L. Brown and R. S. Loomis, {{proponents of}} the Irish origin of the Grail romances, argued that Celtchar's Lúin was to be {{identified}} with the spear of Lug, a weapon which is named in Middle Irish narratives as one of the four items which the Túatha Dé Danann introduced to Ireland. A connection may have been drawn implicitly by Togail Bruidne Dá Derga, which claims that the Lúin was found in the Battle of Mag Tuired, elsewhere known as the battle in which the Túatha Dé Danann led by Lug defeated the Fomoiri. Moreover, a tale of later date, the Early Modern Irish Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann describes the spear of Lug in ways which are reminiscent of Celtchair's Lúin. However, the Middle Irish <b>references</b> to <b>Lug's</b> spear do not correspond closely to the Lúin.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} and compare the antibacterial susceptibility of bacteria to different brands of Ciprofloxacin tablets. The following three bacterial strains were used: Staphylococcus aureus [ATCC 25923], Escherichia coli [ATCC 25922] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ATCC 27853]. Standard commercial discs of definite potency are used as <b>reference</b> standard (Ciprofloxacin <b>lug).</b> The test products 500 mg tablets of the following brands: Ciprobay, Bactiflox, Ciprodenk, Ladinin, Cipron, Zindolin, Bactiflox, ladinin and Ciproflox. There was {{a slight increase in}} the ZI of different brand at different time interval. This means that the solubility of the drugs invitro is increasing with time which in turns increases the zone of inhibition. Ciprobay produced more consistent ZI as compared to other brands, while no significant (p< 0. 05) differences were observed among other brands in respect of ZI. All tested brands of Ciprofloxacin yielded ZI within the acceptable ranges (as per USP). However, there were significant differences among them...|$|R
