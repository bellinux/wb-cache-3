40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to {{investigate}} the challenges faced by Khutala Colliery pertaining to underground road construction and maintenance. Furthermore the influence of these challenges on productivity and safety requirements were taken into consideration. The operating standards required for the construction and maintenance of the 2 seam road transport infrastructure was investigated, together with reasons why the standards of operating procedure are not met. The Code of Practice put in place by Khutala Colliery was used to view the standard operating procedures. Leading practices on underground road construction were researched. The project aims to discover the gaps that Khutala Colliery must bridge to implement enhanced practices with regards to underground road construction. During the period of study, observations were carried out to determine whether the <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> <b>standards</b> of operating procedure were being adhered to at all times for both road construction and road maintenance. Khutala Colliery has put in place a traffic management plan, which includes safety practices and work policies that must be adhered to while travelling on underground transport roads.

40|$|The {{compound}} of layers is the lasting combination {{between the individual}} layers, respectively courses of a <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> Through the {{compound of}} layers the layer-package is considered as a whole for the load transfer. This is an important assumption for a long service life of the <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> The existing <b>standards</b> contain recommendations and rules for achieving a sound compound of layers, however they give no indication for examining and evaluating of the obtained construction. For defined test conditions, for an existing evaluation background {{and based on the}} knowledge of the accuracy of the test procedure, the method can contribute to the quality assurance in <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> Based on the definition of a minimum level for the compound of layers with regard to cores, interpretation ranges for the evaluation background could be assessed. The establishment of the evaluation background was elaborated for the following layer combinations: 'wearing course/base course', 'base course/road base' and 'wearing course/road base'. Based on the eight most common layer combinations the accuracy of the test procedure was established in order to allow quantitative comparisons. From the results of supplementary studies it follows, that the test procedure can be used within the scope of control examinations. On the basis of two cores the compound of layers within a roadway section can be estimated, and it could be recognized that the bond within the layer itself is not always better than the compound of layers. Through the established interpretation ranges of the evaluation background the user is able to assign more precise the shear test results. The evaluation background can serve as basis for the arrangement of the demands on the compound of layers in the standards. Knowing the accuracy of the test procedure, the comparison of shear test results becomes possible and the respective statements become more precise. (orig.)

40|$|M, Development and Management, Public Management and Administration, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 The {{study is}} contextualized within the {{framework}} of project management, and the significant role it plays in road projects, specifically on <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance in Emfuleni Local Municipality (ELM), South Africa. South Africa is rapidly changing, and with change comes development and improvement with regard to the economy and infrastructure. With special reference to <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance, The South African road network saw a vast improvement, from national highway lanes and roads being added and constructed, to local municipality road networks such as those of ELM being constructed and maintained because two international soccer teams, Switzerland and Ivory Coast were based in ELM {{for the duration of the}} FIFA World Cup 2010. One of the characteristics of project management is that, projects have a beginning and an end period, so <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance projects are considered as projects that need to be managed from their starting points all the way to their completion points. The hypothesis for this study indicated that maintaining a high standard road network in the face of increasing traffic demands will need an improvement in project management systems to model and design the roads in ELM. To achieve this, the ELM will need to outsource its <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance projects to highly recommended engineering companies that have experience in quality <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance projects. Those community members that reside in the community where a <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> or maintenance project is taking place should also be hired by ELM or the outsourced companies if the community members are qualified to do such work, this will lower the local unemployment rate of that community and in turn be able to help hired community members to support their families. Local community members play a significant role in preventing <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> equipment from being stolen after working hours, as this slows down the <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance projects as a result of lack of proper equipment. The main aim of the study was to investigate the impact of project management on <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance at ELM. The objective of this study analyse the role of project management on <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance in ELM; and to evaluate the tools employed to monitor <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance projects in ELM. The objectives were realized by the use of literature review and empirical surveys in ELM.

We know well that the benefit of <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> can be equal to its direct effect if there is not any　distortion in the economy. Here the direct effect of <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> is defined by the sum of all user　benefits that are their travel cost savings realized by <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> However, if there is any distortion in a market, the benefit of <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> cannot be equal to its direct effect. What is a proper measure in this case? The answers for this question are as follows : In this case, we have to use the other measure for its benefit. If a firm does not behave in accordance with marginal cost pricing rule（MCPR）, in exchange for its direct benefit, we have to use the change of producer’s surplus which the firm as a user of road enjoys from a <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> And also, there are many cases in the real world that a government will not make a price under MCPR. In these cases, we have to use the change of government’s surplus as the benefit received by a government from a <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> We might list up some examples that a government will not accord with MCPR as showed by zero or constant pricing on road and some non-optimal marginal taxes such as gasoline tax except for lump sum tax.

40|$|Abandonment {{of forest}} {{plantations}} after clear-cutting {{has increased in}} the southern part of Kyushu, SW Japan. This abandonment of forests after clear-cutting hinders sustainable forest management and recovery of forest resources, and poses a periodic threat to soil and water resources. We investigated the current status of slope failures in and around a large-scale abandoned forest (95. 6 ha) after clear-cutting, located near Kumamura Village, southern Kumamoto Prefecture. Dominant geology in the investigated area is alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone, dipping to the northwest, within the Shimanto Belt (an accretionary prism). Geologic characteristics affect the distribution of slope failures in this region. We divided the slope failures into three types: shallow road-cut failures on NW-N facing dip slopes along harvesting roads, slumps in road prism and fill, and deep-seated landslides on SE-S facing opposite dip slopes along the Butsuzo tectonic line (the boundary between the Chichibu and Shimanto terrains). Although slope failures along harvesting roads are affected by geologic characteristics, they are primarily related to inadequate <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> In contrast, deep-seated landslides along the Butsuzo tectonic line are predominantly influenced by geologic structure in this region, independent of logging and <b>road</b> <b>construction.</b> This study provides a rough guide for planning the design and <b>construction</b> <b>standards</b> of forestry related roads and associated drainage systems to minimize landslide hazards...|$|R
