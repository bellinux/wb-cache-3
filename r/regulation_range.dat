50|$|Variable Shunt Reactors {{are used}} in high voltage energy {{transmission}} systems to stabilize the voltage during load variations. A traditional shunt reactor has a fixed rating and is either connected to the power line all the time or switched in and out depending on the load. Recently Variable Shunt Reactors (VSR) have been developed and introduced on the market. The rating of a VSR can be changed in steps, The maximum <b>regulation</b> <b>range</b> typically is a factor of two, e.g. from 100-200 Mvar. The regulation speed is normally in the order seconds per step and around a minute from max to min rating. VSRs are today available for voltages up to 550 kV. The largest three-phase VSRs in operation have a rating of 120-200 Mvar at 420 kV and single-phase variable shunt reactors banks rated 200-285 Mvar at 420 kV have been installed in Italy.|$|E

40|$|DC {{bus voltage}} {{regulation}} {{may be required}} in future high powered spacecraft due {{to the length of}} the busses or because they are not generated at precise voltage levels. In these cases the <b>regulation</b> <b>range</b> is often only a few percent increase or decrease, but conventional DC voltage regulators switch all the power passing through them, and this level of power switched determines the size and losses in the regulator. A recently developed concept used a low power DC-DC converter in series with the bs to raise or lower the bus voltage over a small range. This partial power processing technique combines the small size and power losses of the low power converter with the ability to regulate, (over a small range) a high power bus. The Series Connected Buck Boost Regulator (SCBBR) described herein provides bus regulation with an efficiency of 98 %.

40|$|The {{digital control}} {{circuits}} are often {{employed in the}} dc-dc converter in order to realize the high reliability of the electronic power supply, since they are less affected by the influence of environmental disturbances such as electric noise, temperature, aging, etc. as compared with analog ones. In the digitally controlled dc-dcconverter, the regulation of the output voltage is divided broadly into three modes, i. e., the integral control mode, the proportional control one and the open loop {{one in which the}} regulation cannot be performed. Especially, in the integral control mode, the regulation characteristics is so ideal that there exists no steady-state output voltage error for changes of the input voltage and the load. For this reason, the digitally controlled dc-dc converter is usually used in the integral control mode. This paper deals with the steady-state analysis of the digitally controlled dc-dc converter in the integral control mode. As a result, it is revealed that the circumscription of the <b>regulation</b> <b>range</b> is due to not only the overflow or underflow phenomenon in the integral mode control circuit but also the maximum or minimum on-time of the trasistor switch. Also, the resolution of the output voltage is analyzed, and the relations among output voltage resolution, number of pulse from the voltage-controlled oscipator (VCO) and <b>regulation</b> <b>range</b> are clarified.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the reverse}} link of a {{wireless}} cellular network, power control {{is used to}} ensure that each link achieves its target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), while minimizing the interference to adjacent cells. In cellular systems using direct-sequence code-division multiple access (CDMA), the SINR depends inversely on the power assigned to the other users in the system, creating a nonlinear control problem. Mobility of the terminals, along with associated random shadowing and multi-path fading, results in uncertainty in the channel state.
