2500|$|Medawar's concept {{suggested}} that the evolution process was affected by {{the age at which}} an organism was capable of <b>reproducing.</b> <b>Characteristics</b> that adversely affected an organism prior to that age would severely limit the organism's ability to propagate its characteristics and thus would be highly [...] "selected against" [...] by natural selection. Characteristics that caused the same adverse effects that only appeared well after that age would have relatively little effect on the organism's ability to propagate and therefore might be allowed by natural selection. This concept fits well with the observed multiplicity of mammal life spans (and differing ages of sexual maturity) and is important to all of the subsequent theories of ageing discussed below.|$|E

Head-to-medium spacing of about 300 A is maintained up to 11 m/s at all tracks on the disk.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the thickness of a Co-Cr layer in a Co-Cr/Ni-Fe double layer medium on the recording and <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristics</b> was investigated by computer simulation. In practice, the perpendicular media with a relatively thin Co-Cr layer, about 0. 1 μm in thickness, but which is thicker than the longitudinal media, produce high reproduced voltage at high densities. The {{reason is that the}} sharp magnetic field distribution of a single-pole-head is created for a thin Co-Cr layer by enhancing the head-to-medium magnetic coupling. As a result, the large residual magnetization remains in the recording process, and the high resolution of the singlg-pole-head generates high voltage in reproduction, even at high densities...|$|E

But they are only partially successful in <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristic</b> properties found in tag streams. We argue that this inadequacy of existing models results from their inability to include user’s background knowledge into their model of tagging behavior.

40|$|Biomimetic is {{a design}} {{approach}} to solve engineering problems, by <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristics</b> found in nature. Indeed in nature, {{it is possible}} to find many smart systems, which can be mimicked to build new materials, with potential applications to many engineering fields. Examples of interesting natural materials are bone, nacre, wood. Bone, in particular, is a very intriguing material for its combination of mechanical properties, and in particular for its remarkable toughness, which depends on its complex hierarchical structure, with different levels ranging from the molecular scale to the macroscale. At the micro-scale, bone is characterized by the presence of a typical cylindrical feature called osteon, which {{plays an important role in}} determining the bone fracture behavior. Object of the present work is a new composite material, inspired to the micro-structure of human bone. Here we show the design, manufacturing and characterization of a new composite material, with the aim of replicating some particular toughening mechanisms occurring in the micro-structure of bone; also, we show the design, realization and characterization of a conventional composite, to make a comparison...|$|E

We previously reported skewed T-cell responses to secondary DENV infection in BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice, <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of human DENV infection. To set the stage for using widely available transgenic and knockout mice, we extended these studies to identify DENV-specific T-cell responses in C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) mice. We identified dominant CD 8 + T-cell responses to H- 2 Db-restricted epitopes on the DENV NS 4 a (aa 249 – 265) and NS 5 (aa 521 – 537) proteins. High frequencies of IFN-γ- and TNF-α-producing T cells directed at both epitopes were detected following primary infection with all four DENV serotypes, and were augmented by secondary DENV infections. In vivo cytotoxicity assays demonstrated rapid clearance of target cells pulsed with the NS 4 a peptide; in contrast, NS 5 peptide-pulsed target cells were poorly cleared in vivo. These data characterize two H- 2 b-restricted T-cell epitopes displaying divergent in vivo function. These results should facilitate further studies of the in vivo effects of DENV-specific T cells, including the use of genetically modified mouse strains...|$|E
40|$|The Fission Surface Power Systems Project {{became part}} of the ETDP on October 1, 2008. Its goal was to {{demonstrate}} fission power system technology readiness in an operationally relevant environment, while providing data on fission system characteristics pertinent to the use of a fission power system on planetary surfaces. During fiscal years 08 to 10, the FSPS project activities were dominated by hardware demonstrations of component technologies, to verify their readiness for inclusion in the fission surface power system. These Pathfinders demonstrated multi-kWe Stirling power conversion operating with heat delivered via liquid metal NaK, composite Ti/H 2 O heat pipe radiator panel operations at 400 K input water temperature, no-moving-part electromagnetic liquid metal pump operation with NaK at flight-like temperatures, and subscale performance of an electric resistance reactor simulator capable of <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a nuclear reactor for the purpose of system-level testing, and a longer list of component technologies included in the attached report. Based on the successful conclusion of Pathfinder testing, work began in 2010 on design and development of the Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU), a full-scale 1 / 4 power system-level non-nuclear assembly of a reactor simulator, power conversion, heat rejection, instrumentation and controls, and power management and distribution. The TDU will be developed and fabricated during fiscal years 11 and 12, culminating in initial testing with water cooling replacing the heat rejection system in 2012, and complete testing of the full TDU by the end of 2014. Due to its importance for Mars exploration, potential applicability to missions preceding Mars missions, and readiness for an early system-level demonstration, the Enabling Technology Development and Demonstration program is currently planning to continue the project as the Fission Power Systems project, including emphasis on the TDU completion and testing...|$|E

40|$|A {{range of}} {{possible}} changes in the frequency and characteristics of European wind storms under future climate conditions was investigated {{on the basis of}} a multi-model ensemble of 9 coupled global climate model (GCM) simulations for the 20 th and 21 st centuries following the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario. A multi-model approach allowed an estimation of the (un) certainties of the climate change signals. General changes in large-scale atmospheric flow were analysed, the occurrence of wind storms was quantified, and atmospheric features associated with wind storm events were considered. Identified storm days were investigated according to atmospheric circulation, associated pressure patterns, cyclone tracks and wind speed patterns. Validation against reanalysis data revealed that the GCMs are in general capable of realistically <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of European circulation weather types (CWTs) and wind storms. Results are given with respect to frequency of occurrence, storm-associated flow conditions, cyclone tracks and specific wind speed patterns. Under anthropogenic climate change conditions (SRES A 1 B scenario), increased frequency of westerly flow during winter is detected over the central European investigation area. In the ensemble mean, the number of detected wind storm days increases between 19 and 33 % for 2 different measures of storminess, only 1 GCM revealed less storm days. The increased number of storm days detected in most models is disproportionately high compared to the related CWT changes. The mean intensity of cyclones associated with storm days in the ensemble mean increases by about 10 (± 10) % in the Eastern Atlantic, near the British Isles and in the North Sea. Accordingly, wind speeds associated with storm events increase significantly by about 5 (± 5) % over large parts of central Europe, mainly on days with westerly flow. The basic conclusions of this work remain valid if different ensemble contructions are considered, leaving out an outlier model or including multiple runs of one particular model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved bivariate mixed distribution, which {{is capable of}} modeling the dependence of daily rainfall from two distinct sources (e. g., rainfall from two stations, two consecutive days, or two instruments such as satellite and rain gauge). The distribution couples an existing framework for building a bivariate mixed distribution, the theory of copulae and a hybrid marginal distribution. Contributions of the improved distribution are twofold. One is the appropriate selection of the bivariate dependence structure from a wider admissible choice (10 candidate copula families). The other is {{the introduction of a}} marginal distribution capable of better representing low to moderate values as well as extremes of daily rainfall. Among several applications of the improved distribution, particularly presented here is its utility for single-site daily rainfall simulation. Rather than simulating rainfall occurrences and amounts separately, the developed generator unifies the two processes by generalizing daily rainfall as a Markov process with autocorrelation described by the improved bivariate mixed distribution. The generator is first tested on a sample station in Texas. Results reveal that the simulated and observed sequences are in good agreement with respect to essential characteristics. Then, extensive simulation experiments are carried out to compare the developed generator with three other alternative models: the conventional two-state Markov chain generator, the transition probability matrix model, and the semiparametric Markov chain model with kernel density estimation for rainfall amounts. Analyses establish that overall the developed generator is capable of <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of historical extreme rainfall events and is apt at extrapolating rare values beyond the upper range of available observed data. Moreover, it automatically captures the persistence of rainfall amounts on consecutive wet days in a relatively natural and easy way. Another interesting observation is that the recognized ?overdispersion? problem in daily rainfall simulation ascribes more to the loss of rainfall extremes than the under-representation of first-order persistence. The developed generator appears to be a sound option for daily rainfall simulation, especially in particular hydrologic planning situations when rare rainfall events are of great importance...|$|E
