5|$|Changes {{in other}} areas soon began to be felt. The method of {{government}} after the conquest {{can be described as}} a feudal system, in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king; in <b>return</b> <b>for</b> promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance, called homage, they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour. Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in <b>return</b> <b>for</b> homage and further military support, and eventually the peasantry held land in <b>return</b> <b>for</b> local labour services, creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts. This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo-Saxon system of government. The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest, as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church. The more prosperous peasants, however, lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land more dependent on providing labour services to the local lord. They sank down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor or seek alternative employment.|$|E

5|$|Edward I's {{frequent}} military campaigns put a great financial {{strain on}} the nation. There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including customs duties, money lending and lay subsidies.

In 1303, a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in <b>return</b> <b>for</b> certain rights and privileges. The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy.
