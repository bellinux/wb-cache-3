5|$|Although Darby <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> offshore, {{the large}} {{size of the}} hurricane's {{circulation}} prompted the government of Mexico to issue tropical storm warnings for {{the southern tip of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Although Josephine <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> {{offshore}} of {{the eastern}} United States, the effects from the storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the weekend}} before the January 10 primary, polls showed Huntsman in strong {{competition}} with Ron Paul for a second place showing in New Hampshire, behind front-runner Romney. A Pulse Opinion Research poll on January 4 showed Huntsman narrowly behind Paul 19–16%, while an American Research Group poll on January 7 showed Huntsman edging Paul 17–16%, though both <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> behind Romney.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{the fourth}} named storm of the 1992 Pacific {{hurricane}} season. The origins of Darby were from a tropical wave which moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 19. It traversed the Atlantic, and moved across Mexico, where it re-emerged in the Pacific on June 29 and became a tropical depression on July 2, a tropical storm on July 5, and a hurricane on July 6. The storm <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> offshore, although it killed three people.|$|E
5|$|McKinley <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> ahead {{when the}} state {{conventions}} concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the Republican National Committee (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, {{just prior to the}} convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed along {{the end of a}} quasi-stationary frontal trough. Initially, vertical wind shear prevented deep convection from forming on the western portion of the system. After wind shear decreased, the system became a gale center late on October 22. By early on the following day, the gale center had transitioned into a tropical storm, and it is estimated that Tropical Storm Frances developed at 0600UTC on October 23. Frances quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical storm, and was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800UTC on that same day. After becoming a hurricane, Frances curved northeastward, and <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> east of Bermuda. By midday on October 24, Frances peaked as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> organized, with a wind field 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm {{in an area of}} warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 9, Hernan was {{upgraded}} to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). Convection around the eye continued become more symmetrical, though the National Hurricane Center had stated that Hernan had most likely {{reached its peak}} intensity or {{was very close to}} doing so. However, the eye suddenly became better defined. Based on this, Hernan was {{upgraded to}} a major hurricane. The intensity of Hernan was uncertain, as there was some difference between intensity estimates. Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125mph (205km/h). Overnight, Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken. Although the eye <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> defined, outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor {{probably}} {{hoped that}} Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled {{the shrine of}} a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> preserved, {{which at the time}} was considered to be an indication of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never canonised. In 1292 Henry's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks <b>remained</b> <b>well,</b> but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E
5|$|On August16, Cindy {{made its}} closest point of {{approach}} to Puerto Rico, although its center <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> {{south of the}} island. Impact from the storm was thus limited to intermittent downpours and 8ft (2.4m) waves along the southern coast. The rough seas caused some minor erosion to beach facilities. According to {{a report from the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS), a maximum of 5.54in (141mm) of rain fell near Río Cerrillos in Ponce, though the highest measurement from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) was 4.60in (117mm) at Puerto Real in Cabo Rojo. Many other locations received rainfall amounts of 2.0–4.5in (50–115mm), which flooded some roads and low-lying areas.|$|E

When his grandfather died, the newly titled 10th Earl of Shaftesbury came into a vast fortune of the Shaftesbury estates and other properties, including the family's 17th-century home and large estate in Dorset, as well as residences in Hove, London, Versailles and the French Riviera. Shaftesbury also inherited a collection of art, antiques, and other valuables worth over £3m. By the 1990s, {{the wealth of the}} family estate <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> worth millions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> offshore, the {{difference}} in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|During the day, the French {{strengthened}} {{the positions of}} both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified by Trial, which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was in better condition and <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> protected. Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable.|$|E

5|$|Longchamp governed England while Richard {{was on the}} Third Crusade, but his {{authority}} was challenged by Richard's brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile. Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused {{a great deal of}} hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> known throughout the later Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his failure}} at Pulo Aura, Linois had been {{cruising}} the Indian Ocean, and during August and September 1804 had seized {{a number of}} valuable merchant ships as his squadron travelled north from Ceylon along the Indian coast of the Bay of Bengal. From a ship captured off Masulipatam, Linois learned {{of the presence of}} the East Indiamen at Vizagapatam and determined to attack, unaware that British Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier had replaced the small frigate HMS Wilhelmina with the larger Centurion as the convoy's escort. Arriving off the port at 06:00, Linois advanced on the convoy, causing one of the East Indiamen to drive ashore in panic. The other merchant vessel failed to support the outnumbered Centurion and was captured, but Centurion continued fighting alone. Initially supported by the fire of gun batteries on shore, Centurion later moved out of their range while engaging the French flagship Marengo, which <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> offshore to avoid the coastal shoals. After an engagement lasting four hours Marengo withdrew, the badly damaged Centurion attempting to pursue but without success. Linois's squadron was forced to return to Île de France {{in the aftermath of the}} engagement, where Marengo required six months of repairs.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the early}} hours of September6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak {{steering}} pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas. Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm. Late on September6 a developing banding eye feature became evident. Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTCon September7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it did. The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast–southwest manner late on September7. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along {{the west side of the}} other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90mph (145km/h) late on September8 as it passed 120miles (205km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds <b>remained</b> <b>well</b> offshore.|$|E
