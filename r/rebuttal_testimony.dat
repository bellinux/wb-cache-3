The original complaint {{was built on the}} analyses of teacher effectiveness and the estimated economic cost of ineffective teachers by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University. Raj Chetty (Harvard University) and Thomas Kane (Harvard University) testified on the distribution of ineffective teachers in California and particularly in Los Angeles. Dan Goldhaber (University of Washington) testified on the impact of LIFO layoff statutes.

50|$|In 1984, John Thompson, a 22-year-old African American {{father of}} two, was charged {{along with another}} man for killing a {{prominent}} New Orleans businessman. After his picture {{was published in the}} newspaper because of the arrest, victims of an unsolved attempted armed robbery identified Thompson as the person involved. Handling both cases, district attorney of the Parish of Orleans, Harry Connick Sr., chose to first bring to trial the armed robbery against Thompson in hopes that a conviction would help with the murder case. Based solely on the identification of the three victims, Thompson was found guilty of attempted armed robbery and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Then during the murder trial, Thompson was effectively precluded from testifying in his own defense because the prosecution would have impeached his testimony by referring to his armed robbery conviction. His codefendant was able to testify that he saw Thompson commit the murder without <b>rebuttal</b> <b>testimony</b> from Thompson. Thompson was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. However, Connick suppressed a critical blood sample test. A blood splatter on the victim from the perpetrator of the robbery showed that the perpetrator had a different blood type than Thompson. This meant that Thompson was wrongfully convicted of the robbery - a conviction that prohibited him from defending himself vigorously in the murder case. His murder case was vacated in 2002 and he was retried with his defense providing evidence that another man had committed the murder. After nearly two decades of wrongfully being imprisoned, Thompson was found not guilty in the retrial. Thompson sued Connick and several of his assistant district attorneys for suppression of evidence and won a verdict of $14 million.|$|E
5000|$|Given this {{description}} of the Pinto's design problem, some comments can be offered on the decision-making process within Ford {{that resulted in the}} Pinto. As shown above, a famous Ford report cannot be interpreted as showing Ford balancing lives against dollars in designing the Pinto. To state that the report does not itself reveal such a process does not mean, however, that such a process did not take place. Accordingly, I have consulted the Grimshaw record to learn what light it sheds on this question. As far as basic gas tank location is concerned, I am persuaded that the trunk capacity problem, in conjunction with American auto custom, provides the best explanation for Ford's choice to place the Pinto gas tank behind the axle. As for additional design proposals brought forward by the plaintiffs, several of them-for example, a bladder within the gas tank, and a [...] "tank within the tank"-concerned somewhat innovative technology that had never been utilized in actual auto production. At trial, there was testimony that a bladder would have been feasible in the early 1970's, but also <b>rebuttal</b> <b>testimony</b> that a bladder was at this time beyond the bounds of feasibility. The jury's general verdict does not reveal whether and how the jury resolved such conflicts in the evidence; and I am in no position to resolve them here. Consider now, however, the combination of a stronger bumper, a smooth (bolt-free) differential, and the addition of both hat sections and horizontal cross-members. This combination of design changes clearly would have improved the Pinto's safety to some appreciable extent. According to the evidence, the overall cost of this combination would have been $9; and it makes sense to assume that these items were turned down by Ford in planning the Pinto primarily on account of their monetary costs. It is plausible to believe, then, that because of these costs, Ford decided not to improve the Pinto's design, knowing that its decision would increase the chances of the loss of consumer life. Once a variety of misconceptions are stripped away, this limited core of the Pinto story remains. And this is a core that may well be strong enough to support the [...] "myth" [...] of the Ford Pinto case in the second of the meanings described above. What follows is my effort to explicate the elements of that myth.|$|E
5000|$|Gellman broke {{important}} {{stories about}} the use of and misuse of intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before and after the war in Iraq, including an account of the previously undisclosed White House Iraq Group. In Iraq, traveling with weapons hunters, he showed vividly how the search for WMD was failing, even as the Bush administration asserted otherwise. When Gellman reported that U.S. and allied teams had exhausted their leads on a [...] "reconstituted" [...] Iraqi nuclear weapons program, the CIA issued a strong <b>rebuttal.</b> In <b>testimony</b> before the U.S. Senate, less than 3 months later, Kay acknowledged that The Post's account had been correct. By January 2004, Gellman used independent interviews on the ground with Iraqi scientists and engineers, U.S. and United Nations officials to tell a comprehensive story about how the prewar allegations fell apart. During the presidential election campaign of 2004, Gellman and partner Dafna Linzer wrote a series on the Bush administration's national security record, offering behind-the-scenes narratives of the war with al Qaeda and of Bush's efforts {{to stop the spread of}} nuclear weapons.|$|R

40|$|This <b>rebuttal</b> <b>testimony</b> {{assesses the}} utility of El Sur Ranch’s stream {{transect}} data {{for use in a}} wetted perimeter analysis of the Big Sur River. This testimony rebuts the assertion by Dr. Chuck Hanson that summer flows in the Big Sur River are sufficient to provide adequate physical habitat for juvenile rearing. This also rebuts the suggestion in El Sur Ranch’s water right amendment that 10 cfs is a sufficient minimum bypass flow during the irrigation season. The specific issue regarding use of El Sur Ranch’s stream transect data for use in a wetted perimeter analysis arose during cross-examination of Department of Fish and Game (Department) expert witnesses during the State Water Resources Control Board’s (Board) hearing of El Sur Ranch water right application # 30166 on June 17, 2011. The Department has presented as testimony a wetted perimeter analysis that was based on data collected during 1992 – 1995 (CDFG 2011). There was some question {{as to whether or not}} the analysis based on data collected up to 19 years ago would still apply today, based on the opportunity for river channel conditions to change over time. There was also question as to whether data collected by El Sur Ranch consultants was used for comparative purposes with the historic data...|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, Collins' {{attorneys}} {{introduced a}} renowned neutron analyst named Dr. Robert Jervis {{in an effort}} to discredit the earlier testimony of the forensic experts who had testified on behalf of the prosecution. Dr. Jervis testified as to his belief that insufficient chemical samples had existed in the samples retrieved from the basement which the prosecution scientists had worked with to form their conclusions, and that to form a conclusive neutron activation analysis, at least ten components in a hair sample must be compared, whereas only five components had been used by the prosecution's forensics experts to determine their findings. The forensic experts who had testified on behalf of the prosecution, Dr. Jervis stated, had therefore based their conclusions on [...] "insufficient data". Dr. Jervis' conclusions were supported by a private consultant named Auseklis Perkons, and a Massachusetts-based Director of Forensic Research named Samuel Golub. Perkons testified as to his belief that the hair samples retrieved from Beineman's panties were of a [...] "different origin" [...] than the hair samples retrieved from the Leiks' basement, whereas Golub stated that because he had found only one single fiber upon the victim's panties, the likelihood of her undergarments accumulating these hairs from a basement was extremely remote. In <b>rebuttal</b> to the <b>testimony</b> of Dr. Golub, the defense recalled Dr. Walter Holz on August 12 to testify as to the samples he had himself taken to Dr. Golub for identification; Dr. Holz affirmed that he had taken twenty magnified photographic slides of samples retrieved from Beineman's panties to Dr. Golub's laboratory for analysis, and that they had contained numerous man-made fibrous materials.|$|R
