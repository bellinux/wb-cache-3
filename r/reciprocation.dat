5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing {{what is best for}} the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future <b>reciprocation.</b> Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Mauss is {{recognized}} as one of the first authors interested in the study of gift economies. His main concern centered on individuals' need to provide gifts and the obligations to reciprocate them. He identified human obligation to give, receive, and reciprocate as the most important factor in the creation and maintenance of social ties. <b>Reciprocation</b> was mainly produced by the insertion of the giver's identity in the object that was given. The object maintained this essence (referred to as hau or mana by Mauss) of the giver which needed to return to him/her through <b>reciprocation</b> in the form of a counter-gift (another object, services, person, agreements, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Since every {{household}} {{was almost}} entirely self-sufficient, {{there was very}} little need for trade. Goods and services were exchanged, but a household's survival did not depend on it. In the course of bringing in various resources, it was natural that a given household would reap a windfall of a particular resource, be it a large harvest of apricots, wheat, or a large bison that was brought back by the hunters, etc. When a household found itself with a plentiful supply of a particular resource, it did not necessarily mean that the surplus would be traded in the modern sense of the word, but rather, the surplus would probably be given away to others in the community who could use whatever resource they had on hand, with no thought of <b>reciprocation</b> or direct realized return {{on the part of the}} gifters.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of a number of}} mechanical applications could be greatly improved by the introduction of transducers that are capable of exploiting the inherent power densities of piezoelectric materials. The ability of these solid-state materials to exert large forces at high frequencies engenders them with specific power levels (mass normalized) that are often several orders of magnitude greater than conventional transducers, but their utility is offset by their small achievable strains. A novel concept for a device capable of improved solid-state transduction, Micro Hydraulic Solid-State Transducers (MHSTs), is introduced and explored in this thesis. The concept is comprised of two core principles: (1) utilization of a hydraulic system consisting of a pump, valves, and a working fluid to rectify the high frequency <b>reciprocations</b> of a piezoelectric drive element into unidirectional motion, and (2) performance enhancement through miniaturization. The goal is a transducer possessing high power densities that is useful in conventional applications. Feasibility of the MHST concept is evaluated by designing, modeling, and simulating a prototype mechanism. The effects of miniattariza~ion on device performance are investigated and an optimal scale is determined. Concept feasibility is based on predicted system performance, existing issues, and manufacturing constraints. It is concluded that the concept is feasible and warrants further development. by Seward Webb Pulitzer, III. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In recent times, the {{question}} of the gift has become a hot topic across a range of disciplines. Jacques Derrida was a key instigator: he disclosed the gift’s paradoxical or aporetic nature: it is both gratuitous and circular, excessive and reciprocal. An exemplary and decisive textual site of this duality is the Bible, where gift/ing is expressed according to extreme figures like grace and bribery – and much in between. But an examination of the gift should also move beyond the world of the text to the world itself. And so, we ask: ‘What if creation is a gift? How should we respond to the Earth?’ One of the hottest academic discourses in recent times has been {{the question}} of the gift.

Jacques Derrida is the pivotal figure here: the publication of Given Time in the early 1990 s caused a bit of a stir with its scandalous problematization of one of our most treasured and – one would think – straightforward phenomena, problematised to the extent that Derrida could be misread as insisting that there is no gift – hence, the scandal. Why is the gift a problem?

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was {{the determination of the}} attitudes of Greek Basketball coaches towards their distance learning with the use of ICT in comparison with the classical learning and the examination of the perspective of their distance learning with the use of ICT. Therefore a closed questionnaire was used which included 3 different parts. 60 basketball coaches from Northern Greece comprised the sample (N= 60). An interactive software was created which included the teaching of an offensive basketball system. The methodology of distance learning was used for the creation of the offensive system. The software was copied to a CD-Rom and accompanied with the questionnaires it was given to 20 Basketball coaches of Northern Greece as a pilot program. After the corrections of the primary questionnaires, the distribution of the final questionnaire accompanied with the CD-Rom followed. Multiple <b>reciprocations</b> were used for the data analysis. According to the results the more relaxing, easier and faster distance learning was considered in relation to the conventional one, a) the fewer difficulties would the Basketball coaches face by using the distance learning method and b) the friendlier and more relaxing would the distance learning method be. Also according to data research: a) the more attractive the reading of software was, b) the fewer the difficulties during the reading of software and c) the more relaxing, easier and faster distance learning was considered in relation to the conventional one, the stronger was the perspective of Basketball coaches to believe in distance learning. In conclusion the more relaxing, easier and faster distance learning was considered in relation to the conventional one, the more positive were the attitudes of Basketball coaches towards their distance learning, while a positive perspective of Basketball coaches towards their distance learning is being formed...|$|R

And these tremulations operate on and between entities via one's deep desire (love-resonance) that creates a circuit between subject and object, such that one has access via an inner organ (Coleridge's [...] "inmost mind" [...] or Goethe's Gemüt) and the corresponding 'philosophic' or re-emergent Greek noetic organ. All knowledge for Coleridge rests on the [...] "coadunation" [...] of subject and object, of the representation in the mind (thought) of a sense experience with the object itself, which can only occur where there is a connection between subject and object ('a reciprocal concurrence of both') beyond pure sense-experience, such that the thought that arises out of 'the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking' produces not a representation but a phenomenon (in the Hediggerian sense) that is the re-enactment in the mind of reality (such as for Collingwood in his Idea of History) and as such is knowledge that is apodictic, heuristic and hermeneutic all at the same time.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} how Auster, Roth and DeLillo {{write in}} order to see themselves in the world. If Kafka’s burrowing into himself and Nabokov’s inscription of a chalk-white “I” on the inner blackboard of his shut eyelids exemplified Modernist strategies for projecting the isolated self into the world, my subject authors have confronted a theoretical situation in which the world as a permanent and common object doesn’t exist. Negotiating an increasingly unreal American popular culture that stands in for this object and that has disassembled the monadic self, they reimagine the sight of darkness and premonitions of death inherited from their precursors’ self-seeing as a means of reifying our world. The thesis proceeds in three author-specific chapters. The first traces Auster’s chimeric appearances in the glass of fictive representation using popular cultural symbols. These symbols repeatedly erase the self, figuring its disappearance into the continuing present and giving the lie to a permanent visible world in which the self can be located. The second chapter explores Roth’s writing characters as “darkening[s]” of the fictive glass. His fiction interrogates the obscure “inside of me” to locate an unseen point where the self is remade through transformative connections with the world. This connection, which he names “reality”, remains invisible, communicated in distorted images of grief and mourning that also reflect the unreal character of popular culture. In the final chapter, a new connection between the self and the world becomes visible in DeLillo’s work. He reifies our dissembling culture by rendering it as a smeary, visible reflection of the unfixed, continuing present into which Auster’s selves disappear. The sight of this unfixed, different world is co-eval with a new form of self-seeing in which the world is not permanent nor transparent but formed in characters’ relationships to it, reciprocating today’s wavering possibility of there being the world at all. In tracing the pursuit of self-seeing in the world in these three exemplary writers, the thesis develops a new relationship between the aesthetics of character and the world-rendering potential of novel-writing. In a period of theoretical transition after postmodernism, such new paradigms are vital for grasping how we envision selves now as <b>reciprocations</b> of the world’s precarity, responding to the pressure of the real...|$|R
