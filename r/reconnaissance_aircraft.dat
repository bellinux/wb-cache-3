5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on July 19, 1970. As the depression {{moved through the}} Yucatán Channel, the convective cloud system became better organized.

5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>aircraft</b> was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>aircraft</b> was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{the attack}} was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal on the same course {{and at the same}} speed.

5|$|Captain Ichiro Ono assumed command on 15 November 1934 and Ryūjō {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Hideho Wada's First Carrier Division. The following month {{the ship was}} chosen to evaluate dive-bombing tactics using six Nakajima E4N2-C Type 90 <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>aircraft,</b> six Yokosuka B3Y1 Type 92 torpedo bombers, and a dozen A2N1 Type 90 fighters. The <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>aircraft</b> proved to be unsuitable after several months' testing. Ryūjō participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she {{was attached to the}} IJN Fourth Fleet. The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. Ryūjō arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain Shun'ichi Kira.|$|E
5|$|Despite its success, {{owing to}} {{shortages}} {{in the supply}} of the Daimler-Benz engine, the production Do 17M was fitted with the Bramo 323 engine, with the corresponding <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the Do 17P, being powered by BMW 132Ns to give better range.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, Tropical Depression Eleven formed {{midway between}} Africa and the Lesser Antilles from a {{tropical}} wave.
