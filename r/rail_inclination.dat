500|$|Calthrop {{had been}} engaged in {{negotiations}} with the Indian government for concessions to build a railway from Barsi Road to Barsi since 1887. In 1895 negotiations reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Calthrop formed a new company to build the Barsi Light Railway, and employed himself as consulting engineer. The railway became a showcase for his ideas. Five 0-8-4T locomotives, with even distribution of axle load, were constructed to Calthrop's specification by Kitson & Co. The goods rolling stock was constructed on common [...] pressed steel underframes, reducing tare weight and maximising potential wagon loads. Calthrop recognised the importance of railways in warfare, and designed the rolling stock to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment. Rolling stock rode on pressed-steel Fox bogies, using the Timmis system of double coiled springs. The line was constructed with <b>rail</b> <b>inclination,</b> then a new idea, which involves tilting the rail a few degrees to make its surface more nearly parallel {{with that of the}} tyre. Inclination is now applied universally to railways. The rolling stock could accept [...] radius curves.|$|E
5000|$|In 1895 the {{negotiations}} {{that began in}} 1887 were finally successful and Calthrop formed a new company to build the Barsi Light Railway, employing himself as consulting engineer. Calthrop surmised that the axle load on the axles of all rolling stock (including locomotives) could be equal, allowing maximum loading of goods wagons. He settled on a load of 5 LT per axle, which was light enough to allow railway lines to be built with [...] rail. Further, he argued that using a track gauge of [...] was the best compromise between economy of construction and carrying capacity. Five 0-8-4T locomotives (with even distribution of axle load) were constructed to Calthrop's specification by Kitson and Company. The goods rolling stock was constructed on common 25 by 7 ft pressed-steel underframes, reducing tare weight and maximising wagon loads. Calthrop recognised the importance of railways in warfare, and designed the rolling stock to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment. Rolling stock rode on pressed-steel Fox bogies, using the Timmis system of double coiled springs. The line was constructed with <b>rail</b> <b>inclination</b> (then a new idea), which involves tilting the rail a few degrees to make its surface more nearly parallel {{with that of the}} rim of the wheels. Inclination is now applied universally to railways. Prior to shipment of the rolling stock to India, Calthrop and the Leeds Forge Company, manufacturer of the rolling stock, conducted tests on a specially built test track located at Newlay, near Leeds. The line was opened for inspection by railway officials and journalists, and a number of reports were published in the technical railway press.|$|E
40|$|Present market {{conditions}} prefer an implementation in mining some highly efficient coal longwalls, {{which must be}} insured with a supply of proper machines and equipment as well as working there men, mainly by suspended and floor(narrow-gauge) railways. A frictional contact of engine driving wheels with rails of these railways limits their traction possibilities in the essential way, particularly onto rails of increased slopes. In the paper an analysis of traction possibilities of mining railways with frictional drives {{from the point of}} view of their operating on <b>rail</b> <b>inclination,</b> taking on consideration the different ways of thrust of driving wheels onto rail has been carried out. They were also given the dependences for the calculation of required frictional contact forces of wheels on rails and boundary track inclinations, which can be overcame by the railways with frictional drives...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of wear due to wheel–rail interaction {{is a fundamental}} aspect in the railway field, mainly correlated to safety, maintenance interventions and costs. In this work, the authors present an innovative wheel profile optimisation procedure, specifically designed {{with the aim of}} improving the wear and stability behaviour of the standard ORE S 1002 wheel profile matched with the UIC 60 rail profile canted at 1 / 20 rad, which represents the wheel–rail combination adopted in Italian railway line; this matching shows poor wear performance due to the non-conformal contact. A new wheel profile, conventionally named DR 2, has been developed by the authors in collaboration with Trenitalia S. p. A. The DR 2 wheel profile is designed to guarantee the same kinematic characteristics of the matching formed by ORE S 1002 wheel profile and UIC 60 <b>rail</b> profile with <b>inclination</b> angle p equal to 1 / 40 rad, widely common in European railways and characterised by good performances in both wear and kinematic behaviour. The evolution of wheel profiles due to wear has been evaluated through a wear model developed and validated by the authors in previous works. In the present research the investigated trainset is the passenger vehicle ALSTOM ALn 501 ‘‘Minuetto’’, which is usually equipped with wheelsets having the standard ORE S 1002 wheel profile in Italian railways. The entire model has been simulated on a virtual track specifically developed to represent a statistical description of the whole Italian line; the innovative statistical approach has been employed to obtain accurate results in reasonable computational times. The data necessary to build the virtual track and the vehicle model were provided by Trenitalia S. p. A. and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lateral forces between {{wheels and}} rails must be reduced {{in order that}} rolling stock runs safely and {{smoothly}} on curved tracks. The excessive lateral force will cause not only derail-ment of rolling stock but also destruction of tracks, rail corrugation, track irregularity, squeal noise and wear. It is important to reduce lateral force of wheels in curves, so new wheel-tread profiles and steerable bogie structures have been developed up to now, however, they cannot solve various problems in curving perfectly. In this article, the authors propose three methods for improvement of running performance on curves by using existing types of wheels and rails, and analyse the effects of three methods by numerical simulation. According to analytical results, the authors conclude that ‘expansion of gauge widening’, and ‘larger <b>rail</b> <b>inclination</b> angle of inner rail installation ’ or ‘asymmetrically inclined grinding of inner rail head ’ can get sufficient rolling radius difference, and are effective for improvement of running performance on curved tracks...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for numerical prediction of accumulated rail damage in railway turnouts is presented. Based on simulation of dynamic vehicle-track interaction {{followed by a}} discretisation of the conditions in each wheel-rail contact, distributions of rail wear are calculated by the Archard model of sliding wear, while surface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage is evaluated by the Palmgren–Miner rule and an index building on shakedown theory. Partial slip in the wheel-rail contacts and variable amplitude loading are considered. For freight traffic in the diverging route, the influence of <b>rail</b> <b>inclination</b> and switch rail elevation on damage in the switch panel is investigated in a demonstration example. Two-point contact situations with one contact on the switch rail and {{one on top of}} the stock rail induce relative motion and slip between wheel and rail leading to high energy dissipation. In agreement with field observations, it is concluded that wear is the dominating damage mechanism on the gauge side of the switch rail while the risk for RCF is higher on the crowns of the switch and stock rails. For accurate prediction of rail life for given combinations of wheel/rail materials and traffic conditions, the methodology needs to be calibrated by field measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for track loading limits {{are one of}} the main barriers to simple cross-acceptance of vehicles where rolling stock that is already operating successfully in one (or more) networks has to be retested before it can be approved for operation on another network. DynoTRAIN Work Package 4 studied this area in order to determine whether the additional requirements were justified, or if the process could be made much cheaper and simpler without increasing the risk of track deterioration for the networks. The review of national requirements identified modified criteria and limit values for track forces in some member states; however, these can be obtained from additional analysis of the normal test results with no new tests required. The influence of design <b>rail</b> <b>inclination</b> has also been found not to be significant, provided a realistic range of wheel–rail contact conditions are included in the tests. For line speeds {{greater than or equal to}} 160 [*]km/h, the current standards for track construction across the member states appear to be similar. On lower speed lines in some countries, a ‘weaker’ track condition may require a lower limit on one of the vehicle assessment parameters. Track dynamics modelling has shown that the vehicle assessment parameters used in international standards are suitable for use in cross-acceptance for track forces. The use of multiple regression analysis allows the estimated maximum value for relevant parameters to be evaluated for different target conditions and then compared with the appropriate limit value, or with values for existing, comparable vehicles. Guidance has also been provided on the relevant parameters to consider when developing operating controls for different types of track deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Short-wave {{irregularities}} in the wheel-rail interface {{are at the}} basis of track and vehicle damage and deterioration. On the short term, they result into high dynamic train-track interaction forces and a high energy input into the system that must be dissipated in the different system components or "levels", leading on its turn to progressive deterioration on the long term. Furthermore, the short-wave defects grow into longer defects in the track geometry, {{due to the fact}} that the train is a travelling multi-body mass-spring system. The lifetime of the track and its components can be extended by adjusting the "path" of the dissipated power spectrum through the system and adjusting component and system properties with respect to their hysteretic behaviour. Instead of life-time extension, such measures may also aim at an extension of maintenance intervals, which is important to optimise the availability of e. g. high-speed lines. The present study investigates two particular types of short defects in detail: rail welds and wheel flats. In longitudinal direction and on a global scale, the contact between a rolling wheel and a rail can be distinguished into continuous single-point contact and transient double-point contact. The contact type that occurs depends on the actual geometry of the wheel-rail interface in the running direction. The first contact type leads to a dynamic amplification of the static axle load, whereas the second leads to wheel-rail impact. Especially the latter contact type is detrimental to the rail system and should be prevented as much as possible or detected at an early stage. The introduction of rail welds instead of the traditionally bolted connections reduced the dynamic forces at rail joints globally with a factor three. However, welds remain potential damage initiators due to the local geometrical and metallurgical discontinuity. Investigations show an approximately linear relationship between the extreme value of the dynamic wheel-rail contact force at a weld, the maximum absolute <b>rail</b> <b>inclination</b> and the train speed. The geometry of rail welds is traditionally assessed with the principle of vertical tolerances. A new assessment method for rail welds is proposed, with norm values for the allowable inclination depending on the line section train speed. This method is based on a relatively strong correlation between discretised maximum rail geometry inclinations (first derivatives) and extreme dynamic wheel-rail contact forces, relative to the poor correlation between tolerances and extreme forces. The method aims at a reduction and uniformisation of dynamic contact forces at rail welds, in order to avoid deterioration. Wheel flats are commonly assessed on the basis of their length and/or depth, or automatically detected by wheel impact load detectors in the track. This study has shown that the minimum circumferential wheel tread curvature is the critical parameter that governs the dynamic wheel-rail interaction in the presence of wheel flats. It determines which contact type occurs for a given flat geometry: continuous single-point contact, in the subcritical speed regime, or transient double-point contact, in the transcritical speed regime. It furthermore determines the magnitude of the contact force in the subcritical regime. Both speed regimes are shown to exhibit essentially different features with respect to the dynamic wheel-rail interaction: the track stiffness governs the interaction for low train speeds and long flats, whereas for high speeds and/or short flats the inertial properties of the wheel and the rail govern the interaction. The force-speed relationship is non-linear in the first regime, whereas linearity is a good approximation in the second regime. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
