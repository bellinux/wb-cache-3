5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was looming, and the team began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum <b>range</b> <b>that</b> was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E

5|$|This {{crocodile}} is to {{be found}} in the freshwater swamps, marshes and lakes of New Guinea, particularly in the interior. It has been known to enter brackish waters such as those of the Fly River estuary but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found in the presence of the competing saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the Sepik River area in the north of Papua New Guinea. A separate population is found in the southern half of the island, with a <b>range</b> <b>that</b> extends from southeastern Papua New Guinea to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the northern population by the New Guinea Highlands, a mountain <b>range</b> <b>that</b> runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically separate populations, and there are some differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 New Guinea crocodiles in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency <b>range</b> <b>that</b> its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E

5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its <b>range,</b> <b>that</b> is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Diamond Lake, {{formed by}} one of Thielsen's eruptions, lies {{to the west of}} Mount Thielsen and beyond lies Mount Bailey, a much less eroded and younger stratovolcano.

5|$|On 18 October, the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment {{prepared}} to assault the Hotel Quellenhof, {{which was one}} of the last areas of resistance in the city. American tanks and other guns were firing on the hotel, which was the city's defense headquarters, at point blank <b>range.</b> <b>That</b> night, 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building. A furious German counterattack managed to overrun a number of American infantry positions outside of the hotel, and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American mortar fire.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November 1941, Sydney was {{involved}} in a mutually destructive engagement with the , and was lost with all 645 aboard. The wrecks of both ships were lost until 2008; Sydney was found on 17 March, five days after her adversary. Sydneys defeat is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and Kormorans advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. However, the cruiser's loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the Germans have resulted in controversy, with some alleging that the German commander used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into <b>range,</b> <b>that</b> a Japanese submarine {{was involved}}, and that the true events of the battle are concealed behind a wide-ranging cover up.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{found only}} {{on the island of}} Virgin Gorda, it has since been {{reported}} on Tortola and Moskito Island. Its range is sometimes estimated to encompass the entire British Virgin Islands, although the original expedition by Thomas did not find any specimens on Tortola, Anegada, or other smaller islands, nor in the United States Virgin Islands of Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative, S.nicholsi in Puerto Rico, another species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad (Bufo lemur), has a geographic <b>range</b> <b>that</b> includes both islands, yet it has not diverged.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great <b>range</b> <b>that</b> extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E
50|$|The Transverse Ranges is {{a unique}} set of {{mountain}} ranges in California. They are the only mountain <b>ranges</b> <b>that</b> run west to east, as opposed to the rest of Californiaâ€™s <b>ranges</b> <b>that</b> run north to south. These mountain ranges run from Santa Barbara County into San Bernardino County. They derive the name Transverse Ranges due to their East-West orientation, making them transverse to the general North-South orientation of most of California's coastal mountain ranges.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short <b>range</b> <b>that</b> could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|The species' usual {{habitats}} include drylands, coastal sage scrub, {{and desert}} ecosystems. It also grows in lawns and fields. The {{range of the}} fungus is restricted to southwestern and western North America, where it fruits throughout the year, typically during or following cold, wet weather. Zeller gives a <b>range</b> <b>that</b> includes as its eastern border central Texas, and extends westward to San Diego County, California, and north to Josephine County, Oregon. The mushroom used to be common in the San Francisco Bay area before land development reduced its preferred habitats. A.deserticola has been collected in several states in northwestern Mexico, including Sonora, Chihuahua, and Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Widespread in the nearshore {{waters of}} the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific region, the bluespotted ribbontail ray has a <b>range</b> <b>that</b> extends around {{the periphery of the}} Indian Ocean from South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula to Southeast Asia, including Madagascar, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. It is rare in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. In the Pacific Ocean, this species is found from the Philippines to northern Australia, as well as around numerous Melanesian and Polynesian islands as far east as the Solomon Islands. Rarely found deeper than , the bluespotted ribbontail ray is a bottom-dwelling species that frequents coral reefs and adjacent sandy flats. It is also commonly encountered in the intertidal zone and tidal pools, and has been sighted near seagrass beds. Every summer, considerable numbers of bluespotted ribbontail rays arrive off South Africa.|$|E
