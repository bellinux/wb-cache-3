5000|$|An {{insulated}} cable {{a few hundred}} meters to several kilometers long is laid parallel to the geological strike direction. The cable is either grounded at both ends or {{laid out in a}} large loop, and energized at low frequencies (less than 1 kHz). Two receiving coils are moved on lines outside of and perpendicular to the long side of the loop or grounded cable and two components of the <b>resultant</b> <b>field</b> are measured. The primary field generated by the large loop or cable interacts with the soil and subsoil and with a conductive body if present which could be a mineral and creates a resultant electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is measured according to two values: the Field Strength Ratio and the Phase Difference occurring between the two receiving coils [...] It is a fixed source horizontal loop method. Separation of the two moving coils is usually from 10 to 30 metres. Using an AC bridge (also called compensator bridge), Field Strength Ratio is measured in percent and Phase Difference in degrees. In-phase (Real) and quadrature (Imaginary) values can be calculated from these data. Observed field strength ratio readings are used to calculate reduced ratios using a formula determined by the loop size and shape or the grounded wire length and the position of the receiving coils relative to the loop or grounded wire. The Turam method is a frequency domain method and in a way is the precursor of the time domain fixed loop methods. It is claimed to have detected large flat lying conductors to a depth of 400 metres.|$|E

40|$|Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a method of}} obtaining residual stresses. The results of a preliminary study demonstrated that when Al- 2024 plate containing holes that were plastically deformed by cold expansion process to 2 % and 4 % strain the thermoelastic response in the material around the hole was different to that obtained from a plate that had not experienced any plastic cold expansion (i. e. a reference specimen). This observation provides an opportunity for obtaining residual stresses based on TSA data. In many applications a reference specimen (i. e. residual stress free specimen) may not be available for comparison, so a synthetic, digital bitmap {{has been proposed}} as an alternative. An elastic finite element model is created using commercially available software Abaqus/Standard and the <b>resultant</b> stress <b>field</b> is extracted. The simulated stress field from the model is mapped onto a grid that matches the TSA pixel data from a physical reference specimen.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for computing the fields produced by radio frequency probes {{of the type}} used in magnetic resonance imaging. The effects of surrounding the probe with a shielding coil, intended to eliminate stray fields produced outside the probe, are included. An essential feature of these devices {{is the fact that}} the conducting rungs of the probe are of finite width relative to the coil radius, and it is therefore necessary to find the distribution of current within the conductors as part of the solution process. This is done here using a numerical method based on the inverse finite Hilbert transform, applied iteratively to the entire structure including its shielding coils. It is observed that the fields are influenced substantially by the width of the conducting rungs of the probe, since induced eddy currents within the rungs become more pronounced as their width is increased.

Taking into account the similarity between this problem and the reduction to the pole calculation (cf. Baranov, 1957), Yamazaki successfully derived a formula to determine the <b>resultant</b> piezomagnetic <b>field</b> based on magnetic anomaly data. The existence of such a formula implies that the <b>resultant</b> piezomagnetic <b>field</b> is determined uniquely, regardless of the non-uniqueness of the explicit distribution of the initial magnetization intensities. Therefore, the difficulty encountered regarding the non-uniqueness of the initial magnetization is avoided for situations in which conditions (i) and (ii) are met. Condition (i) is valid across a reasonably wide range of situations, including stress accumulation related to plate subduction. However, condition (ii) is somewhat problematic. Although this condition is usually assumed in interpretations of aero-magnetic survey results, the directions of the initial magnetizations are not assured to be uniform, particularly in cases of remanent magnetization.|$|R
