5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E

500|$|The Brooklyn Free School {{was founded}} in 2004 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and began its first {{academic}} session later that year. Its director, Alan Berger, had been an assistant principal at a Manhattan high school before he left to found the alternative school. He had <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> free school in Woodstock, New York, and was [...] "grabbed ... to the core". Berger published his idea for the school in the October 2003 issue of the park Slope Food Co-op newsletter. About 170 people showed interest, and a group held biweekly planning sessions until the school opened in the 16th Street Brooklyn First Free Methodist Church's bottom two floors in 2004. The original class was thirty students with three teachers. It was the first free school in New York City since the Park Slope Fifteenth Street School closed in 1975. By November 2012, the school had moved to a four-floor brownstone in Fort Greene. The school had 42 pupils by November 2006, 60 by 2012, and 80 by 2015. As of 2015, Lily Mercogliano is the school's director.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} (N= 98) {{investigated the}} moderating effect of ingroup identification on reactions to deviant ingroup members. We measured psychology students’ {{level of identification}} with the group ‘psychologists’ and presented them with information <b>about</b> either <b>a</b> normative or deviant psychologist. Participants completed an ingroup stereotype measure either before or after <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> and evaluating the target psychologist. High identifiers expressed a more positive stereotype of the ingroup after, compared to before, <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> deviant ingroup member. High identifiers also expressed a more positive stereotype of the ingroup after <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> deviant than after <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> normative ingroup member. By contrast, low identifiers’ stereotype judgements were relatively unaffected by the target information. The target evaluation ratings indicate that high identifiers were more positive than low identifiers towards the normative ingroup member, but were more negative than low identifiers towards the deviant. The results point to the greater motivational demands on high identifiers to maintain a positive image of the group...|$|R

500|$|... 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman {{produced}} an animated The Simpsons film that {{was released on}} July 27, 2007. The production staff of The Simpsons had entertained {{the thought of a}} film since early in the series, but production never came together. Groening felt a feature-length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series. The film was directed by David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Groening, Brooks, Jean, Reiss, Mirkin, Scully, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease, taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. Groening <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. He also wanted to make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, as [...] "we wanna really give you something that you haven't seen before." [...] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded.|$|E
500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The Bonfire of the Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give you something that you haven't seen before".|$|E

He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess the very things that had brought him into the underworld." [...] The song also features Darnell's attempt at the then newly fashionable art of rapping—he later confessed, [...] "That's just me goofing at being a rapper, which was the last thing I ever wanted to do".|$|E

60|$|This is {{the excuse}} {{for all that}} {{indeterminate}} and rambling and sometimes sentimental criticism of which Dickens, more than any one else, is the victim, of which I fear that I for one have made him the victim in this place. When I was a boy I could not understand why the Dickensians worried so wearily about Dickens, about where he went to school and where he ate his dinners, about how he wore his trousers and when he cut his hair. I used to wonder why they did not write something that I could <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> man like Micawber. But I {{have come to the}} conclusion that this almost hysterical worship of the man, combined with a comparatively feeble criticism on his works, is just and natural. Dickens was a man like ourselves; we can see where he went wrong, and study him without being stunned or getting the sunstroke. But Micawber is not a man; Micawber is the superman. We can only walk round and round him wondering what we shall say. All the critics of Dickens, when all is said and done, have only walked round and round Micawber wondering what they should say. I am myself at this moment walking round and round Micawber wondering what I shall say. And I have not found out yet.|$|E
6000|$|Strange that, {{after his}} long experience, my {{grandfather}} should have learned {{so little of}} the attitude and even the dialect of the spiritually-minded; that after forty-four years in a most religious circle, he could drop without sense of incongruity from a period of accepted phrases to [...] "trust his wife was getting up her spirits," [...] or think to reassure her as {{to the character of}} Captain Wemyss by mentioning that he had read prayers on the deck of his frigate [...] "agreeably to the Articles of War"! Yet there is no doubt--and {{it is one of the}} most agreeable features of the kindly series--that he was doing his best to please, and there is little doubt that he succeeded. Almost all my grandfather's private letters have been destroyed. This correspondence has not only been preserved entire, but stitched up in the same covers with the works of the godly women, the Reverend John Campbell, and the painful Mrs. Ogle. I did not think to mention the good dame, but she comes in usefully as an example. Amongst the treasures of the ladies of my family, her letters have been honoured with a volume to themselves. I <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> half of them myself; then handed over the task to one of stauncher resolution, with orders to communicate any fact that should be found to illuminate these pages. Not one was found; it was her only art to communicate by post second-rate sermons at second-hand; and such, I take it, was the correspondence in which my grandmother delighted. If I am right, that of Robert Stevenson, with his quaint smack of the contemporary [...] "Sandford and Merton," [...] his interest in the whole page of experience, his perpetual quest, and fine scent of all that seems romantic to a boy, his needless pomp of language, his excellent good sense, his unfeigned, unstained, unwearied human kindliness, would seem to her, in a comparison, dry and trivial and worldly. And if these letters were by an exception cherished and preserved, it would be for one or both of two reasons--because they dealt with and were bitter-sweet reminders of a time of sorrow; or because she was pleased, perhaps touched, by the writer's guileless efforts to seem spiritually-minded.|$|E
