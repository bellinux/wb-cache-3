500|$|Anderson {{is known}} for films set in the San Fernando Valley with realistically flawed and desperate characters. Among the themes dealt with in Anderson's films are {{dysfunctional}} familial relationships, alienation, surrogate families, regret, loneliness, destiny, the power of forgiveness, and ghosts of the past. Anderson makes frequent use of repetition to build emphasis and thematic consistency. In Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love and The Master, the phrase [...] "I didn't do anything" [...] is used at least once, developing themes of responsibility and denial. Anderson's films {{are known for their}} bold visual style which includes stylistic trademarks such as constantly moving camera, steadicam-based long takes, memorable use of music, and multilayered audiovisual imagery. Anderson also tends to reference the Book of Exodus, either explicitly or subtly, such as in <b>recurring</b> <b>references</b> to Exodus 8:2 in Magnolia, which chronicles the plague of frogs, culminating with the literal raining of frogs in the film's climax, or the title and themes in There Will Be Blood, a phrase that can be found in Exodus 7:19, which details the [...]|$|E
2500|$|Seen by Alex. Ştefănescu as both Negoiţescu's only {{complete}} {{work and}} [...] "a sort of critical poem", Poezia lui Eminescu {{became one of}} the most celebrated writings of its author's entire career. Literary historian and columnist Mircea Iorgulescu described the work as a [...] "crucial moment in Eminescian exegesis", equaled only by George Călinescu's 1932 study Viaţa lui Mihai Eminescu ("The Life of Mihai Eminescu") and Ilina Gregori's 2002 Studii literare ("Literary Studies"). Iorgulescu argues that, although structured as [...] "a meager pamphlet of a little more than two hundred pages", the book [...] "radically changed the understanding of Eminescu and his poetry". Overall, the text neglected Eminescu's anthumous poetry and focused on poems only published after the subject's death. It discussed their somber sleep-related imagery, in particular the presence of androgynous angels, their <b>recurring</b> <b>references</b> to darkness, and their various allusions to the temptation of sin. These themes, commonly ignored by Negoiţescu's critical predecessors, were argued to have revealed in Eminescu a [...] "Plutonian" [...] artist. Ştefănescu believes that Negoiţescu had intended to elude that part of Eminescu's work that had become widely accessible to a [...] "motley" [...] public, and instead focused the remaining secrets. The result of such studies, Ştefănescu proposes, has [...] "the flickering—and blinding—unity of magnesium flames", its intensity evoking [...] "a maddening experience, leaving the experimenter to reemerge with his hair all white." [...] In Ştefănescu's view, the passion felt by the exegete is the homoerotic equivalent of a physical affair. He writes: [...] "Nobody, not even Veronica Micle, has loved [...] as intensely and as tragically as Ion Negoiţescu." [...] This dissenting and highly personal view clashed with both critical orthodoxy and other contemporary reevaluations of Eminescu. Negoiţescu's text clashed with the conclusions drawn by Matei Călinescu's in his 1964 book on Eminescu's late poetry (which had mainly focused on the relative impact of Schopenhauerian aesthetics). Negoiţescu's concentration on Eminescu's posthumous pieces was intensely disputed in later years by literary historian Nicolae Manolescu, who regarded this approach as exclusivist.|$|E

50|$|In {{parallel}} motion, rhythmic harmony or in harmonic patterns varying interval combinations can be found. However, {{all these}} intervals {{are limited to}} those permitted by the scale. The intervals of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, octave, ninth and tenth can all be found. As African music and harmony {{is based on a}} cyclical structure with <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> points and harmonic reference points (or chords) some of these intervals are seen as color tones while others have structural significance. Generally the tones and intervals of structural significance are based on thirds, fourths, fifths, and octaves.|$|R
50|$|The series {{borrowed}} a few storytelling elements from its predecessor. Once again, each episode began with Simon narrating {{an introduction to}} set the scene for viewers, and each pre-credit sequence ended with an animated halo appearing above Templar's head as he was identified. The series also made a <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> to the 1930s-40s film series, and the 1940s radio series that starred Vincent Price as Templar: just before the opening credits begin, a short musical phrase is heard that {{is not part of}} the theme music for the Return of the Saint, but is the character's signature theme from film and radio.|$|R
50|$|All of {{the stories}} feature {{the tension between the}} Culture's humane, anarchist ideals and its need to {{intervene}} in the affairs of less enlightened and often less advanced civilisations. The first Culture novel, Consider Phlebas, describes an episode in the Idiran War, which the Culture's Minds foresaw would cause billions of deaths on both sides, but which their utilitarian calculations predicted would be the best course in the long term. The Idiran War serves as a <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> point in most of the subsequent novels, influencing the Culture's development for centuries and dividing its residents—both humanoids and AI Minds—along the pacifist and interventionist ideals.|$|R

40|$|Throughout the {{discourse}} of modern philosophy, the problematic relationship between thought and history has been a recurring theme. Tensions between historicist and ahistoricist conceptions of philosophy continue to pervade the debate. In October 2003 an international symposium under the title “Thinking in History” was held at Södertörn University College. The symposium gathered a number of philosophical researchers who presented material addressing the general problem of philosophy’s conceptualisation of its historical situatedness. Most of the essays presented in this volume originate from this symposium. Several contributions stem from the phenomenological tradition, particularly from the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. Friedrich Nietzsche is also a <b>recurring</b> <b>reference.</b> In addition, the volume contains essays relating to Spinoza’s, Castoriadis’ and the Kyoto School’s varied understanding of history...|$|R
5000|$|The {{custom of}} serving bread {{and salt to}} guests is a <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> in George R. R.

Violating the guest right is widely considered among the highest moral crimes, an affront worthy of the worst damnation, rivaled only by kinslaying. While this is not as present on the HBO show Game of Thrones based on the book series, it is prominently featured during an event called the [...] "Red Wedding", which involves a violation of this sacred guest right.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{delivers}} {{most of its}} {{stories in}} a humorous manner, mainly about certain celebrities, and features tongue-in-cheek jokes and double entendres, though more serious entertainment stories (such as a breaking entertainment story or celebrity death) - which appear on the program sparingly - often warrant a serious tone. Pieces often feature archived clips from television series and movies often for comedic effect, though they may sometimes be used to reference a project that an entertainer is known for performing in. Many pieces are shown in the [...] "man on the street"-type question and answer format synonymous with paparazzi, though some celebrities do not answer certain questions asked {{to them by the}} videographer; a common <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> within the program is how certain TMZ videographers sometimes ask extremely trivial or bad questions to their subject.|$|R

[...] ‘Wings of Love’ was immortalised on the Ogdens' wall in Coronation Street and the painting also achieved cult status by its appearance in Mike Leigh's 1977 film Abigail's Party. [...] In Abigail’s Party, the painting provokes a heated debate {{on the nature of}} [...] "erotic art", culminating in Alison Steadman's husband dropping dead of a heart attack.

50|$|Hancock {{received}} a BFA from Texas A&M University-Commerce. As an undergrad Doyle {{worked as a}} cartoonist for his school newspaper. At {{the time he thought}} he would become a professional cartoonist following graduation. The influence of Hancock's early interest in cartoons is still visible in his current work. Following his studies at Texas A&M University-Commerce Hancock earned a MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, Philadelphia. Hancock's art was also significantly influenced by his upbringing in the town of Paris, Texas. Church was a fundamental focal point of his childhood, as his stepfather was a minister. Thus, religious tropes and themes are abundant in his works, such as <b>recurring</b> <b>references</b> to redemption and the Eucharist.|$|E

40|$|For {{proponents of}} the view that {{anthropogenic}} climate change will become a ‘threat multiplier’ for instability in the decades ahead, the Syrian civil war has become a <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> point, providing apparently compelling evidence that such conflict effects are already with us. According to this view, human-induced climatic change was a contributory factor in the extreme drought experienced within Syria prior to its civil war; this drought in turn led to large-scale migration; and this migration in turn exacerbated the socio-economic stresses that underpinned Syria’s descent into war. This article provides a systematic interrogation of these claims, and finds little merit to them. Amongst other things it shows {{that there is no}} clear and reliable evidence that anthropogenic climate change was a factor in Syria’s pre-civil war drought; that this drought did not cause anywhere near the scale of migration that is often alleged; and that there exists no solid evidence that drought migration pressures in Syria contributed to civil war onset. The Syria case, the article finds, does not support ‘threat multiplier’ views of the impacts of climate change; to the contrary, we conclude, policymakers, commentators and scholars alike should exercise far greater caution when drawing such linkages or when securitising climate change...|$|R

40|$|Most cabbies would {{confirm that}} 'Australia has little history'. This is remarkable; {{how can one}} explain this often {{repeated}} trope? While having 'little' history should be understood {{in the sense that}} Australia has a short chronology (as dialogically opposed to 'Old Europe', for example), this refrain could also be understood as a way of expressing a perception that Australia is, relatively speaking, an especially 'historyless' society. This article understands a <b>recurring</b> <b>reference</b> to a lack of a 'dense' past as one discursive feature related to a number of specific constraints typical of settler colonial ideological formations. Perceiving a lack of history, a lack of conflict, and a classless circumstance are related. As well as historyless (and despite contradicting evidence) Australia has a long tradition of being routinely represented as an exceptionally egalitarian and classless society (again, as dialogically opposed to 'Old England'). A classless political order would be characterised by a lack of conflict that would in turn produce no history. This article interprets this claim as another discursive feature typical of settler colonial rhetorical traditions. Mythologies about egalitarian societies inhabiting 'quiet' continents, and the reality of underdeveloped historiographies are related to the long lasting resilience of a settler colonial consciousness. The first section of this article outlines an approach to the historical consciousness of settler colonial political traditions; the second section focuses on Australian historiographies...|$|R
