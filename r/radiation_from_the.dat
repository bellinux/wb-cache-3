5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice.

5|$|In 1932, as a {{graduate}} student at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E

5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. <b>Radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe.

5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion.

5|$|Ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun breaks water {{molecules}} apart, {{reducing the amount}} of water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case of}} M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy is no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E

5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> star it orbits (in this case, {{changes in the}} apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
