40|$|Abstract — Voltage {{stability}} {{problems have}} been one of the major concerns for electric power utilities due to increased interconnections and loading of the present day power systems. The accurate representation of the voltage instability phenomena requires a detailed model of power system components (generators, transformers, loads, etc.). On the other hand, reactive power generation limits have a significant effect on voltage collapse. In general, the system equations change non-smoothly when these limits are encountered. This paper presents a continuation-based method to steady-state voltage stability analysis that considered complete model of power system and the automatic voltage <b>regulator</b> (AVR) <b>output</b> voltage limits that indirectly control the reactive power generation limits. Results are provided for the New England 39 -bus power system model.

40|$|Taming linear-regulator inrush {{currents}} Many older linear regulators and some regulators {{specifically designed for}} fast start-up require signif-icant inrush current at start-up to charge their output capac itors and to provide current to their resistive loads. The relation ship IInrush = COUT × VOUT/tRise predicts the regulator’s required input current at start-up for a given rise time, tRise, where COUT is the <b>regulator’s</b> <b>output</b> capacitance. With no inrush-control (commonly called “soft-start”) circuitry, IInrush is clamped to the regulator’s current limit, which is typically {{significantly higher than the}} regulator’s rated current. If the input power supply is current-limited or connected by long inductive traces, the voltage at the regulator’s input will droop, possibly below that of the regulator’s under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. Figure 1 illustrates how this causes the regulator to “stair step ” or ratchet its way up to regulation, shutting down momentarily while the input capacitor recharges, then starting up again. In the past, start-up problems were common for linear regulators and can still occur when the output capacitance seen by the regulator is large. End-equipment designers need to take into account how linear regulators handle inrush current, especially if the selected regulator has no inrush-current control other than clamping to its current limit. Additional circuitry can be configured to manage inrush current for any regulator or converter. Simply by adding a FET and some passive elements following the <b>regulator’s</b> or converter’s <b>output</b> voltage, the designer can shape the FET’s turn-on characteristic and the output-voltage wave-form.
