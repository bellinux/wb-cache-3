500|$|Lockheed Have Blue was {{the code}} name for Lockheed's {{demonstrator}} (i.e., [...] "proof of concept") {{that preceded the}} F-117 Nighthawk production stealth aircraft. Have Blue was designed by Lockheed's Skunk Works division, and tested at Groom Lake, Nevada. The Have Blue was the first fixed-wing aircraft whose external shape was defined by <b>radar</b> <b>engineering</b> rather than by aerospace engineering. The aircraft's plate-like, faceted shape was designed to deflect electromagnetic waves in directions other {{than that of the}} originating radar emitter, greatly reducing its radar cross-section. Two flyable vehicles were constructed, but both crashed during the flight-test program.|$|E

50|$|Important {{mathematical}} expressions for {{relations between}} physical characteristics of stimuli and subjective perception are Weber's law (which is now sometimes called Weber-Fechner Law), Ekman's Law, Stevens' Power Law, Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment, the Theory of Signal Detection (borrowed from <b>radar</b> <b>engineering),</b> the Matching Law, and Rescorla-Wagner rule for classical conditioning. While {{the first three}} laws are all deterministic in nature, later established relations are more fundamentally stochastic.

This results in an ideal 'thumbtack' auto-ambiguity function, making the arrays useful in applications such as sonar and radar.

30|$|Sensor array signal {{processing}} {{has played a}} significant role in many diverse application areas, including sonar, <b>radar,</b> audio <b>engineering,</b> and wireless communication [1]. As an important topic in sensor array {{signal processing}}, superdirectivity has received considerable attention for decades [2 – 6], because it can provide a significant potential for sensor arrays to enhance their performance, such as in terms of angular resolution, bearing estimation accuracy, noise suppression ability, and reduction of array aperture. A wideband constant beamwidth and shortened near-field zone can also be conveniently obtained. However, open problems concerning superdirectivity exist in error sensitivity or performance robustness. Although the robustness problem is inevitable for superdirective arrays, this requires an in-depth study to determine a mechanism to decrease the effect of errors as much as possible.|$|R
