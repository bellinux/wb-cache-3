5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion,</b> with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E

25|$|The road {{project was}} {{proposed}} in 1999 by then Premier Jeff Kennett, but gained prominence {{when it became}} one of the chief recommendations of the 2008 East-West Link Needs Assessment report, which warned that steady growth in port freight and population growth was rapidly taking Melbourne roads to capacity. The report's author, Sir Rod Eddington, said an alternative river crossing was also imperative to lessen the city's dependence on the West Gate Bridge, while an additional east-west link was needed to the city's north because of capacity constraints on the congested Monash-CityLink-West Gate corridor. Eddington said the benefits for the city included <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion</b> on Hoddle Street, reducing east-west rat running through suburban streets, assisting north-south traffic flows including public transport, and improving accessibility to city jobs for western suburbs residents.|$|E
25|$|One {{proposal}} for a change was made in 1915 by Thomas Kennard Thomson, an engineer from Buffalo, New York who settled in New York City after making a career in Canada and the United States as a bridge and railway engineer. Thompson opened an office in New York in 1893 which concentrated on the foundations of skyscrapers and underwater caissons used for building bridges. He {{was involved in the}} construction of the Singer Tower, the Manhattan Municipal Building and the Mutual Life Building. His 1915 plan was aimed at <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion</b> at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Thompson proposed to run 42nd Street under Fifth Avenue, and to add a mid-block street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues from 42nd to 43rd Streets to permit the turns that the tunneling would prevent. Why this plan would not simply shift the congestion to the new mid-block connector is not clear. In modern actions to relieve congestion, changes are generally made within the existing right-of-way, therefore without the need to condemn and purchase very expensive Manhattan property.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War, a series of {{preliminary}} plans for <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion</b> on the London Underground had considered various east-west routes through the Aldwych area, although other priorities meant that these were never proceeded with. In March 1965, a British Rail and London Transport joint planning committee published [...] "A Railway Plan for London", which proposed a new tube railway, the Fleet line (later renamed the Jubilee line), to join the Bakerloo line at [...] then run via , , , Aldwych and into the City of London via , [...] and [...] before heading into south-east London. An interchange was proposed at Aldwych and a second recommendation of the report was {{the revival of the}} link from Aldwych to Waterloo. London Transport had already sought parliamentary approval to construct tunnels from Aldwych to Waterloo in November 1964, and in August 1965, parliamentary powers were granted. Detailed planning took place, although public spending cuts led to postponement of the scheme in 1967 before tenders were invited.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Congestion is {{observed}} {{due to lack}} of coordination between generation and transmission system. In order to <b>relieve</b> <b>congestion,</b> congestion management is done by the application of FACTS devices which will reduce the cost and hence reduce the power losses. In this paper, the application of Unified power flow controller (UPFC) to <b>relieve</b> <b>congestion</b> has been studied. A sensitivity based analysis has been done for optimal location of UPFC in a deregulated environment. Results had been done on IEEE 5 bus system with and without UPFC to demonstrate the feasibility as well as effectiveness of UPFC to <b>relieve</b> <b>congestion</b> in a network using MATLAB. The results obtained after using UPFC to improve system reactive power losses and hence congestion management is improved. Keywords- Congestion management, Deregulated powe...|$|R

500|$|In November 1898 the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN) was {{announced}} as a tube railway, {{to run from}} Wood Green to Stanhope Street, north of the Strand. The GN was backed by the Great Northern Railway (GNR), the main line railway operating from King's Cross station. [...] The GNR saw the new company {{as a means of}} <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion</b> on its route. The GN was to run beneath the GNR's main line from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) to Finsbury Park station. It was then planned to run south-west through Holloway to King's Cross, and then south to Bloomsbury and Holborn. Intermediate stations were planned at the GNR's Hornsey, Harringay and Finsbury Park stations, and at Holloway, York Road, King's Cross, Russell Square and Holborn. A power station was planned next to the GNR's tracks at Gillespie Road. When the London County Council planned the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, Stanhope Street was scheduled for demolition so the southern terminus was relocated to the junction of the two new roads. The bill was enacted on 1 August 1899 as the [...] Great Northern and Strand Railway Act, 1899.|$|E
2500|$|The Dalton Highway in Alaska {{was built}} in 1974 to allow {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. It runs [...] from near Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean. Rather than <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion,</b> the highway was built to allow access to the previously-inaccessible Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. Until 1995, permits were required to drive on the highway. Currently, it {{is owned by the}} state of Alaska and open to the public.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extension}} {{was originally}} proposed in a 1960 traffic study, {{with the aim}} of <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion</b> on the Gulf Freeway. [...] The recommended alignment followed Harrisburg Boulevard through a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood. In 1962, TxDOT agreed to build interchanges for the proposed freeway at Interstate 610 and the terminus at US 59 (the planned western terminus is located east of present-day Minute Maid Park). [...] In 1969, after delaying for several years due to a backlog in freeway construction, the Texas Transportation Commission put the Harrisburg Freeway in the state highway system.|$|E

2500|$|South of 14th Street, {{there were}} two {{possible}} options to decide between. Option A would continue the subway beneath Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan. Option B would connect the new subway to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street {{to provide access to}} Lower Manhattan. This option has been proposed as part of plans for the Second Avenue Subway from the 1940s and 1950s. Cross-platform transfers would be available at Canal Street and Chambers Street to the Nassau Street Line routes. It would allow Second Avenue trains to have access to Brooklyn using the underutilized Montague Street Tunnel. This option would have a lower cost than the Water Street option as less tunnel would need to be constructed. The Nassau option would attract more riders to the subway system because of additional service to Brooklyn, but the Water Street option would provide greater coverage in Manhattan and would be better at <b>relieving</b> <b>congestion</b> on the Lexington Avenue Line. Because the platforms on the BMT Eastern Division are shorter than those {{on the rest of the}} B Division, those on the Nassau Street Line south of Chambers Street would have to be lengthened by about , to a total of [...] The tracks would have to be reconfigured, the passenger circulation capacity would have to be increased, and the service plan south of Chambers Street would have to be modified, to provide sufficient capacity to accommodate the additional trains that Second Avenue Subway service would require. The Nassau Street Line connection would have run through a new tunnel that first turns to the east to align under Forsyth Street before turning west and joining the Nassau Street Line along Kenmare Street.|$|E
