50|$|The Shanghai {{branch of}} Chartered bank began {{operation}} in August 1858. Initially, the bank's business dealt specifically with large volume discounting and <b>re-discounting</b> of opium and cotton bills. Although {{there was a}} gradual rise in opium cultivation in China, the imports of opium still increased from 50,087 picul in 1863 to 82,61 picul by 1888. Transactions in the opium trade generated substantial profits for Chartered bank. Later, the Chartered Bank also {{became one of the}} principal foreign banknote-issuing institutions in Shanghai.|$|E

50|$|When the {{commercial}} bank for instance, has lent or invested all its available funds and {{has little or}} no cash over and above the prescribed minimum, it may ask the central bank for funds. It may either <b>re-discount</b> some of its bills with the central bank or it may borrow from the central bank against the collateral of its own promissory notes.|$|R
50|$|The main {{monetary}} policy instruments available to central banks are open market operation, bank reserve requirement, interest rate policy, re-lending and <b>re-discount</b> (including {{using the term}} repurchase market), and credit policy (often coordinated with trade policy). While capital adequacy is important, it is defined and regulated by the Bank for International Settlements, and central banks in practice generally do not apply stricter rules.|$|R
40|$|Having as {{starting}} point Radu Stoenescuâ€™s book {{with respect to}} discount, and the difficulty in defining discount, we pursue to clarify this category and other associated ones, such as reference rate, discount rate, <b>re-discount</b> and its rate, in a historical and actual approach. The purpose is {{to demonstrate that the}} monetary policy about discount influences the economic policies and that is why it must be altered and guided in accordance with the changes of current economic-financial activity. economic policies, discount, monetary policy...|$|R
5000|$|The FED {{district}} {{bank was}} given the option to enforce or deny the provision. In FED districts that accepted progressive rates, each member bank was given {{a line of credit}} or normal <b>re-discount.</b> This measure helped the banks with the difficult transition from wartime to peacetime. It bought member banks time to reorganize and renegotiate loans given to large defense contracting firms that would no longer be manufacturing high priced war munitions and material meant for sale to the government. With the government no longer purchasing, major firms would no longer {{be in a position to}} pay back large loans, and thus the banks that had lent them money to finance heavy production needed Federal assistance.|$|R
5000|$|The Trapped Equity Theory {{explains}} {{the application of}} cash flows that is freed up and {{in excess of the}} company's requirements arising from the over subscription of its shares during a public offer. According to the theory, such 'trapped' excess funds could be invested to guarantee an increase in market value to shareholders over and above their wealth would increase if the 'surplus' funds were to be returned to them. [...] Legally, the law stipulates that all surplus funds arising from over subscription of shares must be returned to the applicant and specifies sanctions for contraventions. According to the applicable law, any delay in the return of these funds must attract interest above the Central bank's <b>re-discount</b> rate.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of monetary policy development on equity prices in the Nigerian Stock Exchange Market using annual data from 1985 to 2010. The ordinary least square regression (OLS) was run using five monetary policy variables including minimum <b>re-discount</b> rate, treasury bill rate, interest rate, exchange rate and consumer price index (proxy for inflation) on the equity prices (proxied by all share price index). The first investigation {{of this study is}} that minimum rediscount rates and Treasury bill rates are highly correlated and cannot be applied simultaneously in monetary policy management. As a consequence, the Treasury bill rates were dropped in the course of further analysis. The general result of the analysis showed a weak correlation between monetary policy and equity prices. This reflected in the explanatory variables which accounted only 15. 6 % in the changes of equity prices in Nigeria. All the explanatory variables are negatively and insignificantly related to equity prices, except the consumer price index that has insignificant positive relationship with equity prices. The study has revealed that monetary policy has not made significant influence over the prices of ordinary equities in Nigeria. What this means is that the equitie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a disequilibrium {{model of}} credit {{supply and demand}} to evaluate the relative role of these factors in the slowdown of credit flows in the Jordanian economy {{in the wake of}} the global financial crisis. The empirical analysis suggests that the credit stagnation is mainly driven by the restricted credit supply amid tighter monetary policy conditions in Jordan relative to the United States, as evidenced by the widened interest differential between the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) <b>re-discount</b> and the U. S. Federal Reserve funds rates. Although it appears that demand side factors related to the slowdown of economic activity have also had an impact, their role has been relatively modest. The estimation results imply that economic policies targeted towards stimulating supply of credit are likely to be a more effective tool for expanding credit flows relative to demand stimulating policies.
