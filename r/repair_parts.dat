5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E

25|$|LGE did not {{challenge}} {{the claim that}} the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as <b>repair</b> <b>parts,</b> or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.|$|E

500|$|After {{reviewing}} a {{study of}} the overall infiltration threat, MACV requested additional aircraft and patrol vessels for Operation Market Time. A request for an additional division of Point-class cutters to be added to Squadron One was made on 5 August 1965 and preparations for deploying the additional cutters started in late October with the new division of nine patrol boats to be named Division 13. The staff and repair personnel arrived at Subic Bay 14 December 1965 while the division's boat crews received weapons and undertook survival training in California. The crews started arriving at Subic Bay on 28 December where additional survival and weapons training was given. Twenty-one of the division's personnel were sent to Divisions 11 and 12 to be exchanged for crewmen who had Market Time experience. Division 13 cutters began arriving as deck cargo on transport ships at Subic Bay on 24 January 1966 and crews commenced outfitting and painting them deck gray. Some of the outfitting had been accomplished before shipment so that more time could be devoted to training crews in gunnery and procedure before the division's scheduled departure for Vietnam on 18 February. During a training exercise on 13 February, the main engine alarm sounded on the bridge of [...] After checking the cause of the alarm, it was determined that a complete overhaul of one of the engines would be required. Division 12 shipped a complete kit of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> from Da Nang overnight by way of a U.S. Marine Corps C-130 flight to Cubi Point Naval Air Station.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{determine}} the fatigue strength of a main girder web connected to a lateral girder flange, which had been repaired using the bolting-stop-hole method with attached steel plates, fatigue tests were performed on several girder specimens. In addition, fatigue tests were carried out on small-scale plate specimens modeling the <b>repaired</b> <b>parts</b> in order to investigate the fatigue crack origin and their fatigue strength. The effectiveness of the repair method was also evaluated using fatigue tests and compared with the stop-hole and the bolting-stop-hole method. It was confirmed that the fatigue strength of the <b>repaired</b> <b>parts</b> was considerably higher than that of as-welded joints and the fatigue strength was almost equal to that of the friction type of high strength bolted connections...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{function}} in the proper management of <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories is the forecasting of future demand. The Navy maintains a database of univariate demand data for its <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories using a quarterly time interval. Historically, Navy <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> demand forecasting has been done using the exponential smoothing procedure. This method is a simple and robust means of forecasting, however {{it does not make}} use of any characteristics of the entire time series such as trend, cycles, presence of outliers, or demand clustering. This research begins by developing several simple, robust, and dimensionless time series features. These features are used to predict the suitability of Box- Jenkins (ARIMA) modeling. The ARIMA process is a powerful time series modeling and forecasting technique which possesses flexibility for the inclusion of many time series characteristics. This research project develops a predictive model of ARIMA suitability using both classical regression and a modem expert-system statistical package, ModelQuest. A computationally simple means is presented for determining which time series may benefit from the Box 4 enkins methodology. Using ARIMA modeling for time series that show significant benefit will provide a more accurate demand forecast and benefit inventory management. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|R

2500|$|The United States {{has imposed}} an arms ban {{and an almost}} total {{economic}} embargo on Iran, which includes sanctions on companies doing business with Iran, a ban on all Iranian-origin imports, sanctions on Iranian financial institutions, and an almost total ban on selling aircraft or <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> to Iranian aviation companies. A license from the Treasury Department is required {{to do business with}} Iran. In June 2011, the United States imposed sanctions against Iran Air and Tidewater Middle East Co. (which runs seven Iranian ports), stating that Iran Air had provided material support to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is already subject to UN sanctions, that Tidewater Middle East is owned by the IRGC, and that both have been involved in activities including illegal weapons transportation. The U.S. has also begun to designate a number of senior Iranian officials under the Iranian Human Rights Abuses Sanctions Regulations. On 14 December 2011, the U.S. Department of Treasury designated Hassan Firouzabadi and Abdollah Araqi under this sanctions program. In February 2012 the US froze all property of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian financial institutions, {{as well as that of}} the Iranian government, within the United States. The American view is that sanctions should target Iran's energy sector that provides about 80% of government revenues, and try to isolate Iran from the international financial system. On 6 February 2013 the United States government blacklisted major Iranian electronics producers, Internet policing agencies, and the state broadcasting authority, in an effort to lessen restrictions of access to information for the general public.
