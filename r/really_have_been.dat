I love doing dance songs and I think my fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but I <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E
500|$|Barrymore's alcohol {{dependence}} meant most studios {{were unwilling to}} employ him, but MGM risked casting him {{in the role of}} Mercutio in their 1936 film Romeo and Juliet. To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley's Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that [...] "he was drinking and unreliable on the set... It was sad to see him in such a state." [...] Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the Hollywood Spectator, thought [...] "Barrymore is an acting gem", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that [...] "Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben's unclear motives {{have led}} to {{speculation}} about his possible status as a villain. Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the good guy all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when he does, it is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and doing whatever is necessary to protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. He always has a plan and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E

500|$|A planned film {{adaption}} of Year Zero {{became a}} television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched {{the idea to}} television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is [...] "still churning along", {{and that he had}} begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was [...] "currently in a holding state" [...] and explained, [...] "We [...] didn't find the right match with a writer, and <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves. [...] This project {{means a lot to me}} and will see the light of day in one form or another." [...] In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP Add Violence, Reznor said that [...] "They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have just done it [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{record is}} highly {{regarded}} {{among the members}} of U2. Mullen said, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." [...] Bono called the album a [...] "pivot point" [...] in the band's career, saying, [...] "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're still here now." [...] Clayton concurred, saying, [...] "If we hadn't done something we were excited about, that made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened." [...] The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by [...] "set themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs, writing that the album helped U2 avoid [...] "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions". AllMusic called the album [...] "a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor". A 2010 retrospective by Spin said that [...] "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with Achtung Baby." ...|$|E

2500|$|Children {{who were}} exposed to crack prenatally faced social stigma as babies and school-aged children; some experts say that the [...] "crack baby" [...] stigma was more harmful than the PCE. Teachers were {{affected}} by these cultural stereotypes; such biases may have negatively affected the educational experiences of children thus stigmatized. Teachers who knew that specific children had been exposed to crack in utero may have expected these children to be disruptive and developmentally delayed. Children who {{were exposed to}} cocaine might be teased by others who knew of the exposure, and problems these children had might be misdiagnosed by doctors or others as resulting from PCE when they may <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> due to factors like illness or abuse.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1947, the CPC Politburo {{assigned}} Kang {{to inspect}} land reform {{in his home}} province of Shandong. [...] Early in 1948, he was appointed deputy chief of the Party's East China Bureau, under Rao Shushi. [...] Some commentators speculate that the private humiliation of being placed under a former subordinate {{may be one reason}} why Kang [...] "fell ill" [...] and largely disappeared from view until after Rao's fall in 1954. [...] Of course, Kang may <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ill. [...] Mao's personal physician, Li Zhisui, later recorded that doctors responsible for Kang's treatment at Beijing Hospital told him that Kang was suffering from schizophrenia. [...] Writing before Li's book was published, Byron and Pack offered other possible diagnoses based on symptoms Kang seems to have displayed, including manic-depressive psychosis and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
2500|$|The neat {{parallel}} rows of corn {{produced by}} Jethro Tull's revolutionary and controversial seed drill {{show that this}} is a thoroughly modern and efficient farm. Robert was a keen farmer, whose letter in 1768 to the agriculturalist Arthur Young [...] "On the Smut in Wheat" [...] was published in Young's Annals of Agriculture. As such details are not typical of Gainsborough's landscapes, but rather anticipate the work of John Constable who was born nearby some 25 years later, it seems likely that they were Robert Andrews's idea. In fact the whole wheat field has been brought far closer to the house than would <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the case; it is [...] "invented, or transposed from further away. If read literally, the sheaves of corn would be thrusting through the porch of Auberies itself".|$|E

2500|$|It {{was only}} from 9 January 1970, when the Supreme Court of Judicature Act came into force, that Singapore {{established}} its own Supreme Court, {{consisting of a}} Court of Appeal, Court of Criminal Appeal and High Court. In moving the Second Reading of the Bill in Parliament, the then Minister for Law and National Development, Mr. E.W. Barker, noted that [...] "the Supreme Court of Judicature Bill ... as its very name suggests, provides a proper basis for the administration of justice in our courts which should <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> introduced soon after we left Malaysia. Unfortunately, the many and varied problems which we {{had to deal with}} upon leaving Malaysia had forced us to continue with the existing system of administration of justice until the present day. All that the Bill purports to do is to set out logically the consequences that flow from our becoming independent on our own with an independent system of administration of justice separate from the system that was introduced to us while we were part of Malaysia ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eiji Yoshida {{recorded}} {{the title of}} another print in the Fujo Ninsō Juppin series, Kasō no Bijin no Hanshin Zu ( [...] , [...] "Half-length picture of lower-class beauty"), in the last volume of Ukiyo-e Jiten, but no details of its composition are known. [...] Yoshida also noted that a catalogue from 1915 for the [...] trading company lists a Chawan o Noseta Chataku o Motsu Onna ( [...] , [...] "Woman holding a saucer with a teacup on it") from the Fujin Sōgaku Jittai series. [...] As these prints cannot be confirmed, there remains {{the possibility that the}} series remained unfinished after the publication of the eight known prints. [...] Yoshida suggests there may <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> two series: Fujo Ninsō Juppin was left incomplete after five prints, and Fujin Sōgaku Jittai followed but was also left complete. [...] Yoshida bases this assumption on the fact that, even if the series name ahd changed, {{there was no reason for}} Utamaro to change his signature from [...] in the one to [...] in the other (both read [...] and have the same meaning).|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, {{a couple}} from Los Angeles, Matthew and Grace Huang, moved to Doha, in Qatar, where Matthew, an engineer, {{was working on}} a {{long-term}} project. The Huangs had three adopted African-born black children. On January 15, 2013, one of these children, the Huangs’ eight-year-old daughter, Gloria, died suddenly. Officials arrested Matthew and Grace the following day and subsequently charged them with murdering Gloria, on the theory that the couple must have had some nefarious purpose (perhaps organ harvesting) for adopting Gloria in the first place, as she was black and therefore could not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wanted (they argued) by the Huangs. Ultimately, although the prosecution presented no substantial case (medical evidence showed that Gloria had not died of starvation – indeed, the autopsy failed to establish cause of death – and no other evidence of abuse surfaced), the couple were convicted on a lesser charge of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. Even so, the prosecution still wanted to charge them with the more serious offense of child trafficking. Representatives of the Huangs created a YouTube video to plead their case, in which Brooks is filmed saying, [...] "In my 25 years of practicing criminal law, I have never seen as outrageous a prosecution theory as there is in this case" [...] and [...] "this case completely lacks any type of due process." [...] In November, 2014, the Huangs' convictions were reversed by the Qatari Appeals Court and they were found innocent; they returned to Los Angeles on December 3.|$|E
