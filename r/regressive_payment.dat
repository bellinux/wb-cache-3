40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis concerns proceedings {{dealing with}} regressive compensations in health insurance, that {{is guided by}} law No. 187 / 2006 Coll. about health insurance. The regressive compensation as such takes place when a certain person causes, by his or hers unlawful action, as found by court or other authority, a reason for amount of compensation to another person and is obliged to reimburse the health insurance institution by a prescribed amount. Most often this {{is a result of}} traffic accidents, less frequently as a result of physical attacks or fights. The amount that is prescribed as a reimbursement is determined by the actual compensation paid. Together with proceedings about being ordered to pay this regressive compensation, there are other preceedings also concerning regressive compensations, such as pardoning of this <b>regressive</b> <b>payment</b> in which it has been decide for the benefit of concerned person only for reasons defined by law, such as immediate danger of his malnourishment. Also, the proceedings may start about the person being allowed to pay by instalments. This may permit the person to pay a certain amounts at certain conditions as prescribed by the decision. The law also permits cancellation of this insatllment payments option, when the agreed upon conditions are not met. This is a relatively new system that is relatively welcomed by the organs of health insurance, mainly because of the recovery of a certain amount that had been previously wrongly paid. This work is divided into five chapters, dealing with individual components concerning regressive compensation and their relevant proceedings. The first chapter of this work is focused on general information cocerning health insurance. It is divided at several subchapters, dealing with law status, basic principles, subjects of health insurance, group of insured persons, institutional security and a very important subchapter, which is important just for determination of regressive compensations, such as the amount of health insurance and tied to it, the health status determined by an involved physician or medical adjudicating comission. The second chapter deals with proceedings about regressive compensations in health insurance, description of its various stages, such as the commencement, pausing and stopping of the procedure, including the issuance of the decisision and eventual appelation. Included is also a basic information about the pinciples and subjects of these proceedings. Tied to this are the relevant rules and processes that are part of lawful relationships in health insurance, being governed by law No. 500 / 2005 Coll. about administrative rule, unless set by later rules No. 187 / 2006 Coll. about health insurance, otherwise. The result of these proceedings is the issuance of the decision, including the entitlement and the amount. The third chapter analyses various types of regressive compensations, such as the pardoning of the regressive compensation, allowing to pay by installments and cancellation of this option. The fourth chapter gives the statistical survey about the development of regressive compensations since their establishment on Jannuary 1, 2009, when the determination ยง 126 was created. Statistical tables show numerical data about the number of issued decisions and the amounts of compensations in each individual year. The fifth and final chapter contains the closing comments on the topic and suggests possible improvements of practical usage. The aim of this thesis is the analysis and the clearest possible description and definition of the valid law modification, focused on regressive compensations in health insurance, so that it, together with the literature cited, could serve as a source of information, or improve the orientation of eventual direct or indirect participants of these proceedings...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to use time series {{analysis}} methods to examine the impact on cases of ambulatory care, claims of ambulatory care and the grand total of medical claims when co-payment and <b>regressive</b> physician <b>payment</b> policies were implemented. Methods: Based on the data from the NHI from Mar. 1995 to Dec. 2001, time series models were used to formulate the time series. Results: By selecting the appropriate time series models, the R squares of these models were over 90 percent except for the model of ambulatory care cases. The two interventions including co-payment and <b>regressive</b> physician <b>payment</b> policy were used in the intervention models. The result showed that co-payment intervention had a delayed effect of one month. Conclusions: The results were similar with that of existing papers in terms of descriptive analyses. The outcomes of our models were also reliable in the point estimation in the forecast of 2002 expenditure. The outcome of intervention models found that <b>regressive</b> physician <b>payment</b> policy had a greater impact than the co-payment policy in the month when the policy was implemented, but the predication of one year using the time series models produced different results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a ten-country comparative study of health care financing systems and their progressivity characteristics. It distinguishes between the tax-financed systems of Denmark, Portugal and the U. K., the social insurance systems of France, the Netherlands and Spain, and the predominantly private systems of Switzerland and the U. S. It concludes that tax-financed systems tend to be proportional or mildly progressive, that social insurance systems are regressive and that private systems are even more <b>regressive.</b> Out-of-pocket <b>payments</b> are in most countries an especially regressive means of raising health care revenues...|$|R
40|$|In {{its latest}} World Health Report, The World Health Organization (WHO) {{argues that a}} key {{dimension}} of a health system's performance is the fairness of its financing system. The report discusses how policymakers can improve this aspect of performance, proposes an index of fairness, discusses {{how it should be}} put into operation, and presents a league table of countries, ranked by fairness with which their health services are financed. The author shows that the WHO index cannot discriminate between health financing systems that are regressive, and those that are progressive - and cannot discriminate between horizontal inequity, and progressiveness, or regressiveness. The index cannot tell policymakers whether it deviates from 1 (complete fairness) because households with similar incomes spend different amounts on health care (horizontal inequity), or because households with different incomes spend different proportions of their income on health care (vertical inequity, given the WHO's interpretation of the ability-to-pay principle) - although the two have different policy implications. With the WHO's index, progressiveness, and regressiveness are both treated as unfair. This makes no sense, because policymakers who may be strongly averse to <b>regressive</b> <b>payments</b> (which worsen income distribution) may in the name of fairness be quite receptive to progressive payments (requiring that the better-off, who may be willing to spend proportionately more on health care, are required to pay proportionately more). The author compares the WHO index with an alternative, and more illuminating approach developed in the income redistribution literature in the early 1990 s, and used in the late 1990 s, to study the fairness of various OECD health care financing systems. He illustrates the differences between the approaches with an empirical comparison, using data on out-of-pocket payments for health services in Vietnam for 1993 and 1998. This analysis is of some interest in its own right, given the large share of health spending from out-of-pocket payments in Vietnam, and the changes in fees, and drug prices over the 1990 s. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Financial {{protection}} against the cost of unforeseen ill health has become a global concern as expressed in the 2005 World Health Assembly resolution (WHA 58. 33), which urges its member states to "plan the transition to universal coverage of their citizens". An important element of financial risk protection is to distribute health care financing fairly in relation to ability to pay. The distribution of health care financing burden across socio-economic groups has been estimated for European countries, the USA and Asia. Until recently {{there was no such}} analysis in Africa and this paper seeks to contribute to filling this gap. It presents the first comprehensive analysis of the distribution of health care financing in relation to ability to pay in Ghana. Methods Secondary data from the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS) 2005 / 2006 were used. This was triangulated with data from the Ministry of Finance and other relevant sources, and further complemented with primary household data collected in six districts. We implored standard methodologies (including Kakwani index and test for dominance) for assessing progressivity in health care financing in this paper. Results Ghana's health care financing system is generally progressive. The progressivity of health financing is driven largely by the overall progressivity of taxes, which account for close to 50 % of health care funding. The national health insurance (NHI) levy (part of VAT) is mildly progressive and formal sector NHI payroll deductions are also progressive. However, informal sector NHI contributions were found to be <b>regressive.</b> Out-of-pocket <b>payments,</b> which account for 45 % of funding, are regressive form of health payment to households. Conclusion For Ghana to attain adequate financial risk protection and ultimately achieve universal coverage, it needs to extend pre-payment cover to all in the informal sector, possibly through funding their contributions entirely from tax, and address other issues affecting the expansion of the National Health Insurance. Furthermore, the pre-payment funding pool for health care needs to grow so budgetary allocation to the health sector can be enhanced. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies {{concentration}} {{curves and}} indices, {{that have been}} previously used to analyze progressivity in health care finance and horizontal equity in health care delivery in developed countries, to a 1998 - 1999 household survey about health care expenditures and utilization carried out in four francophone West African capitals (Abidjan, Bamako, Conakry and Dakar). The paper also uses statistical inference for testing stochastic dominance relationship between curves, a technique already applied in the literature about equity in taxation, as the criterion for making rigorous inequality comparisons. In all four capitals, the results strongly suggest a <b>regressive</b> pattern of <b>payments</b> for health care, with lower income groups bearing an higher burden of health expenditures {{as a proportion of}} their income than do the higher income segments of the population. As soon as dominance between concentrations curves is statistically tested, results appear less conclusive, notably for the groups of population affected by severe morbidity, on the issue of horizontal inequity in health care delivery, which requires that persons with similar medical need be treated equally. Some recommendations are made for the use of equity measurements in access to care for future evaluations of the impact of health care reforms in Africa.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Financial risk {{protection}} against the cost of unforeseen ill health has become a global concern as expressed in the 2005 World Health Assembly resolution (WHA 58. 33), which urges its member states to "plan the transition to universal coverage of their citizens". The study (the first of kind in Ghana) measured the relative progressivity of health care financing mechanisms, the catastrophic and impoverishment effect of direct health care payments, as well as evaluating the factors affecting enrolment in the national health insurance scheme (NHIS), which is the intended means for achieving equitable health financing and universal coverage in Ghana. To achieve {{the purpose of the}} study, secondary data from the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS) 2005 / 2006 were used. This was triangulated with data from the Ministry of Finance and other ministries and departments, and further complemented with primary household data collected in six districts. In addition 44 focus group discussions with different groups of people and communities were conducted. In-depth interviews were also conducted with six managers of District NHI schemes as well as the NHIS headquarters. The study found that generally Ghana's health care financing system is progressive. The progressivity of health financing is driven largely by the overall progressivity of taxes which account for over 50 % of health care funding. The national health insurance levy is mildly progressive as indicated by a Kakwani index of 0. 045. However, informal sector NHI contributions were found to be <b>regressive.</b> Out-of-pocket <b>payments,</b> which account for 45 % of funding, are associated with significant catastrophic and impoverishment effects on households. The results also indicate that high premiums, ineffective exemptions, fragmented funding pools and perceived poor quality of care affect the expansion of the NHIS. For Ghana to attain adequate financial protection and ultimately achieve universal coverage, it needs to extend cover to the informal sector, possibly through funding their contributions entirely from tax, and address other issues affecting the expansion of the NHI. Furthermore, the funding pool for health care needs to grow and this can be achieved by improving the efficiency of tax collection and increasing the budgetary allocation to the health sector...|$|R
40|$|Background: In India, the {{foundations}} for a public role in the health sector were set {{at the time of}} her independence in 1947. Like other former colonies emerging from the war, India envisioned heavy state involvement in the provision of health services to all. The private health sector, at the time was limited to a few mission hospitals and some practitioners of Indian systems of medicine. Since then, there has been the steady growth of a heterogeneous, popular private health sector based on fee-for-service payments; so that now 93 % of all hospitals and 85 % of all qualified physicians are in the private sector. Aim: The thesis aims to study private and public health care providers and their characteristics in the province of Madhya Pradesh, India. Associations between provider distribution (both sectors) and social, demographic and economic characteristics of different districts of the province are also studied. The thesis also explores perceptions that policy makers in each health sector (public or private) have towards the other. Methods: In 2004, a survey to map all health care providers serving the 60. 4 million people living in the province s 394 towns and 52117 villages (spread over 304000 sq. km) was done in collaboration with the Department of Public Health and Family Welfare, Government of Madhya Pradesh (Paper I) as part of the development of a management information system in the province. Providers were identified regardless of qualification and responded to a brief questionnaire administered by trained interviewers. The distribution of these providers in the province was analyzed (Papers II and IV). To study associations, background socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were obtained from secondary data sources, including the Census of India, government department records and the Madhya Pradesh Human Development Report. In particular, possible statistical associations between provider density and vulnerable population subgroups (the scheduled castes and tribes) were studied (Paper V). To explore perceptions that policy makers in the public and private health sectors had of each other (in terms of the motivations, kind of clients served, the attitudes of each sector toward the other), in-depth interviews with 16 provincial policy makers in the public and private health sectors were done (Paper III). Results: A total of 263, 309 providers were identified. A typology was developed based on qualification. Of the 24, 807 qualified physicians identified, 19, 176 (77. 3 %) practiced in urban areas (where 26 % of the population resides). Overall, three times as many physicians worked in the private sector as in the public sector. Private and public physicians were more densely (12 times and 3 times respectively) located in urban than in rural areas. Only 12. 8 % of qualified physicians practicing solo in the province were women. Access to women physicians was lower in the less-urban districts. In the case of the 94, 019 qualified nondoctors (70 % private), 67, 153 (71. 5 %) served in rural areas, with a similar density in rural and urban areas. Only 3. 4 % were women. In addition, 55, 393 traditional birth attendants (99. 9 % women) and 89, 090 unqualified providers (80 % men) were enumerated. Multiple formal and traditional systems of medicine were practiced. Most providers (84. 4 %) and institutions (94. 5 %) functioned for-profit. All provider densities were negatively correlated to scheduled caste proportions and positively to scheduled tribe proportions in the districts. With regard to perception, policy makers in the public and private health sectors perceived the other sector with a degree of mutual suspicion; morality and value conflicts between the two sectors were evident. The barriers of mistrust between the public and private sectors, which hinder true dialogue, are complex. They have social, moral and economic bases. The best chance of addressing these barriers is through necessary structural change, before any real long term significant partnership between the two sectors is possible. Conclusions: The thesis highlights the heterogeneity and dominance of the private health sector, and the distribution of different provider groups in rural and urban areas/districts. Rather than an absolute shortage of manpower, maldistribution seems a problem here. Access to women providers is low, important in a setting where women would prefer seeing women providers. The possibility that scheduled castes might have lower access to health care providers than the rest of the population is presented, a finding with important political implications. The barriers to trust between the public and private health sectors in the setting are complex. Addressing these as a step to making real collaboration possible, calls for deeper more structural changes in the working of the health system, including a redressal of the <b>regressive</b> fee-for-service <b>payment</b> mechanism. The government must consider some form of health insurance for more vulnerable groups of people...|$|R
