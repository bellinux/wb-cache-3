5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times.

This new methodology is conducted in three stages. First, a classical state enumeration reliability assessment is performed for the branch-node model of a subtransmission system, assuming that substations are perfectly reliable. Second, a detailed model of the subtransmission system is considered and the reliability of each substation is assessed by considering them in a “one-by-one” process, supposing perfect operation for the branch-node model. Finally, the <b>reliability</b> <b>indices</b> calculated in the ﬁrst and second stages are analytically combined to obtain the <b>reliability</b> <b>indices</b> for the subtransmission system (system <b>reliability</b> <b>indices)</b> and for the load nodes of the distribution system (load-node <b>reliability</b> <b>indices).</b> Test {{results show that the}} proposed methodology is suitable for both planning studies and 24 hours-ahead security assessment.
