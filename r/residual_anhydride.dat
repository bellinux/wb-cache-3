40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the water {{transport}} in thermoset matrices. We used Fourier Transform Infrared analysis (FTIR) during sorption/desorption experiments {{to investigate the}} interaction between sorbed water and the epoxy network. Our results demonstrated that the polymer matrix undergoes hydrolysis. We found that the chemical species involved in the reaction process was the <b>residual</b> <b>anhydride</b> groups. These results support the physical basis of the three-dimensional (3 D) diffusion/reaction model. We finally showed that this model is able to reproduce multi-cycle sorption/desorption experiment, as well as water uptake in hybrid metal/epoxy samples. We simulated the 3 D distributions of the diffusing water and the reacted water. International audienceIn this paper, we studied the water transport in thermoset matrices.

40|$|A novel vinyl ether, 2, 2 -{{dimethyl}}- 4 -vinyioxymethyl- 1, 3 -dioxol (DMVMD), {{that has}} a dimethyl ketal protected vicinal diol functionality was synthesizied from readily available starting materials, such as glycerol, acetone and acetylene. Copolymerisation of DMVMD with maleic anhydride (MAH) in various molar ratios was carried out using a free radical initiator. The composition of the copolymer was established by conductometric titration, and {{was found to be}} 1 : 1 irrespective of the monomer feed composition thus establishing its alternating nature. The copolymer formed clear free standing films upon solvent casting which became insoluble upon prolonged exposure to ambeint atmosphere. The insolubility is ascribed to moisture induced crosslinking. A plausible mechanism for the crosslinking involves the hydrolysis of some of the anhydride groups, followed by acid catalysed deketalization, and then by the reaction of the alcoholic groups, thus generated, with the <b>residual</b> <b>anhydride</b> to give ester crosslinks. This hypothesis was confirmed both by model reactions and insitu FT-IR studies...|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the <b>residual</b> acetic <b>anhydride</b> and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|R
