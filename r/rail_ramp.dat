30|$|Three main {{types of}} {{transportation}} systems are {{defined in the}} utilization of multiple transportation modes. Multimodal transportation refers to passenger or freight transportation from an origin to a destination using two or more transportation modes. Intermodal transportation {{is a type of}} multimodal freight transportation that uses an intermodal transport unit (ITU) (e.g. container) with no handling of the goods themselves between mode changes. Combined transportation is a type of multimodal freight transportation that excludes air transport and where most the trip occurs by rail or on waterways with only the initial and final legs of the trip occurring on road. The reader is referred to [3] for a compilation of these definitions. It should also be noted here that air and sea transport do not lend themselves to unimodal (i.e. single-mode) transportation of freight. Air and sea transport are almost always coupled with either rail/road transport or both. On the other hand, rail and road transport could be used as unimodal and possibly interchangeably. Choice between rail and road transport depends mostly on economic matters and the availability of the required infrastructure (i.e. <b>rail</b> <b>ramp,</b> crane, etc.) and qualified human resource at the transhipment hubs.|$|E

50|$|Early {{pioneers in}} powered and {{unpowered}} flight used gravity to accelerate their aircraft to a speed which allowed its wings to generate enough lift to achieve independent flight. These included attempts to achieve flight from towers, city walls and cliffs. Generally more successful were attempts in which speed was built up by accelerating down hills and mountain slopes, sometimes on <b>rails</b> or <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The off-railer is {{a system}} of {{installing}} a turnout over and above some plain track, without having to cut or replace that track. It is useful for installing temporary branches on agricultural railways, and sidings for track machines on mainline <b>rails.</b> Special <b>ramps</b> lift the wheels off the normal track, and then the off-railer curves away as required. Decauville has such a system. It {{is a bit like}} a drawbridge crossing.|$|R
40|$|Daily drayage {{operations}} involve moving loaded or empty equipment between customer {{locations and}} rail ramps. Drayage orders are generally pickup and delivery requests with time windows. The repositioning of empty equipment {{may also be}} {{required in order to}} facilitate loaded movements. The drayage orders are satisfied by a heterogeneous fleet of drivers. Driver routes must satisfy various operational constraints. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, our goal is to minimize the cost of daily drayage operations in a region on a given day. We present an optimization methodology for finding cost-effective schedules for regional daily drayage operations. The core of the formulation is a set partitioning model whose columns represent routes. Routes are added to the formulation by column generation. We present numerical results for real-world data which demonstrate that our methodology produces low cost solutions in a reasonably short time. The second part of the dissertation addresses minimizing total empty mileage when driver capacity is not restrictive and new orders are added to the problem in an online fashion. We present a lower bound for the worst case guarantee of any deterministic online algorithm. We develop a solution methodology and provide results for the performance of different scheduling policies and parameters in a simulated environment. In the third part of the dissertation, we study a system with one <b>rail</b> <b>ramp</b> and one customer location which is served by a single driver. The problem has discrete time periods and at most one new order is released randomly each time period. The objective is to maximize the expected number of orders covered. With this simple problem, we seek to learn more about route planning for a single driver under uncertainty. We prove that carrying out an order ready to be picked up at the driver's current location is optimal for the case with one customer location. We show that the structure of the optimal policies is not simple and depends on various parameters. We devise a simple policy which yields provably near-optimal results and identify a case for which that policy is optimal. Ph. D. Committee Co-Chair: George L.

50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the <b>rails.</b> This <b>ramp</b> consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|R

50|$|The {{main line}} between Hamm and Paderborn was opened on 4 October 1850 by the Royal Westphalian Railway Company (Königlich-Westfälische Eisenbahn, KWE). The {{extension}} to Warburg was opened in 1853. The line from Munster to Warstein was opened on 31 October 1883. The line to Rheda followed {{a few years}} later. Operations on the north-south route of the Westfälische Landes-Eisenbahn (Westphalian State Railway) between Münster and Warstein was closed in two stages for passenger services up to 1975. Today it is used purely as a freight line. In 1979, passenger services were finally closed to Rheda. This line is now abandoned and largely dismantled. The Lippstadt-Nord station {{on the line to}} Beckum/Neubeckum was completely demolished in 1987 (station building, freight shed, loading <b>ramp,</b> <b>rail</b> tracks) and only the now non-functional signal box, which was built in 1910, and the main track survive. The headquarters of the Westfälische Landes-Eisenbahn along with its local freight terminal and central workshop are also near the former Lippstadt-Nord station.|$|R
50|$|On 13 or 14 January 1849 the {{innovative}} young engineer Thomas Bouch was appointed engineer {{and manager of}} the E&NR. Bouch saw that the proposals for hydraulic cranes at the harbours would only partly mitigate the problem, and he immediately put forward a radical scheme: what {{is now known as}} a train ferry. The steamship would have railway tracks on its deck and goods wagons—passenger carriages were not planned to be conveyed—would travel on board. At each harbour point there would be a flying bridge (as Bouch described it): this would be a large trolley system capable of running on its own <b>rails</b> on a <b>ramped</b> jetty, and carrying railway tracks. The flying bridge could be moved up or down the ramp and make a connection with the landward tracks; a link span at the seaward end connected to the track on the steamer. It was to be hinged at the flying bridge end so as to accommodate tidal variation during the berthing of the ferryboat. The tidal range was about 20 feet (6 m).|$|R
