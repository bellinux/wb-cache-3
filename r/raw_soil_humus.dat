In addition, other climatic factors such as high levels of precipitation, a relatively short vegetation period and a cool, moist, montane climate are basic pre-requisites. Human exploitation may also favour the emergence of missen. The introduction of stall feeding in the 19th century forced forest farmers to use the ground vegetation as bedding. On poor bunter sandstone <b>soils</b> <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> is laid down {{as a result of the}} constant removal of nutrients. The blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), an indicator of acidicism, becomes the dominant type of dwarf shrub.

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{series of}} fungi {{with varying degrees}} of {{sensitivity}} to soil fungistasis was selected as the result of agar disk and buried-slide tests with 17 fungi and one soil. Six out of 7 different soils exhibited a spectrum of inhibition of the test series of fungi {{similar to that of the}} first soil tested. The exception was a very acid <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> <b>soil</b> which only inhibited the acid-sensitive fungus Acrostulugmus cinna-barinus. Fertilizer treatments of two series of plots a t Rothamsted were found to affect soil fungistasis only through their influence on soil pH. Inhibitory effect decreased with increasing soil acidity, being absent from the most acid plot tested. From the results of experiments in which three fungi were pre-incubated before exposure to the influence of soil, it is suggested that spores are most sensitive to soil fungistasis at an early stage in the process of germination. Reference was made in a previous paper (Jackson, 1958) to the numerous reports which suggest that factors which inhibit the germination of fungal spores and, to a lesser extent, the vegetative growth of fungi, are of wide-spread occurrence in the soil. Little is yet known of the properties and natur...|$|R

30|$|In contrast, other mediterranean-climate regions have {{reported}} {{significant differences in}} soil-arthropod assemblages in burned plots compared to control plots within {{the first two years}} after burning (Pryke and Samways 2012, Radea and Arianoutsou 2012, Pitzalis et al. 2013). Interestingly, in Italy, while species composition changed significantly, {{there was no significant difference}} in soil-arthropod diversity or evenness between burned and unburned pine forests (Pitzalis et al. 2013). Apparently, species evenness and diversity are affected by fire in independent ways that can lead to an altered soil-arthropod composition, illustrating the complexity of multivariate phenomena. Di Castri (1973) pointed out that, in mediterranean-climate ecosystems, soil animals are heavily influenced by <b>soil</b> <b>humus,</b> which is a function of aboveground vegetation and stand age. The variability in aboveground vegetation and stand age undoubtedly contributes to very different fire behavior patterns with respect to fire regime parameters such as <b>soil</b> <b>humus</b> combustion and rate of spread, further leading to complexity in predicting fire effects on these organisms.|$|R

40|$|We {{organized}} a crowdsourcing {{experiment in the}} form of a snapshot sampling campaign to assess the spatial distribution of nitrogen solutes, namely, nitrate, ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), in German surface waters.

The statistical analyses revealed a significant correlation between nitrate and arable land (0. 46), as well as <b>soil</b> <b>humus</b> content (0. 37) but a weak correlation with population density (0. 12). DON correlations were weak but significant with humus content (0. 14) and arable land (0. 13). The mean contribution of DON to total dissolved nitrogen was 22 %. Samples were classified as water quality class II or above, following the European Water Framework Directive for nitrate and ammonium (53 % and 82 %, respectively).

A number of reports {{relate to the}} return of crop residue into field [6 – 11]. However, the mechanism of carbon sequestration of crop residue in different origin of paddy soils is not clear until now. The composition and nature of humus derived from different origin paddy soils are various [12]. Moreover, humified OM and the reduction of their microbial mineralization could protect the labile organic compounds effectively in soil [13]. The microbial and enzyme activities are seriously changed [4], {{and the formation of}} <b>soil</b> <b>humus</b> is considerably different during decomposition of crop residue [8].

Not only Solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to study soil organic matter (SOM) [16 – 18], but also Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is also a useful technique in distinguishing the main chemical functional groups of SOM, such as carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose, fats, and/or lipids and proteinaceous compounds [19]. The direct information of functional groups in SOM fraction could be investigated by FTIR spectroscopy [20].|$|R
