40|$|Abstract. Preliminary {{simulations}} of finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects on m = 1 tearing insta-bilities in a <b>reverse</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> (<b>RFP)</b> plasma are presented. δf particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations were performed by extending a hybrid drift kinetic-MHD model {{to include the}} full Lorentz equa-tions of motion {{to take into account}} FLR effects. The simulations show that for an idealized phase space distribution, sufficiently energetic ions stabilize the tearing mode. These simulations show good agreement with analytic theory and demonstrate the FLR physics capability of the hybrid kinetic-MHD model.

40|$|To {{understand}} the physical mechanism underlying the cross-field transport of mass and energy in magnetoplasmas is a long-standing problem in fusion research. Woods (1987) has recently developed a second-order transport theory {{which has been}} used to explain a number of transport-related phenomena observed in tokamaks. Here, we apply second-order transport theory to the <b>reverse</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> (<b>RFP)</b> and a phenomenon observed in tokamaks known as 'snakes'. Expressions for the mass and energy confinement times in the RFP, Ï p and Ï e, are deduced and agreement with experimental results from HBTX is found. For typical operating conditions the times Ï p ~ 0. 1 ms and Ï e ~ 0. 2 ms are observed in HBTX. Second-order transport theory predicts Ï p ~ 0. 4 ms and Ï e ~ 0. 4 ms for this machine. Scaling laws for Î² p versus Î· e,Î² p versus I Ï and Ï e versus I Ï are compared with measurements from HBTX and agree well with observation. Snakes are large density perturbations observed in JET after fuel pellet injection. Typical snakes in JET are remarkably stable and are found to have density decay times longer than predictions based on neoclassical theory (Stringer 1987). After their formation, snakes have even been observed to grow (Weller et al. 1987), which suggests the presence of an inward diffusion mechanism. There is also some evidence for a temperature depression in the snakes region. An explanation of the stability and energy balance in snakes based on second-order transport theory is proposed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The DDFTU code {{has been}} {{modified}} and updated {{to study the}} transport of dust in the <b>reverse</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> (<b>RFP)</b> EXTRAP-T 2 R. The DDFTU code solves the coupled equations of charging, heating and motion of a dust grain immersed in a plasma whose profiles are given. Updates of the code have been introduced to include (i) non-steady state heat balance and phase transitions models, (ii) realistic boundary conditions for dust-wall collisions, and (iii) a radius and temperature-dependent thermal radiation model, for which a dedicated code has been developed. The models for secondary electron emission (SEE), thermionic emission and magnetic dipole force have been refined as well, the sensitivity to SEE and thermal radiation modelling being highlighted.  Similarly to limiter tokamak configuration, the ion drag is confirmed {{to be the main}} force driving the dust dynamics. However for RFP configurations, the strong contribution of the electric force is demonstrated. The latter {{plays an important role in}} the RFP edge plasma due to (i) the large value of the radial electric field and (ii) its sign which is opposite to typical tokamak edge electric fields.  A comparison with available experimental data - dust collection in the mid-plane - has been carried out. For this purpose, the dust toroidal transport asymmetry has been evaluated numerically from the computation of the time dependent velocity distribution of an ensemble of many particles launched from the vessel wall. An empirical scaling law for the asymmetry has been found in the high dust inertia regime...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The RFX-mod <b>reverse</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> (<b>RFP)</b> {{experiment}} applies {{active control}} on the MHD instabilities by acting on the magnetic field configuration at the boundary. These studies aim at acquiring expertise on the control of MHD modes that is also relevant for high beta discharges in tokamaks. To control the MHD activity, 192 saddle coils are installed, covering the entire torus surface. A large number of field and current measurements are acquired and processed in real-time (3 x 192 = 576 channels). Excellent results have been achieved by exploiting the real-time MHD mode control system, especially on MHD mode suppression at the boundary, toroidal loop voltage reduction, particle and energy time increase and duration of the plasma discharge. The paper discusses the technological enhancement developed {{in the last two}} years. Two new techniques have been introduced recently. The first one is referred to as Clean Mode Control (CMC). It consists in the correction of the aliasing, due to the sidebands produced by the discrete grid of coils, which determines a systematic error on the Fourier analysis of the measurements. As the CMC correction requires the simultaneous availability in the same real-time station of all acquired channels, a significant upgrade of the architecture of the real-time feedback system was necessary. The second technique consists in the introduction of a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) approach to substitute the Single Input Single Output model used so far, whose dynamic behaviour is not satisfactory. The MIMO approach relies on a full electromagnetic model of the coil and sensor system in the presence of passive structures. The MIMO controller has been developed following the concept of model decoupling. To compute the new algorithms without exceeding the real-time constraints, faster CPUs have been introduced and the data throughput in the real-time network has been optimized. 1...|$|E

40|$|The RFX {{power supply}} system is a {{combination}} of electrical devices, such as a. c. -d. c. converters, direct current interrupters, large capacitor banks and fast closing switches, whose coordinated operation allows the investigation of plasmas in the <b>reverse</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> (<b>RFP)</b> configuration. The large electrical power, required for the pulses, is derived partly from the 400 kV high voltage Italian grid and partly by the transfer to the plasma of energy stored before the pulse in the capacitor banks or in the machine magnets. The circuit operation phases to obtain RFP configurations are initially described: after premagnetizing the machine and charging the capacitor banks, the plasma current start-up follows (between 5 and 50 ms long) during which the energy stored is transferred to the plasma. Then, by means of the a. c. -d. c. converters, the steady state of the plasma configuration is sustained for a maximum duration of 0. 25 s. In the design of the power supply units a few aspects have been taken into account which have a great impact on the technical solutions: the possible fault conditions, which can in a few cases heavily damage the devices; the presence of high electromagnetic interference (EMI) which can induce noises in signals and errors in the circuit operations; the request for easy reconfigurations of the circuits, to cope with different types of plasma investigations. The fault protection led in RFX to the development of an active logic able to command the required protective actions, which have to operate within 1 ms of the fault. The EMI reduction was obtained with a careful analysis of the EMI source, related to the magnetic stray field caused by the machine magnetizing winding and by the operation of converters, capacitor banks, interrupters and ignitrons; screening of the area with control equipment, the signal insulation and a particular solution for the ground system was adopted. Finally, a high level of plant flexibility was reached by adopting a modular solution {{in the design of the}} a. c. -d. c. converter system and of the toroidal capacitor bank. In the paper the design criteria of the {{power supply system}} units are presented, together with a discussion concerning the main choices; the structures of the power supply units (the a. c. voltage network, the a. c. -d. c. converters, the capacitor bank, the energy transfer and the switching units and the pulse discharge cleaning system) are described in detail. Finally, the results of the commissioning and first operation of the whole power supply system with dummy loads are also reporte...|$|E
