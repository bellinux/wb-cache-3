As this RFI is always additive to the brightness, {{the presence of}} undetected RFI can bias the geophysical parameter retrieval. As radiometers have the most sensitive receivers operating in their band, low levels of RFI are both significant and difficult to identify. The kurtosis statistic is a tool being explored {{as a means of}} detecting low level RFI in microwave receivers. The performance of the kurtosis statistic as a detector of RFI is introduced.

The L-band RFI Detection and Mitigation Testbed (DetMit Testbed) will not be optimized for radiometric observation {{as much as it}} is optimized for flexibility in the presence of RFI. While the DetMit Testbed will be a fully functional polarimetric L-band radiometer, the ultimate application of this instrument is not so much brightness measurements as it will be validation of RFI mitigation strategies for employment in future L-band (and other frequency) radiometers. The design approaches for the L-band RFI Detection and Mitigation Testbed are expected to apply to C-band and X-band, and presumably also to other frequencies of interest that experience RFI.

40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{satellite}} communications, a system based on low-earth-orbit satellites (LEO-SAT's) such as the Iridium system has been proposed. The LEO-SAT system is able to offer mobile telecommunication services in high-latitude areas. Rain degradation, fading and shadowing are also expected to be decreased when the system is operated at a high elevation angle. Furthermore, the propagation delay generated in the LEO-SAT system is less pronounced than that in the geostationary orbit satellite (GEO-SAT) system and, in voice services, {{the effect of the}} delay is almost negligible. We proposed a concept of a broad-band mobile satellite communication system with LEO-SAT's and Optical ISL. In that system, a fixed L-band (1. 6 / 1. 5 GHz) multibeam is used to offer narrow band service to the mobile terminals in the entire area covered by a LEO-SAT and steerable Ka-band (30 / 20 GHz) spot beams are used for the wide band service. In this paper, we present results of a study of LEO-SAT microwave link between a satellite and a mobile terminal for a broad-band mobile satellite communication system. First, the results of link budget calculations are presented and the antennas mounted on satellites are shown. For a future mobile antenna technology, we also show digital beamforming (DBF) techniques.

40|$|Rationale: Dysregulated alcohol {{consumption}} has {{been attributed to}} an imbalance between an approach-alcohol action tendency and executive control processes. However, which specific executive control processes are involved is not known. One candidate executive process is <b>interference</b> <b>suppression,</b> which refers to the suppression of task-irrelevant information through the active maintenance of task-relevant information or a cognitive load. Objective: The present study aimed to (1) establish whether alcohol action tendency can be inhibited by <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> through the use of cognitive loads and (2) to assess whether individual differences in the degree of <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> from cognitive loads is related to individual differences in the ability to regulate {{alcohol consumption}}. Method: Two groups of social drinkers (total N[*]=[*] 58) who differed in their ability to regulate their alcohol consumption completed a novel cognitive load variant of the approach avoidance task (AAT) and an alcohol taste test. Results: Results indicated that (1) there was a relationship between alcohol bias on the AAT and alcohol consumption under low load, but not high load, consistent with the hypothesis that the action tendency would be inhibited through <b>interference</b> <b>suppression,</b> and (2) this effect of load was not modified by drinking group, with both groups demonstrating equivalent ability to inhibit the action tendency.
