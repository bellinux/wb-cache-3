25|$|The multivariate {{nature of}} SA {{significantly}} complicates its quantification and measurement, {{as it is}} conceivable that a metric may only tap into one aspect of the operator's SA. Further, studies have shown that different types of SA measures do not always correlate strongly with each other (cf. Durso, Truitt, Hackworth, Crutchfield, Nikolic, Moertl, Ohrt, & Manning, 1995; Endsley, Selcon, Hardiman, & Croft, 1998; Vidulich, 2000). Accordingly, rather than rely on a single approach or metric, valid and reliable measurement of SA should utilize a battery of distinct yet <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> that complement each other (e.g., Harwood, Barnett, & Wickens, 1988). Such a multi-faced approach to SA measurement capitalizes on the strengths of each measure while minimizing the limitations inherent in each.|$|E

Other enactments limited use of firearms in cities [...] "close to buildings" [...] and on state roads (especially shooting to air during religious celebrations), citing fire hazard as a main concern. In general, however, people were free to possess and carry firearms as they wished, with another 1797 enactment specifying that loaded firearms at home must be kept in a way preventing their use by children.|$|E
500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate.

40|$|The pole-sensitivity {{approach}} is a general method for analyzing {{the stability of the}} discrete-time control system with a finite word length (FWL) implemented digital controller. It leads to a non-smooth and non-convex optimization framework, where an optimal controller realization can be designed by maximizing some stability <b>related</b> <b>measure.</b> In this contribution, a new stability <b>related</b> <b>measure</b> is derived, which is more accurate in estimating the closed-loop stability robustness of an FWL implemented controller than the existing measures of pole-sensitivity analysis. This improved stability <b>related</b> <b>measure</b> provides a better criterion to find the optimal FWL realizations for a generic controller structure that includes output-feedback and observer-based controllers. An efficient global optimization strategy called the adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) is adopted to solve for the resulting optimization problem. A numerical example is included to verify the theoretical analysis and to illustrate the design procedure...|$|R

In 1997, Latin America's largest miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) was privatized. These and other developments such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act led the bank to publish a third report (Assistance for Minerals Sector Development and Reform in Member Countries) which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population. The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations. The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays, zero custom duties, reduced income taxes, and <b>related</b> <b>measures.</b> The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec, which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but [...] "fall very short of permitting sustainable development".

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} implementation {{issues of}} digital controllers with finite word length (FWL) considerations.

A unified formulation is adopted to derive a computationally tractable stability <b>related</b> <b>measure</b> that describes FWL closed-loop stability characteristics of di erent controller realizations. Within a given operator parameterization, the optimal FWL controller realization, which maximizes the proposed stability <b>related</b> <b>measure,</b> is the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. Relationship between the z-operator and -operator controller parameterizations is analyzed, and it is shown that the parameterization has better FWL closed-loop stability margin than the z domain approach under a mild condition.
