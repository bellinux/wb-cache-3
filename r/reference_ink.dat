40|$|Color {{prediction}} {{models and}} color separation models {{are essential for}} print device characterization and calibration, from which the profiles used in color management systems are built up. Dot gain refers to the phenomenon in printing causing the printed ink dots appear bigger than their reference size in the original bitmap. The characterization of dot gain is necessary and crucial in color prediction models. Most prediction and separation models use a single dot gain characterization curve for each primary ink. In this thesis, the dot gain behavior of each ink is characterized by using multiple characterization curves based on CIEXYZ tri-stimulus values or spectral reflectance at different subintervals. For higher color prediction accuracy, an effective coverage map is created based on those multiple characterization curves. With this map, given any <b>reference</b> <b>ink</b> combination, the effective coverage values of the involved inks are calculated by cubic interpolation, and then used to predict the tri-stimulus values or the spectra of the printed colors. The color prediction accuracy is improved significantly by using this effective coverage map. Further improvement on the modified model is also carried out by selecting optimal training samples. Based on this color prediction model (forward model), a simple color separation model (inverse model), minimizing the colorimetric and spectral differences, is also presented. The presented color separation model shows favorable stability and gives accurate color reproduction. Ink saving is feasible during the color separation by setting tolerances in colorimetric differences (ΔE 94). The simplicity and high accuracy of the proposed color prediction and separation models prove their potential {{to be applied to}} color management in practical printing systems. In order to investigate the possibility of applying these models to multi-channel printing, color prediction for CMYLcLm prints, i. e. with the additional colorants light cyan and light magenta, is carried out using the forward model. The color prediction is implemented by treating the combination of C and Lc (M and Lm) as a new ink coordinate to replace the ink coordinate C (M) in our three-channel color prediction model. The corresponding prediction results are acceptable. Suggestions are also given for future work to simplify and modify the approach based on our simple color prediction model for CMYLmLc prints...|$|E
30|$|In general, XRF {{provided}} significant {{information about}} the elemental composition, which was important {{for the evaluation of}} rFTIR as well as Raman spectra allowing the identification of several inorganic pigments. A draw-back of XRF is the lack of compound specific information and the disability to identify organic materials. Furthermore, the penetration depth of X-rays is high, so that the material on the verso side of the analyzed folios contributes to the signal as well. In contrast, compound specific rFTIR was well as Raman spectrometry signals derive mainly from the uppermost surface. However, the identification of various inorganic materials is still not always possible with these methods. rFTIR, e.g., does not detect important metal oxides and sulfide pigments such as vermilion, red lead and orpiment/realgar. On the other hand, rFTIR was the only method allowing the identification of compounds such as calcium oxalate or silicates. During the investigations it turned out that only Raman spectrometry allowed a clear identification of iron gall ink [44], whereas rFTIR did not, although it was possible in sample studies with <b>reference</b> <b>inks.</b>|$|R

40|$|Document {{examinations}} are {{vitally important}} for fraudulent investigations. During a forensic document examination, {{one of the}} major questions which arises for the examiner is: when was an ink entry made on a document? During the past half century there has been a large development in the analysis in pen inks, including the introduction of new techniques and development of methods such as the ink library approach and hyphenated chromatography. Attenuated Total Reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) is a rapid and non-destructive technique that can objectively profile molecular changes within ink applied to document. 	The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether infrared spectroscopy can be used to calculate the age of a gel pen ink and therefore how much time has passed between an ink sample being written on a piece of paper and the sample being analysed. ATR-FTIR was used during this study as a rapid and non-destructive technique allowing multiple spectra to be produced in a short space of time, while not causing destruction to the sample. 	The paper used to write ink samples on for the aging study was analysed to show consistent spectra between sheets of a single ream. This analysis was vital to determine whether all of the ink samples were to be produced onto paper which would produce the same or different spectra. As the paper provides the same spectra these differences do not need to be considered when conducting analysis between aging inks. The ink samples analysed through the drying study took 10 minutes to dry after being produced. This time frame was used as knowledge for how long the ink sample should be allowed to dry prior to the spectrum for the ink sample being first taken as a reference point on day 0. Through examinations, spectral peaks at 929. 51 cm- 1 and 1348 cm- 1 from second derivatised data were established as the most discriminative wavenumbers for ink spectra and used as the major point of <b>referencing</b> <b>ink</b> aging. Evidence for gel pen ink aging is demonstrated from spectral data and group scatter plot correlations. Spectral data at the highly discriminating wavenumbers demonstrates differences between spectra for different lengths of aging. Correlations of ink aging are present in group scatter plots. Despite a non-linear correlation between the specific time periods, correlation are detectable over ranges of time with the major occurrence of aging present between the time periods of 4 weeks and 7 weeks. Overall, this study presents evidence that aging of a gel pen ink can be demonstrated by the use of Attenuated Total Reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|Forensic {{document}} examiners in the Department of Justice {{have identified}} specific {{needs in the}} analysis of intersecting lines with respect to sequence and dating of lines in questioned documents such as forgeries and alterations. Raman spectroscopy has great potential in forensics, in part because it is nondestructive to evidence. Raman has recently shown promise in successfully identifying and differentiating several different types of inks. There is, however, a shortfall in the ability to time-sequence marks, and to identify specific inks and pigments, {{especially in the case of}} intersecting lines. To date, this has received little attention. One major problem is the fluorescence of paper fibers and inks which masks valuable spectral information that identifies the inks. Diffusion of inks across different layers of paper and other inks is another problem that could make time-sequencing lines very difficult. The goal of this project is to overcome the problem of fluorescence and to determine a method that successfully sequences intersecting lines. Raman spectroscopy will be used in various modes such as changing wavelengths of the lasers, scanning at different depths in the sample, and employing surface-enhanced Raman scattering. The hypothesis is that Raman is capable of differentiating and identifying different inks under these circumstances, using a <b>reference</b> library of <b>inks</b> and a computational spectral subtraction technique...|$|R
30|$|The gall {{extracts}} chromatographic profiles {{are very}} interesting, where HPLC–ESI–MS clearly shows {{the presence of}} a dominant fraction of polygalloyl esters of glucose, Fig.  7. The results obtained from the aqueous solution of commercial tannic acid surprised us, and for that reason, the chromatogram obtained is presented in Fig.  7. We were expecting a maximum of two peaks, corresponding to some fraction of gallic acid and a broad band for the isomers of decagalloylglucoses [39]. Instead, the chromatographic profile is much more complex than the gall extracts obtained following fifteenth to seventeenth centuries recipes. Definitively, commercial tannic acid cannot be described, as depicted in the commercial catalogues, as penta-m-digalloyl-glucose (meta-depsidic 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 pentakis-O-digalloyl-β-d-glucopyranose), Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, and it is not suitable for preparing a <b>reference</b> medieval iron-gall <b>ink.</b> As described by Quideau et al. [39], commercial tannic acid is in fact “a complex and varying mixture of different gallotannins and simpler galloylglucoses”. This could have been anticipated as tannic acid is described in literature as being extracted from gall-nuts “by boiling ground-up nuts in acidic aqueous solution” [40]. In the future, we plan to study “true” iron-decagalloylglucoses complexes, but we anticipate it will not be an easy task since these molecular structures equilibrate into meta/para-depsidic isomeric mixtures in solution [39].|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} {{information}} provided by ink evidence to the criminal and civil justice system is limited. The limitations arise from {{the weakness of the}} interpretative framework currently used, as proposed in the ASTM 1422 - 05 and 1789 - 04 on ink analysis. It is proposed to use the likelihood ratio from the Bayes theorem to interpret ink evidence. Unfortunately, when considering the analytical practices, as defined in the ASTM standards on ink analysis, it appears that current ink analytical practices do not allow for the level of reproducibility and accuracy required by a probabilistic framework. Such framework relies on the evaluation of the statistics of the ink characteristics using an <b>ink</b> <b>reference</b> database and the objective measurement of similarities between ink samples. A complete research programme was designed to (a) develop a standard methodology for analysing ink samples in a more reproducible way, (b) comparing automatically and objectively ink samples and (c) evaluate the proposed methodology in a forensic context. This report focuses on the first of the three stages. A calibration process, based on a standard dye ladder, is proposed to improve the reproducibility of ink analysis by HPTLC, when these inks are analysed at different times and/or by different examiners. The impact of this process on the variability between the repetitive analyses of ink samples in various conditions is studied. The results show significant improvements in the reproducibility of ink analysis compared to traditional calibration methods...|$|R
30|$|Piantanida et al. {{presents}} band assignments for ink reconstructions [35]. However, in {{this publication}} the proposed assignments are {{largely based on}} the papers by Biles and Garrido; i.e., on gallic acid and not on galloyl-iron complexes. Considering that we will show that gallic acid is a minor component in most of our gall extracts (“Quantification of gallic acid by HPLC–DAD and HPLC–ESI–MS”) as well the contradictory assignments present in literature, we prefer to not assign vibrational modes to the bands observed in this work, Table  4. At this point, {{we think it is}} better to use the signature bands for iron-gall inks as proposed by Lee et al. [31], and to discuss the spectral patterns found. When we compare the historical inks with the iron-gallate reference, we observe that 2 of the 3 strong signature bands for iron-gall inks display shifts: The band at 1327  cm− 1 for iron gallate, is found in an interval between 1332 and 1336  cm− 1 for the historical ink reconstructions; likewise, the signature broad band at 594  cm− 1 for iron-gallate is shifted to higher wavenumbers, displaying maxima in an interval between 601 and 608  cm− 1. Considering both <b>references</b> and gall <b>inks,</b> the bands that possibly display the higher variability are the signature band at 1325 – 1336  cm− 1 and the band found between 1577 and 1569  cm− 1; the more stable, is the signature band at 1468 – 1471  cm− 1. Overall, the best match between the references prepared and the historical iron-gall inks lies in-between the spectral fingerprint of iron-PGG and iron-DiGG. This means that the spectra are better described by molecular structures that are characterized by an ester bond and not by a carboxylate group.|$|R
40|$|A Thesis Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirement}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyReproducibility of third level fingerprint detail is important in personal identification. The effect of different substrates on the reproducibility of pore dimensions in <b>inked</b> <b>reference</b> fingerprints was investigated. Photomicrographs of reference prints were taken and pore area was measured repeatedly using appropriate software. Reproducibility of pore area was also studied in latent prints. Latent prints were deposited on chosen absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces and developed using Cyanoacrylate and Ninhydrin to determine pore area reproducibility. Photomicrographs of ridged skin were captured directly by focusing under microscope and pore area reproducibility in these images was studied. Live scans were {{also included in the}} study to see if pore area can be relied upon in live scans at 500 ppi (pixels per inch). Results revealing best third level detail in inked prints were achieved by deposition onto a variety of non-absorbent substrates but inter-print variation indicated that pore area in inked prints deposited onto paper substrates cannot be used reliably in personal identification. In case of latent prints, variation was greater than normal acceptable limits suggesting that pore area is not reproducible in latent prints developed using Cyanoacrylate and Ninhydrin techniques. Results of direct microscopic images also showed too great inter-image variation which has further supported the unreliability of pore area as a tool in personal identification. Live scans at 500 ppi did not prove to be useful in providing good pore detail for study. This study casts doubt on the use of pore area as a reliable identification tool in personal identification and suggests raising the scanning resolution to study pore detail in live scans...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this series of article aimed at (1) automating the search of questioned ink specimens in <b>ink</b> <b>reference</b> collections and (2) at evaluating the strength of ink evidence in a transparent and balanced manner. These aims require that ink samples are analysed in an accurate and reproducible way {{and that they are}} compared in an objective and automated way. This latter requirement is due to the large number of comparisons that are necessary in both scenarios. A research programme was designed to (a) develop a standard methodology for analysing ink samples in a reproducible way, (b) comparing automatically and objectively ink samples and (c) evaluate the proposed methodology in forensic contexts. This report focuses on the last of the three stages of the research programme. The calibration and acquisition process and the mathematical comparison algorithms were described in previous papers [C. Neumann, P. Margot, New perspectives in the use of ink evidence in forensic science-Part I: Development of a quality assurance process for forensic ink analysis by HPTLC, Forensic Sci. Int. 185 (2009) 29 - 37; C. Neumann, P. Margot, New perspectives in the use of ink evidence in forensic science- Part II: Development and testing of mathematical algorithms for the automatic comparison of ink samples analysed by HPTLC, Forensic Sci. Int. 185 (2009) 38 - 50]. In this paper, the benefits and challenges of the proposed concepts are tested in two forensic contexts: (1) ink identification and (2) ink evidential value assessment. The results show that different algorithms are better suited for different tasks. This research shows {{that it is possible to}} build digital ink libraries using the most commonly used ink analytical technique, i. e. high-performance thin layer chromatography, despite its reputation of lacking reproducibility. More importantly, it is possible to assign evidential value to ink evidence in a transparent way using a probabilistic model. It is therefore possible to move away from the traditional subjective approach, which is entirely based on experts' opinion, and which is usually not very informative. While there is room for the improvement, this report demonstrates the significant gains obtained over the traditional subjective approach for the search of ink specimens in ink databases, and the interpretation of their evidential value...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical <b>references</b> (page 36). <b>Ink</b> market in Bangladesh is growing parallel {{to the growth of}} printing and packaging material industries. There is significant demand of various types of industrial ink in Bangladesh, such as Flexo Ink, Gravure, Offset, Screen Printing Ink and Letterpress Printing. In this study, focus was mainly given on Flexo and Gravure ink as market size of those ink are quite substantial. The study covered ink producers, cement companies, packaging companies, importers, ink association and packaging association to collect all types of information regarding this industry. From the study, the estimated annual market size of Flexo ink in Bangladesh is 5444 M. Ton in volume and BDT 188. 44 Crore in value and Gravure ink is 10, 509 M. ton in volume and BDT 370. 65 Crore in value. Out of 15 major ink producers in the country, 5 ink manufacturers currently produce Flexo ink and Gravure ink. The big users of Flexo ink in Bangladesh are WPP bag manufacturer companies. Bengal poly and paper sacks, Paragon Limited, Khan Brothers are major WPP bag manufacturers. The major ink users of Gravure are the food packaging companies and among them Premafelx, BRAC printing, Mecca Multilayer, Arbab Poly are the bigger ones. Some cement manufacturers produce their own packaging in their plants, they use Flexo ink to print on their packaging. Seven rings cement, Shah Cement, Desh Bondhu Polymer, and Tiger Cement etc. are some of the companies that are using Flexo ink. Some of the Gravure ink users import the raw materials from outside and hire chemist to make their own ink in Bangladesh. These packaging and cement companies directly import major portion of their Flexo and Gravure ink requirement. Ink and Thinner are complementary goods. Almost all of the thinner are imported from outside of Bangladesh as there are no good thinner manufactures here. From the study, the market size of Thinner for Flexo printing is 7777. 14 M. ton / year in volume and BDT 145. 24 Crore in value and for Gravure printing is 12892. 77 M. ton /year and 232. 75 Crore in value. Many big companies like Premaflex wants to inspire the local ink manufactures to make quality ink as the local ink is not yet as good as imported. They would prefer buying from local rather than import but as they really care about quality printing they still don’t buy.

5000|$|Neilsen's {{claims were}} {{subsequently}} challenged {{by one of}} the 2006 election observers, who claimed that the New Zealand political economist had 'failed to understand' the mechanics of Fiji's electoral process. David Arms, who serves {{as a member of the}} Electoral Commission under Bainimarama's government, described the Neilsen/Lala/Vakatale report as weak and claimed that there was [...] "undue haste in its preparation" [...] (Arms, ‘A Critique of the Report of the Independent Assessment of the Electoral Process in Fiji’, 31 July 2007). The report was commissioned by ex Fiji Human Rights Commission director Shaista Shameem, who had publicly backed the military takeover. According to Arms, Dr Neilsen and his colleagues reached the verdict that the 2006 result had been ‘rigged’ mainly on the basis of evidence gleaned at public hearings, without any independent effort to verify the accuracy of the allegations. Arms' report states that most of those who showed up at the hearings had an axe to grind. They were defeated candidates or supporters of political parties that had performed poorly at the polls. Dr Nelsen's only evidence of electoral fraud had to do with alleged bias in the treatment of Indian voters' registration slips. However, election observer and Fiji-specialising academic Jon Fraenkel claimed that Dr Neilsen's claims were false: I was a University of the South Pacific election observer during the 2006 election. Early in election week, the problem of officials finding the names of voters on one roll, but not on the other, became apparent and much discussed. I personally raised this with the Fiji Elections Office, and was told that - although the colour-coded registration slips handed out to voters at the time of registration were often in error, the electoral rolls themselves were not. Over the following days of election week, I tested this claim by requesting presiding officers in the polling stations to show me their logbook records of voters who had been able to cast only one vote because their name could not be found in a corresponding open or communal constituency. In every case I checked, the Elections Office was correct: it was possible for presiding officers, if they ignored the registration slips, to use any one correct entry on the electoral roll to find the other. In other words, the problem lay with the registration officials and with the training of polling station officials. It was not an indication of systemic bias or ballot-rigging. In any case, during the final days of election week, in somewhat chaotic circumstances, the Fiji Elections Office effectively dispensed with the electoral rolls as a means of avoiding duplicate voting and allowed citizens whose name was found on one roll to cast a second vote on a corresponding open or communal roll, even if their name could not be found. From that point, prevention of duplicate voting depended solely on <b>reference</b> to the <b>ink</b> marked on voters’ fingers'.|$|R
