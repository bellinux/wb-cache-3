5|$|At {{the request}} of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King {{declared}} Holloway legally dead in absentia on January 12, 2012. On August 16, 2017, Holloway's father announced that he and a private investigator had recently discovered human remains {{and that they were}} being DNA-tested to determine whether they belonged to his daughter. Final <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> the human remains did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
25|$|In 1832, Michael Faraday's {{experiments}} led him {{to state}} his two laws of electrochemistry. In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell which solved the problem of polarization by eliminating hydrogen gas generation at the positive electrode. Later <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> alloying the amalgamated zinc with mercury would produce a higher voltage.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 2013, a T-50 of the South Korean Air Force crashed {{during a}} {{training}} mission near Kwangju city, killing both pilots on board.

They suffered a blow {{on the last day}} of the regular season when MRI <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> Matt Kemp had a severe ankle injury and would not be able to play in the post-season. Andre Ethier was also dealing with an ankle injury and he was limited to pinch hitting in the division series.|$|E
25|$|As expected, the <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> details {{central to}} the event were remembered more {{accurately}} when that event was emotional than when neutral, However, this {{was not at the}} expense of memory for peripheral (in this case, spatially peripheral or plot-irrelevant) details, which were also remembered more accurately when the event was emotional. Based on these findings {{it has been suggested that}} the dual enhancing and impairing effects on memory are not an inevitable consequence of emotional arousal.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, {{president}} and CEO Paul Otellini {{announced that he}} would step down in May 2013 at the age of 62, three years before the company's mandatory retirement age. During a six-month transition period, Intel's board of directors commenced a search process for the next CEO, in which it considered both internal managers and external candidates such as Sanjay Jha and Patrick Gelsinger. Financial <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that,</b> under Otellini, Intel's revenue increased by 55.8 percent (US$34.2 to 53.3 billion), while its net income increased by 46.7% (US$7.5 billion to 11 billion).|$|E

25|$|In {{a recent}} experiment, an {{apparatus}} {{to test this}} debate was developed and implemented. The test consisted of a free-floating molecular double slit and the momentum change of the atom scattering from it. The results of this experiment were compared to quantum mechanical, and semi-classical models. The <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> the classical description of the slits, used by Einstein, provides a surprisingly good description of the experimental results, even for a microscopic system, if the momentum transfer is not ascribed to a specific pathway but shared coherently and simultaneously between both.|$|E
25|$|The Census, {{taken on}} 27 March 2011, asked {{a number of}} {{questions}} relating to nationality and national identity, including What is your country of birth? ('Wales' was one of the options), How would you describe your national identity? (for the first time 'Welsh' and 'English' were included as options), What is your ethnic group? ('White Welsh/English/Scottish/Northern Irish/British' was an option) and Can you understand, speak, read or write Welsh?. In December 2012 census <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> 66% of residents considered themselves to have a singular Welsh national identity, with another 10% stating they had a Welsh and British identity.|$|E
25|$|In {{hundreds}} of non-binding local referendums on independence, organised across Catalonia from 13 September 2009, {{a large majority}} voted for independence, although critics argued that the polls were mostly held in pro-independence areas. In December 2009, 94% of those voting backed independence from Spain, on a turn-out of 25%. The final local referendum was held in Barcelona, in April 2011. On 11 September 2012, a pro-independence march pulled in a crowd of between 600,000 (according to the Spanish Government), 1.5 million (according to the Guàrdia Urbana de Barcelona), and 2 million (according to its promoters); whereas poll <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> half the population of Catalonia supported secession from Spain.|$|E

25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has proven}} {{useful in the}} {{recovery}} of motor skills. Rhythmical auditory stimulation in a musical context in combination with traditional gait therapy improved the ability of stroke patients to walk. The study consisted of two treatment conditions, one which received traditional gait therapy and another which received the gait therapy {{in combination with the}} rhythmical auditory stimulation. During the rhythmical auditory stimulation, stimulation was played back measure by measure, and was initiated by the patient's heel-strikes. Each condition received fifteen sessions of therapy. The <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> the rhythmical auditory stimulation group showed more improvement in stride length, symmetry deviation, walking speed and rollover path length (all indicators for improved walking gait) than the group that received traditional therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study done}} by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 {{different}} children ages {{three to four}} and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed {{to play with the}} toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed for the results to be more authentic compared to research done in a lab. The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders {{in order to create a}} better balance.|$|E

500|$|Early in April, Gilmore {{coined the}} term [...] "Rudy McRomney" [...] to {{describe}} the three Republican frontrunners, whom he labeled as liberals during a forum in Des Moines, Iowa. [...] On April 16, ten days prior to his official announcement, polling <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> Gilmore hovered between 1% and 2% support among the Republican electorate. A Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Gilmore was in twelfth place among Republicans with 1% of participants, compared to 0% in February and 1% in January. Somewhat promising results showed that among Newt Gingrich supporters, Gilmore had 2% support; up from 0% in February.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{the motive}} of the rioters was {{attributed}} to racial tensions {{but now they are}} considered one factor in a larger status quo conflict. Urban sociologist Joel Kotkin agrees, [...] "This wasn't a race riot, it was a class riot." [...] Supporting this is the large misconception that rioters were only African-American; many groups in fact participated. Newsweek reported that [...] "Hispanics and even some whites—men, women and children—mingled with African-Americans." [...] "When residents who lived near Florence and Normandie were asked why they believed riots had occurred in their neighborhoods, they responded of the perceived racist attitudes they had felt throughout their lifetime and empathized with the bitterness the rioters felt. Residents who had respectable jobs, homes, and material items still felt like second-class citizens. A poll by Newsweek asked whether black people charged with crimes were treated more harshly or more leniently and <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> 75% of blacks voted more harshly versus 46% of whites.|$|E
