40|$|Current {{approaches}} to assess interoception of respiratory functions cannot {{differentiate between the}} physiological basis of interoception, i. e. visceral-afferent signal processing, and the psychological process of attention focusing. Furthermore, they typically involve invasive procedures, e. g. induction of respiratory occlusions or the inhalation of CO 2 enriched air. The aim {{of the current study}} was to test the capacity of startle methodology to reflect respiratory-related afferent signal processing, independent of invasive procedures. Forty-two healthy participants were tested in a spontaneous breathing and in a 0. 25 Hz paced breathing condition. Acoustic startle noises of 105 dB(A) intensity (50 ms white noise) were presented with identical trial frequency at peak and on-going inspiration and expiration, based on a new pattern detection method, involving the online processing of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>belt</b> signal. The results show the highest startle magnitudes during on-going expiration compared to any other measurement points during the respiratory cycle, independent of whether breathing was spontaneous or paced. Afferent signals from slow adapting phasic pulmonary stretch receptors may be responsible for this effect. The current study is the first to demonstrate startle modulation by respiration. These results offer the potential to apply startle methodology in the non-invasive testing of interoception-related aspects in respiratory psychophysiology...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{validate}} the change in thoracic impedance (dZ) derived respiratory signal obtained from four spot electrodes against incidental spirometry. Additionally, a similar validation was performed for a dual <b>respiratory</b> <b>belts</b> signal to compare the relative merit of both methods. Participants were 38 healthy adult subjects (half male, half female). Cross-method comparisons were performed at three (paced) respiration frequencies in sitting, supine and standing postures. Multilevel regression was used to examine the within- and between-subjects structure of the relationship between spirometric volume and the respiratory amplitude signals obtained from either dZ or <b>respiratory</b> <b>belts.</b> Both dZ derived respiratory rate and dual <b>belts</b> derived <b>respiratory</b> rate accurately reflected the pacing frequencies. For both methods, fixed factors indicated acceptable but posture-specific regression on spirometric volume. However, random factors indicated large individual differences, which was supported by variability of gain analyses. It was concluded that both the dZ and dual belts methods can be used for measurement of respiratory rate and within-subjects, posture-specific, changes in respiratory volume. The need for frequent subject-specific and posture-specific calibration combined with relatively large measurement errors may strongly limit the usefulness of both methods to assess absolute tidal volume and minute ventilation in ambulatory design...|$|R

Respiratory motion was addressed using prospective triggering (PT), prospective gating (PG) and retrospective gating (RG) with physiological signals {{obtained from a}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>belt</b> and interleaved pencil beam and DC navigators. The methods were demonstrated on four healthy volunteers at 3 T. 3 D, radial zero-TE imaging with high imaging bandwidth and nominally zero echo-time enables efficient capture of short-lived signals from the lung parenchyma and the vessels. Compared to Cartesian encoding, unaccounted for free-breathing respiration resulted in only benign blurring artifacts confined to the origin of motion. Breath holding froze respiration but achieved only limited image resolution (similar to 1. 8 mm, 30 s). PT and PG obtained similar quality expiratory-phase images at 1. 2 mm resolution in similar to 6 min scan time. RG allowed multi-phase imaging in similar to 15 min, derived from eight individually stored averages. Zero-TE {{appears to be an}} attractive pulse sequence for 3 D isotropic lung imaging.

The potential improvements of these extensions {{with respect to the}} original model were investigated. Additional evaluations were performed to investigate the limitations of the model regarding temporal prediction and extreme breathing motion. Data were acquired of four volunteers, with breathing instructions and a <b>respiratory</b> <b>belt.</b> The model was built from these data using spatial prediction only and using temporal forward prediction of 300 ms to 1200 ms, using the extended Kalman filter. From temporal prediction of 0 ms to 1200 ms ahead, the Dice coefficient of liver overlap decreased with 0. 85 %, the median liver surface distance increased with 20. 6 % and the vessel misalignment increased with 20 %. The mean vessel misalignment was 2. 9 mm for the original method, 3. 42 mm for spatial prediction with a respiratory signal and 4. 01 mm for prediction of 1200 ms ahead with a respiratory signal. Although the extension of the model to temporal prediction yields a decreased prediction accuracy, the results are still acceptable. The use of the breathing signal as input to the model is feasible. Sudden changes in the breathing pattern can yield large errors. However, these errors only persist during a short time interval, after which they can be corrected automatically.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} a general framework for multiple coil MRI reconstruction {{in the presence}} of elastic physiological motion. On the assumption that motion is known or can be predicted, it is shown that the reconstruction problem is equivalent to solving an integral equation [...] known in the literature as a Fredholm equation of the first kind [...] with a generalized kernel comprising Fourier and coil sensitivity encoding, modified by physiological motion information. Numerical solutions are found using an iterative linear system solver. The different steps in the numerical resolution are discussed, in particular it is shown how over-determination can be used to improve the conditioning of the generalized encoding operator. Practical implementation requires prior knowledge of displacement fields, so a model of patient motion is described which allows elastic displacements to be predicted from various input signals (e. g., <b>respiratory</b> <b>belts,</b> ECG, navigator echoes), after a free-breathing calibration scan. Practical implementation was demonstrated with a moving phantom setup and in two free-breathing healthy subjects, with images from the thoracic-abdominal region.

40|$|Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation (AFES) {{has been}} shown to improve the {{respiratory}} function of people with tetraplegia. The effectiveness of AFES can be enhanced by using different stimulation parameters for quiet breathing and coughing. The signal from a spirometer, coupled with a facemask, has previously been used to differentiate between these breath types. In this study, the suitability of less intrusive sensors was investigated with able-bodied volunteers. Signals from two <b>respiratory</b> effort <b>belts,</b> positioned around the chest and the abdomen, were used with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, trained on a participant by participant basis, to classify, in real-time, respiratory activity as either quiet breathing or coughing. This was compared with the classification accuracy achieved using a spirometer signal and an SVM. The signal from the belt positioned around the chest provided an acceptable classification performance compared to the signal from a spirometer (mean cough (c) and quiet breath (q) sensitivity (Se) of Se c = 92. 9 % and Se q = 96. 1 % vs. Se c = 90. 7 % and Se q = 98. 9 %).

30|$|Respiratory and cardiac {{motion in}} PET/MR imaging leads to reduced {{quantitative}} and qualitative image accuracy. Correction methodologies involve the use of double gated acquisitions which lead to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and to issues concerning the combination of cardiac and respiratory frames. The objective of this work {{is to use a}} generalized reconstruction by inversion of coupled systems (GRICS) approach, previously used for PET/MR respiratory motion correction, combined with a cardiac phase signal and a reconstruction incorporated PET motion correction approach in order to reconstruct motion free images from dual gated PET acquisitions. The GRICS method consists of formulating parallel MRI in the presence of patient motion as a coupled inverse problem. Its resolution, using a fixed-point method, allows the reconstructed image to be improved using a motion model constructed from the raw MR data and two <b>respiratory</b> <b>belts.</b> GRICS obtained <b>respiratory</b> displacements are interpolated using the cardiac phase derived from an ECG to model simultaneous cardiac and respiratory motion. Three different volunteer datasets (4 DMR acquisitions) were used for evaluation. GATE was used to simulate 4 DPET datasets corresponding to the acquired 4 DMR images. Simulated data were subsequently binned using 16 cardiac phases (M 1) vs diastole only (M 2), in combination with 8 respiratory amplitude gates. Respiratory and cardiac motion corrected PET images using either M 1 or M 2 were compared to respiratory only corrected images and evaluated in terms of SNR and contrast improvement. Significant visual improvements were obtained when correcting simultaneously for respiratory and cardiac motion (using 16 cardiac phase or diastole only) compared to respiratory motion only compensation. Results were confirmed by an associated increased SNR and contrast. Results indicate that using GRICS is an efficient tool for respiratory and cardiac motion correction in dual gated PET/MR imaging.|$|R
30|$|This {{simulation}} study analyses {{the effects}} of a badly aligned anatomical image relative to the PET dataset for the purpose of PVC of lesions in PET cardiac datasets. A few limitations of this study come from the ideal-case scenario we are currently considering. First of all, we utilize a single cardiac and respiratory PET gate, assuming that a perfect motion correction of the PET dataset is performed. We believe that this {{is the best way to}} clearly assess the effect of the different partial volume correction techniques, without confounding the effect of the motion blur with the partial volume effect. This said, we acknowledge that the breathing and beating motion are a tangible and cumbersome issue when cardiac datasets are of interest and that in the current clinical practice, there is often no time nor means to perform a fully dual-gated PET reconstruction. For this reason, we performed an additional simulation study where we purposely did not correct for the respiratory motion (i.e. only ECG gating is performed, which can be easily done in clinical practice) and we just applied the PVC techniques on such datasets. With this additional study, we demonstrated that the heart motions (both due to breathing and beating) need to be corrected for in order for PVC to successfully take place. The optimal compensation of one of the two motions would improve the noise properties of the resulting reconstructions, in all cases. However, a further improvement in lesion visibility can always be observed when the prior information is used. In addition, even in the best-case scenario where dual gating can be performed, sometimes a perfect motion correction simply cannot be achieved. This can be due to delays or imperfections in the insertion of the triggers in the PET dataset, or to gross patient motion that can occur during the scan and is not corrected for, or to the violated assumption of correlation between the external motion tracked by the external tracking devices (e.g. <b>respiratory</b> <b>belts)</b> and the internal motion of the heart, or to the unpredictable motion pattern of a real, patient heart (e.g. deformations occurring during the breathing), or to the too simplistic gating method used for motion correction. In all these non-ideal situations, the gating process can only be correct to a certain extent. If the heart does not behave as modelled by the gating software, part of the activity will be misplaced, and any of the PVC techniques presented would simply smooth over activity regions regardless of how well motion correction was performed.|$|R

Frequently, {{these problems are}} attributed to learned behavioral patterns, but {{little is known about}} organic causes of sleep disturbances in children. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common cause of sleep disordered breathing in adults. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is also common in this population. Less is known about OSA and GER as potential causative agents of sleep disturbances in children, and these medical problems have not been addressed in Icelandic children. This study was designed to investigate the organic causes of sleep disordered breathing in Icelandic children, evaluate their severity and possible therapies. Material and methods: One hundred and ninty children who were referred to the Pediatric Department at Reykjavik Hospital due to sleep disturbances were hospitalized over night and a sleep study was recorded, using the sleep equipment, EMBLA. The latter machine has 16 channels that record informations about sleep patterns and breathing. The children were 0 - 18 years of age. Informations were collected from EEGs, EMGs, and eye movements to determine sleep stages, and with <b>respiratory</b> <b>belts</b> with sensors on the chest and abdomen as well as an air-flow sensor that measures airflow through the nose and mouth. When GER was suspected, a pH meter was inserted and the pH values were measured in the upper and lower parts of the esophagus. Results: The results demonstrate {{that a large number of}} children who suffer from sleep disturbances have an underlying disease. Of 61 children who underwent a sleep study and were suspected to have OSA, 46 had a positive study that resulted in a change in therapy. In addition, 69 of 89 children who underwent pH measurements in the esophagus were diagnosed with GER which prompted changes in therapy. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that both OSA and GER are common problems in children with sleep disturbances. We conclude that sleep studies are important in the overall workup of children with sleep disturbances, and can provide valuable informations regarding the causes, prevalence and severity of these medical problems. Sleep studies also facilitate the selection of children who require specific treatments such as operation of the oropharynx or CPAP/BiPAP treatment for OSA, or drug therapy for GER.

Additionally, the study aimed to determine the feasibility of creating a laboratory curriculum for a cutaneous electrogastrography experiment that an undergraduate could perform, analyze, and interpret during a three hour physiology lab. Through this study and the laboratory procedures designed from the experiment, undergraduates will be able to interpret the physiological aspects of gastrointestinal function within the human body, including how it is effected by mental stress. According to previous studies by Yin et al. (2004) and Vianna and Tranel (2006), mental stress was expected to inhibit normal gastric motility patterns on an EGG recording. A subject group of 20 University of Mississippi students between the ages of 18 and 23 were recruited via email and gave informed consent prior to participating. Upon arrival to the lab, subjects were asked if they had done the required fasting of 6 to 8 hours before the experiment. In preparation for the experiment, each subject had three EGG electrodes positioned on the abdomen, electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes positioned on the wrists with a ground electrode on the right ankle, and a <b>respiratory</b> rate <b>belt</b> around the lower thorax. Subjects were asked to lie in a supine position during the 30 minute EGG recordings. The first EGG recording session occurred while the subject was still in the fasting state, and the second EGG recording occurred after the subject ingested a test meal. During the second EGG recording session, either a negative slideshow of still images intended to induce slight mental stress or a positive slideshow with still images intended to induce serenity and comfort was played for the subjects to watch. Furthermore, ECG and respiratory rate recordings were conducted on all subjects during each EGG recording session. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean change (post-prandial minus pre-prandial) EGG cycles per minute (CPM) between the positive and negative post-prandial stimuli (P(1, 18) = 0. 604); however, there was a significant increase from 2. 679 CPM to 3. 026 CPM between the pre-prandial and post-prandial mean EGG cycles per minute of all tested subjects (P(1, 38) = 0. 000297). The positive group’s heart rate increased from 64. 955 beats per minute (BPM) to 69. 024 BPM, and the negative group’s heart rate increased from 60. 784 BPM to 63. 229 BPM. The positive group’s respiratory rate increased from 12. 288 breaths per minute (BrPM) to 13. 883 BrPM, and the negative group’s respiratory rate increased from 15. 852 BrPM to 17. 290 BrPM. There was no significant difference in the mean change (post-prandial minus pre-prandial) heart rate beats per minute and respiratory rate breaths per minute between the positive and negative postprandial stimuli. There was also no significant difference between the pre-prandial and post-prandial mean heart rate and respiratory rate of all tested subjects. Although the BPM and BrPM of the study did not occur as predicted, the study can be used to create a cutaneous electrogastrography experiment for undergraduate physiology students. The study and the physiology lab can be improved by finding a more appropriate way to induce mental stress in the subjects...|$|R
40|$|An {{injury to}} the {{cervical}} region of the spinal cord can cause paralysis affecting all four limbs, termed tetraplegia. People with tetraplegia also have paralysis or impaired function of the major respiratory muscles, namely the diaphragm and intercostal and abdominal muscles. This often reduces respiratory function, with associated respiratory complications {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality for this population. Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation (AFES), the application of electrical pulses to the abdominal muscles causing them to contract, has been shown to improve respiratory function in tetraplegia. Despite these positive results, further work is needed to establish AFES as a standard clinical treatment. The aim of this thesis is to support the clinical introduction of AFES. This was achieved by addressing two primary objectives. Firstly, the development of new technologies and protocols to optimise AFES for use in a clinical setting. Secondly, the clinical evaluation of these technologies and protocols with tetraplegic patients. For research purposes, AFES has typically been applied manually, requiring an operator to synchronise stimulation with respiratory activity. One important step necessary for the clinical introduction of AFES is the development of an automated AFES device that can apply stimulation in synchrony with the users respiratory activity, with different stimulation parameters applied for different breath types such as a quiet breath and a cough. In this thesis, the signal from a non-intrusive <b>respiratory</b> effort <b>belt,</b> worn around the chest, was used to develop a statistical classifcation algorithm capable of classifying respiratory activity in real-time, and applying AFES in synchrony with the user's respiratory activity. The effectiveness of AFES can also be enhanced by stimulating at the abdominal muscle motor points. In this thesis the positions of the abdominal motor points were located systematically for the frst time, in ten able bodied and five tetraplegic participants. To aid the clinical introduction of AFES it is necessary to establish the patient groups who would benefit most from this intervention, and to develop appropriate clinical protocols. This is addressed in two clinical studies, where the feasibility and effectiveness of AFES to improve the respiratory function of the acute ventilator dependant and sub-acute tetraplegic populations was demonstrated. In the first study, conducted with 10 acute ventilator dependant tetraplegics, AFES was applied on alternate weeks for a total duration of eight weeks. This resulted in acute improvements in breathing and led to a longitudinal increase in respiratory function over the study duration. It was found that participants weaned from mechanical ventilation on average 11 days faster than matched historic controls. Previous work, which investigated the effect of a three week AFES training programme on the respiratory function of people with sub-acute tetraplegia, suggested that an extended AFES training programme may be more effective. In the second clinical study in this thesis, a continuous eight week AFES training protocol (combined with a six week control period) was evaluated with three sub-acute tetraplegic participants. The application of AFES led to an acute increase in respiratory function, with a longitudinal improvement in respiratory function observed throughout the study. In a single participant case study, the feasibility of combining AFES with assisted coughing delivered by mechanical insufflation-exsufflation was demonstrated for the first time. This was shown to lead to an acute improvement in respiratory function at six of the eight assessment sessions, indicating that this technique could be used to aid secretion removal. This thesis highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of AFES to improve the respiratory function of the acute ventilator dependant and sub-acute tetraplegic populations. The clinical protocols that enable AFES to be used with these patient groups, and the technological developments detailed throughout this thesis, are an important step towards the introduction of AFES as a regular treatment modality...|$|R
