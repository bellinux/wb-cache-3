40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between capital flows, turnover and returns for the UK private real estate market. We examine {{a number of possible}} implication of capital flows and turnover on capital returns testing for evidence of a price pressure effect, ‘return chasing’ behaviour and information revelation. The main tool of analysis is a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) regression model in which institutional capital flows, turnover and returns are specified as endogenous variables in a two equation system in which we also control for macro-economic variables. Data on flows, turnover and returns are obtained for the 10 market segments covering the main UK commercial real estate sectors. Our results do not support the widely-held belief among practitioners that capital flows have a ‘price pressure’ effect. Although there is some evidence of return chasing behaviour, the short timescales involved suggest this finding may be due to delayed <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> relative to returns given the difficulties of market entry. We find a significant positive relationship between lagged turnover and contemporaneous capital returns, suggesting that asset turnover provides pricing information. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purposes of}} the present study were to: (1) observe and develop a fundamental understanding <b>of</b> the <b>flow</b> regimes and their transitions occurring in helical and spiral coils; and (2) obtain pressure drop measurements <b>of</b> such <b>flows,</b> and, if possible, develop a method for predicting pressure drop in these flow geometries. Elaborating upon the above, the general intent is to develop criteria (preferably generalized) for establishing the nature <b>of</b> the <b>flow</b> dynamics (e. g. flow patterns) and the magnitude of the pressure drop in such configurations over a range <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> rates and fluid properties.

40|$|We {{report on}} three GPS <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> the Larsen C Ice Shelf, {{spanning}} 2 months to 2 years. Variations in speed are evident at periods {{from a few}} hours to similar to 182 days, including semi-diurnal, diurnal and similar to 14. 76 days. At fortnightly periods the ice shelf varies by +/- 10 % from its long-term speed but at diurnal timescales it is up to +/- 100 %. A nonlinear relationship between ocean tides and velocity is required to explain the observed variations in flow. As an initial examination we model flow as a non-linear function of basal shear stress including tidal perturbations in the ice shelf grounding zone and show that the major features of the observations are reproduced, notably the long-period signal largely absent from the vertical tidal signal. Alternative explanations are discussed. These observations demonstrate that the ice shelf system is highly sensitive to relatively modest changes in forcing at its boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Having a long <b>record</b> <b>of</b> stream <b>flow</b> is very {{valuable}} in planning water resources development projects. However, in many occasions, stream flow records {{are available for}} very short periods though very long rainfall records are available. Therefore, possibility to relate rainfall over a catchment to the stream flow at its outlet will enable having a long <b>record</b> <b>of</b> stream <b>flow.</b> Besides prediction <b>of</b> stream <b>flow</b> using already available predicted rainfall will permit taking precautionary measures in water related disaster situations such as floods and droughts. This paper presents a research carried out to find a model to predict daily stream <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> Kalu River at Ratnapura. The model, a non-linear regression model based on Marquardt’s procedure, was developed using measured daily stream flow at Kalu River at Ratnapura and daily rainfall at eight rainfall gauging stations within the catchment above Ratnapura.

The constructed reservoir models are compared against models constructed with standard geostatistical procedures that do not make use of seismic data.

The aortic valve closed effectively during regular ventricular contractions. However, aortic reflux was observed whenever a weak ventricular contraction produced an opening of the aortic valve that was barely detectable, as evidenced by a minimal aortic pressure pulse and stroke volume. This type of aortic regurgitation was mild and invariably occurred {{at the end of}} ventricular ejection, coincident with the aortic incisura. Such regurgitation may be clinically significant in some instances of bigeminal rhythm or rapid atrial fibrillation, and is especially important for the evaluation of aortic angiograms. It further supports the concept that competent aortic valve closure depends on vortex formation in the sinus of Valsalva of sufficient degree to keep the aortic valve leaflets in partia...|$|R

Here, in <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> speed and isotopic composition of surface and bottom waters from a Deep Western Boundary Current location near the northern source of North Atlantic Deep Water, we show both orbital and millennial-scale coupling between deep ocean flow and climate in the middle Pleistocene (0. 75 – 0. 87 Ma), when the boundary conditions in terms of the mean state and amplitude of climate change were different from more recent periods. The coupling appears as a phased series of events initiated by reduced vertical density gradients and initial ventilation of deep waters. The occurrence of these events in interglacials during the middle Pleistocene suggests that the millennial-scale climate variability in the North Atlantic was more pronounced at that time than previously thought. This demonstrates that, given the right boundary conditions, rapid climate shifts can also occur during relatively warm climate conditions...|$|R
