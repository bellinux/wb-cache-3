5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} <b>runs</b> <b>scored</b> by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total <b>runs</b> <b>scored</b> by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

40|$|In baseball, an {{offensive}} team's <b>run</b> <b>scoring</b> ability is dependent not only upon the batting skills of its players, {{but also their}} baserunning abilities. Using a Monte Carlo simulation based on actual statistics of real players, we estimate {{the magnitude of the}} effect of baserunning skills upon a team's <b>run</b> <b>scoring</b> ability. Our results largely confirm previous non-academic estimates that the impact of baserunning upon a team's <b>run</b> <b>scoring</b> ability is typically less than ± 25 runs per season. However, we show using simple heuristic algorithms, that a team composed of the best (worst) nine baserunners could gain (lose) as many as 70 (55), runs per season due to baserunning. ...|$|R
