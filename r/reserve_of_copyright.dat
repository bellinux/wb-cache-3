40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} how the policy-year {{structures}} of expense ratios and surrender rates affect the distributions <b>of</b> policy <b>reserves.</b> Our results show that a convex expense ratio curve, though reduces the mean and the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>reserves,</b> could make the beneficial impact of surrenders on insurers become detrimental. Our results also show that the convexity of the surrender rate curve is favorable to insurers while the volatilities of surrender rates are unfavorable. We further find that neglecting the policy-year structures of surrender rates and expense ratios may result in overestimation of the mean and the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>reserves.</b> <b>Copyright</b> (c) The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2009. ...|$|R

Secrecy is modeled by assuming that financial markets are unc ertain about a parameter in the Federal Reserve reaction function.

The main result of the paper is that secr ecy tends to increase the volatility of the funds rate and <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> aggregates. <b>Copyright</b> 1987 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{opportunity}} cost <b>of</b> holding international <b>reserves</b> plays {{a central role}} in all models of optimal demand for foreign exchange. This cost is conventionally defined as the difference between the yield on reserves and the marginal productivity forgone from an alternative investment in fixed capital. Most empirical studies have failed to find a significant opportunity-cost effect, since none of them measure it in accordance with its theoretical definition. The results for Israel show that, when this cost is measured properly, {{it turns out to be}} a crucial determinant <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> demand. <b>Copyright</b> 1992 by MIT Press. ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we study}} the {{determinants}} of cross-country variation in the level <b>of</b> international <b>reserves</b> over the period 1981 – 1995. Confirming intuition, trade openness is easily the most important variable. There is also some evidence that financial deepening is associated {{with an increase in}} the reserves ratio. Smaller and more volatile industrial countries hold larger reserves than their larger, less volatile counterparts. In addition, more indebted developing countries tend to have smaller reserve ratios. We view these results as establishing some interesting stylized facts that may be helpful in informing future theoretical modeling <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> behavior. <b>Copyright</b> Kluwer Academic Publishers 2001 foreign reserves, openness, volatility, financial development, external debt,...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{copyright protection}} for stage directions. Copyright law dictates that stage directions {{are subject to}} copyright protection, as they are original creative works that can easily be fixed in a tangible medium. Under their union contracts, theatre directors <b>reserve</b> ownership <b>of</b> the <b>copyright</b> in stage directions. Directors who believe that their staging has been misappropriated by a later director can prove infringement through showing access and substantial similarity. The doctrines of merger and scenes a faire, however, limit the extent <b>of</b> that <b>copyright</b> protection. If copyright law fails to fully vindicate a director 2 ̆ 7 s hoped-for rights in stage directions, other legal theories also pose their own hurdles. Ultimately, a director {{should be able to}} successfully sue a later director for copyright infringement if the later director closely copies the most striking features of the original director 2 ̆ 7 s staging.

40|$|ENGLISHENGLISHENGLISHENGLISH SUMMARYSUMMARYSUMMARYSUMMARY My diploma thesis {{deals with}} the topic of non-contractual use <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> works, which is {{important}} and still evolving part <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> law. International copyright treaties, European Union directives and national laws lay down specific exceptions and limitations <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> that enable person other than the author to use in special cases copyrighted works without author's permission. They represent {{the exception to the}} rule, that {{it is not possible to}} use copyright protected works without having author's or other right-holder's authorisation. The objective of these limitations and exceptions is to achieve a fair balance between interests of authors on the one hand and interests of the users of works on the other hand. Therefore they limit authors' exclusive economic rights in order to answer to the public interest in the easy and wide accessibility <b>of</b> the <b>copyright</b> protected works. The legal regulation of non-contractual use <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> works must be continuously updated to fulfill its purpose. The fast development of digital technologies brings new possibilities of use and exploitation <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> works and leads to changes in copyright law including the exceptions and limitations <b>of</b> <b>copyright.</b> The goal <b>of</b> today's <b>copyright</b> legislator is [...] ...|$|R
