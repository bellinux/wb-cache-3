Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Are {{reasons for}} action facts or {{psychological}} states? There are two answers {{in the literature}} on the ontology of reasons. According to the Standard Story, normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts, while motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states. According to the factualist, both normative and motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts. In this paper I argue that neither of these views is satisfactory. The Standard Story errs in thinking that the two kinds of <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> different ontological entities. The factualist gets this right, but incurs some distasteful ontological commitments by thinking of motivating reasons as facts. We should, thus, give a proper hearing to the only serious logically possible alternative to the two existing views: both motivating and normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states...|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} making beer is known as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E

40|$|To explain an {{intentional}} action one must exhibit the agent’s reasons. Donald Davidson famously {{argued that the}} only clear way to understand action explanation is to hold that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. Davidson’s discussion conflated two issues: whether <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes and whether reasons causally explain intentional action. Contemporary work on explanation and normativity help disentangle these issues and ground an argument that intentional action explanations cannot be a species of causal explanation. Interestingly, this conclusion is consistent with Davidson’s conclusion that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. In other words, <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes, but rationalizing explanations are not causal explanations...|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E

Two <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> that directors are overloaded with information but also lack information independent of management to evaluate manage-ment and the business. A third <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that directors do not have systemic processes to dis-cover if their trust in management is misplaced. A fourth and fifth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that directors have absolute power to manage their own conflicts of interest and a dominant shareholder can enter into related party transactions that can unfairly extract value. The sixth and seventh <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> the incentive for directors not {{to blow the whistle}} on their colleagues and the impotence of a director to act alone. The eighth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that shares can be manipulated and traded cov-ertly. Four changes in corporate constitutions are identified that could remove these concerns. These are to establish a watchdog board, introduce cumulative voting for directors, establish stakeholder councils and introducing sunlight share trading...|$|R
