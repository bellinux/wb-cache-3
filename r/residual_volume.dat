5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the <b>residual</b> <b>volume.</b> Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all the air}} in {{the lungs}} can be {{expelled}} during maximally forced exhalation. This is the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> of about 1.0-1.5liters which cannot be measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> (i.e. functional residual capacity of about 2.5-3.0liters, and total lung capacity of about 6liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their measurement requires special techniques.|$|E

40|$|The early {{postoperative}} phase after transtibial amputation {{is characterized}} by rapid <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> reduction. Accurate measurement of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> {{is important for the}} timing of fitting a prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the reduction of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> in people with transtibial amputation and to correlate <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> with <b>residual</b> limb circumference. In a longitudinal cohort study of 21 people who had a transtibial amputation, <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> was measured using a laser scanner and circumference was measured using a tape measure 1 wk postamputation and every 3 wk thereafter until 24 wk postamputation. A linear mixed model analysis was performed with weeks postamputation transformed according to the natural logarithm as predictor. <b>Residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> decreased significantly over time, with a large variation between patients. <b>Residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> did not correlate well with circumference. On average, <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> decreased 200. 5 mL (9. 7 % of the initial volume) per natural logarithm of the weeks postamputation.

This systematic review assesses {{what is known about}} measurement and management of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> change in persons with lower-limb amputation. Publications that met inclusion criteria were grouped into three categories: group I: descriptions of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> measurement techniques; group II: studies investigating the effect of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> change on clinical care in people with lower-limb amputation; and group III: studies of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> management techniques or descriptions of techniques for accommodating or controlling <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume.</b> We found that many techniques for the measurement of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume</b> have been described but clinical use is limited largely because current techniques lack adequate resolution and in-socket measurement capability. Overall, limited evidence exists regarding the management of <b>residual</b> limb <b>volume,</b> and the evidence available focuses primarily on adults with transtibial amputation in the early postoperative phase.

40|$|ABSTRACT Measurement of {{specific}} amounts of gastric <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> in tube-fed patients often precludes {{the objective of}} the therapy: to provide nutrition. There is no agreement in the literature regarding the exact amount of <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> necessary to stop or maintain feeding. Measurements of gastric <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> should be used in conjunction with sound clinical judgment before deci-sions are made to stop enteral nutrition. Tube feeding has become an essential tool in the care of malnourished patients who have a functional gastrointestinal tract. Methods to provide safe and effective tube feeding are frequently discussed in the literature. Tube-feeding tolerance is often measured by checking gastric “residuals. ” If the residual vol-umes are too high, the clinician stops the feeding t...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of a software program which is able to control adaptively the feed speed level during a finishing operation of milling of free-formed surfaces. Final machining speeds depend on <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> that are left on the surface after the roughing operation. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with problems based on <b>residual</b> <b>volumes.</b> There are descriptions of up-to-date solutions of this problem by CAD/CAM systems and research teams. The main part of the work is the development of a regulation algorithm. This algorithm is able to regulate the feed speed at every single moment of machining in dependence of the <b>residual</b> <b>volumes.</b> An example of a free-formed surface machining with and without optimizing of the feed speed, force records and comment are described in the experimental part of the thesis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the intrapatient reproducibility {{of the extent}} and anatomic distribution of air trapping at sequential expiratory thin-section computed tomographic (CT) examinations in heart-lung transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen heart-lung transplant recipients (eight with and 11 without bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [BOS]) underwent three expiratory CT examinations within 1 hour. <b>Residual</b> <b>volumes</b> were measured at CT. Anatomic distribution and extent of air trapping were scored by two observers at two independent readings, and the reproducibility of observations was calculated for each feature. CT examination results were compared by using {{an analysis of variance}} that took into account interobserver and BOS and non-BOS effects. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to test the association between variability of <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> and variability of the extent of air trapping. RESULTS: <b>Residual</b> <b>volumes</b> did not significantly differ between the three CT examinations (P =. 556). Reproducibility values for findings of anatomic distribution of air trapping ranged from 84 % to 95 %, with a tendency toward improved reproducibility in patients without BOS. Mean reproducibility values for the extent of air trapping ranged from 97. 1 % to 97. 7 %, and no substantial difference in these values between patients with and those without BOS was observed. The Spearman rank coefficient for the correlation between variability of <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> and variability of extent of air trapping ranged from 0. 382 to 0. 568 (P =. 105 -. 016). No interobserver effect was detected (P =. 944). CONCLUSION: Anatomic distribution and extent are reproducible characteristics of air trapping. No substantial variability of air trapping occurs in functionally stable heart-lung transplant recipients. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Residual</b> urine <b>volume</b> is {{measured}} to diagnose various neurogenic and obstructive disorders of the urinary bladder. However, it is hypothesized that cystotomy closure using inverting patterns decreases intraluminal diameter of urinary bladder which consequently reduce <b>residual</b> bladder <b>volume.</b> This study aimed {{to investigate the}} ideal suturing style for cystotomy incision closure which would exert the least effect on <b>residual</b> bladder <b>volume.</b> The effect of various suturing styles on <b>residual</b> bladder <b>volume</b> was studied sonographically. <b>Residual</b> Bladder <b>Volume</b> (RBV) was calculated by the formula, i. e. RBV=L×W× (DL+DT) / 2 × 0. 625, where L=longitudinal diameter, W=transverse diameter, DL= depth at longitudinal diameter, DT=depth at transverse diameter. 24 healthy mongrel dogs were selected and randomly divided into four equal groups A, B, C and D (n= 6). In groups A, B and C, the cystotomy incision was subsequently closed by two-layered appositional suturing pattern, two-layered inverting pattern and three layers ({{using a combination of}} appositional and inverting styles), respectively. Group-D remained as sham-operated Control. The results clearly showed that the three-layered closure technique using a combination of appositional and inverting patterns (Group-C), significantly reduced the bladder volume (P< 0. 01). Two-layered inverting patterns (Group B), also reduced the bladder volume but not up to a significant level, whereas, the appositional suturing technique (group-A) exerted the least effect on <b>residual</b> bladder <b>volume.</b> Conclusively, it was inferred that a two-layered appositional suturing pattern should be preferred for closure of cystotomy incision to avoid significant changes in <b>residual</b> bladder <b>volume.</b> ...|$|R
