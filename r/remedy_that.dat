5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> problem.|$|E
5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E

25|$|A recent use {{of equal}} {{protection}} doctrine came in Bush v. Gore (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in Florida {{in the aftermath}} of the 2000 presidential election. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices Souter and Breyer joined the majority of five—but only, it should be emphasized, for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – {{though it has}} yet to do so – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws. When a piece of legislation is ruled as unconstitutional, a lacuna or gap in the law may ensue as the legislation is void retrospectively and prospectively. The situation is exacerbated if the legislation is one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome the negative impact of such a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{overlap between}} {{criminal}} law and tort. For example, in English law an assault {{is both a}} crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person, usually the victim, to obtain a <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> serves their own purposes (for example by the payment of damages to a person injured in a car accident, or the obtaining of injunctive relief to stop a person interfering with their business). Criminal actions {{on the other hand}} are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a personalthough often criminal courts do have power to grant such remediesbut to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. This explains why incarceration is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts. In early common law, the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} {{possible}} remedies where a claimant {{is found to}} have committed a nuisance; injunctions, damages and abatement. Injunctions are the main remedy, and consist of an order to stop the activity causing the nuisance. They may be [...] "perpetual", completely forbidding the activity, or [...] "partial", for example limiting when the activity can take place. Damages are a monetary sum paid by the defendant for the claimant's loss of enjoyment or any physical damage suffered; they may be paid for things as varied as loss of sleep or any loss of comfort caused by noise or smells. Abatement is a <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> allows the claimant to directly end the nuisance, such as trimming back a protruding hedge. If the abatement requires the claimant stepping onto the defendant's land, he must give notice or risk becoming a trespasser.|$|E
500|$|In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld Section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{which prohibits}} {{certain forms of}} {{literacy}} requirements as a condition to vote, as a valid exercise of Congressional power under Section 5 to enforce the Equal Protection Clause. The Court ruled that Section 5 enabled Congress to act both remedially and prophylactically {{to protect the rights}} guaranteed by the amendment. However, in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), the Court narrowed Congress's enforcement power, holding that Congress may not enact legislation under Section 5 that substantively defines or interprets Fourteenth Amendment rights. The Court ruled that legislation is valid under Section 5 only if there is a [...] "congruence and proportionality" [...] between the injury to a person's Fourteenth Amendment right and the means Congress adopted to prevent or <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> injury.|$|E

500|$|In {{their native}} lands, mole crickets have natural enemies that keep them under control. This {{is not the}} case when they have been accidentally {{introduced}} {{to other parts of the}} world. In Florida they are considered pests and are described as [...] "a serious problem". A University of Florida Entomology report suggests that South American Neoscapteriscus mole crickets may have entered the United States at Brunswick, Georgia in ship's ballast from southern South America around 1899, but were at that time mistakenly believed to be from the West Indies. [...] One possible remedy is biological pest control using the parasitoidal wasps Larra bicolor. Another <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> has been successfully applied is use of the parasitic nematode Steinernema scapterisci. When this is applied in strips across grassland, it spreads throughout the pasture within a few months and not only controls the mole crickets, but remains infective in the soil for future years.|$|E
500|$|The pumping {{engine for}} use in mines was a great success. In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt's {{invention}} so that the engine had a rotary motion, making it suitable {{for use in}} mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would <b>remedy</b> <b>that</b> defect. [...] Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine, warning that they were reaching {{the limits of the}} pumping engine market: [...] "There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, which is certainly an extensive field." [...] Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, completed it {{at the end of the}} year. [...] One order was received in 1782, and several others from mills and breweries soon after. [...] George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine. [...] As a demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. [...] While the mill was not financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a [...] "publicity stunt par excellence" [...] for the firm's latest innovation. [...] Before its 1791 destruction by fire, the mill's fame, according to early historian Samuel Smiles, [...] "spread far and wide", and orders for rotative engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies.|$|E
