The system {{consists of a}} common <b>rack</b> <b>for</b> <b>mounting</b> both video and telemetry equipment, which makes installation easier and more time efficient. Prior to the one-rack concept, the video, TSPI, and telemetry were all installed as separate entities competing for space, power, and time. Requirements to downlink High-Definition (HD) video from the aircraft prompted research into technological improvements in transmitters, onboard encoders, and recorders. These advances allowed the integration of video, analog sensors, and aircraft bus data into a single telemetry stream. Future advancements will include combining multiple HD video sources in a single downlink...|$|E

50|$|<b>For</b> <b>rack</b> <b>mounted</b> {{computer}} servers, devices generally {{intake air}} {{on the front and}} exhaust on the rear. This prevents circular airflows where hot exhaust air is recirculated through an adjacent device and causes overheating.|$|R
50|$|A Rack rail, or rack strip, is used {{to mount}} rackable {{electronic}} hardware and 19-inch rack mount accessories within a 19-inch rack. Within a rack {{a minimum of two}} rack rails are required to mount equipment. The height of rack rail is determined by the number of <b>rack</b> units required <b>for</b> <b>mounting</b> the equipment.|$|R
50|$|Racks are {{available}} with either four or two vertical posts. Four-post <b>racks</b> allow <b>for</b> <b>mounting</b> rails to support the equipment at the front and rear. These racks may be open in construction (similar to the traditional open-style two-post racks), or may be enclosed by front and/or rear doors, side panels, or tops. Two-post racks provide just two vertical posts; {{a piece of equipment}} can be mounted either via its front panel holes, or close to its center of gravity (to minimize load on its front panel), depending on the design of the rack. Two-post racks are most often used for telecommunication installations.|$|R
50|$|Evolving {{technology}} and sampling has {{allowed him to}} use a smaller rig of 4 or 3 keyboards {{with an array of}} rack mounted synth modules to emulate many of the earlier sounds. His concert rigs since When in Rome 2007 include Korg Wavestation and Roland A-90 keyboard acting as MIDI controllers <b>for</b> <b>rack</b> <b>mounted</b> Korg Wavestation SR, Roland JD-990, Yamaha TX7, E-mu Proteus I and II, and E-mu EIV, as well as Korg OASYS as a master keyboard.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec <b>for</b> <b>rack</b> <b>mounting</b> in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|R
50|$|The {{density of}} {{computing}} power and stackability of pizza box systems also made them attractive {{for use in}} data centers. Systems originally designed for desktop use were placed on shelves inside of 19&#8209;inch racks, sometimes requiring that part of their cases be cut off {{in order for them}} to fit. Since the late 1990s, pizza boxes have been a common form factor in data centers or industrial applications where rack space and density are critical. Servers in this form factor, as well as higher-end Ethernet switches, are now designed <b>for</b> <b>rack</b> <b>mounting.</b> Rack mount 1U computers come in all types of configurations and depths.|$|R
50|$|Attributes {{of merit}} for {{electrically}} controlled devices, include {{speed of response}} and avoiding degradation of the transmitted signal. Dynamic range is usually quite restricted, and power feedback may mean that long term stability is a relatively minor issue. Speed of response is a particularly major issue in dynamically reconfigurable systems, where a delay of one millionth of a second can result {{in the loss of}} large amounts of transmitted data. Typical technologies employed for high speed response include liquid crystal variable attenuator (LCVA), or lithium niobate devices. There is a class of built-in attenuators that is technically indistinguishable from test attenuators, except they are packaged <b>for</b> <b>rack</b> <b>mounting,</b> and have no test display.|$|R
40|$|The {{immunity}} {{of electrical}} and electronic equipment to repetitive electric fast transients/bursts (EFT) is {{regulated by the}} IEC 61000 - 4 - 4 standard, 2 nd edition. The test procedure recommended <b>for</b> <b>rack</b> <b>mounted</b> equipment is actually not very comfortable to implement. To improve this aspect of the standard, the working group charged to developing the new edition has addressed some attention to defining an improved test configuration. In this paper some configurations of rack mounted equipment subjected to EFT test are investigated by numerical simulations based on the use of a full-wave electromagnetic software tool, and of SPICE circuit simulator. The results of this activity have helped to define a new test setup that will appear in the 3 rd edition of the standard that is currently being voted...|$|R
