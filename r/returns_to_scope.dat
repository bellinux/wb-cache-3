The model characterizes insurers decisions on the face value and number of policies and the number of insurance lines. The model is applied to Canadian life insurance firms. Price-cost margins average from 13 % to 40 %. These margins emanate from information spillovers generated by marketing activities.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between firm size and research productivity in the Japanese top ten pharmaceutical firms for the years 1981 - 1994. By using the number of successful patents as research performance measure, we find significant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>scope</b> in drug discovery research. We also find nearly constant returns to scale at the individual therapeutic level. These findings suggest that Japanese pharmaceutical firms are relatively small in terms of research scope, regardless of firm size per se. The Japanese firms may be able to enlarge the scope of research without suffering from marginal productivity decline at the firm level. Concerning knowledge spillovers, we find positive correlation between domestic competitors ’ research spending and individual firm’s patenting. But we detect negative correlation between research expenditures of large western pharmaceutical firms and the Japanese firms ’ patenting. This suggests that appropriation mechanism of patent may be very effective in drug discovery research, and may predominate over probable knowledge spillovers among pharmaceutical firms especially in globally patented drug discovery research...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{determination}} of specialized codes under bounded rationality, {{and its implications for}} organizations. Agents may decrease communication costs by designing codes that …t their own environment, using for example more precise words for more frequent events. Bounded rationality imposes sharply decreasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>scope,</b> since when similarly skilled agents in di¤erent services must communicate with one another they must share common codes, which in turn degrades communication within each service. Thus the decision of whether to segregate services or integrate them trades o¤ the synergies that result from better coordination between services against the loss due to the need for a common, more vague, code than the one that would optimize communication within services. Alternatively, more skilled ‘translators’may be used to allow separate services to appropriate the synergies while keeping their own codes. A decrease in diagnosis costs leads to increasing integration among services and to the substitution of common codes for hierarchies, as common codes allow for the direct interaction among agents in different services. When adoption decisions are decentralized and noncontractible, the common code will be ine ¢ ciently biased towards th...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} {{consumer}} choice assume consumers {{are aware of}} all products for sale. This assumption is questionable, especially when applied to markets characterized by {{a high degree of}} change, such as the personal computer (PC) industry. I present an empirical discrete-choice model of limited information on the part of consumers, where advertising influences the set of products from which consumers choose to purchase. Multi-product firms choose prices and advertising in each medium to maximize their profits. I apply the model to the US PC market, in which advertising expenditures are over $ 2 billion annually. The estimation technique incorporates macro and micro data from three sources. Estimated median industry markups are 19 % over production costs. The high industry markups are explained in part by the fact that consumers know only some of the products for sale. Indeed estimates from traditional consumer choice models predict median markups of one fourth this magnitude. I find that product-specific demand curves are biased towards being too elastic under traditional models of consumer choice. The estimates suggest that PC firms use advertising media to target high-income households, that there are <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>scope</b> in group advertising, and that word-of-mouth or experience plays a role in informing consumers. The top firms engage in higher than average advertising and earn higher than average markups. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although most {{production}} activities involve multiple outputs, econometric models of production or cost functions normally involve only one single homogeneous output. The {{aim of this}} paper is to test the hypothesis that a multiproduct specification is superior to a model with a single homogenous product. To do this, we use a Multiproduct Symmetric Generalized McFadden (MSGM) cost function. This functional form is globally concave and flexible in the sense that it provides a second order differentiable approximation of any arbitrary cost function which is twice continuously differentiable and linear homogenous in input prices. In an empirical application on a panel data from ten Norwegian primary aluminium plants, we find support for our hypothesis. We present estimates of price elasticities, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale and <b>scope,</b> and product specific demand elasticities. Our results indicate economies of scope, i. e. it is more profitable to produce more than one output, and show sensitivity of factor demand when the product mix changes.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the production and cost technology of higher education institutions is of considerable policy interest as it motivates {{the structure of the}} sector—how large universities should be, and what mix of outputs they should produce. We review the literature and, using data for English institutions in 2013 – 14, apply appropriate frontier methods to model the structure of costs in this diverse sector. In doing so, we uncover information about the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale and <b>scope</b> within the higher education sector: in particular, the class of institutions comprising larger research-intensive universities and small specialist institutions could benefit from further concentrating postgraduate and research activity. We find that the universities comprising the English higher education sector are largely efficient (measured relative to observed practices) and that there is little scope for gains in technical efficiency from allocating resources on the basis of efficiency scores...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies on}} Japanese supplier-automaker {{relationships}} {{have focused on}} the nature of the dyadic inter-firm relationship and the performance of the assembler. We examine the relationship between a Japanese supplier's "customer scope strategy" (i. e. number of customers) and the supplier's performance. By analyzing data on 125 suppliers, we found that a supplier with broad automotive customer <b>scope</b> tends <b>to</b> be more profitable and is better off with less exclusive ties. This relationship held even after controlling for supplier size, product type, and the underlying competitiveness/efficiency of each supplier. We argue that a broad customer <b>scope</b> strategy Ieads <b>to</b> superior performance primarily due to learning opportunities. This finding highlights a key liability of vertical integration since integration of inputs often limits the ability of in-house divisions to access new customers. However, there is a limit to the advantages of a broad customer base, since sales to 'unrelated customers' (e. g., non-automotive) did not have a significant impact on performance. In short, there appear <b>to</b> be diminishing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> customer <b>scope</b> as suppliers add 'dissimilar' customers with requirements farther from their core knowledge domain. Thus, these findings offer empirical support for the knowledge based view of the firm which suggests that the efficient boundaries of firms are driven by knowledge domains/considerations. Our findings also suggest that studies that focus only on the advantages of long-term cooperative relationships may be misleading if interpreted to mean that an exclusive supplier-assembler relationship is the optimal solution for the supplier...|$|R
40|$|While {{the growing}} {{importance}} of off-farm earnings suggests large benefits accrue to farmers from efforts to expand off-farm income opportunities, survival still depends on greater efficiency. To comprehensively gauge the economic health of farm operator households we interpret off-farm income as an output along with corn, soybeans, livestock, and other crops. To accomplish this task we use two related methodologies. First, using 2000 data, we setup a multiactivity cost function to analyze labor allocation decisions within the farm operator household and also <b>to</b> estimate <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale and <b>scope.</b> Second, using 1996 - 2000 data, we follow an input distance function approach <b>to</b> estimate <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale, technical progress, cost economies, and technical efficiency [...] {{and compare the}} relative performance of farm operator households with and without off-farm wages and salaries. Our preliminary results suggest that over our sample period, scale economies are a primary factor driving up farm operator household size and decreasing the competitiveness of small farm operator households in the base farm operator household model where off-farm income is constrained to zero. But small farm operator households appear to achieve efficiency levels more comparable to larger farm operator households when off-farm income is accommodated. The evidence therefore suggests that while short-falls in these productivity components are decreasing the competitiveness of small farm operator households as agricultural structure changes, corn/soybean farm operator households have partially adapted to such pressures by increasing off-farm income and, therefore, achieving economies of scope.

30|$|Learning {{effects are}} gained through {{subsequent}} iterations of an operation, {{resulting in the}} increase of operational efficiency. The more attractive the chosen solution becomes due to accumulated skills and decreasing costs, the less attractive it becomes to switch to an alternative (Sydow et al. 2009). In addition, it is the aim of many organizations to maintain their “core competence” (Prahalad and Hamel 1990), that is, a set of successful strengths that tends to focus all learning abilities on refining this success. The learning effects are acquired in a specific field of practices and cannot be easily transferred to a new alternative. Therefore, the motivation to look for additional alternatives and to critically examine the established organizational practices is likely to decline progressively over time. Thus, {{it is argued that}} core competences and capabilities that develop over time always result in organizational inertia (Leonard-Barton 1992; Miller 1993). On the other hand, it is argued that it is rational to follow the path because the developed strategic pattern gains positive feedback (Koch 2011). According to Vergne and Durand (2010), the positive outcome for a firm of the path-dependent capability is more likely when asset complementarities, learning specialization, or increasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale and <b>scope</b> prevent imitation by the firm’s competitors.|$|R
