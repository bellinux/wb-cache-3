25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the <b>reference</b> <b>asset</b> or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E

5000|$|In {{mathematical}} finance, a replicating portfolio {{for a given}} asset {{or series}} of cash flows is a portfolio of assets with the same properties (especially cash flows). This is meant in two distinct senses: static replication, where the portfolio has the same cash flows as the <b>reference</b> <b>asset</b> (and no changes {{need to be made}} to maintain this), and dynamic replication, where the portfolio does not have the same cash flows, but has the same [...] "Greeks" [...] as the <b>reference</b> <b>asset,</b> meaning that for small (properly, infinitesimal) changes to underlying market parameters, the price of the asset and the price of the portfolio change in the same way. Dynamic replication requires continual adjustment, as the asset and portfolio are only assumed to behave similarly at a single point (mathematically, their partial derivatives are equal at a single point).|$|E

40|$|We introduce, in {{continuous}} time, an axiomatic approach to assign to any financial position a dynamic ask (resp. bid) price process. Taking into account both transaction costs and liquidity risk {{this leads to}} the convexity (resp. concavity) of the ask (resp. bid) price. Time consistency is a crucial property for dynamic pricing. Generalizing the result of Jouini and Kallal, we prove that the No Free Lunch condition for a time consistent dynamic pricing procedure (TCPP) is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent probability measure $R$ that transforms a process between the bid process and the ask process of any financial instrument into a martingale. Furthermore we prove that the ask price process associated with any financial instrument is then a $R$-supermartingale process which has a cadlag modification. Finally we show that time consistent dynamic pricing allows both to extend the dynamics of some <b>reference</b> <b>assets</b> and to be consistent with any observed bid ask spreads that one wants to take into account. It then provides new bounds reducing the bid ask spreads for the other financial instruments. ...|$|R
40|$|Portfolio credit {{derivatives}} are contracts that {{are tied to}} an underlying portfolio of defaultable <b>reference</b> <b>assets</b> and have payoffs that depend on the default times of these assets. The hedging of {{credit derivatives}} involves the calculation of {{the sensitivity of the}} contract value with respect to changes in the credit spreads of the underlying assets, or, more generally, with respect to parameters of the default-time distributions. We derive and analyze Monte Carlo estimators of these sensitivities. The payoff of a credit derivative is often discontinuous in the underlying default times, and this complicates the accurate estimation of sensitivities. Discontinuities introduced by changes in one default time can be smoothed by taking conditional expectations given all other default times. We use this to derive estimators and to give conditions under which they are unbiased. We also give conditions under which an alternative likelihood ratio method estimator is unbiased. We illustrate the application and verification of these conditions and estimators in the particular case of the multifactor Gaussian copula model, but the methods are more generally applicable...|$|R

A key feature of the current methodology is to establish an equivalence relationship between the CDS and the down-and-out binary option through the discussion of 2 ̆ 2 no default 2 ̆ 2 probability, while balancing the two SV processes with the perturbation method.

40|$|Derivatives {{transactions}} {{are an important}} part of the financial markets. For this reason, the market infrastructures supporting the trading, clearing and settling of derivatives transactions, in particular trade repositories and central counterparties, play an important role in contributing to the transparency, the safety and the efficiency of derivatives markets. This, in turn, enhances the stability of the financial system. This article, after a brief look at derivatives transactions and the market structure of the derivatives markets, will first discuss the risks in clearing and settling derivatives transactions, then look at the market infrastructure supporting derivatives markets, mention the new international standards for financial market infrastructure and discuss the role of oversight. It will then focus on the collection of data on derivatives markets, including the derivatives statistics published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). 2.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{highlight}} the importance of liquidity risk, especially in periods of market stress, and advocate in favour of an explicit consideration of a liquidity premium when using mark-to-model methodologies to value financial assets. For European corporate bonds, we show that the liquidity premium, calculated as {{the difference between the}} yield spread of corporate bonds and the spread of credit default swaps, grew significantly during the recent market turmoil not only in absolute terms but also in relative terms. Although liquidity premiums were far from stable during the time frame of analysis-from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 - on average roughly 40 % of corporate yield spreads can be interpreted in terms of liquidity premia. We propose direct matching between the CDS and the underlying <b>reference</b> <b>assets</b> when computing liquidity premia. This differs from {{what seems to be the}} industry standard, which is simply to use indices when trying to infer market implied liquidity premia.
