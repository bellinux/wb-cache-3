40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>rebamipide</b> in a rat model of colitis and restitution of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. METHODS: Acute colitis was induced with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in male Wistar rats. Rats received intrarectal <b>rebamipide</b> treatment daily starting on day 7 and were sacrificed on day 14 after TNBS administration. The distal colon was removed to evaluate the various parameters of inflammation. Moreover, wound healing assays {{were used to determine}} the enhanced restitution of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells treated with <b>rebamipide.</b> RESULTS: Intracolonic administration of <b>rebamipide</b> accelerated TNBS-induced ulcer healing. Increases in the wet weight of the colon after TNBS administration were significantly inhibited by <b>rebamipide.</b> The wound assay revealed that <b>rebamipide</b> enhanced the migration of RIE cells through phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and activation of Rho kinase.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{preclinical}} and phase I {{studies have}} reported that <b>rebamipide</b> decreased the severity of chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with oral cancer. This placebo-controlled randomized phase II study assessed the clinical benefit of <b>rebamipide</b> in reducing the incidence of severe chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). METHODS: Patients aged 20 - 75 years with HNC who were scheduled to receive chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive <b>rebamipide</b> 2 % liquid, <b>rebamipide</b> 4 % liquid, or placebo. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade ≥ 3 oral mucositis determined by clinical examination and assessed by central review according to the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 3. 0. Secondary endpoints were the time to onset of grade ≥ 3 oral mucositis and the incidence of functional impairment (grade ≥ 3) based on the evaluation by the Oral Mucositis Evaluation Committee. RESULTS: From April 2014 to August 2015, 97 patients with HNC were enrolled, of whom 94 received treatment. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 oral mucositis was 29 % and 25 % in the <b>rebamipide</b> 2 % and 4 % groups, respectively, compared with 39 % in the placebo group. The proportion of patients who did not develop grade ≥ 3 oral mucositis by day 50 of treatment was 57. 9 % in the placebo group, whereas the proportion was 68. 0 % in the <b>rebamipide</b> 2 % group and 71. 3 % in the <b>rebamipide</b> 4 % group. The incidences of adverse events potentially related to the study drug were 16 %, 26 %, and 13 % in the placebo, <b>rebamipide</b> 2 %, and <b>rebamipide</b> 4 % groups, respectively. There {{was no significant difference}} in treatment compliance among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present phase II study suggests that mouth washing with <b>rebamipide</b> may be effective and safe for patients with HNC receiving chemoradiotherapy, and 4 % liquid is the optimal dose of <b>rebamipide.</b> TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov under the identifier NCT 02085460 (the date of trial registration: March 11, 2014) ...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the permeability characteristics of <b>rebamipide</b> across intestinal mucosa, {{and examine the}} effects of some absorption enhancers on the permeability across the colonic tissue. Another purpose is to demonstrate the colon-specific delivery of <b>rebamipide</b> with or without absorption enhancers using chitosan capsule as a carrier. METHODS: The permeability of <b>rebamipide</b> was evaluated using an in vitro diffusion chamber system, and the effects of some absorption enhancers on the permeability via colon were further investigated. The release of <b>rebamipide</b> from chitosan or gelatin capsule was studied by Japan Pharmacopoeia rotating basket method. The colonic and plasma concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to evaluate colon-targeting action after oral administration of various dosage forms, and <b>rebamipide</b> with absorption enhancers in chitosan dosage forms. RESULTS: The permeability of <b>rebamipide</b> across the jejunal or ileal membranes was higher than the colonic membranes. Both sodium laurate (C 12) and labrasol significantly increased permeability across the colon membranes. On the other hand, the release of <b>rebamipide</b> from chitosan capsule was less than 10 % totally within 6 h. The area under concentration-time profile of drug in the colon mucosa using chitosan capsules (AUCLI, 1   6011. 2 ng·h/g) was 2. 5 times and 4. 4 times greater than using gelatin capsules and CMC suspension, respectively. Meanwhile, the area under concentration-time profile of drug in the plasma (AUCPL) was 1016. 0 ng·h/mL for chitosan capsule, 1887. 9 ng·h/mL for CMC suspension p and 2163. 5 ng·h/mL for gelatin capsule. Overall, both AUCLI and AUCPL were increased when C 12 was co-administrated, but the increase of AUCLI was much greater; the drug delivery index (DDI) was more than 1 compared with simple chitosan capsule group. CONCLUSION: There was a regional difference in the permeability of <b>Rebamipide</b> across the jejunum, ileum and the colon, and passive diffusion seems {{to be one of the}} major transport mechanisms of <b>rebamipide.</b> Absorption enhancers can increase the permeability of <b>rebamipide</b> across the colon tissue significantly.

This change was significantly attenuated by <b>rebamipide</b> at a concentration less than 1 mM, showing that <b>rebamipide</b> may inhibit oxidant production from H pylori elicited neutrophils. To assess whether <b>rebamipide</b> attenuates gastric mucosal injury, we tested its inhibitory action on H pylori induced gastric mucosal damage associated with neutrophils in vitro. Rabbit gastric mucosal cells were monolayered in culture wells and coincubated with human neutrophils and H pylori, and the cytotoxicity index was then calculated.

Secondary endpoints included the complete healing of mucosal breaks at 8 weeks and the change in Lewis score (an endoscopic score assessing damage severity) from baseline to 8 weeks. The study was completed by 38 patients (<b>rebamipide</b> group: n = 25, placebo group: n = 13). After 8 weeks of treatment, <b>rebamipide,</b> but not placebo, significantly decreased the number of mucosal breaks (p = 0. 046). While the difference was not significant (p = 0. 13), the rate of complete mucosal break healing in the <b>rebamipide</b> group (32 %, 8 of 25) tended to be higher than that in the placebo group (7. 7 %, 1 of 13). <b>Rebamipide</b> treatment significantly improved intestinal damage severity as assessed by the Lewis score (p = 0. 02), whereas placebo did not. The triple dose of <b>rebamipide</b> was well tolerated. High-dose <b>rebamipide</b> is effective for the treatment of LDA-induced moderate-to-severe enteropathy.

40|$|Objectives Endoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} (ESD) {{is useful}} for treating gastric tumors. Several trials have shown the efficacy of 4 or 8 weeks of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration for post-ESD ulcers. However, if {{the size of the}} post-ESD ulcer is larger than predicted, PPI administration alone might not be sufficient for the ulcer to heal within 4 weeks. There is no report about the efficacy of post-ESD gastric ulcers by esomeprazole. We examined retrospectively the efficacy of a combination therapy of esomeprazole plus <b>rebamipide,</b> a mucosal-protective antiulcer drug, on the acceleration of post-ESD ulcer healing comparing with omeprazole plus <b>rebamipide.</b> Methods We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent ESD for gastric neoplasia. We conducted a case-control study to compare the healing rates within 4 weeks effected by esomeprazole plus <b>rebamipide</b> (group E) and omeprazole plus <b>rebamipide</b> (group O). The sizes of the artificial ulcers were divided into normal-sized or large-sized. Results The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups except age and sex. Stage S 1 disease was observed in 27. 6 % and 38. 7 % of patients after 4 weeks of treatment in the group E and O, respectively. In large-sized artificial ulcers, the healing rate of stage S 1 in group E is significantly higher than that in group O in 4 weeks. (25 % VS 0 %: P = 0. 02) Conclusions The safety and efficacy profiles of esomeprazole plus <b>rebamipide</b> and omeprazole and <b>rebamipide</b> are similar for the treatment of ESD-induced ulcers. In large-sized ulcers, esomeprazole plus <b>rebamipide</b> promotes ulcer healing...|$|E
40|$|Temporomandibular joint {{osteoarthritis}} (TMJ-OA) {{is characterized}} by progressive degradation of cartilage and changes in subchondral bone. It {{is also one of}} the most serious subgroups of temporomandibular disorders. <b>Rebamipide</b> is a gastroprotective agent that is currently used for the treatment of gastritis and gastric ulcers. It scavenges reactive oxygen radicals and has exhibited anti-inflammatory potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of <b>rebamipide</b> both in vivo and in vitro on the development of cartilage degeneration and osteoclast activity in an experimental murine model of TMJ-OA, and to explore its mode of action. Oral administration of <b>rebamipide</b> (0. 6 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg) was initiated 24 h after TMJ-OA was induced, and was maintained daily for four weeks. <b>Rebamipide</b> treatment was found to attenuate cartilage degeneration, to reduce the number of apoptotic cells, and to decrease the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase- 13 (MMP- 13) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in TMJ-OA cartilage in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Rebamipide</b> also suppressed the activation of transcription factors (e. g., NF-κB, NFATc 1) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) to inhibit the differentiation of osteoclastic precursors, and disrupted the formation of actin rings in mature osteoclasts. Together, these results demonstrate the inhibitory effects of <b>rebamipide</b> on cartilage degradation in experimentally induced TMJ-OA. Furthermore, suppression of oxidative damage, restoration of extracellular matrix homeostasis of articular chondrocytes, and reduced subchondral bone loss as a result of blocked osteoclast activation suggest that <b>rebamipide</b> is a potential therapeutic strategy for TMJ-OA...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>rebamipide</b> on {{repairing}} intestinal mucosal damage induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and its mechanism remain unclear. In this study, {{we sought to}} explore the mechanism whereby <b>rebamipide</b> could promote the regeneration of aspirin-induced intestinal mucosal damage. BALB/c mice were administered aspirin (200 mg/kg/d) for 5 days to induce acute small intestinal injury (SII). Subsequently, SII mice were treated with <b>rebamipide</b> (320 mg/kg/d) for 5 days. The structure of intestinal barrier was observed with transmission electron microscope, and Zo- 1 and occludin expressions were detected. The proliferative index was indicated by the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells. The prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels in the small intestine tissues were measured by an enzyme immunoassay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX) and β-catenin signal were detected in the small intestine using quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. COX expression was significantly down-regulated in aspirin induced SII (P < 0. 05). In SII mice treated with <b>rebamipide,</b> histopathological findings of aspirin-induced intestinal inflammation were significantly milder and tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells were improved significantly. The proliferative index increased after <b>rebamipide</b> treatment when compared with that in the control mice. The expressions of COX- 2, β-catenin, and c-myc and the PGE 2 concentrations in small intestinal tissues were significantly increased in mice with <b>rebamipide</b> treatments (P < 0. 05). <b>Rebamipide</b> administration in aspirin-induced SII mice could improve the intestinal barrier structure and promote the regeneration of small intestinal epithelial injury through up-regulating COX- 2 expression and the accumulation of β-catenin...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim. Although many {{epidemiologic}} {{studies have}} shown that Helicobacter pylori eradication has prophylactic effects on gastric cancer, it does not completely eliminate the risk of gastric cancer. We aimed to investigate the changes in histological gastritis in patients receiving <b>rebamipide</b> treatment after H. pylori eradication. Methods. 206 patients who had undergone H. pylori eradication were evaluated. Of these, 169 patients who achieved successful eradication were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the <b>rebamipide</b> group (n = 82) and the untreated group (n = 87). The primary endpoints were histopathological findings according to the updated Sydney system {{at the start of the}} study and after 1 year. Results. Final assessment for histological gastritis was possible in 50 cases from the <b>rebamipide</b> group and 53 cases from the untreated group. The activity and atrophy improved in both the <b>rebamipide</b> and untreated groups, and no significant intergroup differences were observed. Chronic inflammation affecting the lesser curvature of the corpus was significantly improved in the <b>rebamipide</b> group compared to in the untreated group (1. 12 ± 0. 08 versus 1. 35 ± 0. 08; P = 0. 043). Conclusions. <b>Rebamipide</b> treatment after H. pylori eradication alleviated chronic inflammation in the lesser curvature of the corpus compared to that in the untreated group.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>rebamipide</b> on symptom, histology, endogenous prostaglandin, and mucosal oxygen free radicals in chronic erosive gastritis (CEG) patients by using sucralfate as a control. The trial also examined whether Helicobacter pylori infection would affect rebamipide-induced protection. A total of 453 endoscopy-confirmed CEG patients from 11 hospitals in China were enrolled in the study. They randomly received either <b>rebamipide</b> (100 mg t. i. d) or sucralfate (1. 0 t. i. d) for 8 weeks with a ratio of 3 : 1. Per-protocol analysis (n = 415) showed the accumulated symptom score in the <b>rebamipide</b> group dropped from 5. 54 +/- 0. 97 to 0. 80 +/- 0. 47 after 8 weeks (P < 0. 001 versus control). The endoscopic inflammation score in <b>rebamipide</b> group also decreased from 2. 65 +/- 0. 09 to 0. 60 +/- 0. 10, which showed better effects than sucralfate. It was shown a significant improvement (P < 0. 01) in prostaglandin E 2 (PGE(2)) contents in rebamipide-treated subjects mucosa (225. 4 +/- 18. 3 pg/g versus 266. 7 +/- 14. 7 pg/g) compared with that in sucralfate group after 8 weeks of treatment. Malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly depressed both in the trial and control group. When Helicobacter pylori infection was considered, no statistically difference was found in the effect of <b>rebamipide</b> on either symptom or inflammation scores. In conclusion, <b>Rebamipide</b> demonstrated a stronger suppressive effect on the mucosal inflammation in chronic erosive gastritis than sucralfate. The gastroprotection induced by <b>rebamipide</b> is not influenced by H. pylori infection, which indicates its usage in the treatment of H. pylori-associated CEG...|$|E

40|$|Background: During esophageal acid clearance, salivation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in defending the esophageal mucosa. Mosapride, an agent used in chronic, long-term therapy of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) was regarded as mediating its efficacy through prokinetic properties. <b>Rebamipide</b> is also widely used as an anti-gastritis and anti-ulcer agent in GERD patients with chronic gastritis. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of <b>rebamipide,</b> mosapride, and risperidone on the salivation induced by pilocarpine. Materials and Methods: The experiments were conducted on 4 -week male SD rats (120 - 150 g). The salivation was induced by intraperitoneally administrated pilocarpine and saliva was collected using preweighted small cotton balls inserted into the animal's mouth every 30 min for 180 min. Thirteen minutes before intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine, <b>rebamipide,</b> mosapride, and risperidone were administered intraduodenally. Control rats were conducted by intraperitoneal administration of saline and intraduodenal administration of 0. 5 % methylcellulose solution. Rsults: The saliva weight at 0 - 30 min was significantly (p< 0. 01) increased after administration of pilocarpine, compared to control rats. An additional administration of mosapride and <b>rebamipide</b> increased the saliva weight at 0 - 30 min. The total volume of saliva for 150 min after administration of pilocarpine was the highest after preadministration of <b>rebamipide,</b> followed by mosapride, and risperidone. Conclusions: Increase in salivation produced by i. p. pilocarpine was enhanced by preadministration of <b>rebamipide</b> and mosapride...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundRebamipide, a gastroprotective drug, {{has been}} {{reported}} to suppress gastric mucosal inflammation. In Japan, <b>rebamipide</b> eyedrops have recently been approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. Some patients with allergic conjunctival diseases such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) manifest dry eye with decreased tear break-up time only. We report patients with VKC/AKC refractory to anti-allergic treatments who responded to the combination of <b>rebamipide</b> eyedrops and conventional anti-allergic treatments with anti-allergic- and/or immunosuppressive/steroid eyedrops. MethodsFour patients with allergic conjunctival diseases with giant papillae (VKC or AKC) instilled <b>rebamipide</b> eyedrops {{three or four times a}} day for varying periods. All had dry eye with decreased tear break-up time. We evaluated changes in the size of their giant papillae using Image J software. ResultsWe observed attenuation of the giant papillae in all 4 patients. In 2 patients with severe disease, whose giant papillae had become larger despite the administration of tacrolimus and steroids, the addition of <b>rebamipide</b> contributed to their attenuation. In 2 patients with mild disease, the giant papillae had become larger or remained the same size despite the administration of anti-allergy drugs; the addition of <b>rebamipide</b> eyedrops also resulted in the attenuation of their giant papillae. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that <b>rebamipide</b> eyedrops might attenuate giant papillae in patients with allergic conjunctival diseases and that these eyedrops may be useful for the treatment of not only dry eye but also of allergic conjunctival diseases...|$|E

Although IBD is associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), any association with the TBK 1 -IRF pathway remains unknown. How <b>rebamipide</b> affects the TBK 1 -IRF pathway is also unclear. We analyzed the relationship between IBD (particularly ulcerative colitis; UC) and the TLR-TBK 1 -IRF 3 / 7 pathway using human colon tissue, a murine model of colitis and human colonic epithelial cells. Inflamed colonic mucosa over-expressed TKB 1, NAP 1, IRF 3, and IRF 7 mRNA compared with normal mucosa. TBK 1 was mainly expressed in inflammatory epithelial cells of UC patients. The expression of TBK 1, IRF 3, IRF 7, IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA was suppressed in mice given oral dextran sulfate-sodium (DSS) and daily rectal <b>rebamipide</b> compared with mice given only DSS. <b>Rebamipide</b> reduced the expression of TBK 1, IRF 3 and IRF 7 mRNA induced by LPS/dsRNA, but not of NF-κB mRNA in colonic epithelial cells. <b>Rebamipide</b> might suppress the TLR-TBK 1 pathway, resulting in IRF 3 / 7 -induction of IFN-α/β and inflammatory factors. TBK 1 {{is important in the}} induction of inflammation in patients with UC. If <b>rebamipide</b> represses the TLR-TBK 1 pathway, then rectal administration should suppress inflammation of the colonic mucosa in patients with UC...|$|E
