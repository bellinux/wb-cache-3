Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>maneuver,</b> would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E

Lieutenant Colonel José Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians. [...] In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire. [...] The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift. At that point, 5060 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians. [...] Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, [...] "Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!" [...] At [...] from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle. [...] They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect. [...] For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians. [...] According to Texian Noah Smithwick, [...] "grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan trees overhead, raining a shower of ripe nuts down on us, and I saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther." [...] In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that [...] "The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect." [...] The Mexican infantry were assigned Brown Bess muskets, which had a maximum range of only , compared to the [...] effective range of the Texian long rifles. [...] The Texians were short of ammunition, however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful, it was poor quality. In several cases, Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers, causing little damage other than a bruise.|$|E

2500|$|Moreau {{deserved}} {{criticism for}} spreading his forces too widely {{but he can}} be credited for keeping his composure despite the defeat of Duhesme. But Moreau now fell into a fatal strategic error. Charles entertained a desire to combine forces with Wartensleben {{at the earliest opportunity}} in order to defeat Jourdan's army. When Charles withdrew to the south bank of the Danube, he left Moreau free to stay on the north bank and join with Jourdan. Charles hoped to lure his opponent onto the south bank which would take Moreau farther away from Jourdan. In fact, Moreau did not begin to advance until 14 August and then he headed for the Danube crossings. Meanwhile, Charles retreated rapidly, increasing the distance between his army and Moreau, but also giving himself more <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>maneuver.</b> On 18 and 19 August Moreau's army finally crossed to the south bank of the Danube. But on the 17th the archduke made a crucial strategic move. Leaving Latour with 30,288 troops plus Condé's 5,000-6,000 men, Charles and 28,000 troops recrossed to the north bank, heading for a rendezvous with Wartensleben. Ignoring this move, Moreau moved steadily to the east on the south bank of the Danube. Napoleon later wrote of Moreau, [...] "One would have said that he was ignorant that a French army existed on his left".

2500|$|The battle {{took place}} in the morning of July 14 on the left bank of the Shelon River, which flows into Lake Ilmen {{southwest}} of Novgorod. It is believed to have taken place about 30km {{from the mouth of the}} river and just to the east of the town of Soltsy, possibly, near the village of Skirino. [...] The location indicates that the Muscovite army was advancing on Novgorod along the western shore of the lake to come up on the city from the southwest. [...] After an accidental encounter of the Muscovite forces (around 5,000 men) under the command of Prince Daniel Kholmsky (Daniel of Kholm) with the army of Novgorod (20,000 to 40,000 men), the badly organized army of Novgorod was not able to withstand the pressure of the princely forces. [...] Indeed, the Novgorodian Fourth Chronicle reports that Feofil, Archbishop-Elect of Novgorod, ordered his cavalry to not attack the Muscovites, but only the Pskovian forces, thus limiting their <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>maneuver.</b> The Battle of Shelon lasted for two hours and ended with Novgorod's defeat. According to Muscovite sources, more than 12,000 Novgorodians were killed during the battle and the subsequent pursuit. Some 2,000 men were taken prisoners. It is, however, difficult to say how accurate these figures are as the size of the Novgorodian army at this time are almost impossible to determine, and the number seems quite high given that the city of Novgorod itself probably had a population of only about 40,000 people, although the army could have been drawn from the rural population as well. [...] That being said, the numbers may have been inflated to add to the Grand Prince's prestige and cast Novgorod in an even worse light.|$|E
