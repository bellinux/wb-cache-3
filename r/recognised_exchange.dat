40|$|Price risk in {{commodities}} such as cereals is, unfortunately, {{a fact of}} life. Ignoring {{this risk}} is potentially dangerous and equates to taking a speculative view on the market. Managing cereal price risk using derivitaves such as futures and options are being looked at by farmers as possible ways of managing cereal price risk and minimising volatility in cereal prices. Derivatives were “invented ” as hedging tools, instruments designed to allow growers and processors to reduce or remove price risk. Market participants can use futures (exchange-traded) or forwards (OTC) to lock in an underlying price or buy options (exchange-traded or OTC) to protect against adverse price movement. The great benefit of buying options {{is that it allows}} market participants to be protected yet still benefit from favourable underlying price movements. The problem with buying options is that, just like insurance, they cost money. If that cost presents a problem, then more sophisticated option strategies such as fences may usefully be employed. Derivatives may be traded directly between counterparties (OTC) or on a <b>recognised</b> <b>exchange</b> such as LIFFE or the CME. Trading on exchange largely removes counterparty risk and is more transparent than trading OTC. However, OTC trading may offer more flexibility than standardised exchange derivatives...|$|E

50|$|This {{refers to}} the {{scenario}} where the assessee is either Salaried or is engaged in some other business or profession and trading in securities is not the main line of business. In such cases gains or losses from securities transactions are taxed under the head “Income from Capital Gains”. Gains or losses are subject to Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) or Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax depending upon the period of holding, i.e., if the holding period is less than 1 year, gains are classified as STCG and if the holding period is {{equal to or greater}} than 1 year, gains are classified as LTCG. Any equity share, which has been sold through a <b>recognised</b> stock <b>exchange</b> and on which STT has been paid, is entitled to exemption from LTCG under Section 10 (38) of the Act. Similarly, in case of STCG of such shares, the gains shall be taxed only at 15%, plus surcharge and education cess under section 111A of the Act.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{reports on}} {{theoretical}} and empirical studies of contact systems. It refines and extends the framework, and consequently the implications, of such systems. This framework forms a base for extensive empirical studies, the results of which are used to suggest how contact systems are resolved and how they affect the quantitative and qualitative aspects of regional development. The analysis aims to determine how control of the course of development can be exerted by planning bodies at various levels. 1 The questions to be studied 1. 1 Background Transportation {{has long been the}} focal point of many attempts to explain regional development. Traditionally, much attention has been given to the costs of transportation of raw material and finished products. Lately it has also been <b>recognised</b> that the <b>exchange</b> of messages through the transport of people can consume considerable resources. Cost calculations alone, however, give a biased picture of the effect of communications. The outcomes are often neglected as they are less easily measurable in monetary terms...|$|R
5000|$|As soon as {{the news}} of Hasan's {{selection}} reached Muawiyah, who had been fighting ‘Ali for the caliphate, he condemned the selection, and declared his decision not to <b>recognise</b> him. Letters <b>exchanged</b> between Al-Hasan and Mu‘awiyah before their troops faced each other were to no avail. However, these letters, which are recorded in Madelung and Jafri's books, provide useful arguments concerning the rights of caliphate which {{will lead to the}} origin of the Shi‘ah (شـيـعـة, Party) (of ‘Ali and the Household of Muhammad). In one of his long letters to Muawiyah in which he summoned him to pledge allegiance to him, Hasan made use of the argument of his father, Ali, which the latter had advanced against Abu Bakr after the death of Muhammad. Ali had said: [...] "If Quraysh could claim the leadership over the Ansar {{on the grounds that the}} Prophet belonged to Quraysh, then the members of his family, who were the nearest to him in every respect, were better qualified for the leadership of the community." ...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of an}} article published in the International Journal of Sport Policy [© Routledge (Taylor & Francis) ] available online at: [URL] 1998 the European Commission introduced into the political arena the concept of a ‘European model of sport’ in the build up to the Helsinki Report on Sport, the Commission’s first attempt to formulate a comprehensive approach towards sport in the ‘post-Bosman era’. In the recently adopted White Paper on Sport (July 2007), the Commission however considers it ‘unrealistic’ to define a single model of sport for Europe. This article argues that the Commission’s departure from its previous position deserves attention because it is an explicit acknowledgement of the transformations in the governing structures of European sport over the last two decades. The article suggests two possible motives for the Commission’s new understanding of European sport. First, the Commission is responding to the politicisation and redefinition of the concept of the ‘European Model’ by sport governing bodies, who are attempting to forestall legal intervention by the European courts and the Commission. Second, the Commission is just acknowledging the reality of the new governance of sport. In this respect, the article focuses on professional football to argue that the governance of the sport in Europe is transforming from the old pyramidal and vertical structure to more horizontal configurations of stakeholder networks. The White Paper is just another indication of this process, and the Commission has used it to position itself within the network structure. The Commission, it is argued, has opted for a supervisory role, offering governing bodies a degree of ‘supervised autonomy’ where the specific role of federation is <b>recognised</b> in <b>exchange</b> for greater stakeholder representation within governing structures...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely <b>recognised</b> that the <b>exchange</b> of {{information}} {{is one of the}} underpinning factors for economic growth in developing and developed nations. One of the fastest growing areas of information transfer is the mobile data sector. In 2012, global mobile data traffic grew by 70 %. There is an urgent need to improve the wireless capacity of cellular networks in order to match this growth. One of the key issues faced by mobile operators is the fall in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the growing Operational Expenditure (OPEX) due to capacity growth and rising energy prices. The challenge is therefore how to grow the wireless capacity in a way that minimizes the OPEX and thus improves the ARPU. Furthermore, there is growing focus on the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sectors. There are tangible, financial, and environmental motivations for reducing the energy expenditure of wireless networks whilst growing its capacity. This chapter examines recent {{research in the area of}} future wireless network architectures and deployments. This is done in the context of improving capacity in a sustainable way. That is to say, what is the lowest-cost and -energy method of achieving certain capacity targets? The authors of this chapter were researchers in the world’s first green wireless communications project—Mobile VCE Green Radio (2007 - 2012) ...|$|R
