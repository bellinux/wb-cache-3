40|$|We present new {{observational}} data on small-angle {{light scattering}} properties of natural, <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> particles, as contrasted with spherical particles. The {{interest in this}} "shape effect" on scattering arises from {{the need for a}} suitable kernel matrix for use in the laser diffraction method (LD) of particle sizing. LD is now used broadly for measuring size distribution of suspended marine particles. LD involves the measurement of small-angle forward scattering at multiple angles. This data is inverted using the kernel matrix to produce size distribution. In the absence of a suitable matrix for <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> particles, past practice has been to use a model based on Mie theory, applicable strictly only to homogeneous spheres. The present work replaces Mie theory with empirical data. The work was motivated in part by anomalous field observations of size distribution and settling velocity distributions reported in literature. We show that a kernel matrix for <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> particles results in improved interpretation of field multiangle scattering observations. In particular, a rising edge at the fine particle end of the size spectrum is shown to be associated with shape effects...|$|E

This paper presents an algorithm to control an ordered search strategy for locating all contours of <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> objects intersected {{by a series of}} cross-section image planes. Classic search techniques in AI problem solving and software for image processing and computer graphics are combined here to aid program initialization and automate the search process thereafter. Using three-dimensional region growing, this method isolates all spatially connected pixels forming a structure's volume and enters image planes the least number of times to do so. An algorithmic description is given to generalize the process for controlling search in 3 -D image data where little core memory is available. Phantom and medical computer tomographic data are used to illustrate the algorithm's performance...|$|E

In this paper, results will be presented of a study comparing computational model predictions to experimental measurements of the rheological properties of various suspensions. The model incorporates the particle size distribution as well as the shape of particles as determined from X-ray microtomography. The experimental rheological properties will be based on measurements using co-axial rheometers and various materials that could potentially be used as reference materials...|$|E
30|$|We {{simulate}} {{our environment}} with the distributed sensor nodes using Java programming language. We worked for both random and various topologies. For random topology, we considered <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> but for shaped topology we considered five shaped network models which are C, D, I, H, and O. After reaching consensus decision, we get all sensor nodes average values from {{leaves of the}} segment tree because leaves of the segment tree stores single array updated values. We did it exactly like how we use build-tree for going leaves of the segment tree. Here, actually iteration means how many times we choose an edge to update their protocol. So, the less number of iterations means the algorithm reaches on consensus faster. We take data thrice for various topologies and twice for random topologies to clearly see the results variations. We described the defination and generation for various selected five topologies.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{advantage}} of tunability via size, shape, doping and relatively low level of loss and high extent of spatial confinement, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are emerging as an effective way to control light by molecular engineering. The collective excitation in GQDs shows both high energy plasmon frequency along with frequencies in the terahertz (THz) region making these systems powerful materials for photonic technologies. Here, we report a systematic study of the linear and nonlinear optical properties of large varieties of GQDs (400 systems) in size and topology utilizing the strengths of both semiempirical and first-principles methods. Our detailed study shows how the spectral shift and trends in the optical nonlinearity of GQDs depends on their structure, size and shape. Among the circular, triangular, stripe, and <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> GQDs, we find that GQDs with inequivalent sublattice atoms always possess lower HOMO-LUMO gap, broadband absorption and high nonlinear optical coefficients. Also, we find that for majority of the GQDs with interesting linear and nonlinear optical properties have zigzag edges, although reverse is not always true. We strongly believe that our findings can act as guidelines to design GQDs in optical parametric oscillators, higher harmonic generators and optical modulators.

Applications of such a distribution in the context of information transmission over a wireless fading channel are provided and novel average symbol error probability (SEP) expressions for single and multi-channel reception are derived involving the Laplace transform of the new distribution.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that verbal {{materials}} vary in meaningfulness or association value, and that these variations are related to learning and retention. Patterns and shapes may vary similarly; however, little systematic control over such variation has been exercised in studies of perceptual learning and retention. Indeed, little effort to standardize such materials has been expended (cf., e. g., the discussions by Hilgard [1951, p. 547] and Graham [1951, pp. 911 - 915]). A number of experiments have appeared in which <b>random</b> <b>shapes</b> have been used as stimuli in tasks involving perceptual learning and retention. <b>Random</b> <b>shapes</b> have also been employed in studies of mediated transfer and "predifferentiation.

Blurb: Nano-particles are tiny in size 100 nm or downwards, whereas human hair is 10 - 50 micron diameter hence largest nano-particles are 100 times smaller than a 10 micron human hair. As a particle decreases in size a larger portion of atoms are found at the surface as compared to inside. Thus nano-particle have much larger surface area per unit mass compared to larger particles {{as a matter of}} this quantum effect can play a role and these can significantly change materials optical, magnetic and electrical properties. Due to this in recent times, plasmonic metallic nano-particle has gained considerable amount of interest and has been extensively used in cell biology for cancer therapy, drug delivery, disease targeting, biological imaging and probing membrane protein. Here, 80 nm Au nano-spheres were added to the plated HeLa cell media and allowed to sediment. Afterward, migration of nano-particle was observed over time (24 hr) and due to natural process NP was internalized inside HeLa cells forming different types of cluster (different colour such as green,yellow, orange and red are due to cluster) which was investigated performing the dark field microscopy scattering. This work will pave the way for the cell biologist to consider plasmonic nano-particle as a superior labelling choice and understanding the activation of signalling pathway of intact cells.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mechanistic}} model capable of predicting end milling cutting forces in brittle porous media is described. A coefficient which {{is capable of}} reproducing the <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> and variation in cutting forces due to porosity is proposed. In addition, a method of experimental determination of cutting force coefficients is outlined. The proposed model {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> and variation in cutting forces of brittle porous media coincide with the shape and variation of pore size and distribution in the media. The developed coefficient and model is compared to end milling tests conducted in CB 1100, a porous machinable alumina based ceramic manufactured by UMECO. High correlation between predicted and measured cutting forces is shown. Experiments show that the model is capable of accurate prediction of variation in individual cutting tooth force profile shape and overall magnitude over the entire range of machining conditions tested. The benefit of the model lies in its ability to greatly reduce the number of cutting tests required when investigating cutting forces in novel brittle porous materials...|$|R

In the paper, we propose a probabilistic model consisting of vector parameters using a spatial interaction binary model with inhomogeneous Markov chain.

A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is thus developed to approximate the Minimum Mean Squared Error estimator. The performance is assessed through numerical simulations.
