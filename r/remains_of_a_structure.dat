50|$|In the Schmeeson Village Project, {{the remains}} of what {{appeared}} to be a church were excavated in 2005. Initially, Stephan and his team thought they had found a small, squarish building, but in 2004, the site was covered by brush. The local historical society, which supports the project, came out and cleared the site, allowing the researchers to see they had been standing on a mound of stones of various sizes. They also found evidence of plaster and mortar around the entire area. Their excavations in the summer of 2005 uncovered <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> 9 x 16 m, with a considerable number of ceramic and metal finds. The 100 metal finds weighed over 20 kg. In 2006, Arno Beyer of the University of Kiel took samples of soil from the site for further research. The trenches that were dug for this purpose went to the natural bedrock and revealed numerous postholes, as well as ceramic finds pre-dating the church, providing researchers with evidence of a community.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> {{discovered}} {{to the east}} of the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia and immediately to the southwest of the Parthenon have been suggested to be those of the Chalkotheke. Only scant limestone foundations and rock-cut foundation trenches survive. The building {{stood in front of the}} southern Acropolis wall and was circa 43 m long and 14 m wide, fronted on its northern long side by a portico of 4.5 m width. To make room for that portico, the southernmost portion of the rock-cut steps leading up to the west facade of the Parthenon had to be cut away. Thus, the portico is assumed to have been an early fourth century BC addition, while the main part of the structure is thought to be roughly contemporary with the Parthenon, i.e. to date to the mid-fifth century. A major renovation appears to have taken place during Roman times, as indicated by numerous fragments of architectural members that are definitely Roman in date and have dimensions matching those of the Chalkotheke.|$|E
50|$|The {{first decade}} of the 21st century has {{witnessed}} renewed interest in the site. A German-Panamanian team of archaeologists excavated the <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> in 2001, which suggested to them that Barriles was probably a village rather than an empty ceremonial center or cemetery. This large excavation block has been left open for tourists to visit today. Dr. Karen Holmberg (Brown University) sampled volcanic stata from this excavation, though much of her work was ultimately conducted near the modern towns of Boquete and Caldera {{on the other side of}} the volcano. Dr. Scott Palumbo (College of Lake County) recently conducted the most extensive work at the site by sampling different domestic sectors with hundreds of small excavations. His work suggested that Barriles contained a far denser residential population compared to other sites in the region, and that the activities which drew people to the village were likely ceremonial feasts, perhaps associated with funerary rituals. Differences between social ranks, however, was subtle and not nearly as clear as the distinctions supposedly advertised in the double individual statues.|$|E

5000|$|The House and Baths of Eustolios, {{situated}} {{on the crest of}} the southern cliffs immediately above the theatre, was constructed in the late-4th century over the <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> destroyed in the mid-4th century. In {{the early years of the}} 5th century, seemingly immediately after the completion of the house, a bathing complex was constructed along the northern side of the house. The household and bath annex on the northern side contains more than thirty rooms. The complex was entered from the west, the visitor passing into a rectangular forecourt. A salutatory inscription in the vestibule beyond the forecourt reads, [...] "Enter for the good luck of the house." [...] Rooms were arranged north and south of this forecourt and the vestibule, including a peristyle courtyard to the south at its eastern extent. The southern peristyle was arranged around a central pool and is the centrepiece of the household, its porticoes adorned with elaborate mosaics. A mosaic inscription in the eastern portico identifies the building as Eustolios, who built the structure to alleviate the suffering of the populace of Kourion, presumably in response to the earthquakes of the mid-to-late 4th century. The inscription identifies Eustolios as a Christian, concluding, “this house is girt by the much venerated signs of Christ.” The accompanying iconography includes figural depictions of fish and birds (grey goose, guinea hen, falcon, partridge and pheasant).|$|E
