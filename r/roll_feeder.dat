40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out to analyse thin sheet metal feeding {{characteristic}} by a servo <b>roll</b> <b>feeder.</b> Although servo roll feeding has been seen to be very successful in conventional sheet metal forming, no significant effort {{has been made to}} enable the application of this technology to micro sheet metal forming. A metal strip in micron size is very fragile, and it may be severely deformable if an inappropriate feeding facility is deployed. A model of feeder was created and simulation was further conducted to analyse the performance of servo <b>roll</b> <b>feeder</b> in term of accuracy and repeatability during feeding process of thin sheet metal. Several parameters were changed during simulation to acquire more data about servo <b>roll</b> <b>feeder</b> performance. The analysed showed that many factors affect the feed process in term of accuracy such as feed frequencies, feed distances and materials thickness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For a {{continuous}} feeding of sheet metals in forming press lines mechanical <b>roll</b> and gripper <b>feeders</b> are used. Typical resulting problems are the damage {{of the sheet}} surface due to the mechanical contact. The present contribution deals with the investigations of an electromagnetic material feeder for electric conductive sheet metals. The concept {{is based on the}} principle of an asynchronous linear motor. Here the sheet metal acts directly as the secondary part. The new approach was first analysed and designed by means of finite element simulation. With experimental measurements the simulations could be validated using a demonstrator of the electromagnetic feeder. The results indicate that the feeding forces of partially 1000 N can be doubled in comparison to conventional mechanical <b>roll</b> <b>feeders...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ink ribbon}} {{was a long}} roll {{the width of the}} print area that was {{positioned}} between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the <b>feeder</b> <b>roll</b> and take-up roll. The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{benefits}} of a hydraulic drive installed on the pressure <b>feeder</b> <b>rolls</b> of one dewatering mill at the Malelane sugar factory. The drive met all criteria except for the anticipated reduction in mill moistures. It emerged that other factors on the mill must be addressed before the additional power available would be of benefit in this regard. It has been concluded that the capital cost of hydraulic drives compares favourably with steam and electric drives for dewatering mill duty. The power conversion efficiency of a hydraulic drive is similar to an electric drive with conventional helical/spur gears...|$|R
5000|$|Material {{is put on}} a sinter {{machine in}} two layers. The bottom layer may vary in {{thickness}} from 30 to 75 mm. A 12 to 20 mm sinter fraction is used, {{also referred to as}} the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of 350 to 660 mm. The mixed materials are applied with drum <b>feeders</b> and <b>roll</b> <b>feeders,</b> which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine [...] The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/annealing) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked {{from the bottom of the}} bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but sinter in smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several temperature measuring instrument placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (< 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( [...] 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth layer in sinter machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis on}} 15 hp {{has been done}} by {{students}} at Halmstad University in Mechanical Engineering. The students have had as purpose to create a portable ID-scanner. The students have done this together with the company 365 id which has created a stationary ID-scanner. 365 id has given the students relatively free requirements because they wanted them to think outside the box. The project started with doing concept sketches made after the requirements, which have been brought up to make different concepts which were followed by an evaluation of the most suitable concepts. Three concepts made it through the evaluation where two of them were scanner type and one were camera type. One of the scanner type was chosen and was made into a CAD- model. The model got analyzed and 3 D-printed. The biggest dilemma was to make the choice between picking camera type or scanner type. Both types had big problems to fix but the camera type was eventually removed due to the product becoming too big and therefore not portable. The Scanner with the ID-card opening on the side was elected due to it passing the criteriaâ€™s best. To take correct pictures it was given a <b>feeder</b> <b>roll</b> driven by a small electric motor. The ID-scanner has eight unique parts constructed by the students and six components which will be bought in in their finished state...|$|R
