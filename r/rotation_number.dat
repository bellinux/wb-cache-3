40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} to {{construct}} topological template in terms of symbolic dynamics for the diamagnetic Kepler problem is proposed. To confirm the topological template, <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers</b> of invariant manifolds around unstable periodic orbits in a phase space are taken {{as an object of}} comparison. The <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers</b> are determined from the definition and connected with symbolic sequences encoding the periodic orbits in a reduced Poincaré section. Only symbolic codes with inverse ordering in the forward mapping can contribute to the rotation of invariant manifolds around the periodic orbits. By using symbolic ordering, the reduced Poincaré section is constricted along stable manifolds and a topological template, which preserves the ordering of forward sequences and can be used to extract the <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers,</b> is established. The <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers</b> computed from the topological template are the same as those computed from their original definition. Comment: 8 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|Introduction A {{fundamental}} {{goal in the}} modelling {{of complex}} behaviour by means of low-dimensional nonlinear deterministic systems is {{the understanding of the}} transition to chaos from quasiperiodic motion on a T j torus for small j.

The main {{result is}} that an annulus homeomorphism {{homotopic}} to the identity either has a well-defined and continuous assignment of <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers</b> on its chain recurrent set or there exists an interval of <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers</b> and periodic points corresponding to each reduced rational number in the interval. As a corollary, rotational discontinuities force the mapping to admit periodic points of all sufficiently large periods n. In a related result, we provide a criterion for the rotation set of an annulus homeomorphism to be nowhere dense. For homeomorphisms /: A — ► A of the annulus that are homotopic to the identity, the rotation behavior can be predicted from the behavior on individual chain components. A very strong result along these lines, due to Franks [FI], asserts that if a compact chain transitive set A has points x and y with distinct <b>rotation</b> <b>numbers</b> a and ft, then the given map / has, corresponding to each reduced rational p/q in the interval (a, fi), a periodic orbit of period q.
