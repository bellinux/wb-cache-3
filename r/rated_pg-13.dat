5|$|On February 10, 2010, Sony {{announced}} that the film would be released in 3D and IMAX 3D on July 3, 2012. Release dates outside the US were moved up to June in other countries to increase first-week sales. Premieres took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 13. The film is <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> for sequences of action and violence.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} was <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> by the Motion Picture Association of America after changes were made at their request {{in order to avoid}} an R rating, which it had {{received}} twice before. The film was presented and widely released on July 2, 2008 in the United States and the United Kingdom by Columbia Pictures. Hancock received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $624 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the attempt}} to tone down the content, the Motion Picture Association of America deemed the film too violent to <b>rate</b> <b>PG-13,</b> so Gibson {{released}} it as unrated. The re-release showed for three weeks.|$|R

25|$|Along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, also rated PG, Gremlins {{was one of}} {{two films}} in 1984 to {{influence}} the MPAA to create the <b>PG-13</b> <b>rating,</b> with Red Dawn being the first film released in theaters that was given the new rating in August 1984. The scene in which a gremlin explodes in the microwave was particularly influential to the idea that some films too light to be rated R are still too mature to be rated PG. The change to the rating system was not insignificant; the <b>rating</b> <b>PG-13</b> turned out to be appealing to many film patrons, as it implied some excitement without being too explicit.|$|R
5|$|Jay Wolpert {{developed}} a script {{based on the}} theme park ride in 2001, and Stuart Beattie rewrote it in early 2002. Around that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer {{became involved in the}} project; he had Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding the supernatural curse to the storyline. Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and on sets constructed around Los Angeles, California. It was also significant in being the first film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> by the MPAA.|$|E
25|$|The film {{received}} a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 49 out of 100 on Metacritic. This {{is the first}} film in the series to be <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13.</b> The first two films were R-rated.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "parental backlash" [...] criticized Batman Returns with {{violence}} and sexual references that were inappropriate for children despite being <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13.</b> McDonald's shut down their Happy Meal promotion for the film. Burton responded, [...] "I like Batman Returns {{better than the}} first one. There was this big backlash {{that it was too}} dark, but I found this movie much less dark." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart {{commonly}} appears nude in the show, {{although in}} every case only his buttocks are visible. In The Simpsons Movie (2007), Bart appears in a sequence where he is skateboarding while fully nude; several different items cover his genitalia, but {{for a brief moment}} his penis can be seen. The scene {{was one of the first}} worked on for the film, but the producers were nervous about the segment because they thought it would earn the movie an R rating. Despite this, the film was <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "Irreverent Humor Throughout." [...] The scene was later included by Entertainment Weekly in their list of [...] "30 Unforgettable Nude Scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|These 12 locations, {{as well as}} the {{majority}} of other North American 7-Elevens, sold products found in The Simpsons, such as [...] "Buzz Cola", [...] "Krusty-O's", [...] "Squishees", pink frosted [...] "Sprinklicious doughnuts" [...] and other Simpsons-themed merchandise. The Squishees were Slurpees that are sold in special collector cups and the Krusty-O's were made by Malt-O-Meal. Several other 7-Eleven items, such as sandwiches, were sold in Simpsons-themed packaging. It was decided that Duff Beer would not be sold due to the movie being <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13,</b> and the promoters wanted to have [...] "good, responsible fun," [...] though it was noted that it was a tough decision. [...] However, a Duff Energy Drink was released in place of the Duff Beer.|$|E
500|$|On March 19, 2013, Paramount {{announced}} that a sequel to the film {{is in the works}} due to overseas box office numbers. Hansel & Gretel producers Ferrell, McKay, Messick, and Flynn were reported to return. In June 2013, McKay officially confirmed his involvement and said that [...] "everyone feels like as good as the first one is, we can really jack it up a level with the second one. So, fingers crossed everyone will come back" [...] (including Renner and Arterton). McKay suggested that Paramount might insist harder to make the film <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> this time. Talking about Wirkola's [...] "pretty insane" [...] ideas for the second film, McKay said this could be one of those instances where the sequel does go further than the first one." [...] Regarding the storyline, he offered one hint: [...] "Think of different kinds of witchcraft." [...] It was revealed that the sequel will have a 2016 release date.|$|E
500|$|It is <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13</b> by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "intense {{sequences}} of sci-fi violence, action, and language," [...] unlike {{the first three}} films which are rated R. The decision to release the film with a PG-13 rating has met with much criticism from fans, {{as well as the}} media. The rating decision was made after McG cut out a shot of Marcus stabbing a thug with a screwdriver, as the director felt disallowing the young audience due to that one shot was unfair. He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because [...] "It was a soft moment {{between a man and a}} woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in Witness [...] in the end, it felt more like a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters." [...] The producers had expected the rating because of the modern leniency towards violence in PG-13 films, such as the 2007 action film, Live Free or Die Hard.|$|E
50|$|In April, The Weinstein Company {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the MPAA. After toning down the profanity, the film received a new <b>rating</b> of <b>PG-13</b> (for intense thematic material, disturbing content and some strong language—all involving kids), which meant that children of all ages could watch the movie without an adult. The Weinstein Company subsequently announced that the <b>PG-13</b> <b>rated</b> version of Bully would be released nationwide on April 13, 2012. When it was released, its widest release was in 265 theaters.|$|R

2500|$|Warner Bros. {{announced}} in early 2009 {{that they would}} distribute Sucker Punch due {{to the success of}} Snyder's previous film, Watchmen. [...] "They've never said, 'Ahh, it could have been shorter', or, 'Too bad it's so R-ish.' And that's really cool. I'm challenging them again with Sucker Punch." [...] In early interviews, Snyder stated that he would make Sucker Punch an R-rated film, but a later interview stated that he was aiming for it to be <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13.</b> In its theatrical release, the movie was ultimately <b>rated</b> <b>PG-13.</b> Snyder cut many crucial scenes before the film's release in order to satisfy the MPAA's censors, but claimed that the home media release of the film will be a director's cut and closer to his original vision.|$|E

2500|$|George Lucas was set {{to provide}} Abrams with advice as a {{creative}} consultant; however, Lucas had no involvement with the film, with his representative stating Lucas [...] "ideally would love not to see any footage until he walks into the theater next December.
