5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a <b>rethinking</b> <b>of</b> his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E

500|$|By the mid-1920s Sibelius had {{acquired}} {{the status of}} a living national monument and was the principal cultural ambassador of his country, independent since 1917. According to his biographer Guy Rickards, he invested [...] "his most crucial inspiration" [...] into the seven symphonies he composed between 1898 and 1924. The Sibelius scholar James Hepokoski considers the compact, single-movement Seventh Symphony, which Sibelius completed in 1924, to be the composer's most remarkable symphonic achievement, [...] "the consummate realization of his late-style <b>rethinking</b> <b>of</b> form".

Millett added that [...] "one of children's essential rights is to express themselves sexually, probably primarily with each other but with adults as well" [...] and that [...] "the sexual freedom of children {{is an important part of}} a sexual revolution ... if you don't change the social condition of children you still have an inescapable inequality". In this interview, Millett criticized those who wished to abolish age of consent laws, saying the issue was not focused on children's rights but [...] "being approached as the right of men to have sex with kids below the age of consent" [...] and added that [...] "no mention is made of relationships between women and girls".|$|E

2500|$|The 1934 to 1936 Chrysler Imperial {{ushered in}} the 'Airflow' design, {{reflecting}} an interest in streamlining. The car was marketed with the slogan [...] "The car of tomorrow is here today." [...] It featured eight passenger seating and again an eight-cylinder engine. This was the first car to be designed in a wind tunnel. Initial tests indicated that the standard car of the 1920s worked best in the wind-tunnel when pointed backwards with the curved rear deck facing forward. This led to a <b>rethinking</b> <b>of</b> the fundamental design of Chrysler's line of cars. The Airflow was an exceptionally modern and advanced car, and an unparalleled engineering success. Both engine and passenger compartment were moved forward, giving better balance, ride and roadability. An early form of unibody construction was employed, making them extremely strong.
