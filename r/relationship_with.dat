40|$|Investigating how other-oriented perfectionism (OOP) {{differed}} from self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) and socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), Stoeber (2014 a) found OOP to show unique positive <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> the Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) and unique negative <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> nurturance, intimacy, {{and social development}} goals. Aiming to expand on Stoeber’s findings, the present study examined 229 university students investigating the unique relationships of the three forms of perfectionism with humor styles, callous-unemotional-uncaring traits, social value orientations, self- and other-interest, and positive self-evaluations (positive self-regard, feeling superior to others). When multiple regressions were conducted controlling for the overlap between the three forms of perfectionism, OOP showed unique positive <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> aggressive humor, uncaring traits, an individualistic orientation, and positive self-regard and unique negative <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> a prosocial orientation and other-interest. In contrast, SOP showed unique positive <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> affiliative humor and other-interest and unique negative <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> aggressive humor, callous-uncaring traits, and a competitive orientation whereas SPP showed unique positive <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> self-depreciating humor and unemotional traits and unique negative <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> both forms of positive self-evaluations. The findings provide further evidence that OOP is a “dark” form of perfectionism positively associated with narcissistic, antisocial, and uncaring personality characteristics...|$|R
