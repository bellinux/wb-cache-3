40|$|Since the {{coefficient}} matrix of image point <b>observation</b> <b>equations</b> may contain random error, it is proposed that a bundle adjustment method for satellite linear array CCD imagery based on total least squares. Assuming that both point observation random error and {{the coefficient}} matrix random error are independent and identically distributed, a total least squares based bundle adjustment algorithm, which contains both virtual <b>observation</b> <b>equations</b> of exterior elements and error equations of ground control points, has been deduced using Lagrange conditional extremum. The variance {{of any type}} of virtual <b>observation</b> <b>equation</b> can be estimated using variance component estimation. Thus the proposed method can handle with adjustment problems {{with more than one}} type of virtual <b>observation</b> <b>equation</b> and chose the undetermined coefficient in proposed method using priori information or the ridge mark method, which overcomes the deficiency of existing virtual observation total least squares method and ensures that the adjustment problems can be solved correctly and effectively. Experiments have been taken on both simulative data and real satellite linear array images in two areas. Results indicate that the proposed method can get more accurate solutions than traditional least squares algorithm and recently proposed virtual observation total least squares method. The proposed method can also get more accurate bundle adjustment results when compared to conventional method...|$|R

40|$|GPS {{processing}}, {{like every}} processing method for geodetic applications, relies upon least-squares estimation. Quality measures must be defined {{to assure that}} the estimates are close to reality. These quality measures are reliable provided that, first, the covariance matrix of the observations (the stochastic model) is well defined and second, the systematic effects are completely removed (i. e., the functional model is good). In the GPS precise point positioning (PPP) the stochastic and functional models are not as complicated as in the differential GPS processing. We will assess the quality of the GPS Precise Point Positioning in this thesis by trying to define more realistic standard deviations for the station position estimates. To refine the functional model from systematic errors, we have 1) used the phase observations to prevent introducing any hardware bias to the <b>observation</b> <b>equations,</b> 2) corrected <b>observations</b> for all systematic effects with amplitudes of more than 1 cm, 3) used undifferenced observations to prevent having complications (e. g. linearly related parameters) in the system of <b>observation</b> <b>equations.</b> To have a realistic covariance matrix for the observations we have incorporated the ephemeris uncertainties into the system of <b>observation</b> <b>equations.</b> Based on the above-mentioned issues a PPP processing method is designed and numerically tested on the real data of some of the International GNSS Service stations. The results confirm that undifferenced stochastic-related properties (e. g. degrees of freedom) can be reliable means to recognize the parameterization problem in differenced <b>observation</b> <b>equations.</b> These results also imply that incorporation of the satellite ephemeris uncertainties might improve the estimates of the station positions.
