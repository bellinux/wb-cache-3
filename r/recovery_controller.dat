40|$|Abstract — Bipedal {{humanoid}} robots {{are inherently}} unstable to external perturbations, {{especially when they}} are walking on uneven terrain {{in the presence of}} unforeseen collisions. In this paper, we present a push <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> for position-controlled humanoid robots which is tightly integrated with an omnidirectional walk controller. The high level push <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> learns to integrate three biomechanically motivated push recovery strategies with a zero moment point based omnidirectional walk controller. Reinforcement learning is used to map the robot walking state, consisting of foot configuration and onboard sensory information, to the best combination of the three biomechanical responses needed to reject external perturbations. Experimental results show how this online method can stabilize an inexpensive, commerciallyavailable DARwin-OP small humanoid robot...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{optimal control}} strategies for autonomous {{operation of a}} piezoelectric micro-robot with a strict energy budget and payload constraints. Due to the capacitive nature of piezoelectric actuators, traditional analog amplifier based controllers and pulse width modulation based controllers use excessive amounts of energy compared to the actual physical work done by the actuators. Hence, an optimal on-off controller was developed which is the building block for the control strategies proposed in this dissertation. Strategies are presented for minimizing energy consumption during both the charge and discharge phases of actuator and when using feedback. First, an optimal on-off controller and a partial charge <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> are presented. These controllers are developed for driving simple movements of actuators in the robot from a given initial position to a prescribed final position in a given time with minimum number charging of the actuator from external power source. Charge <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> recovers drained energy at the actuator discharge phase as well. Conceptually these optimal movements of the actuators can be combined to form an efficient gait sequence for the robot. Compared to traditional controllers, the proposed on-off controller consumes {{only a fraction of}} energy and the charge <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> uses even lesser; in certain cases charge <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> consumption was observed to be one third of on-off controller consumption for the same motion. Second, a three step strategy is proposed for adding an energy consuming position sensor to the system {{in such a way that}} the sensor is turned on sparingly in order to achieve a certain level of error performance. Under certain assumptions, which may be verified relatively simply, the proposed strategy can be used to find optimal time points to turn on the sensor and update input sequences. Finally, a hybrid energy system architecture containing a small solar cell and a micro-battery which can be used on-board is proposed. A study on selecting optimization parameters based on gait sequences for choosing one of the power sources is presented. Together this is an attempt to form a benchmark for autonomous micro-robotics using piezoelectric actuators from an energy consumption point of view...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Bipedal {{walking in}} human environments is made {{difficult}} by the unevenness {{of the terrain}} and by external disturbances. Most approaches to bipedal walking in such environments either rely upon a precise model of the surface or special hardware designed for uneven terrain. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to stabilize the walking of an inexpensive, commercially-available, position-controlled humanoid robot in difficult environments. We use electrically compliant swing foot dynamics and onboard sensors to estimate the inclination of the local surface, and use a online learning algorithm to learn an adaptive surface model. Perturbations due to external disturbances or model errors are rejected by a hierarchical push <b>recovery</b> <b>controller,</b> which modulates three biomechanically motivated push recovery controllers according to the current estimated state. We use a physically realistic simulation with an articulated robot model and reinforcement learning algorithm to train the push <b>recovery</b> <b>controller,</b> and implement the learned controller on a commercial DARwIn-OP small humanoid robot. Experimental results show that this combined approach enables the robot to walk over unknown, uneven surfaces without falling down...|$|E

By formulating the simultaneous search for a controller and the associated domain of attraction as a single problem, we provide a unified framework in which full-body push <b>recovery</b> <b>controllers</b> can be designed and their performance analyzed. The resulting controller explicitly mod-els external disturbances in the system dynamics and guarantees stabilization under bounded disturbances as well as physical constraints on the robot.

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} fault accommodation algorithm {{based on}} a multi-level hierarchical architecture is proposed for satellite formation flying missions. This framework introduces a high-level (HL) supervisor and two recovery modules, namely a low-level fault recovery (LLFR) module and a formation-level fault recovery (FLFR) module. At the LLFR module, a new hybrid and switching framework is proposed for cooperative actuator fault estimation of formation flying satellites in deep space. The formation states are distributed among local detection and estimation filters. Each system mode represents a certain cooperative estimation scheme and communication topology among local estimation filters.

40|$|An optimal {{controller}} for a 30 kW swirl stabilized spray combustor using a system-identification (SI) based {{model is}} developed. The combustor was operated {{in two different}} configurations. The first consisted of a dual-feed nozzle whose primary fuel stream was utilized to sustain combustion, and the secondary stream was used for active control. The second used a single-feed nozzle with two different swirling air streams. An LQG-LTR (Linear Quadratic Gaussian-Loop Transfer <b>Recovery)</b> <b>controller</b> was designed using the SI based model to determine the active control input, which was in turn used to modulate the secondary fuel stream. Using this controller, the thermoacoustic oscillations, which occurred under lean operating conditions, were reduced to the background noise level. A simpler time-delay controller was also implemented for comparison purposes. The {{results showed that the}} LQG-LTR controller yielded an additional pressure reduction of 14 db compared to the time-delay controller in both configurations. This improvement {{can be attributed to the}} added degrees of freedom of the LQG-LTR controller that allow an optimal shaping of the gain and phase of the controlled combustor over a range of frequencies surrounding the unstable mode.

40|$|Abstract — During heavy work, humans utilize {{whole body}} motions {{in order to}} {{generate}} large forces. In extreme cases, exaggerated weight shifts are used to impart large impact forces. There have been approaches to design stable whole body impact motions based on precise dynamic models of the robot and the target object, but they have practical limitations as the uncertainty in the ensuing reaction forces can lead to instability. In the current work, we describe a motion controller for a humanoid robot that generates impacts at an end effector while keeping the robot body balanced {{before and after the}} impact. Instead of relying on the accuracy of the impact dynamics model, we use a simplified model of the robot and biomechanically motivated push <b>recovery</b> <b>controllers</b> to reactively stabilize the robot against unknown perturbations from the impact. We demonstrate our approach in physically realistic simulations, as well as experimentally on a small humanoid robot platform...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Imitating {{the motion}} of a human {{operator}} is an intuitive and efficient way to make humanoid robots perform complex, human-like behaviors. With the help of recently introduced affordable and real-time depth sensors, the real time imitation of human behavior has become more feasible. However, due to their small footprint and high center of mass, humanoid robots are not inherently stable. The momentum generated by dynamic upper body movements can induce instabilities that are often large {{enough to make the}} robot fall down. In this work, we describe a motion controller for a humanoid robot where the upper body is controlled in real time to imitate a human teacher, and the lower body is reactively stabilized based on the current measured state of the robot. Instead of relying on the accuracy of robot dynamics, we use biomechanically motivated push <b>recovery</b> <b>controllers</b> to stabilize the robot against unknown perturbations that include possible impacts.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of modern industrial processes makes high dependability an essential demand for reducing production loss, avoiding equipment damage, and increasing human safety. A more dependable {{system is a}} system that has the ability to: 1) detect faults as fast as possible; 2) diagnose them accurately; 3) recover the system to the nominal performance as much as possible. Therefore, a robust Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) and a Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) system design have attained increased attention during the last decades. This thesis focuses on the design of a robust model-based FDI system and a performance <b>recovery</b> <b>controller</b> based on a new performance index called Dynamic Safety Margin (DSM). The DSM index is used to measure the distance between a predefined safety boundary in the state space and the system state trajectory as it evolves. The DSM concept, its computation methods, and its relationship to the state constraints are addressed. The DSM can be used in different control system applications; some of them are highlighted in this work. Controller design based on DSM is especially useful for safety-critical systems to maintain a predefined margin of safety during the transient and in the presence of large disturbances. As a result, the application of DSM to controller design and adaptation is discussed in particular for model predictive control (MPC) and PID controller. Moreover, an FDI scheme based on the analysis of the DSM is proposed. Since it is difficult to isolate different types of faults using a single model, a multi-model approach is employed in this FDI scheme. The proposed FDI scheme is not restricted to a special type of fault. In some faulty situations, recovering the system performance to the nominal one cannot be fulfilled. As a result, reducing the output performance is necessary in order to increase the system availability. A framework of FTC system is proposed that combines the proposed FDI and the controllers design based on DSM, in particular MPC, with accepted degraded performance in order to generate a reliable FTC system. The DSM concept and its applications are illustrated using simulation examples. Finally, these applications are implemented in real-time for an experimental two-tank system. The results demonstrate the fruitfulness of the introduced approaches...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose for scalar plants an {{adaptive}} LQG controller with adaptive input sensitivity function/loop transfer recovery of an associated adaptive LQ design. The sensitivity recovery {{can be viewed as}} a frequency-shaped loop recovery where the weights involve a sensitivity function. The adaptive loop/sensitivity recovery is achieved by feeding back the estimation residuals to the control through a stable bounded input, bounded output (BIBO) adaptive filter Q~. For simplicity we consider fixed but uncertain plants in the model set and identification schemes where there are consistent parameter estimates. For non-minimum phase plants an asymptotic partial recovery is achieved via a recursive least squares update of the BIBO filter Qk. The degree of recovery can be prescribed a priori between zero and the maximum possible. For the case of minimum phase plant estimates, full loop recovery may be achieved asymptotically by prescribing a maximum degree of recovery. The motivation for proposing the new adaptive control algorithm is to enhance robustness of adaptive LQG designs, taking advantage of the robustness enhancement properties of sensitivity/loop recovery for off-line designs. The robustness properties of the new algorithm are demonstrated by simulation results.

40|$|Unexpected {{failures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important problems, which cause costly shutdowns in an assembly line. Generally the recovery process is done by the experts or automated error <b>recovery</b> logic <b>controllers</b> embedded in the system.

Generally, the recovery process is done “on-line ” by human experts or automated error <b>recovery</b> logic <b>controllers</b> embedded in the system.

In SDN-based vehicle sensor networks, the data plane is simplified and becomes more efficient by introducing a centralized controller. However, in a wireless environment, the main controller node may leave the sensor network due to the dynamic topology change or the unstable wireless signal, leaving the rest of network devices without control, e. g., a sensor node as a switch may forward packets according to stale rules until the controller updates the flow table entries.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an historical and comparative {{analysis of the}} development of the avenues of <b>recovery</b> from corporate <b>controllers</b> available to creditors of limited liability companies. The thesis proposes that the conflicting goals of the promotion of enterprise through the provision of the privilege of limited liability and the protection of creditors through the provision of a recovery regime have presented both the judiciary and legislatures with a difficult balancing act. This will be demonstrated with evidence of a history of piecemeal and reactive common laws and legislation. In particular it will be observed that the common law has identified a limited category of circumstances where the privilege of limited liability will be rescinded although these have seldom been of advantage to creditors {{with the exception of a}} limited fiduciary duty owed by directors to creditors. It will also be demonstrated that whilst the legislature initially perceived creditor protection in terms of corporate disclosure together with a simplified procedure to enhance the effectiveness of the common law remedies, the inadequacies of these remedies soon witnessed the creation of statutory remedies in the form of fraudulent and, latter, reckless/wrongful trading provisions. These became the lynchpin of the creditor recovery regime notwithstanding a history of deficiencies. The thesis acknowledges that although recent legislative reforms, in the form of an insolvent trading provision, are an improvement these reforms are also not without their limitations. The thesis will also explore issues that have arisen in creditor protection with the emergence of group companies. It will be acknowledged that the legislative response has been limited and creditors have sought to exploit other legal avenues, with torts law providing some assistance. However, against the complexities raised by the multinationalisation of company groups little avenue for redress exists. From a comparative analysis {{of the development of}} creditor recovery regimes overseas (the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand) it will be concluded that, whilst the Australian approach has merit, experiences in these jurisdictions provide some useful lessons. Possible responses to the inadequacies of the law, including the thematic development of the fraudulent and reckless trading provisions, are then explored and a tentative reform proposal consisting of a tripartite structure which distinguishes between small private companies, "typical" trading companies and group companies is put forward. This proposal is compared with the Government's recent legislation which will be shown to essentially satisfy one limb of the reform equation. Outstanding reforms are elaborated upon. The thesis concludes with the proposition that the underlying theme of the creditor recovery regime is that the transfer of risk inherent in the provision of the privilege of liability involves an implicit undertaking by corporate controllers that they will not transfer an inappropriate degree of risk onto creditors and, through them, the community. This is embodied in the requirement that they maintain the solvency of their company or risk recision of the privilege...|$|R
