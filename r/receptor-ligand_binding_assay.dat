The receptors mediating these Interactions have not previously been Identified. In this study, monoclonal antibodies raised to the Integrin α 3 β 1 heterodimer are shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth by rat sympathetic neurons on thrombospondin- 1. α 3 β 1 {{is found to be}} expressed on the cell body, neurites, and growth cones of sympathetic neurons in vitro and on sympathetic axons passing through the thrombospondin-rich outer sheath of the superior cervical ganglion In vivo, consistent with Its role In mediating axon outgrowth. A <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> Is used to demonstrate the direct binding of Immunopurified α 3 β 1 to thrombospondin- 1.

Precursor binding for the small subunit of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase to isolated pea chloroplasts was investigated using a <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assay.</b> Translocation of precursors was blocked by conducting the binding assays at 0 °C. Binding of precursor was judged to be receptor mediated by the following criteria: (a) precursor binding was saturable at between 1500 and 3500 molecules per chloroplast; (b) binding is a high affinity interaction with a dissociation constant of 6 to 10 nanomoles; (c) binding is physiologically productive since most of the bound precursors could be imported from the bound state; and (d) precursor binding was sensitive to both protease and the sulfhydryl modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide. The effects of these two reagents differed in that protease reduced the total number of binding sites from the surface of chloroplasts but had little effect on binding affinity, whereas N-ethylmaleimide reduced the binding affinity but had little or no effect on receptor density...|$|E

In addition, it has been reported that, after cleavage from procollagen, CPP-I exerts feedback control of collagen biosynthesis. To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in each of these processes, we have investigated the nature of cell surface receptors for CPP-I. CPP-I affinity chromatography, using detergent extracts of iodinated HT 1080 cells and EDTA elution, resulted in the isolation of two polypeptides of molecular mass 160 and 110 kDa. Since the migratory behavior of these polypeptides under nonreducing and reducing conditions was characteristic of a subset of integrin receptors, their reactivity with anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies was tested. Antibodies directed against the alpha 2 and beta 1 subunits specifically immunoprecipitated both CPP-I-binding polypeptides, indicating that the CPP-I receptor is the integrin alpha 2 beta 1. CPP-I was found to support the attachment and spreading of HT 1080 cells, demonstrating that it can function as an adhesion protein. Two other approaches supported the identification of alpha 2 beta 1 as the CPP-I receptor. First, anti-functional anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies directed against the alpha 2 and beta 1 subunits completely abrogated the adhesive activity of CPP-I and, second, highly purified CPP-I bound specifically to alpha 2 beta 1 -containing integrin preparations in a solid-phase <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assay.</b> These findings have important implications for the function of fibrillar collagen carboxyl-terminal propeptides and for the role played by integrins in the regulation of cellular phenotype.

40|$|Receptor-ligand {{interactions}} play {{a crucial}} role in biological systems and their measurement forms an important part of modem pharmaceutical development. Numerous assay formats are available that can be used to screen and quantify receptor ligands. In this review, we give an overview over both radioactive and non-radioactive assay technologies with emphasis on the latter. While radioreceptor assays are fast, easy to use and reproducible, their major disadvantage is that they are hazardous to human health, produce radioactive waste, require special laboratory conditions and are thus rather expensive on a large scale. This has led to the development of non-radioactive assays based on optical methods like fluorescence polarization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer or surface plasmon resonance. In light of their application in high-throughput screening environments, there has been an emphasis on so called "mix-and-measure" assays that do not require separation of bound from free ligand. The advent of recombinant production of receptors has contributed to the increased availability of specific assays and some aspects of the expression of recombinant receptors will be reviewed. Applications of <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> described in this review will relate to screening and the quantification of pharmaceuticals in biological matrices.

40|$|Cellular {{adaptation}} to hypoxia is a protective mechanism for neurons and relevant to cancer. Treatment with desferrioxamine (DFO) to induce hypoxia reduced {{the viability of}} human neuronal NMB cells. Surviving/attached cells exhibited profound increases of expression of the human kappa-opioid receptor (hKOR) and hypoxia inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α). The functional relationship between hKOR and HIF- 1 α was investigated using RT-PCR, Western blot, luciferase reporter, mutagenesis, siRNA and <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assays.</b> In surviving neurons, DFO increased HIF- 1 α expression and its amount in the nucleus. DFO also dramatically increased hKOR expression. Two (designated as HIFC and D) out of four potential HIF response elements of the hKOR gene (HIFA–D) synergistically mediated the DFO response. Mutation of both elements completely abolished the DFO-induced effect. The CD 11 plasmid (containing HIFC and D with an 11 bp spacing) produced greater augmentation {{than that of the}} CD 17 plasmid (HIFC and D with a 17 bp-spacing), suggesting that a proper topological interaction of these elements synergistically enhanced the promoter activity. HIF- 1 α siRNA knocked down the increase of endogenous HIF- 1 α messages and diminished the DFO-induced increase of hKOR expression. Increased hKOR expression resulted in the up-regulation of hKOR protein. In conclusion, the adaptation of neuronal hKOR under hypoxia was governed by HIF- 1, revealing a new mechanism of hKOR regulation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) {{isozymes}} are key effectors in G protein-coupled signaling pathways. Prior research {{suggested that}} some isoforms of PLC-β may exist and function as dimers, but {{little is known}} about dimerization of PLC-β. Data from coimmunoprecipitation assays of differentially-tagged PLC-β constructs and sizeexclusion chromatography of native PLC-β support homodimerization of PLC-β 3 and PLC-β 1 isozymes, but not heterodimerization of these isozymes. Size-exclusion chromatography data also suggest that PLC-β 3 and PLC-β 1 form higher affinity homodimers than PLC-β 2. Evidence supportive of limited PLC-β monomerhomodimer equilibrium appears at 100 nM and lower. Further assessment of homodimerization status by co-immunoprecipitation assays with differentially-tagged PLC-β 3 fragments demonstrated that at least two subdomains of PLC-β 3 are involved in dimer formation, one in the catalytic X and Y domains, and the other in the G protein-regulated carboxy-terminal domain. Additionally, microscopic fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays provide evidence consistent with the existence of PLC-β homodimers in a whole cell context. Phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PIP₃) has been proposed as a second messenger that affects a variety of cellular responses. Previously, we had shown that PLC-β 1 and PLC-β 3 bound immobilized PIP₃. In this study, PIP₃ was found to potentiate Ca²⁺-stimulated PLC-β activities using an in vitro reconstitution assay. LY 294002, a specific PI 3 -kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited 10 minutes agoniststimulated total IP accumulation. Both LY 294002 and wortmannin inhibited 90 seconds agonist-stimulated IP₃ accumulation in intact cells. Moreover, transfected p 110 CAAX, a constitutively activated PI 3 -Kinase catalytic subunit, increased 90 seconds oxytocin-stimulated IP₃ accumulation. <b>Receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> indicated that LY 294002 did not affect G protein-coupled receptors directly, suggesting a physiological role for PIP₃ in directly potentiating PLC-β activity. When co-expressed with p 110 CAAX, fluorescence-tagged PLC-β 3 was increasingly localized to the plasma membrane. Conversely, a greater proportion of PLC-β 3 associated with cytosolic fraction following H 9 c 2 cells treatment with LY 294002. Additional observations suggest that the C-tail domain of PLC-β 1 and β 3, not the PH or catalytic XY domain, is important for membrane association...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotection of B 12 -hup against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Exposure of CGNs to glutamate induces apoptosis, as assessed by MTT and LDH assays, FDA staining, Hoechst 33342 staining and DNA fragmentation. B 12 -hup, but not other currently used anti-Alzheimer's agents, could effectively attenuate glutamate-induced apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manners. Meanwhile, MK- 801 could also protect the CGNs from the glutamate-induced apoptosis, suggesting that glutamate-induced apoptosis is largely mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Using the <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assay,</b> it is found bis(12) -hupyridone displaces the binding of [3 H] MK- 801 on NMDA receptor with Ki of 586 nM. In addition, B 12 -hup inhibits the formation of NO and cGMP triggered by glutamate, but {{is not able to}} protect the sodium nitroprusside (SNP) -induced death in CGNs. On the other hand, after the exposure to glutamate, the dephosphorylations of protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) were found to rapidly increase. B 12 -hup inhibited this dephosphorylation and apoptosis in CGNs to a similar extent as the GSK 3 β inhibitors. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of B 12 -hup might possibly involve the modulation of the cleavage of Cdk 5 /p 35 to Cdk 5 /p 25, which has been first activated by glutamate treatment. More interestingly, we also detect that Cdk 5 /p 35 and Cdk 5 /p 25 might regulate the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GSK 3 β respectively. In conclusion, the ensemble of results indicates that B 12 -hup protects CGNs against glutamate-induced apoptosis at least in part by possibly regulating the AKT/GSK 3 β and Cdk 5 /p 25 pathways...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{process in}} the immune response to infection is the activation of T cells following contact with antigen presenting cells. This activation occurs after T cell receptors {{on the surface of}} T cells bind to immunogenic peptides expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells. The binding of T cell receptors to ligands not only leads to the activation of T cells, it is also key to T cell selection in the thymus and the maintenance of a diverse T cell receptor repertoire. T cell receptor bindings are converted into a signal which activates a T cell but there is no universal theory which governs this process. There is experimental evidence to suggest that <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>bindings</b> must be sufficiently long to elicit a T cell response. and that counting devices in the T cell work to allow signal accumulation, decoding and translation into biological responses. In view of these results, this thesis uses mathematical models to explore the timescales associated with T cell responses. A stochastic criterion that T cell responses occur after N receptor-ligand complexes have been bound for at least a dwell time, T, each, is used. The first model of <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding,</b> in conjunction with the stochastic criterion, supports the affinity threshold hypothesis for thymic selection and agrees with the experimentally established ligand hierarchy for thymic negative selection. The initial model of ligand-receptor binding is then extended to include feedback responses, bivalent receptor binding and ligand diffusion through the immunological synapse. By including these mechanisms, the models agree with an array of experimental hypotheses which include: T cells exhibit a digital response to ligand. bivalent T cell receptor engagement stabilises <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>bindings</b> and one ligand is sufficient to elicit a T cell response.

The present study investigated how the exposure of tissue transglutaminase kept in a liquid phase and fixed to a solid support affected the binding of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG autoantibodies in children with untreated and treated celiac disease. Methods: Included were 73 untreated celiac disease children, 50 controls and 80 children with treated celiac disease. IgA and IgG antitissue transglutaminase were measured with solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and liquid phase radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays.</b> For IgG antitissue transglutaminase detection with radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> antihuman IgG and protein A were used.

Results: Both ELISA and radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> detected IgA antitissue transglutaminase in 65 of 73 untreated celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. One additional control child was detected with radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays.</b> Endomysial autoantibodies were present in 62 of 73 celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. IgG antitissue transglutaminase was detected with both ELISA and radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> in 40 of 73 untreated celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. Radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> using protein A detected 20 of 73 additional untreated celiac disease children and one control child with increased IgG antitissue transglutaminase. In treated celiac disease children, 21 of 80 were IgA antitissue transglutaminase positive with radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays,</b> 3 of 80 with ELISA, whereas none had endomysial autoantibodies. Conclusions: No qualitative differences between radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> and ELISA in IgA or IgG antitissue transglutaminase binding from untreated celiac disease children was demonstrated.

For membrane fluidity regionalization analysis of MEC- 1 lymphocytes, two-photon microscopy was used in individual living cells.

We have been able to establish a new tool which detects and evaluates lipid raft clustering from two-photon microscopy images of individual living cells.

However, {{in order to}} analyse the interactions between GDNF and its receptors, researchers have been mostly dependent of radioactive <b>binding</b> <b>assays.</b> We developed a FACS-based <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> for GDNF {{as an alternative to}} current methods. We demonstrated that the FACS-based assay using TGW cells allowed readily detection of GDNF binding and displacement to endogenous receptors. The dissociation constant and half maximal inhibitory concentration obtained were comparable to other studies using standard <b>binding</b> <b>assays.</b> Overall, this FACS-based, simple to perform and adaptable to high throughput setup, provides a safer and reliable alternative to radioactive methods...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the life}} cycle of {{biopharmaceutical}} products, bioanalytical support is provided using ligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> to measure the drug product for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity studies. The specificity and selectivity of these ligand <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> are highly dependent on the ligand binding reagents. Thus the selection, characterization, and management processes for ligand binding reagents are crucial to successful assay development and application. This report describes process considerations for selection and characterization of ligand binding reagents that are integral parts of the different phases of assay development. Changes in expression, purification, modification, and storage of the ligand binding reagents may {{have a profound effect on}} the ligand <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> performance. Thus long-term management of the critical ligand <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> reagents is addressed including suggested characterization criteria that allow ligand binding reagents to be used in as consistent a manner as possible. Examples of challenges related to the selection, modification, and characterization of ligand binding reagents are included...|$|R

25|$|BPA {{has been}} found to bind to both of the nuclear {{estrogen}} receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. It is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol. The drug can both mimic the action of estrogen and antagonize estrogen, indicating that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or partial agonist of the ER. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to receptor binding, the compound {{has been found}} to affect Leydig cell steroidogenesis, including affecting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and aromatase expression and interfering with LH <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding.</b>|$|R
40|$|Glucocorticoid <b>receptor-ligand</b> <b>binding</b> {{kinetics}} of budesonide, a glucocorticoid {{used for}} inhalation therapy, were determined and compared with dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate using glucocorticoid receptors from human lung tissue. From the association 5 21 21 24 21 constant of 18. 9310 l mol min and the dissociation constant of 25. 0310 min resulted the equilibrium dissociation constant KD of 1. 32 nmol / l and a relative receptor affinity of 855 with dexamethasone as reference (100). The half-life of the budesonide-receptor complex was 4. 6 h. Results agree with data derived from competition tests we performed earlier. Ó 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

40|$|The use of two enzyme labels in a dual analyte {{simultaneous}} heterogeneous enzyme-linked competitive <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> is examined. Reaction {{conditions for}} monitoring glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) and [beta]-galactosidase ([beta]-gal) activities are found which enable the independent measurement of each enzyme {{activity in the}} presence of the other. The two enzymes are used as labels in the development of a model simultaneous heterogeneous competitive <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> for detecting the biotin and vitamin B 12 content of vitamin tablets.
