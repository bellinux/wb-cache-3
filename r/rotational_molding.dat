5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> process.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Emilie Savage-Smith {{discovered}} several celestial globes {{without any}} seams in Lahore and Kashmir. Hollow objects are typically cast in two halves, and Savage-Smith {{indicates that the}} casting of a seamless sphere is considered impossible, [...] though techniques such as <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> have been used {{since at least the}} '60s to produce similarly seamless spheres. The earliest seamless globe was invented in Kashmir by the Muslim astronomer and metallurgist Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 1589-90 (AH 998) [...] during Akbar the Great's reign; another was produced in 1659-60 (1070 AH) by Muhammad Salih Tahtawi with Arabic and Sanskrit inscriptions; and the last was produced in Lahore by a Hindu astronomer and metallurgist Lala Balhumal Lahuri in 1842 during Jagatjit Singh Bahadur's reign. 21 such globes were produced, and these remain the only examples of seamless metal globes. These Mughal metallurgists used the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.|$|E

This <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> process was used to create metal artillery shells and other hollow vessels. The main purpose of using <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> was to create consistency in wall thickness and density. In 1905 in the United States F.A. Voelke used this method for the hollowing of wax objects. This led to G.S. Baker's and G.W. Perks's process of making hollow chocolate eggs in 1910. <b>Rotational</b> <b>molding</b> developed further and R.J. Powell used this process for molding plaster of Paris in the 1920s. These early methods using different materials directed the advancements in the way <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> is used today with plastics.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the processing, morphology, mechanical properties, and acoustic properties of new polymeric foam materials. A batch foaming process, a <b>rotational</b> <b>mold</b> foaming process and a constrained mold foaming process were designed and {{applied in the}} producing of polymeric foams. Microcellular closed cell polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) foams were produced using the batch foaming process. The foam morphologies and mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break were investigated by varying the foaming parameters. The PMMA microcellular foam showed superior mechanical properties in tensile strength and elongation at break over conventional foams. Nanoclay was used as reinforcement filler and a nucleation agent for PMMA in the batch foaming process. The nanoclay affected the foaming behavior and enhanced the mechanical properties of the microcellular PMMA foams. The PMMA nanocomposite foam with 0. 5 wt % nanoclay exhibited optimized mechanical properties. Fine celled Polypropylene (PP) and low density Polyethylene (LDPE) foams were also produced using the <b>rotational</b> <b>mold</b> foaming. The processing parameters such as the particle sizes and processing time were important parameters in this process. The obtained PP foam exhibited a greatly improved energy absorption capacity. Opened cell PMMA foams were produced using a particulate leaching/gas foaming method for acoustic absorption applications. The foam morphology i. e. porosity and cell sizes were independently controlled by altering the processing settings. Consequently, the acoustic performance of the foams was manipulated. Finite element analysis was then employed to predict the macroscopic properties of polymeric foams correlated to their microstructure. The predicted elastic responses of both opened cell and closed cell foams showed great agreement with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Various {{manufacturing}} techniques {{exist to}} produce double-curvature shells, including injection, <b>rotational</b> and blow <b>molding,</b> {{as well as}} dip coating. However, these industrial processes are typically geared for mass production and are not directly applicable to laboratory research settings, where adaptable, inexpensive and predictable prototyping tools are desirable. Here, we study the rapid fabrication of hemispherical elastic shells by coating a curved surface with a polymer solution that yields a nearly uniform shell, upon polymerization of the resulting thin film. We experimentally characterize how the curing of the polymer affects its drainage dynamics and eventually selects the shell thickness. The coating process is then rationalized through a theoretical analysis that predicts the final thickness, in quantitative agreement with experiments and numerical simulations of the lubrication flow field. This robust fabrication framework should be invaluable {{for future studies on}} the mechanics of thin elastic shells and their intrinsic geometric nonlinearities.

40|$|The mold {{filling process}} of {{titanium}} alloy in the thin-walled and complicated cavities in hypergravity field {{is the subject}} of this paper. The obtained results indicate that the filling process of the melt in the thin-walled and complicated cavity at different mould rotational speeds is quite complex. The free surface of the melt in the thin-walled ribs moves forward in a near planar way parallel to the gravity direction under different mould <b>rotational</b> speeds. The <b>mold</b> filling process with higher filling rotational speed, 300 rpm and 500 rpm shows that the free surface in the thin-walled ribs and backward filling in the radial runners are in the same vertical plane. Besides, the speed of backward filling in the radial runner is equal to that in the thin-walled ribs. The free surface during the backward filling process at the rotational speeds of 300 rpm and 500 rpm is a series of arc surfaces, while the free surface during backward filling with 150 rpm is not obvious, for the free surface during the forward filling process occupies nearly the whole radial runner...|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal casting is a {{technology}} used for manufacturing hybrid rocket paraffin grains. This technology helps avoiding voids formation inside the solid paraffin as it cools. Voids are formed because of air bubbles being entrapped while pouring {{and because the}} liquid wax shrinks by 17 â€“ 19 % upon cooling. In this work, the centrifugal casting process for the manufacturing of paraffin cylinders was prototyped at two different scales considering critical casting issues. The effects of process parameters (rotational speed, melt temperature, and flow rate) on the tensile properties of the manufactured grains were analyzed. The results of the optimization conducted at the lower scale (2. 5 [*]kg) were up scaled to manufacture 25 [*]kg grains. The resulting mechanical properties complied with the design specifications, and they were better than those characterized from the gravity cast wax. A numerical model of growth and dissolution of bubbles during the process was then developed to predict {{the quality of the}} castings. The numerical results showed how increasing the <b>mold</b> <b>rotational</b> speed up to 1800 [*]rpm reduced the removal time. However, compared to grains solidification time, the predicted removal times were much shorter, proving the advantage of centrifugal casting in counteracting voids formation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to explore {{microstructural}} and mechanical properties of cast Al-Si-Cu aluminum alloy (ADC 12). To obtain excellent material properties, the cast Al alloys were produced by an originally developed <b>mold</b> <b>rotational</b> machine, namely liquid aluminum alloy is solidified during high speed rotating. The casting process was conducted under various casting conditions, in which the following factors were altered, e. g., melt temperature, metal mold temperature and different rotational speed. Microstructural characteristics were examined by direct observation using an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the secondary dendrite arm spacing of alpha-Al phase (SDAS) and the size of Si eutectic phase were identified. Mechanical properties were investigated by micro-hardness and tensile tests. Rotation speed and melt temperature were directly attributed to the SDAS, and severe shear stress arising from the rotation made fine and complicated grain structure, leading to the high mechanical properties. The extent of the shear stress was altered depending on the area of the sample due to the different shear stress. Furthermore, high melt temperature and high rotational speed decrease the size of Si eutectic phases. The high mechanical properties were detected for the cast samples produced by the casting condition as follows: melt temperature 700 oC, mold temperature 400 oC and rotation speed 400 rp...|$|R

50|$|In {{some cases}} <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> {{can be used}} as a {{feasible}} alternative to blow molding, this is due to the similarity in product outputs, with products such as plastic bottles and cylindrical containers, this is only effective on a smaller scale as it much more costly to blow mold regarding a small output, and with fewer resulting products <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> is much cheaper, due to blow molding relying on economies of scale regarding efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> {{process is}} a high-temperature, {{low-pressure}} plastic-forming process that uses heat and biaxial rotation (i.e., angular rotation on two axes) to produce hollow, one-piece parts.Critics of the process point to its long cycle times - {{only one or two}} cycles an hour can typically occur, as opposed to other processes such as injection molding, where parts can be made in a few seconds.

50|$|Ron Rezek's {{career began}} in 1970 {{while he was}} a {{graduate}} student at UCLA working on an MFA degree, studying industrial design and working as a teaching assistant. While experimenting with <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> of plastic, in particular cross-linking orange polyethylene to produce an extremely tough and seamless plastic vessel, he was approached by a Los Angeles county lifeguard to investigate an alternative for the spun aluminum rescue can. After meeting with Captain Bob Burnside at a lifeguard station at Zuma Beach, CA, Rezek realized that <b>rotational</b> <b>molding</b> was the perfect production process for a water rescue device because it produced a watertight seam.

50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, extrusion, <b>rotational</b> <b>molding,</b> blow molding, thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes. Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam molding has high equipment and tooling cost. Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, <b>rotational</b> <b>molding,</b> blow molding, thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.|$|E
