500|$|On 26 February 1821, Portuguese troops {{stationed}} in Rio de Janeiro mutinied. Neither JoãoVI nor his government made any move against the mutinous units. Pedro decided {{to act on}} his own and rode to meet the rebels. He negotiated with them and convinced his father to accept their demands, which included naming a new cabinet and making an oath of obedience to the forthcoming Portuguese Constitution. On 21 April, the parish electors of Rio de Janeiro met at the Merchants' Exchange to elect their representatives to the Cortes. A small group of agitators seized the meeting and formed a revolutionary government. Again, JoãoVI and his ministers remained passive, and the monarch was about to accept the revolutionaries' demands when Pedro took the initiative and sent army troops to re-establish order. Under pressure from the Cortes, JoãoVI and his family departed for Portugal on 26 April, leaving behind Pedro and Maria Leopoldina. Two days before he embarked, the King warned his son: [...] "Pedro, if Brazil breaks away, let it rather do so for you, who will <b>respect</b> <b>me,</b> than for one of those adventurers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to building a}} legal career, and {{becoming one of the}} most successful legal professionals of the 1870s, Fleva created a trademark and highly unconventional political style. Described by contemporaries as possessing a warm and engaging voice, he relied on patriotic-themed oratory, and reportedly could speak for four hours on end without accepting interruptions. He notoriously organized electoral National Liberal rallies in front of patriotic landmarks, such as the Michael the Brave Monument in University Square. With time, Fleva became known to his supporters as Tribunul, [...] "the Tribune", or variations of that nickname. Writing in 2011, journalist Maria Apostol called him [...] "one of the most controversial political figures in the history of Romania." [...] Fleva himself did not preoccupy himself with his colleagues' resentment of his conduct, publicizing his motto: [...] "I'd rather have enemies who <b>respect</b> <b>me</b> than friends who despise me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to <b>respect</b> <b>me</b> enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
