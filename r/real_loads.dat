40|$|Abstract. The <b>real</b> <b>loading</b> is {{generally}} constituted {{only by the}} outside forces and torques acting on a system, neglecting other influences. An important problem is the including the aleatory <b>real</b> <b>loading</b> in the strength and reliability estimation. The analysis of the actual state of researches in field promotes an interesting observation: there are not proposed even clear methods and principles in literature regarding {{the establishment of the}} model of real loading; these are presented relatively vague omitting essential details for their applying. The strength calculation is based by the correction of the nominal load through factors including the exterior influences. Papers published in Romania in the field of real modeling are also mentioned. Considerations on <b>real</b> <b>loading</b> in the strength and reliability estimation for specific models are presented. There are two models of <b>real</b> <b>loading</b> much used that are discussed in the paper: loading spectra and loading sequences. Final conclusions emphasize the main points of the paper. In this way, the paper offers an up-to-date image on the <b>real</b> <b>loading</b> modeling of the mechanical systems and the new problems that could be focused in future research started at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest...|$|R

50|$|Real {{transmission}} lines typically serve inductive loads, {{which are the}} motors that exist everywhere in modern electronics and machines. Transferring {{a large amount of}} reactive power Q to inductive loads makes the line current lag voltage, and the voltage regulation is characterized by decrease in voltage magnitude. In transferring a large amount of real power P to <b>real</b> <b>loads,</b> current is mostly in phase with voltage. The voltage regulation in this scenario is characterized by a decrease in phase angle rather than magnitude.|$|E

40|$|AbstractInductive power {{transfer}} systems {{are widely used}} to supply {{the current generation of}} biomedical implants. However, the {{power transfer}} efficiency is highly dependent on both the mutual coupling of the coils and the load impedance of the implant side. To overcome the challenge of time-dependent coil orientation and load impedance changes due to different power consumption levels, a maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) system for inductive links is presented within this work. After characterizing the momentary mutual inductance of the transmission channel, the designed system calculates the optimum load impedance and performs a dynamic impedance matching by emulating this optimum load with an input voltage-controlled switching regulator. Therefore, the presented system is capable of extracting energy at the best case efficiency {{for a wide range of}} <b>real</b> <b>loads.</b> The implemented system features a small system size (14 x 14 mm 2) and a low self-consumption of only 250  μW, while providing up to 100 mW to the load...|$|E
