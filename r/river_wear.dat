5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the doorway to The Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>River</b> <b>Wear.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Second World War brought havoc to Wearside, with Sunderland one of {{the seven}} most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy {{shelling}} of the North East coast and <b>River</b> <b>Wear,</b> the Echo offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The Shields Gazette, the Echo's nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, South Shields, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on the Echo presses. The Echo continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper rationing, a lack of reporters and a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the Echo—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on newsprint reduced the former broadsheet to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{is set in}} {{the area}} which is now {{southern}} Scotland and north-east England. Around the year 600 this area included a number of Brythonic kingdoms. Apart from the Gododdin, the kingdom of Alt Clut occupied the Strathclyde area and Rheged covered parts of Galloway, Lancashire and Cumbria. Further south lay the kingdom of Elmet in the Leeds area. These areas made up what was later known in Welsh as Yr Hen Ogledd (The Old North). The Gododdin, known as the Votadini in the Romano-British period, occupied a territory from the area around the head of the Firth of Forth as far south as the <b>River</b> <b>Wear.</b> In modern terms their lands included much of Clackmannanshire and the Lothian and Borders regions. Their capital at this period may have been called Din Eidyn, now known as Edinburgh. By this time the area that later became Northumbria had been invaded and increasingly occupied by the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia.|$|E

5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the <b>River</b> <b>Wear,</b> “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of a number of}} flood routing methods has been carried out in this study. These methods are namely, the Muskingum-Cunge Method, the Variable Parameter Diffusion Method, the State Variable Kinematic Wave Model, and the state variable modelling of nonlinear Muskingum Model. The Muskingum-Cunge and Variable Parameter Diffusion Methods are recommended for use on British Rivers by the Natural Environment Research Council flood studies report, 1975. In using numerical flood routing model, {{it is very important to}} calculate the model parameters. For instance storage routing models require a suitable form of storage-discharge relationship. Past flow records were used for the above calculation. The state Variable Kinematic Wave Model has been applied for routing the flood hydrograph through river reaches. The stage and discharge are computed by a kinematic wave routing technique using the state variable approach in which the one-dimensional differential equations of unsteady flow are solved by state and output equations of the state variable model. The nonlinear Muskingum equation has been solved using the state variable modelling technique. Two parameter estimation techniques namely, Hooke-Jeeves and linear regression, are employed for the calibration of the nonlinear Muskingum model parameters (a, x, and m). The applicability of the flood routing model computer programs to different flood events of different seasons for reaches of both the <b>Rivers</b> <b>Wear</b> and Tees is demonstrated. Discriptions of the geology and hydrological data for reaches of both the <b>Rivers</b> <b>Wear</b> and Tees are given in this study. The computed and observed hydrographs of flood routing models used in this study are compared...|$|R

50|$|Channel flow {{describes}} the {{process through which}} hot, viscous crustal material flows horizontally between the upper crust and lithospheric mantle, and is eventually pushed to the surface. This model aims to explain features common to metamorphic hinterlands of some collisional orogens, most notably the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau system. In mountainous areas with heavy rainfall (thus, high erosion rates) deeply incising rivers will form. As these <b>rivers</b> <b>wear</b> away the Earth's surface two things occur: (1) pressure is reduced on the underlying rocks effectively making them weaker and (2) the underlying material moves closer to the surface. This reduction of crustal strength, coupled with the erosional exhumation, allows for the diversion of the underlying channel flow toward the Earth's surface.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} the Sunderland area were Stone Age hunter-gatherers and artifacts from this era have been discovered, including microliths found during excavations at St Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth. During {{the final phase of}} the Stone Age, the Neolithic period (c. 4000 – c. 2000 BC), Hastings Hill, on the western outskirts of Sunderland, was a focal point of activity and a place of burial and ritual significance. Evidence includes the former presence of a cursus monument. It is believed the Brigantes inhabited the area around the <b>River</b> <b>Wear</b> in the pre- and post-Roman era.
