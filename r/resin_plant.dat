5000|$|Anthidium is a genus of bees {{often called}} carder or potter bees, who use conifer <b>resin,</b> <b>plant</b> hairs, mud, or {{a mix of}} them to build nests. They are in the family Megachilidae which is {{cosmopolitan}} in distribution and made up of species that are mostly solitary bees with pollen-carrying scopa that are only located on the ventral surface of the abdomen. Other bee families have the pollen-carrying structures on the hind legs. Typically species of Anthidium feed their brood on pollen and nectar from plants. Anthidium florentinum bees are distinguished from most of its relatives by yellow or brick-red thoracic bands. They fly all summer and make the nests in holes in the ground, walls or trees, with hairs plucked from plants.|$|E
5000|$|Most Anthidium {{species are}} leaf-cutting bees who use conifer <b>resin,</b> <b>plant</b> hairs, earth, or a {{combination}} of these as material for the nest walls. Their abdominal bands are usually interrupted in the middle. There is no lobe (arolium) between their claws. Anthidium manicatum is commonly known as the wool carder bee which uses comblike mandibles to [...] "comb" [...] plant fibers into its brood cell walls. It has spread from Europe to North and South America. The males are much larger (ca. 18 mm) than the females (ca.12 mm) which is not uncommon among Megachilidae, but very rare among other bee families (e.g., the true honey bees, genus Apis). The males also have three [...] "thorns" [...] at their abdominal apex which they use as weapons when defending their territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of melamine-urea-formaldehyde resins is of key {{importance in the}} manufacture of engineered wood products such as medium density fibreboard (MDF) and other wood composite products. Often the MDF manufacturing plant has little available information on the resin reactivity other than details of the resin specification at the time of batch manufacture, which often occurs off-site at a third-party <b>resin</b> <b>plant.</b> Often too, fresh resin on delivery at the MDF plant is mixed with variable volume of aged resin in storage tanks, thereby rendering any specification of the fresh resin batch obsolete. It is therefore highly desirable to develop a real-time, at-line or on-line, process analytical technology to monitor the quality of the resin prior to MDF panel manufacture. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been calibrated against standard quality methods and against 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measures of molecular composition in order to provide at-line process analytical technology (PAT), to monitor the resin quality, particularly the formaldehyde content of the resin. At-line determination of formaldehyde content in the resin was made possible using a six-factor calibration with an R 2 (cal) value of 0. 973, and R 2 (CV) value of 0. 929 and a root-mean-square error of cross-validation of 0. 01.

40|$|The {{carbonatation}} {{process at}} the Huletts refinery (Hulref) consists of adding a slurry of calcium hydroxide in water to the raw melt solution, to a desired pH. Carbon dioxide gas is then bubbled into the sugar solution, in saturators, under controlled conditions of alkalinity and temperature. Separation of the clear liquor and the calcium carbonate is done by filtration. The filter station at the refinery consists of 13 rotary leaf filters and four plate and frame filters. The performance of these filters has been deteriorating due to age and lack of maintenance. As a result there is a carryover of impurities which adversely affects {{the performance of the}} <b>resin</b> <b>plant</b> and also refined sugar quality. Options were considered regarding the way forward with the filter station. The installation of new filters was considered. Currently fully automated membrane filter presses are available that carry out both the filtration and de-sweetening of the calcium carbonate cake in one filtration step. This has major advantages in terms of operating personnel, liquor quality and quality of the filter cake. The new filters would reduce the moisture of the filter cake from 52 % to less than 30 %. The loss of sugar in the cake would also be reduced. This paper describes the pilot plant tests that were done.

40|$|We use a {{modified}} optimal market area model {{to examine how}} links between material recycling {{and other aspects of}} operations strategy can shape plant networks for the processing of recyclable materials. We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling- and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon <b>resin</b> <b>plant</b> networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy...|$|E

The highly diverse Megachilidae use a wide range of plant-derived brood cell-building materials, including plant leaves, mortar made from plant tissue, <b>resin,</b> <b>plant</b> hairs (‘plant wool’), and plant trichome secretions. While certain plant-derived materials are believed to protect nests against microbial decay, this has not been tested, and the factors driving diversification of nesting materials are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the protective effects of plant-derived extrafloral trichome secretions which female European wool-carder bees, Anthidium manicatum, smear on their brood cells. By breeding bees in cages with differential resource supply we generated brood cells with or without trichome secretions. Brood cells with trichome secretions were less attractive to parasitic wasps (Monodontomerus obscurus) in Y-maze olfactometer tests. Also, when exposed at sites where A. manicatum occurs in natural populations, brood cells smeared with trichome secretions were less affected by wasp (Melittobia acasta) parasitism than those without trichome secretions. On the other hand, trichome secretions did not prevent the growth of mold on brood cells, and larval mortality due to microbial decay was almost non-existent even when brood cells were exposed to rainfall. We conclude that the use of plant trichome secretion for brood cell construction has more likely evolved to create enemy-free space in response to chalcidoid wasp parasitism. Parasitoids are likely an underestimated cause of the diversification of cell construction materials and adaptive radiation in megachilid bees...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2015. Major: Entomology. Advisor: Marla Spivak. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xx, 112 pages. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), like many social insects, have collective behavioral defenses called “social immunity” to help defend {{and protect the}} colony against pathogens and parasites. One example of social immunity is the collection of plant resins by honey bees and {{the placement of the}} resins on the interior walls of the nest cavity, where it is called a propolis envelope. Propolis is known to have many antimicrobial proprieties against bacteria, fungi, and viruses and has been harvested from bee hives for use in human medicine since antiquity. However the benefit of propolis to honey bees has not been studied until recently. This dissertation research focused on how bees collect and use the antimicrobial properties of plant resins within the hive as a form of social immunity and defense against infectious bacterial and fungal pathogens. In the first experiment, the benefit of a naturally constructed propolis envelope to individual bee health was assessed by quantifying the gene expression of immune-related genes via real-time PCR, and to colony health by measuring colony strength, pathogen and parasite load of large field colonies. The presence of a propolis envelope within hives of apparently healthy colonies directly affected individual bee health by decreasing the baseline and variability in expression of immune-related genes (such as hymenoptaecin and abaecin) throughout the active foraging season. As the immune system {{is one of the most}} costly physiological systems to maintain in animals, a decrease in energetic costs associated with the maintenance of an up-regulated immune system helps bees allocate their energy toward vital tasks (e. g. foraging, rearing brood) and maintain higher storage protein levels in their bodies required for overwintering success. The propolis envelope also benefited colony strength in the spring and increased colony survivorship in one year of the study. In a second experiment, after colonies were challenged with a highly infectious brood bacterial pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae, nurse bee immune system activity and the antimicrobial activity of larval food (fed to young larvae by nurse bees), were both higher when challenged colonies had a propolis envelope compared to when they did not have the envelope. The immune system activity of nurse bees was measured via real-time PCR, using primers for 3 honey bee antimicrobial peptides (hymenoptaecin, apidaecin and defensin- 1). A bacterial growth assay was performed to assess the inhibitory activity of larval food from 1 - 2 day old larvae against the growth of P. larvae. Colonies with a propolis envelope had reduced level of American foulbrood clinical signs (caused by P. larvae) two months following challenge, which was likely due to a combination of the effects of propolis on both the collective and individual behavioral responses (larval food bioactivity and individual bee immune response). The results of this experiment reveal a novel therapeutic effect of the propolis envelope and a protective physiological response of nurse bees towards the brood. The third experiment explored the role of resin collection by honey bees as a general vs. specialized immune defense against the two highly infectious brood pathogens, Ascosphaera apis (a fungal pathogen that causes chalkbrood) and P. larvae (a bacterial pathogen that causes American foulbrood). The hypothesis was tested that bees self-medicate with resin in response to infection with either pathogen. Results from three years of data suggested that bees significantly increased resin collection, that is, self-medicated the colony with resin, in response to A. apis challenge, but not in response to challenge with P. larvae. We also tested the hypothesis that bees may shift their selection of resin sources at the colony-level after challenge with the fungal or bacterial pathogen, and, if so, how the antimicrobial activity might differ between the pre- and post-challenge <b>resin</b> <b>plant</b> sources. Resin loads from each bee were analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify the plant sources of resin. The inhibitory activity of each resin source against A. apis and P. larvae was quantified using dilution assays for each pathogen. After challenge with either pathogen, colonies increased the number of foragers collecting resin from the plants they were already visiting, and not necessarily from the most inhibitory resin. This study sheds light on the complex way in which colony-level behavioral defenses contribute to diminish pathogen infection, and on the role of resins as pharmacological agents in the ecology and evolution of plant-animal interactions. Further research will be necessary to investigate whether bees self-medicate with resin based on resin quality or available quantity. In all, these studies demonstrate the significance of the propolis envelope as a crucial component of the nest architecture in honey bee colonies. The collection and deposition of resins into the nest architecture impacts individual immunity, colony health, and induces honey bees antimicrobial defenses. These results emphasize the importance of resin to bees and show that plants are not only a source of food but can also be "pharmacies. ...|$|E
