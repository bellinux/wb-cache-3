40|$|Abstract Background The aquatic birnavirus {{infectious}} pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) causes {{infectious pancreatic necrosis}} (IPN), {{a severe}} disease in farmed salmonid fish. IPNV has a very broad host range and infects many different species of fish as well as molluscs and crustaceans. Investigation of the host <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> may reveal important molecular mechanisms governing the infection processes such as receptors and entry mechanisms. In the present work we have studied whether IPNV is able to infect cells with different mammalian origin. Results IPNV bound in a specific manner to a membrane protein of the rabbit kidney cell line RK- 13 {{as shown by the}} use of a virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA). Six different mammalian cell lines were inoculated with IPNV and incubated in parallels at different temperatures. At 7 days post inoculation (dpi), IPNV was detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) in all the cell lines. Confocal microscopy confirmed intracellular presence of the virus. No apparent cytopathic effect (cpe) was observed in any of the cultures, and no viral replication was demonstrated with real-time RT-PCR. Conclusion Our results show that IPNV is able to enter into a wide range of mammalian cells, and virus entry is most likely receptor mediated.

40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is a new}} {{human disease}} caused by an animal coronavirus that adapted to efficient human-to-human transmission. The disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China and spread globally within months. The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with diarrhea, lymphopenia, and mild liver dysfunction being common extra-pulmonary manifestations. Increasing age {{and the presence of}} underlying respiratory diseases worsens the prognosis. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, transmission of SARS was less frequent in the first 5 days of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract {{at this stage of the}} illness. This fortuitous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and abort the SARS outbreak. Bats are a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>virus</b> closely related to SARS CoV and this may be the likely precursor from which the human-adapted SARS CoV emerged. Small mammals such as ‘civet-cats’ (Paguma larvata) within live animal markets in southern China serve as amplifiers of infection and these markets were the likely interface where zoonotic transmission occurred. The viral spike protein is necessary and sufficient for inducing protective antibody responses and has been a key target in the development of candidate vaccines. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

To address this, 18, 679 samples from 7728 Mallard ducks captured between 2002 and 2009 at a single stopover site in Sweden were screened for IAV infections, and the resulting 1081 virus isolates were analyzed for patterns of immunity. We found support for development of homosubtypic hemagglutinin (HA) immunity during the peak of IAV infections in the fall. Moreover, re-infections with the same HA subtype and related prevalent HA subtypes were uncommon, suggesting the development of natural homosubtypic and heterosubtypic immunity (p-value = 0. 02). Heterosubtypic immunity followed phylogenetic relatedness of HA subtypes, both at the level of HA clades (p-value = 0. 04) and the level of HA groups (p-value = 0. 05).

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} <b>A</b> <b>viruses,</b> such as {{the highly}} pathogenic avian H 5 N 1 viruses, sporadically enter the human population but often do not transmit between individuals. In rare cases, however, they establish a new lineage in humans. In addition to well-charac-terized barriers to cell entry, one major hurdle which avian viruses must overcome is their poor polymerase activity in human cells. There is compelling evidence that these viruses overcome this obstacle by acquiring adaptive mutations in the polymerase subunits PB 1, PB 2, and PA and the nucleoprotein (NP) {{as well as in}} the novel polymerase cofactor nuclear export protein (NEP). Recent findings suggest that synthesis of the viral genomemay represent the major defect of avian polymerases in human cells. While the precise mechanisms remain to be unveiled, it appears that <b>a</b> broad spectrum <b>of</b> polymerase adaptive mutations can act collectively to overcome this defect. Thus, identification andmonitoring of emerging adaptive mutations that further increase polymerase activity in human cells are critical to estimate the pandemic potential of avian viruses. Although the natural <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> lackingadaptivemutations that increase polymerase activity inmam-malian cells (1 – 53) are wild birds (54), mammals are frequently infected with influenza viruses of avian origin.

During routine influenza surveillance, we isolated an unconventional H 6 N 5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Experimental infection of mice revealed that this isolate replicated efficiently in the lungs, subsequently spread systemically, and caused lethality. The isolate also productively infected ferrets, with direct evidence of contact transmission, but no disease or transmission was seen in pigs. Although the isolate possessed the conserved receptor-binding site sequences of avian influenza viruses, it exhibited relatively low replication efficiencies in ducks and chickens.

Further studies will be required to examine why our isolate has the virologic characteristics of mammalian influenza viruses but the archetypal receptor binding profiles of avian influenza viruses, as well as to determine whether its potential virulence markers (PB 1 analogous to those of H 5 N 1 viruses or isoleucine residue at position 97 within PA) could render it highly pathogenic in mice...|$|R
40|$|Outbreaks {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI), which originate in poultry upon transmission of low pathogenic viruses from wild birds, have occurred relatively {{frequently in the}} last decade. During our ongoing surveillance studies in wild birds, we isolated several influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> hemagglutinin subtype H 5 and H 7 that contain various neuraminidase subtypes. For each of the recorded H 5 and H 7 HPAI outbreaks in Europe since 1997, our collection contained closely related virus isolates recovered from wild birds, as determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin gene and antigenic characterization of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. The minor genetic and antigenic diversity between the viruses recovered from wild birds and those causing HPAI outbreaks indicates that influenza <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> surveillance studies in wild birds can help generate prototypic vaccine candidates and design and evaluate diagnostic tests, before outbreaks occur in animals and humans.

Viruses containing HA of subtypes H 5 and H 7 may become highly pathogenic after introduction in poultry and cause outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, formerly termed fowl plague) (1, 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT Avian {{species are}} <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> {{influenza}} <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> and could harbor viruses with significant pandemic potential. We examined the antibody and cellular immune responses to influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> in field or laboratory workers with <b>a</b> spectrum <b>of</b> occupational exposure to avian species {{for evidence of}} zoonotic infections. Wemeasured the seroprevalence and T cell responses among 95 individuals with various types and degrees of prior field or laboratory occupational exposure to wild North American avian species using whole blood samples collected in 2010. Plasma samples were tested using endpoint enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination (HA) inhibition (HAI) assays to subtypes H 3, H 4, H 5, H 6, H 7, H 8, and H 12 pro-teins. Detectable antibodies were found against influenza HA antigens in 77 % of individuals, while 65 % of individuals tested had measurable T cell responses (gamma interferon [IFN-] enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay [ELISPOT]) to multiple HA antigens of avian origin. To begin defining the observed antibody specificities, Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that ELISA responses, which measure both head- and stalk-binding antibodies, do not predict HAI reactivities, which measure pri-marily head-binding antibodies. This result suggests that ELISA titers can report cross-reactivity based on the levels of non-head-binding responses. However, the strongest positive correlate of HA-specific ELISA antibody titers was receipt of seasonal influenza virus vaccination. Occupational exposure was largely uncorrelated with serological measures, {{with the exception of}} individuals exposed to poultry, who had higher levels of H 7 -specific antibodies than non-poultry-exposed individuals.

In the present study, we investigated whether LPAI infection incurred ecological or physiological costs to migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in terms of body mass loss and staging time, and whether such costs could influence the likelihood for long-distance dispersal of the avian influenza virus by individual ducks. During the autumn migrations of 2002 - 2007, we collected faecal samples (n = 10 918) and biometric data from mallards captured and banded at Ottenby, a major staging site in a flyway connecting breeding and wintering areas of European waterfowl. Body mass was significantly lower in infected ducks than in uninfected ducks (mean difference almost 20 g over all groups), and the amount of virus shed by infected juveniles was negatively correlated with body mass. There was no general effect of infection on staging time, except for juveniles in September, in which birds that shed fewer viruses stayed shorter than birds that shed more viruses. LPAI infection did not affect speed or distance of subsequent migration. The data from recaptured individuals showed that the maximum duration of infection was on average 8. 3 days (s. e. 0. 5), with a mean minimum duration of virus shedding of only 3. 1 days (s. e. 0. 1). Shedding time decreased during the season, suggesting that mallards acquire transient immunity for LPAI infection. In conclusion, deteriorated body mass following infection was detected, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether this has more long-term fitness effects.

40|$|Wild {{waterfowl}} is {{the natural}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> (IAV); hosted viruses are very variable and provide a source for genetic segments which can reassort with poultry or mammalian adapted IAVs to generate novel species crossing viruses. Additionally, wild waterfowl act as a reservoir for highly pathogenic IAVs. Exposure of wild birds to the antiviral drug oseltamivir may occur in the environment as its active metabolite can be released from sewage treatment plants to river water. Resistance to oseltamivir, or to other neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), in IAVs of wild waterfowl has not been extensively studied. In a previous in vivo Mallard experiment, an influenza A(H 6 N 2) virus developed oseltamivir resistance by the R 292 K substitution in the neuraminidase (NA), when the birds were exposed to oseltamivir. In this study we tested if the resistance could be maintained in Mallards without drug exposure. Three variants of resistant H 6 N 2 /R 292 K virus were each propagated during 17 days in five successive pairs of naïve Mallards, while oseltamivir exposure was decreased and removed. Daily fecal samples were analyzed for viral presence, genotype and phenotype. Within three days without drug exposure no resistant viruses could be detected by NA sequencing, which was confirmed by functional NAI sensitivity testing. We conclude that this resistant N 2 virus could not compete in fitness with wild type subpopulations without oseltamivir drug pressure, and thus has no potential to circulate among wild birds. The {{results of this study}} contrast to previous observations of drug induced resistance in an avian H 1 N 1 virus, which was maintained also without drug exposure in Mallards. Experimental observations on persistence of NAI resistance in avian IAVs resemble NAI resistance seen in human IAVs, in which resistant N 2 subtypes do not circulate, while N 1 subtypes with permissive mutations can circulate without drug pressure. We speculate that the phylogenetic group N 1 NAs may easier compensate for NAI resistance than group N 2 NAs, though further studies are needed to confirm such conclusions...|$|R

These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/ 56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H 13 gull strains, and all other avian strains.

(iii) All <b>of</b> the influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, {{and it is possible}} that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China.

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses with H 5 and H 7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes evolve from low-pathogenic precursors through {{the acquisition of}} multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been observed to occur naturally only in these HA subtypes, {{little is known about}} the genetic basis for the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that consecutive adenine residues and a stem-loop structure, which are frequently found in the viral RNA region encoding amino acids around the cleavage site of low-pathogenic H 5 and H 7 viruses isolated from waterfowl reservoirs, are important for nucleotide insertions into this RNA region. A reporter assay to detect nontemplated nucleotide insertions and deep-sequencing analysis of viral RNAs revealed that <b>an</b> increased number <b>of</b> adenine residues and enlarged stem-loop structure in the RNA region accelerated the multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions required to create codons for basic amino acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were not observed principally in the viral RNA of other subtypes tested (H 1, H 2, H 3, and H 4). Our findings suggest that the RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide insertions, providing a clue as to why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to the particular HA subtypes. IMPORTANCE Influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H 1 to - 16) maintained in waterfowl <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses,</b> H 5 and H 7 viruses often become highly pathogenic through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980 s, the genetic basis for nucleotide insertions has remained unclear. This study shows the potential role of the viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and demonstrates a key mechanism explaining why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to particular HA subtypes in nature. Our findings will contribute to better understanding of the ecology <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines against H 5 and H 7 influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> with increased stability...|$|R
40|$|Background Wild {{waterfowl}} is {{the natural}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> (IAV); hosted viruses are very variable and provide a source for genetic segments which can reassort with poultry or mammalian adapted IAVs to generate novel species crossing viruses. Additionally, wild waterfowl act as a reservoir for highly pathogenic IAVs. Exposure of wild birds to the antiviral drug oseltamivir may occur in the environment as its active metabolite can be released from sewage treatment plants to river water. Resistance to oseltamivir, or to other neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), in IAVs of wild waterfowl has not been extensively studied. Aim and Methods In a previous in vivo Mallard experiment, an influenza A(H 6 N 2) virus developed oseltamivir resistance by the R 292 K substitution in the neuraminidase (NA), when the birds were exposed to oseltamivir. In this study we tested if the resistance could be maintained in Mallards without drug exposure. Three variants of resistant H 6 N 2 /R 292 K virus were each propagated during 17 days in five successive pairs of naive Mallards, while oseltamivir exposure was decreased and removed. Daily fecal samples were analyzed for viral presence, genotype and phenotype. Results and Conclusion Within three days without drug exposure no resistant viruses could be detected by NA sequencing, which was confirmed by functional NAI sensitivity testing. We conclude that this resistant N 2 virus could not compete in fitness with wild type subpopulations without oseltamivir drug pressure, and thus has no potential to circulate among wild birds. The {{results of this study}} contrast to previous observations of drug induced resistance in an avian H 1 N 1 virus, which was maintained also without drug exposure in Mallards. Experimental observations on persistence of NAI resistance in avian IAVs resemble NAI resistance seen in human IAVs, in which resistant N 2 subtypes do not circulate, while N 1 subtypes with permissive mutations can circulate without drug pressure. We speculate that the phylogenetic group N 1 NAs may easier compensate for NAI resistance than group N 2 NAs, though further studies are needed to confirm such conclusions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceZoonotic agents {{challenging}} the world every year afresh are influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses.</b> In the past, human pandemics caused by influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> had been occurring periodically. Wild aquatic birds are carriers {{of the full}} variety <b>of</b> influenza <b>virus</b> <b>A</b> subtypes, and thus, most probably constitute the natural <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> all influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses.</b> Whereas avian influenza viruses in their natural avian <b>reservoir</b> are generally <b>of</b> low pathogenicity (LPAIV), some have gained virulence by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible gallinaceous poultry. Those so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) then cause mass die-offs in susceptible birds and lead to tremendous economical losses when poultry is affected. Besides <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> avian influenza virus subtypes that have sporadically infected mammals, the HPAIV H 5 N 1 Asia shows strong zoonotic characteristics and it was transmitted from birds to different mammalian species including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses might derive directly from avian influenza viruses or arise after genetic re-assortment between viruses of avian and mammalian origin. So far, HPAIV H 5 N 1 already meets two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype it has been hitherto unseen in the human population and it has infected at least 387 people, and caused severe illness and high lethality in 245 humans to date (Sep 08). The acquisition of efficient human-to-human transmission would complete the emergence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new pandemic <b>virus.</b> Therefore, fighting H 5 N 1 at its source is the prerequisite to reduce pandemic risks posed by this virus. Other influenza viruses regarded as pandemic candidates derive from subtypes H 2, H 7, and H 9 {{all of which have}} infected humans in the past. Here, we will give a comprehensive overview on avian influenza viruses in concern to their zoonotic potential...|$|R

In birds, the virus replicates primarily in the intestinal tract, whereas in mammals, it replicates primarily in the respiratory tract. An important feature of avian influenza viruses is their capacity to mutate into forms that cause high mortality in poultry. Such mutations only have been recorded for the subtypes H 5 and H 7 and occur after transmission of these viruses to poultry. Based on their capacity to cause morbidity and mortality in chickens, avian influenza viruses are classified as low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) or high pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) ...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a method for the concentration and detection of infectious AIV from large volumes of surface water samples. Two filtration systems, glass wool and electropositive NanoCeram filter, were studied. The individual effects of filtration-elution and polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration parameters on the recovery efficiency of the H 1 N 1 strain from 10 -liter surface water samples were assessed. An ultimate 1 % recovery rate of infectious viruses was achieved with the optimal protocol, corresponding to filtration through glass wool, followed by a viral elution step and then a PEG concentration. This method was validated for the detection of highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 strains from artificially contaminated larger water volumes, from 10 to up to 50 liters, from different sources. The viral recovery efficiencies ranged from 0. 01 % to 7. 89 % and from 3. 63 % to 13. 79 % with lake water and rainwater, respectively. A theoretical detection threshold of 2. 25 × 102 TCID 50 (50 % tissue culture infectious dose) in the filtered volume was obtained for seeded lake waters by M gene reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).

40|$|Pteropid bats (flying-foxes) are {{the natural}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> Hendra <b>virus,</b> <b>an</b> {{emergent}} paramyxovirus responsible for fatal infection in horses and humans in Australia. Pteropus alecto (the Black flying-fox) and the paraphyletic P. conspicillatus (the Spectacled flying-fox) {{appear to be}} the primary reservoir hosts. Previous studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may underpin infection dynamics in flying-foxes, and subsequent spillover to horses and in turn humans. We sought to examine temporal trends in urinary cortisol concentration in wild Australian flying-fox populations, to elucidate the putative relationship between Hendra virus infection and physiological stress. Pooled and individual urine samples were non-invasively collected from under roosting flying-foxes at two latitudinally disparate regions in the eastern Australian state of Queensland. Hendra virus detection, and (in individual urine samples) sex and species determination were PCR-based. Urinary cortisol measurement used a validated enzyme immunoassay. We found no direct correlation between increased urinary cortisol and Hendra virus excretion, but our findings do suggest a biologically plausible association between low winter temperatures and elevated cortisol levels in P. alecto in the lower latitude Southeast Queensland roosts. We hypothesize an indirect association between low winter temperatures and increased Hendra virus infection and excretion, mediated by the physiological cost of thermoregulation. Our findings and our approach are directly relevant to elaboration of the disease ecology of Nipah virus and other emerging henipaviruses in bats. More broadly, they inform investigation of emerging disease infection dynamics across the wildlife/livestock/human interface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{important}} role of the non-structural 1 (NS) gene <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> in virulence <b>of</b> the virus is well established, our knowledge about the extent of variation in the NS gene pool <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> in their natural reservoirs in Europe is incomplete. In this study we determined the subtypes and prevalence <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> present in mallards in Northern Europe and further analysed the NS gene of these isolates in order to obtain a more detailed knowledge about the genetic variation of NS gene <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> in their natural hosts. Results <b>A</b> total number <b>of</b> 45 influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> different subtypes were studied. Eleven haemagglutinin- and nine neuraminidase subtypes in twelve combinations were found among the isolated viruses. Each NS gene reported here consisted of 890 nucleotides; there were no deletions or insertions. Phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A and B, were present {{at the same time in}} the same geographic location in the mallard populations in Northern Europe. <b>A</b> comparison <b>of</b> nucleotide sequences <b>of</b> isolated <b>viruses</b> revealed <b>a</b> substantial number <b>of</b> silent mutations, which results in high degree of homology in amino acid sequences. The degree of variation within the alleles is very low. In our study allele <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> displays <b>a</b> maximum <b>of</b> 5 % amino acid divergence while allele B viruses display only 2 % amino acid divergence. All the viruses isolated from mallards in Northern Europe possessed the typical avian ESEV amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end of the NS 1 protein.

Although our phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A and B, were present in the mallards populations in Northern Europe, allele B viruses appear to be less common in natural host species than allele A, comprising only about 13 % of the isolates sequenced in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|The natural <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> {{influenza}} <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> (IAV) is wild waterfowl, and {{all human}} IAVs have their genetic origins from avian viruses. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are currently the best drugs {{for treatment of}} human influenza; therefore, the orally available NAI oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) has been stockpiled worldwide as part of pandemic preparedness planning. Re-sistance to NAIs is related to worse clinical outcomes and if a new pandemic influenza virus would be oseltamivir-resistant its public health impact would be substantially worsened. The active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) is not removed by sewage treatment and ends up in river water, where OC-concentrations up to 0. 86 µg/L have been detected. We hypothesize that occasional OC exposure of wild waterfowl carrying IAVs may result in circulation of resistant variants that may potentially evolve to become human-pathogenic. We tested the hypothesis in an in vivo Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) model in which birds were infected with avian IAVs and exposed to OC. Excreted viruses were analyzed regarding genotypic and phenotypic resistance by neuraminidase (NA) sequencing and a functional NA inhibition assay. Two viruses with NAs of the phylogenetic N 2 -group, H 6 N 2 and H 7 N 9, acquired the NA substitutions R 292 K and I 222 T when host ducks were exposed to 12 µg/L and 2. 5 µg/L of OC, respectively. Drug susceptibilities were at previously described levels for the substitutions. To test persistence <b>of</b> resistance, <b>an</b> OC resistant avian H 1 N 1 /H 274 Y <b>virus</b> (with <b>a</b> group N 1 NA-protein) from a previous study, and three resistant H 6 N 2 /R 292 K variants were allowed to replicate in Mallards without drug pressure.

We conclude that OC in the environment may generate resistant IAVs in wild birds. Resistant avian IAVs may become a problem to humans, should the resistance trait become part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new human pathogenic <b>virus.</b> It implies <b>a</b> need for prudent use of available NAIs, optimized sewage treatment and resistance surveillance of avian IAVs of wild birds...|$|R

Phylogenetic analyses of influenza viruses found in other animals revealed that all were directly or indirectly derived from viruses resident in aquatic birds. 1 However, the prevalence, movement, and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in these avian hosts have not been well defined. Southern China was hypothesized to be an ‘epicenter’ for the generation of human pandemic influenza viruses as all major influenza pandemic viruses in the 20 th century emerged from this region. 2 The ecological background that facilitates the occurrence of these pandemic influenza strains has not been fully explored. In the past two decades, four lineages, belonging to H 5 N 1, H 9 N 2, and H 6 N 1 viruses, have become established and long-term endemic in different types of poultry in this region. 3 – 5 Some of these viruses were disseminated to many countries in Eurasia and Africa and have continued to cause sporadic human infection, posing a persistent pandemic threat to the world. 6 In the mean time, the endemic influenza lineages have undergone extensive genetic reassortment events giving rise to many variants, dramatically increasing the genetic diversity of the influenza virus in this region …link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

In particular, AIVs in ducks of the Atlantic flyway of North America have not been thoroughly investigated. To begin to address this gap, we analyzed 109 AIV genome sequences from ducks in the Atlantic flyway to determine their genetic structure and to document the extent of gene flow {{in the context of}} sequences from other locations and other avian and mammalian host groups. The analyses included 25 AIVs from ducks from Newfoundland, Canada, from 2008 – 2011 and 84 available reference duck AIVs from the Atlantic flyway from 2006 – 2011. <b>A</b> vast diversity <b>of</b> viral genes and genomes was identified in the 109 viruses.

40|$|Wild {{waterfowl}} are {{the natural}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> all influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses,</b> and these viruses are usually nonpathogenic in these birds. However, since late 2002, H 5 N 1 outbreaks in Asia {{have resulted in}} mortality among waterfowl in recreational parks, domestic flocks, and wild migratory birds. The evolutionary stasis between influenza virus and its natural host may have been disrupted, prompting us to ask whether waterfowl are resistant to H 5 N 1 influenza virus disease and whether they can still act as a reservoir for these viruses. To better understand the biology of H 5 N 1 viruses in ducks and attempt to answer this question, we inoculated juvenile mallards with 23 different H 5 N 1 influenza viruses isolated in Asia between 2003 and 2004. All virus isolates replicated efficiently in inoculated ducks, and 22 were transmitted to susceptible contacts. Viruses replicated to higher levels in the trachea than in the cloaca of both inoculated and contact birds, suggesting that the digestive tract is not the main site of H 5 N 1 influenza virus replication in ducks and that the fecal-oral route {{may no longer be}} the main transmission path. The virus isolates' pathogenicities varied from completely nonpathogenic to highly lethal and were positively correlated with tracheal virus titers. Nevertheless, the eight virus isolates that were nonpathogenic in ducks replicated and transmitted efficiently to naïve contacts, suggesting that highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 viruses causing minimal signs of disease in ducks can propagate silently and efficiently among domestic and wild ducks in Asia and that they represent a serious threat to human and veterinary public health.
