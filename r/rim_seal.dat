40|$|In gas turbines, <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> are fitted at the {{periphery}} of the wheel-space between the turbine disc and its adjacent casing; their purpose is to reduce the ingress of hot mainstream gases. A superposed sealant flow, bled from the compressor, is used to purge the wheel-space or at least dilute the ingress to an acceptable level. The ingress is caused by the circumferential variation of pressure in the turbine annulus radially outward of the seal. Engine designers often use double <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> where the variation in pressure is attenuated in the outer wheel-space between the two seals. This paper describes experimental results from a research facility which models an axial turbine stage with engine-representative <b>rim</b> <b>seals.</b> The radial variation of CO 2 gas concentration, swirl and pressure, in both the inner and outer wheel-space, are presented over a range of purge flow rates. The data are used to assess the performance of two seals: a datum double-rim seal and a derivative with a series of radial fins. The concept behind the finned seal is that the radial fins increase the swirl in the outer wheel-space; measurements of swirl show the captive fluid between the fins rotate with near solid body rotation. The improved attenuation of the pressure asymmetry, which governs the ingress, results in an improved performance of the inner geometry of the seal. The fins also increased the pressure in the outer wheel-space and reduced the ingress though the outer geometry of the seal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> of gas {{turbines}} {{are used to}} prevent or reduce the ingestion of hot mainstream gas into the wheel-space between the turbine rotor and its adjacent stationary casing. The ingestion is caused by local pressure differences between the mainstream and the wheel-space; ingress usually occurs where the mainstream pressure is higher than that in the wheel-space and egress occurs where it is lower. Sealing air, which is supplied to the wheel-space, flows through the seal clearance and joins the mainstream flow. Too much sealing air is inefficient; too little can lead to disastrous consequences. The nozzle guide vanes create three-dimensional (3 D) variations {{in the distribution of}} pressure in the mainstream annulus and the turbine blades create unsteady effects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and expensive for these 3 D unsteady flows, and engine designers tend to use correlations or simple models to predict ingress. This paper describes the application of simple ‘orifice models’, the analytical solutions of which can be used to calculate the sealing effectiveness of turbine <b>rim</b> <b>seals.</b> The solutions agree well with available data for externally-induced ingress, where the effects of rotation are negligible, for rotationally-induced ingress, where the effects of the external flow are small, and for combined ingress, where the effects of both external flow and rotation are significant...|$|R

40|$|Unsteady flow {{dynamics}} in turbine rim seals {{are known to}} be complex and attempts accurately to predict the interaction of the mainstream flow with the secondary air system cooling flows using CFD with RANS turbulence models have proved difficult. In particular, published results from RANS models have overpredicted the sealing effectiveness of the <b>rim</b> <b>seal,</b> although their use in this context continues to be common. Previous authors have ascribed this discrepancy to the failure to model flow structures with a scale greater than can be captured in the small sector models typically used. This paper presents results from a series of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of a turbine stage including a <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> and rim cavity for, it is believed by the authors, the first time. The simulations were run at a rotational Reynolds number Reθ = 2. 2 × 106 and a main annulus axial Reynolds number Rex = 1. 3 × 106 and with varying levels of coolant mass flow. Comparison is made with previously published experimental data and with unsteady RANS simulations. The LES models are shown to be in closer agreement with the experimental sealing effectiveness than the unsteady RANS simulations. The result indicates that the previous failure to predict <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> effectiveness was due to turbulence model limitations in the turbine <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> flow.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the flow structure in typical rotor–stator systems with ingress and egress. Measurements of concentration, velocity and pressure were made using a rotating-disc rig which experimentally simulated hot gas ingestion into the wheel-space of an axial turbine stage. Externally-induced ingress through <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> was {{generated from the}} non-axisymmetric pressures produced by the flow over the vanes and blades in the external annulus. Measurements were conducted using several single- and double-seal geometries and {{for a range of}} sealing flow rates and rotational speeds. The concentration measurements showed that the amount of ingress, which increased with decreasing sealing flow rate, depended on the seal geometry. The swirl velocity in the fluid core increased with decreasing sealing-flow rate, but outside the outer region in the wheel-space, it was largely unaffected by the seal geometry or by the amount of ingress. The radial distribution of static pressure, calculated from the measured swirl velocity in the core, was in good agreement with the pressures measured on the stator. The data for the double seals demonstrated that the ingested gas was predominately confined to the region between the seals near the periphery of the wheel-space; in the inner wheel-space, the effectiveness is shown to be significantly higher. The results are of direct relevance to the engine designer who uses complex <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> often designed through computational fluid dynamics. The designer needs to know how much sealing air is required to prevent ingress, what is the effect of ingress on metal temperature and stresses, and how these factors are governed by the flow structure in the wheel-space...|$|R

40|$|Turbine blade {{components}} in an engine are typically designed with gaps between parts due to manufacturing, assembly, and operational considerations.

The interaction of the gaps, their leakage flows, and the complex vortical flow at the endwall of a turbine blade can significantly impact endwall heat transfer coefficients {{and the effectiveness of}} the leakage flow in providing localized cooling. In particular, a platform gap through the passage, representing the mating interface between adjacent blades in a wheel, has been shown to have a significant effect.

In particular, the work sought to investigate whether LES could give an improved predictive tool for flows through a turbine <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> where other methods of modelling turbulence give disappointing results for the simulation of hot annulus gas ingestion into the <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> cavity. The applicability of LES to flow regimes within a rotor-stator cavity were investigated with reference to two experimental studies, those of Daily & Nece [1] and of Itoh et al. [2]. LES simulations were run using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT and the Rolls-Royce CFD code HYDRA. Both gave good agreement for the velocity field even when the boundary layer was not fully resolved. HYDRA was then used to simulate a turbine <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> cavity with external flow through an annulus with NGV and rotor blades, modelled using a small sector with periodic boundary conditions in the circumferential direction. LES was found to predict higher levels of ingestion than Unsteady Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations {{at a number of}} different values of cavity throughflow. This resulted in better, but not close, agreement with the experiments of Gentilhomme [3].
