40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of puerperal breast abscess is a clinical dilemma which ranges from conservative treatment to surgical intervention. A recently highlighted approach is drainage of pus by needle aspiration with ultrasound guidance under antibiotic cover. This approach had advantage of complete resolution without incision scar, less morbidity and {{will allow the}} patient to carry on breast feeding. Aims & Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the management of puerperal breast abscess by percutaneous ultrasound guided needle aspiration versus open surgical drainage with special attention to resolution and complications. Material and Methods: In this interventional study, 70 puerperal breast abscess cases were randomly divided and undergone either percutaneous ultrasound guided niddle aspiration (Group A) or open surgical drainage (Group B) and results were compared. Results: Failure rate for aspiration therapy was 17. 14 % with 06 patients requiring conversion to open surgical drainage after aspiration and were excluded from study. The resolution time was less in aspiration group. Painful and cumbersome daily changes of dressing, mammry fistula in 3 patients with ugly scar were the main drawback of open surgical drainage as compared to aspiration. However, there was high failure <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> therapy in abscesses presenting later than 5 days (45. 83 %) and those with> 5 cm size (55. 55 %) on ultrasonography.

40|$|Abstract Background Cricoid {{pressure}} {{is considered to}} be the gold standard means of preventing aspiration of gastric content during Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI). Its effectiveness has only been demonstrated in cadaveric studies and case reports. No randomised controlled trials comparing the incidence of gastric aspiration following emergent RSI, with or without cricoid pressure, have been performed. If improperly applied, cricoid pressure increases risk to the patient. The clinical significance of aspiration in the emergency department is unknown. This randomised controlled trial aims to; 1. Compare the application of the 'ideal" amount of force (30 - 40 newtons) to standard, unmeasured cricoid pressure and 2. Determine the incidence of clinically defined aspiration syndromes following RSI using a fibrinogen degradation assay previously described. Methods/design 212 patients requiring emergency intubation will be randomly allocated to either control (unmeasured cricoid pressure) or intervention groups (30 - 40 newtons cricoid pressure). The primary outcome is the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> of gastric contents (determined by pepsin detection in the oropharyngeal/tracheal aspirates or treatment for aspiration pneumonitis up to 28 days post-intubation). Secondary outcomes are; correlation between aspiration and lowest pre-intubation Glasgow Coma Score, the relationship between detection of pepsin in trachea and development of aspiration syndromes, complications associated with intubation and grade of the view on direct largyngoscopy. Discussion The benefits and risks of cricoid pressure application will be scrutinised by comparison of the incidence of aspiration and difficult or failed intubations in each group. The role of cricoid pressure in RSI in the emergency department and the use of a pepsin detection as a predictor of clinical aspiration will be evaluated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} how British Thoracic Society (BTS) {{guidelines for the}} management of spontaneous pneumothorax have been implemented over a four year period in a large district general hospital with a specialised respiratory unit. To assess the validity of the guidelines in the management of spontaneous pneumothorax. METHODS: A retrospective case notes study over a four year period for all patients with spontaneous pneumothoraces attending the accident and emergency (A&E) department of a large district general hospital. RESULTS: 115 episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax were identified. Overall 20. 8 % of episodes were treated correctly by BTS guidelines. Decisions made by A&E staff {{were significantly more likely to}} be correct than decisions made by on call medical teams (39. 4 % v 13. 4 %, p = 0. 002). There was a non-significant trend towards better compliance with BTS guidelines over the four year period. The management decision was made by A&E staff only in 28. 7 % of episodes. Patients without chronic lung disease could be safely observed as outpatients. Forty three pneumothoraces were aspirated: 23 (58 %) successfully; eight (18. 6 %) with little or no improvement; and 12 (27. 9 %) initially successfully but developing increased size of pneumothorax within a period of 72 hours. Three patients had repeat aspirations, two successfully. Age over 50, chronic lung disease, and more than 2. 5 litres of air aspirated were significantly associated with failure of aspiration (p < 0. 01). There was a 28. 6 % failure <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> for patients with moderate pneumothoraces without chronic lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients over the age of 50 should be treated the same as patients with chronic lung disease. A second aspiration should be attempted if the first aspiration is initially successful with subsequent recurrence of pneumothorax. Further research is required to clarify if patients with moderate pneumothoraces under the age of 50 and no chronic lung disease should be aspirated or observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{generally}} accepted {{that the human}} neutrophil can be mechanically represented as a droplet of polymeric fluid enclosed by some sort of thin slippery viscoelastic cortex. Many questions remain however about the detailed rheology and chemistry of the interior fluid and the cortex. To address these quantitative issues, {{we have used a}} finite element method to simulate the dynamics of neutrophils during micropipet aspiration using various plausible assumptions. The results were then systematically compared with aspiration experiments conducted at eight different combinations of pipet size and pressure. Models in which the cytoplasm was represented by a simple Newtonian fluid (i. e., models without shear thinning) were grossly incapable of accounting for the effects of pressure on the general time scale of neutrophil aspiration. Likewise, models in which the cortex was purely elastic (i. e., models without surface viscosity) were unable to explain the effects of pipet size on the general aspiration rate. Such models also failed to explain the rapid acceleration of the aspiration rate during the final phase of aspiration nor could they account for the geometry of the neutrophil during various phases of aspiration. Thus, our results indicate that a minimal mechanical model of the neutrophil needs to incorporate both shear thinning and surface viscosity to remain valid over a reasonable range of conditions. At low shear rates, the surface dilatation viscosity of the neutrophil was found to be on the order of 100 poise-cm, whereas the viscosity of the interior cytoplasm was on the order of 1000 poise. Both the surface viscosity and the interior viscosity seem to decrease in a similar fashion when the shear rate exceeds ∼ 0. 05 s− 1. Unfortunately, even models with both surface viscosity and shear thinning studied are still not sufficient to fully explain all the features of neutrophil aspiration. In particular, the very high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> during the initial moments after ramping of pressure remains mysterious...|$|E

Search terms relating to deglutition or dysphagia or swallow and neoplasms and oncology or head and neck cancer and viscosity or texture and apira or residu * were com-bined with honey or nectar, xerostomia, and respiratory aspira-tion using Boolean operators. Review Methods. A multiengine literature search identified 337 nonduplicate articles, of which 6 were judged to be rel-evant. These underwent detailed review for study quality and qualitative synthesis. Results. The articles reviewed in detail predominantly described heterogeneous study samples with small sample sizes, making for difficult interpretation and generalization <b>of</b> results. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> were typically not reported by bolus consistency, despite the fact that a variety of stimulus consistencies was used during a videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Studies confirmed that aspiration is a major concern in the head and neck cancer population and reported a trend toward more frequent aspira-tion after (chemo) radiotherapy. Conclusion. Overall, the literature on thickened liquids as an intervention to eliminate aspiration in the head and neck cancer population is limited. Because aspiration is known to be prevalent in the head and neck cancer population and thickened liquids are known to eliminate aspiration in other populations, it is important to determine the effectiveness of thickened liquids for reducing aspiration in the head and neck cancer population...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{living cells}} are {{subjected}} to external and internal mechanical stresses. The effects of these stresses on the deformation and subsequent biological response of the cells remains unclear. This study tested {{the hypothesis that the}} rate at which pressure (or stress) is applied influence the viscoelastic properties of the cell associated with differences in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Principal finding: micropipette aspiration was used to determine the instantaneous and equilibrium moduli and the viscosity of isolated chondrocytes based on the standard linear solid (SLS) model and a variation of this incorporating Boltzmann superposition. Cells were visualised for 180 seconds following aspiration to 7 cmH 2 O at 0. 35, 0. 70 and 5. 48 cmH 2 O/sec. Cell recovery was then examined for a further 180 seconds once the pressure had been removed. Reducing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> application of pressure reduced the levels of cell deformation and recovery associated with a significant increase in modulus and viscosity. Using GFP transfection and confocal microscopy, we show that chondrocyte deformation involves distortion, disassembly and subsequent reassembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. At faster pressure rates, cell deformation produced an increase in cell volume associated with membrane bleb formation. GFP-actin transfection inhibited the pressure rate dependent variation in cell mechanics indicating that this behaviour is regulated by GFP-sensitive actin dynamics. Conclusion: we suggest that slower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> pressure enable greater levels of cortical actin distortion. This is partially inhibited by GFP or faster aspiration rates leading to membrane bleb formation and an increase in cell volume. Thus the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> application of pressure regulates the viscoelastic mechanical properties of living cells through pressure rate sensitive differences in actin dynamics.

40|$|The ideal {{invasive}} {{management as}} initial approach for pneumothorax (PTX) {{is still under}} debate. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis {{was to examine the}} evidence for the effectiveness of intercostal tube drainage and other various invasive methods as the initial approach to all subtypes of PTX in adults. Three databases were searched from inception to May 29, 2016 : MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL. Randomised controlled trials that evaluated intercostal tube drainage as the control and various invasive methods as the intervention for the initial approach to PTX in adults were included. The primary outcome was the early success rate of each method, and the risk ratios (RRs) were used for an effect size measure. The secondary outcomes were recurrence rate, hospitalization rate, hospital stay, and complications. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Interventions were aspiration in six studies and catheterization connected to a one-way valve in one study. Meta-analyses were conducted for early success rate, recurrence rate, hospitalization rate, and hospital stay. Aspiration was inferior to intercostal tube drainage in terms of early success rate (RR = 0. 82, confidence interval [CI] = 0. 72 to 0. 95, I 2 = 0 %). While aspiration and intercostal tube drainage showed {{no significant difference in the}} recurrence rate (RR = 0. 84, CI = 0. 57 to 1. 23, I 2 = 0 %), aspiration had shorter hospital stay than intercostal tube drainage (mean difference = - 1. 73, CI = - 2. 33 to - 1. 13, I 2 = 0 %). Aspiration had lower hospitalization rate than intercostal tube drainage, but marked heterogeneity was present (RR = 0. 38, CI = 0. 19 to 0. 76, I 2 = 85 %). Aspiration was inferior to intercostal tube drainage in terms of early resolution, but it had shorter hospital stay. The recurrence <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> and intercostal tube drainage did not differ significantly.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} the anatomic structures whose damage or malfunction cause late dysphagia and aspiration after intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, {{and to explore}} whether they can be spared by intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) without compromising target RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 26 patients receiving RT concurrent with gemcitabine, a regimen associated with {{a high rate of}} late dysphagia and aspiration, underwent prospective evaluation of swallowing with videofluoroscopy (VF), direct endoscopy, and CT. To assess whether the VF abnormalities were regimen specific, they were compared with the VF findings of 6 patients presenting with dysphagia after RT concurrent with high-dose intra-arterial cisplatin. The anatomic structures whose malfunction was likely to cause each of the VF abnormalities common to both regimens were determined by literature review. Pre- and posttherapy CT scans were reviewed for evidence of posttherapy damage to each of these structures, and those demonstrating posttherapy changes were deemed dysphagia/aspiration-related structures (DARS). Standard three-dimensional (3 D) RT, standard IMRT (stIMRT), and dysphagia-optimized IMRT (doIMRT) plans in which sparing of the DARS was included in the optimization cost function, were produced for each of 20 consecutive patients with advanced head-and-neck cancer. RESULTS: The posttherapy VF abnormalities common to both regimens included weakness of the posterior motion of the base of tongue, prolonged pharyngeal transit time, lack of coordination between the swallowing phases, reduced elevation of the larynx, and reduced laryngeal closure and epiglottic inversion, contributing to a high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration.</b> The anatomic structures whose malfunction was the likely cause of each of these abnormalities, and that also demonstrated anatomic changes after RT concurrent with gemcitabine doses associated with dysphagia and aspiration, were the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (median thickness near midline 2. 5 mm before therapy vs. 7 mm after therapy; p = 0. 001), the supraglottic larynx (median thickness, 2 mm before therapy vs. 4 mm after therapy; p or = 50 Gy (V(50)) was, therefore, a planning and evaluation goal. Compared with the 3 D plans, stIMRT reduced the V(50) of the pharyngeal constrictors by 10 % on average (range, 0 - 36 %, p < 0. 001), and doIMRT reduced these volumes further, by an additional 10 % on average (range, 0 - 38 %; p < 0. 001). The V(50) of the larynx (glottic + supraglottic) was reduced marginally by stIMRT compared with 3 D (by 7 % on average, range, 0 - 56 %; p = 0. 054), and doIMRT reduced these volumes by an additional 11 %, on average (range, 0 - 41 %; p = 0. 002). doIMRT reduced laryngeal V(50) compared with 3 D, by 18 % on average (range 0 - 61 %; p = 0. 001). Certain target delineation rules facilitated sparing of the DARS by IMRT. The maximal DARS doses were not reduced by IMRT because of their partial overlap with the targets. stIMRT and doIMRT did not differ in target doses, parotid gland mean dose, spinal cord, or nonspecified tissue maximal dose. CONCLUSIONS: The structures whose damage may cause dysphagia and aspiration after intensive chemotherapy and RT are the pharyngeal constrictors and the glottic and supraglottic larynx. Compared with 3 D-RT, moderate sparing of these structures was achieved by stIMRT, and an additional benefit, whose extent varied among the patients, was gained by doIMRT, without compromising target doses. Clinical validation is required to determine whether the dosimetric gains are translated into clinical one...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Aspiration {{pneumonia}} is {{the most}} common cause of death in children with neurologic impairment who have gastroesophageal reflux disease. Fundoplications and gastrojejunal feeding tubes are frequently employed to prevent aspiration pneumonia in this population. Which of these approaches is more effective in preventing aspiration pneumonia and/or improving survival is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes for children with neurologic impairment and gastroesophageal reflux disease after either a first fundoplication or a first gastrojejunal feeding tube. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of children with neurologic impairment who had either a fundoplication or gastrojejunal feeding tube between January 1997 and December 2005 at a tertiary care children 2 ̆ 7 s hospital. Main outcome measures were postprocedure aspiration pneumonia–free survival and mortality. Propensity analyses were used to control for bias in treatment assignment and prognostic imbalances. Results: Of the 366 children with neurologic impairment and gastroesophageal reflux disease, 43 had a first gastrojejunal feeding tube and 323 underwent a first fundoplication. Median length of follow-up was 3. 4 years. Children who received a first fundoplication had similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> pneumonia and mortality after the procedure compared with those who had a first gastrojejunal feeding tube, when adjusting for the treatment assignment using propensity scores. Conclusions: Aspiration pneumonia and mortality are not uncommon events after either a first fundoplication or a first gastrojejunal feeding tube for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children with neurologic impairment.

OBJECTIVES: Bullet To compare the efficacy and effectiveness of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy for dysphagia versus placebo or no intervention in patients with Parkinson's disease. Bullet To compare one form of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy for dysphagia with another in patients with Parkinson's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ISI-SCI, AMED, MANTIS, REHABDATA, REHADAT, GEROLIT, Pascal, LILACS, MedCarib, JICST-EPlus, AIM, IMEMR, SIGLE, ISI-ISTP, DISSABS, Conference Papers Index, Aslib Index to Theses, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the CentreWatch Clinical Trials listing service, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials. gov, CRISP, PEDro, NIDRR and NRR; and examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the useful tool for evaluating salivary aspiration in brain-injured patients with tracheostomy. Methods Radionuclide salivagram and laryngoscopy {{was done in}} 27 brain-injured patients with tracheostomy. During salivagram, 99 mTc sulfur colloid was placed sublingually in the supine position, and 50 -minute dynamic images and 2 -hour delayed images were obtained. Salivary aspiration was detected when the tracer was entered into the major airways or lung parenchyma. Laryngoscopy was done by otolaryngologists, and saliva aspiration, saliva pooling, and vocal cord palsy were evaluated. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study was done in patients {{who were able to}} undergo the test. Results The detection <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> salivary <b>aspiration</b> was 44. 4 % with salivagram, and 29. 6 % with laryngoscopy. The correlation of the two tests was 70. 4 %. Of the laryngoscopy findings, salivary pooling had significant correlation with positive salivagram results (p= 0. 04). Frequent need of suction correlated with salivary aspiration in both salivagram (p= 0. 01) and laryngoscopy (p= 0. 01).

Materials and Methods: We randomized 50 head and neck cancer patients, including all sites and stages into two groups, 25 patients in each group. In Group-A dysphagia prevention exercises were done from the day of the onset of radiation therapy and continued till 6 months, while in Group-B no dysphagia interventions were given. We analyzed <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dysphagia, <b>aspiration</b> <b>rate</b> and its impact on quality of life. We used M. D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) which is a validated and reliable questionnaire designed specifically for evaluating impact of dysphagia on quality of life (QOL) in head and neck cancer patients. American Speech language Hearing Association (ASHA) scale was used for assessing swallowing function. Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) was used to assess aspiration during swallowing with the help of Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Results: Quality of life was significantly better in dysphagia preventive exercise arm (group - A). There was significant improvement in the MDADI score, from the baseline to 6 months in exercise arm (14 versus 7. 76, p= 0. 017). Swallowing function score was also in favour of exercise arm (6. 44 versus 5. 8, p= 0. 002). Patients in exercise arm were able to swallow much better by the end of 6 months post radiotherapy. Risk <b>of</b> silent <b>aspiration</b> as evaluated by PAS score at the end of three months was 36 % (Group A = 16 %, Group B = 20 %). At the end of six months, it improved to 24 % (Group A = 8 %, Group B = 16 %). There was a trend towards lesser incidence <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> in exercise arm, although it was not statistically significant (p= 0. 21). Conclusion: Results from this study demonstrated that swallowing exercises, if administered from first week of chemo-radiation and continued till 6 months, results in significant improvement in swallowing function and quality of life. Use of FEES helps in detection <b>of</b> silent <b>aspiration</b> at an early stage and reduces aspiration related morbidities...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the EU minimum standard on cold appliances: the British case Monitoring the effectiveness of policy {{is an essential part of}} securing energy savings. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the minimum standard on cold appliances using the British market as a case study. Data availability on developments in the cold appliance market in Britain is very good compared to most other EU markets, permitting an unbroken quarterly analysis from 1995 onwards. The timing and magnitude of market transformation as a result of the minimum standard is shown in the context <b>of</b> historical <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> change, the <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> Directive 96 / 57 /EC and the development in price. The analysis shows that the minimum standard is resulting in substantial energy savings to the consumer, but that retailers and manufacturers delayed efficiency improvements to the UK market for as long as possible. More than one year after the standard came into effect a significant proportion of sales were not meeting the standard. There is very little evidence that the minimum standard has resulted in price increases. On the contrary, real prices generally continued to fall as manufacturers geared up to meeting the standard...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>aspirations</b> on {{the adoption of}} agricultural innovations {{in the context of}} rural Ethiopia. While most studies on agricultural innovations have focused on identifying observable and resource-related deprivations or 'external' constraints, a related stream of literature suggests that 'internal' constraints, such as the lack <b>of</b> <b>aspirations,</b> could reinforce external constraints and lead to self-sustaining poverty traps. Since both aspirations and the adoption of innovations are forward-looking, {{they are likely to be}} intimately linked. Aspirations are motivators that can enhance innovations or their adoption not only in their own right but also through their determinants, including self-efficacy, locus of control and other internal traits that may be unobserved. This implies that aspirations may affect innovations through multiple channels and hence may be endogenous. On the other hand, aspirations are also affected by a person's level of achievement, implying that aspirations and innovations are simultaneously determined. To identify the effect <b>of</b> <b>aspirations</b> on the adoption of agricultural innovations, we conducted both plot-level and household-level analysis using purposely collected data from households in rural Ethiopia. Using econometric strategies that account for the endogenous nature <b>of</b> <b>aspirations,</b> we found that a narrow or a very wide gap between aspirations and achievement in a farming household is strongly associated with low levels of innovativeness and low adoption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> innovation products such as chemical fertilizers...|$|R

The purpose of the current study was to screen for risk <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> in care home residents in the Netherlands and assess potential risk factors <b>of</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Five experienced speech-language therapists assessed 203 care home residents (115 primarily physically disabled, 88 primarily cognitively impaired) 60 and older in the first week after admission to a care home. In 43 (21. 2 %) residents, speech-language therapists assessed risk <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> and found no significant difference between physically disabled (26. 1 %) and cognitively impaired (14. 8 %) residents. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the final prediction model for risk <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> showed Parkinson's disease as a significant factor (odds ratio = 5. 11; 95 % confidence interval [1. 49, 17. 52]). The authors therefore conclude that risk <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> is a relevant care problem among Dutch care home residents and requires further assessment...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of safe and maximally effective ovarian stimulation {{is a major}} aim for in vitro fertilization (IVF) teams. The goal of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is to supply enough oocytes with normal maturation to insure the consequent biological procedures. A variety of different stimulation protocols have been suggested and an individual selection of the correct stimulation protocol is mandatory. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the correlation between number of retrieved oocytes and clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) after IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures. We reviewed 1017 cycles in a total of 975 patients. The study results clearly demonstrate that the <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> less than 5 oocytes significantly reduced pregnancy <b>rate.</b> The <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> a large number of oocytes (> 15) does not lead to an increase of the treatment effect and, at the same time, increases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The major goal is to obtain 5 — 15 oocytes as a “gold standard”, connected to optimal pregnancy rate after assisted reproduction (ART) ...|$|R

The performance of ROSE relative to fixed sampling depends on many factors. It {{is not clear}} when ROSE is less costly than sampling with a fixed number of needle passes. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the conditions under which ROSE is less costly than fixed sampling. Cost comparison of sampling with and without ROSE using mathematical modeling. Models were based on a societal perspective and used a mechanistic, micro-costing approach. Sampling policies (ROSE, fixed) were compared using the difference in total expected costs per case. Scenarios were based on procedure complexity (palpation-guided or image-guided), adequacy rates (low, high) and sampling protocols (stopping criteria for ROSE and fixed sampling). One-way, probabilistic, and scenario-based sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which variables had the greatest influence on the cost difference. ROSE is favored relative to fixed sampling under the following conditions: (1) the cytologist is accurate, (2) the total variable cost ($/hr) is low, (3) fixed costs ($/procedure) are high, (4) the setup time is long, (5) the time between needle passes for ROSE is low, (6) when the per-pass adequacy rate is low, and (7) ROSE stops after observing one adequate sample. The model is most sensitive to variation in the fixed cost, the per-pass adequacy rate, and the time per needle pass with ROSE. Mathematical modeling can be used to predict the difference in cost between sampling with and without ROSE...|$|R
