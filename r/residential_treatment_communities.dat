40|$|For {{the first}} time in a prison setting a {{randomised}} trial rigorously compared intensive <b>residential</b> therapeutic <b>community</b> <b>treatment</b> to outpatient counselling. Confounding expectations, the US prison for problem drug users which hosted the study gained nothing in terms of preventing recidivism by allocating even high-risk prisoners to the more intensive treatment. In a rare randomised trial, the featured analysis attempted not just to establish the effectiveness of a US prison therapeutic community relative to outpatient treatment, but also what types of inmates may differentially benefit from these modalities. Key points from summary and commentary •	In a US prison for problem drug users nearly all new arrivals joined a study which for {{the first time}} in a prison setting rigorously compared intensive <b>residential</b> therapeutic <b>community</b> <b>treatment</b> to outpatient counselling. •	Over a three-year post-release follow-up period no extra reduction in reimprisonment was found from the intensive option. •	The same finding emerged among prisoners at the highest risk of re-offending, confounding expectations that the more intensive treatment would be particularly suitable for these offender...|$|R

Newly diagnosed DSM-II schizophrenia subjects were assigned consecutively (1971 to 1976, N 79) or randomly (1976 to 1979, N 100) to the hospital or Soteria and followed for 2 years. Admission diagnoses were subsequently converted to DSM-IV schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder. Multivariate analyses evaluated hypotheses of equal or better outcomes in Soteria on eight individual outcome measures and a compos-ite outcome scale in three ways: for endpoint subjects (N 160), for completing subjects (N 129), and for completing subjects corrected for differential attrition (N 129). Endpoint subjects exhibited small to medium effect size trends favoring experimental treatment. Completing subjects had significantly better composite outcomes of a medium effect size at Soteria (. 47 SD, p. 03). Completing subjects with schizophrenia exhibited a large effect size benefit with Soteria treatment (. 81 SD, p. 02), particularly in domains of psychopathology, work, and social func...|$|R
