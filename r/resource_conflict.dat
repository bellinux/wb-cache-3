50|$|When {{creating}} circuit partitions, engineers {{should first}} observe the available resources the FPGA offers, since the design {{will be placed}} onto the FPGA fabric The architecture of each FPGA {{is dependent on the}} manufacturer, but the main goal in design partitioning is to have an even balance of FPGA resource utilization. Various FPGA resources include Look-Up-Tables (LUTs), D Flip-Flops, block RAMs, digital signal processors (DSPs), clock buffers, etc. Prior to balancing the design partitions, it is also valuable to the user to perform global logic optimization to remove any redundant or unused logic. A typical problem that arises with creating balanced partitions is that it may lead to timing or <b>resource</b> <b>conflict</b> if the cut is on many signal lines. To have a fully optimized partitioning strategy, the engineer must consider issues such as timing/power constraints and placement and routing while still maintaining a balanced partition amongst the FPGAs. Strictly focusing on a single issue during a partition may create several issues in another.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Multi-agent {{approaches}} can {{be applied}} to model behaviour and relations of entities in cyber-physical systems. Here entities frequently compete on insufficient resources (e. g., hardware) at the same time. Hence, <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts</b> between several agents {{are one of the most}} important conflict types in such multi-agent systems. These conflicts can significantly slow the operation of a system down, or in the worst case, might lead to a system halt. In this paper, we investigate the challenge of efficiently detecting <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts.</b> For this purpose, we in-troduce a conflict detection model based on beliefs of BDI agents. One benefit of our approach is that conflicts are detected using local belief state information of agents without communication.

The evaluation study showed that the system deploying the conflict detection model can avoid collisions between moving agents and agents execute tasks successfully. <b>conflict</b> detection, <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts,</b> multi-agent systems, BDI agents, cyber-physical systems I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Max-Plus-Linear (MPL) {{system is}} known as a {{solution}} for scheduling problems of a class of discrete event systems. Typical systems include: manufacturing system and project management, etc. In such systems, the initial schedule is frequently changed due to unpredictable disturbances. Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is a management method that can shorten the time required to complete a project based on the Theory Of Constraints (TOC). Therefore, in our previous papers [1], we proposed a method for applying the concepts of the CCPM to MPL representation in order to control the occurrence of an undesirable state change. The CCPM method also provides a solution for the problem of the <b>resource</b> <b>conflict.</b> However, we did not discuss the <b>resource</b> <b>conflict.</b> In this paper, we propose a method for discovering the <b>resource</b> <b>conflict</b> between two different projects in the MPL-CCPM representation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the base causal mechanisms of the Motunui-Waitara <b>resource</b> <b>conflict,</b> which {{occurred in the}} early 1980 s in North Taranaki, and resulted in a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal. Resource conflicts are complex social phenomena, based on disputes over the use, control, and allocation of resources. They occur {{as the result of}} both proximate causes (empirical, easily identified, site specific), and base causes (a 'wider status quo'). The <b>resource</b> <b>conflict</b> revolved around the grievances of the local iwi, over the discharge of effluent onto coastal reefs by the Waitara township, Borthwicks freezing works, the 'Synfuels' synthetic -petrol plant, and the Petralgas methanol plant. As social action, the <b>resource</b> <b>conflict</b> resulted from readily identifiable proximate causes, but also base causal mechanisms. The discharge of effluent, a proximate cause, reflected the causal 'wider status quo', which is analysed as comprising two parts. First, social organisation as a generalised framework of occurrence, where social relations between people nature and power are based on differentiation, the development of power relations, and the creation of imbalances. Secondly, context and place as a specific framework of occurrence, where the <b>resource</b> <b>conflict</b> was a result of two conflicting processes, economic and cultural transformation, which were reflected in a context of issues: energy; indigenous peoples; and environmental awareness. The conflict became the subject of an extremely significant claim to the Waitangi Tribunal. The process of resolution was highly contentious, taking ten years to provide one working marine outfall and land based treatment all the waste streams. During a similar timeframe there has been an attempt to remove what are perceived as base causal mechanisms through the fisheries Quota Management System, the Sealords deal, and the process of Resource Management Law Reform which resulted in the Resource Management Act 1991. Despite these processes there has not been effective resolution of the <b>resource</b> <b>conflict,</b> which requires the removal of all causes. A process of effective resolution is suggested, revolving around the 'principle of partnership and the notions of active protection, balancing priorities, rights and values. Finally, the Motunui-Waitara <b>resource</b> <b>conflict</b> although not finally resolved, has had a number of positive impacts, in Waitangi Tribunal operation, and in the changing focus, from management to control, of many Maori claims and Tribunal reports...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the Resource Constrained Multi Project Scheduling Problem with Weighted Earliness Tardiness Costs (RCMPSPWET). In multi-project environments, the project portfolio {{of a company}} does often change dramatically in time. In this dynamic context, {{the arrival of a}} new project requires quoting a due date while keeping the disruptions to the existing plans and schedules to a minimum. The suggested solution method is an adaptation of the well known shifting bottleneck (SB) heuristic in the job shop literature. Initially, a base schedule is obtained by relaxing all resource capacities and solving the resulting model as a linear program (LP). The SB heuristic then resolves the <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts</b> present in the optimal solution of this resource relaxation iteratively by solving a set of single-resource weighted earliness tardiness scheduling subproblems with precedence constraints. The unit earliness and tardiness costs in the subproblems are estimated by drawing upon tools from LP sensitivity analysis recently proposed by Bülbül and Kaminsky [1] for a general job shop scheduling problem. The subproblems in the SB heuristic are a generalization of the NP-hard single machine weighted earliness tardiness problem, and a neighborhood search based algorithm is applied to these for the efficiency of the overall SB algorithm. The solution of a subproblem introduces new precedence relationships based on the concept of resource flows. These new precedence constraints are incorporated into the LP mentioned above and ensure that the capacity of the resource under consideration is observed. These steps are repeated until all <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts</b> are removed. The order in which the <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts</b> are resolved is a major determinant of the final solution quality, and therefore, a systematic tree search strategy is implemented for resolving the <b>resource</b> <b>conflicts</b> in different orders. A local search algorithm for the original problem is also adopted to benchmark the results...|$|R
