5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising the Jack <b>Russell</b> terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack <b>Russell</b> Terrier Club of America as {{they did not want}} the breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack <b>Russell</b> Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack <b>Russell</b> terrier was changed to Parson <b>Russell</b> terrier, with the Jack <b>Russell</b> Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson <b>Russell</b> Terrier Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Power: A New Social Analysis by Bertrand <b>Russell</b> (1st imp.

In particular, <b>Russell</b> has in mind social power, that is, power over people.|$|E

5|$|The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZCK) {{are some}} of {{national}} kennel associations that register both the Jack <b>Russell</b> terrier and the Parson <b>Russell</b> terrier; however, the size requirements for the Jack <b>Russell</b> terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a <b>Russell</b> terrier in the United States. In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 18 for the Parson <b>Russell</b> terrier. Other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack <b>Russell</b> terriers, including their cousin the Parson <b>Russell</b> terrier, the Tenterfield terrier, and the Rat Terrier. Several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early Fox Terrier breed, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.|$|E
5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for <b>Russell,</b> when it has limited but well-defined powers. <b>Russell</b> advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (<b>Russell</b> 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (<b>Russell</b> 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} post {{was established}} on Key Biscayne in March 1838. Its first commander was Lt. Col. James Bankhead. The fort was initially known as Fort Dallas or Fort Bankhead, {{but it was}} eventually renamed Fort <b>Russell</b> for Captain Samuel L. <b>Russell.</b> He was killed when the Seminoles ambushed two boats on the Miami River in February 1839. In the summer of 1839, a total of 143 soldiers and sailors were stationed at Fort <b>Russell.</b> Some of the Seminoles captured during the war were held at Fort <b>Russell</b> until they could be placed on ships to be removed to Indian Territory.|$|E

40|$|The History of Western Philosophy {{enhanced}} <b>Russell’s</b> broad reputation {{among members}} of the public and helped secure his finances. But the academic community was less enthusiastic about the text and tended to treat it with contempt. My paper is a critical investigation of one of the central chapters of <b>Russell’s</b> History: namely, <b>Russell’s</b> rendition of David Hume’s views on the self. My argument is that <b>Russell’s</b> concise treat­ment of le bon David’s provocative views on the self must be read with great care—otherwise a misunderstanding of <b>Russell’s</b> interpreta­tion is likely to be foisted on this popular and influential twentieth­-century text...|$|R

5|$|After {{spending}} {{about a decade}} living as a recluse on Mercer Island near Seattle, <b>Russell</b> rose to prominence again {{at the turn of}} the millennium. Russell's Rules was published in 2001, and in January 2006, he convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, with whom O'Neal had a bitter public feud. Later that year, on November 17, 2006, the two-time NCAA winner <b>Russell</b> was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with John Wooden, Oscar Robertson, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. On May 20, 2007, <b>Russell</b> was awarded an honorary doctorate by Suffolk University, where he served as its commencement speaker, and <b>Russell</b> received an honorary degree from Harvard University on June 7, 2007. On June 18, 2007, <b>Russell</b> was inducted as a member of the founding class of the FIBA Hall of Fame. <b>Russell</b> was also honored during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix.|$|E

5|$|Before his NBA rookie year, <b>Russell</b> was {{the captain}} of the U.S. {{national}} basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that <b>Russell</b> had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but <b>Russell</b> prevailed. He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team. Under coach Gerald Tucker, <b>Russell</b> helped the national team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. <b>Russell</b> led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.|$|E

50|$|Most feists {{are fairly}} quiet dogs, and lack the {{tendency}} toward excessive barking demonstrated by some Jack <b>Russells</b> and other hunting dogs.

5000|$|Lord Rayleigh {{published}} {{a paper in}} Philosophical Magazine in 1876 to support John Scott <b>Russell's</b> experimental observation with his mathematical theory. In his 1876 paper, Lord Rayleigh mentioned Scott <b>Russell's</b> name and also admitted that the first theoretical treatment was by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq in 1871. Joseph Boussinesq mentioned Scott <b>Russell's</b> name in his 1871 paper. [...] Thus Scott <b>Russell's</b> observations on solitary waves were accepted as true by some prominent scientists within his own lifetime.|$|R

5|$|Boston honored <b>Russell</b> by {{erecting}} {{a statue}} of him on City Hall Plaza in 2013: he is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win. Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments. The Bill <b>Russell</b> Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project. The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with <b>Russell</b> in attendance.|$|E

50|$|A {{selection}} of <b>Russell’s</b> letters {{was published in}} 1987 by John Murray. <b>Russell’s</b> friend Evelyn Waugh (who appears in <b>Russell’s</b> letters as “Mr Wu”) described him as “one of the most exquisitely entertaining men I have known” and he gave full rein in his correspondence to his gift for (occasionally racy) drollery and gentle satire, combined on occasions with somewhat quizzical metaphysical speculation.|$|R
50|$|From 1952-1962, Bateson {{directed}} {{a research project}} on communication. This paid particular attention to logical paradoxes including <b>Russell's</b> paradox 1901 and to Bertrand <b>Russell's,</b> Theory of Types, <b>Russell's</b> solution to it. Bateson and his associates here pioneered the concept of meta-communication - something that means different (often contradictory) things at different levels. Meta-communication {{is thought to be}} a characteristic feature of complex systems.|$|R
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, <b>Russell</b> specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. <b>Russell</b> argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (<b>Russell</b> 1938:179).|$|E

5|$|During the 1892 presidential campaign, {{there was}} talk of <b>Russell</b> being the Vice Presidential nominee if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination. In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A. Collins, a former Democratic Massachusetts Congressman, agreed to make Palmer the Democratic Presidential {{candidate}} and <b>Russell,</b> Collins' personal and political friend, the Vice Presidential candidate. Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. <b>Russell</b> received one vote for President on the first ballot.|$|E

5000|$|Previously, {{other common}} names {{were used to}} {{describe}} subspecies that {{are now part of}} the synonymy of this form: Indonesian <b>Russell's</b> viper for [...] "limitis", and Formosan <b>Russell's</b> viper for [...] "formosensis".|$|R
5|$|Frazier {{demands to}} inspect the hostages before {{allowing}} the robbers to leave and <b>Russell</b> takes him {{on a tour of}} the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks <b>Russell,</b> but is restrained by another of the robbers. Afterwards he explains that he deliberately tried to provoke <b>Russell</b> and judges that the man is not a killer. However, this is disproven when the robbers execute one of the hostages.|$|E
5|$|Further {{calculations}} of this ilk combine {{to show that}} the number of essentially different Sudoku grids is 5,472,730,538, for example as demonstrated by Jarvis / <b>Russell</b> and verified by Pettersen. Similar methods have been applied to the 2x3 case, where Jarvis / <b>Russell</b> showed that there are 49 essentially different grids (see also the article by Bailey, Cameron and Connelly), to the 2x4 case, where <b>Russell</b> showed that there are 1,673,187 essentially different grids (verified by Pettersen), and to the 2x5 case where Pettersen showed that there are 4,743,933,602,050,718 essentially different grids (not verified).|$|E
5|$|However, <b>Russell</b> also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, <b>Russell</b> punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, <b>Russell</b> had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that <b>Russell</b> resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that <b>Russell</b> was more important, but <b>Russell</b> also had only played half the season. <b>Russell</b> also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
50|$|Scott <b>Russell's</b> {{experimental}} work seemed at contrast with Isaac Newton's and Daniel Bernoulli's theories of hydrodynamics. George Biddell Airy and George Gabriel Stokes had difficulty to accept Scott <b>Russell's</b> experimental observations because Scott <b>Russell's</b> observations {{could not be}} explained by the existing water-wave theories. His contemporaries spent some time attempting to extend the theory but it would take until the 1870s before an explanation was provided.|$|R
50|$|<b>Russell's</b> Piegans sold in 2005 for $5.6 million, {{more than}} double the highest price his work had sold for a few years earlier. At auction in 2008, <b>Russell's</b> oil {{painting}} The Hold Up (20 Miles to Deadwood) sold for $5.2 million, and his bronze sculpture Buffalo Hunt (which depicted two Native Americans attacking a running bison) sold for $4.1 million. In July 2009, <b>Russell's</b> 1907 watercolor and gouache The Truce went for $2.03 million to an anonymous phone bidder. <b>Russell's</b> 1911 18 in by 13 in bronze sculpture, Bronc Twister, auctioned in 2008 for $805,000—far above the $300,000 pre-auction estimate.|$|R
