50|$|The 603.96 engine has a {{capacity}} of 2996cc and was an engineering marvel in pre-chamber design and a technological leap forward from the earlier 5 cylinder OM617. It produced 143 hp at 4600 rpm (euro market without catalytic converter produced 148hp) and 195 ft.lb at 2400 rpm with a compression ratio of 22.0:1. Versions 603.96x and 603.97x are turbocharged. Only turbocharged models of the 603 series were available to the U.S. market. The single camshaft and injection pump are driven by duplex chain from the crankshaft.

This engine reached North America later for the 1981 380SL. There were 116.961, 116.962, and 116.963 versions of this engine. Early models came with a single <b>row</b> timing <b>chain</b> until 1983 and were plagued with chain failure problems which Mercedes-Benz would repair free of charge, changing the timing chain to a dual row thus resolved the problem making these engine as durable and reliable as any other Mercedes V8.

Whereas the molecules substituted by dodecyl chains form the lamellar structures with alternating rigid core <b>rows</b> and alkyl <b>chain</b> <b>rows,</b> the unsubstituted ones change the orientation of the rigid backbones with respect to the lamellar axis.

40|$|Sonar {{broadcasts}} {{are followed}} by echoes at different delays from objects at different distances. When broadcasts are emitted rapidly in cluttered surroundings, echo streams from successive broadcasts overlap and cause ambiguity in matching echoes to corresponding broadcasts. To identify reactions to ambiguity in clutter, echolocating bats that emit multiple-harmonic FM sounds were trained to fly into a dense, extended array of obstacles (multiple rows of vertically hanging chains) while the sonar sounds the bat emitted were recorded with a miniature radio microphone carried by the bat. Flight paths were reconstructed from thermal-infrared video recordings. Successive <b>rows</b> of <b>chains</b> extended more than 6 m in depth, so each broadcast {{was followed by a}} series of echoes from multiple <b>rows</b> of <b>chains</b> that lasted up to 40 ms. Bats emitted sounds in pairs (“strobe groups”) at short (20 – 40 ms) interpulse intervals (IPIs) alternating with longer IPIs (> 50 ms). For many short IPIs, the stream of echoes from the first broadcast was still arriving when the second broadcast was emitted. This overlap caused ambiguity about matching echoes with broadcasts. Bats shifted frequencies of the first sound in each strobe group upward and the second sound downward by 3 – 6 kHz. When overlap and ambiguity ceased, frequency shifts ceased also. Frequency differences were small compared with the total broadcast band, which was 75 – 80 kHz wide, but the harmonic structure of echoes enhances the differences in spectrograms. Bats could use time–frequency comparisons of echoes with broadcasts to assign echoes to the corresponding broadcasts and thus avoid ambiguity...|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} addimer chain structures as metastable precursors to compact epitaxial islands on the (2 · n) reconstructed SiGe wetting layer, using polarity-switching {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM). These chain structures are comprised of 2 – 12 addimers residing in the troughs of neighboring substrate dimer <b>rows.</b> The <b>chain</b> structures extend along equivalent h 130 i directions across the substrate dimer rows in a zigzag fashion, giving rise to kinked and straight segments. We measure a kink-to-straight ratio of nearly 2 : 1. This ratio corresponds to a free energy difference of 17 ± 4 meV, favoring the formation of kinked segments. The chain structures convert to compact epitaxial islands at elevated temperatures (P 90 °C). This conversion suggests that the chain structures are a precursor for compact island formation on the SiGe wetting layer. We digitally process filled- and empty-state STM images to distinguish chain structures from compact islands. By monitoring the populations of both species over time, the chain-to-island conversion rates are measured at substrate temperatures ranging from 90 to 150 °C. The activation energy for the conversion process is measured to be 0. 7 ± 0. 2 eV with a corresponding pre-exponential factor of 5 · 10 4 ± 2 s 1. Ó 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The strong metal-metal bonds {{inherent}} to the crystal structure of WO 2 have a pronounced {{effect on the}} electronic characteristics of this transition-metal oxide. The results of the bonding are clearly identifiable in the photoemission spectra of polycrystalline WO 2 samples. For the first time, single crystal surface studies have also been carried out. Single crystals of WO 2 with well-developed (012) faces were grown by a vapour transport method, and surface cleaning procedures involving ion bombardment and low-pressure oxygen annealing were developed. Photoemission spectroscopy and {{low energy electron diffraction}} were used to characterise the surface composition and long range order. LEED patterns reveal the expected c 2 mm symmetry, based on a model (012) surface unit cell of dimensions 5. 6 Å × 21 Å. Details of the surface structure were examined using high-resolution STM. The periodicity in filled-state STM images is determined by the separation between the centres of the metal-metal bonds rather than individual atoms. Rows of greyscale maxima are observed corresponding to the chains of WO 6 octahedra which run in the [100] direction. The terminating (012) ionic plane most probably has stoichiometry W 2 O 4. STM images demonstrate that the chains of paired WO 6 octahedra in this outer layer undergo pronounced lateral relaxations, bringing them into positions between the <b>rows</b> of <b>chains</b> in the underlying W 2 ionic plane.
