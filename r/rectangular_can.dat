In a periodic arrangement of sub-wavelength holes in a metal film the transmitted fraction of the incident light exceeds the open air fraction of the film for certain colours.

The principle procedure of transformation of walkway into a single-server finite capacity queuing system remains the same. In this research, we only consider the walkway facility. The escalator, platform and ticket facilities are not discussed in this research. These facilities can also be designed by abstracting into a queuing system.

40|$|Ion beam sputter {{deposition}} (IBSD) is a promising technique for the fabrication of high performance thin films {{because of the}} well defined and adjustable particle energies, which are rather high in comparison to other PVD techniques. Recent developments concerning long-term stability and lateral uniformity of the ion beam sources strengthen {{the position of the}} IBSD technique in the field of precise thin film synthesis. Furthermore, IBSD offers a more independent choice of relevant deposition parameters like particle energy and flux, process gas pressure and deposition rate. We present our currently installed large area IBSD facility IonSys 1600, which was developed by Fraunhofer IWS Dresden and Roth & Rau company (Hohenstein-Ernstthal). Substrate sizes of ? 200 mm (circular) or ? 500 mm length (<b>rectangular)</b> <b>can</b> be coated and multilayer stacks with ? 6 different materials are possible. Tailored 1 D or 2 D film thickness distributions with deviations of < 0. 1 % can be fabricated by a relative linear motion of the substrate holder above an aperture. To demonstrate the advantages of the IBSD technique esp. for sophisticated materials and films with high requirements concerning purity, chem. compn. or growth structure, several examples of deposited multilayers for various applications are presented...|$|E
30|$|Several models {{regarding}} {{the mechanism of}} formation of macropores on p-type Si {{has so far been}} reported. The depletion and field effects model proposed by Lehmann and Rönnebeck [24], the chemical passivation model [25], the current burst model [26], etc. have been widely used, but a real consensus in this matter is still awaited. However, before commenting on the probable mechanism governing pore formation, we first note the major observations generated in this study with respect to the effect of wafer resistivity on pore morphology, which is partly reflected in the images shown in Figure 1 : (1) the thickness of the macropore walls are greatly reduced with decrease in resistivity of the starting substrate; (2) for given current density and HF/DMF ratio, inter-pore spacing increases but the pore density decreases with increase in resistivity of the substrate; (3) the pore diameter also decreases with decreasing resistivity (though on comparing Figure 1 a with either c or d this might seem contradictory, one has to note that the voids seen in Figure 1 a are due to more than one interconnected pores); (4) there is probably some critical threshold resistivity (approximately 0.1 to 0.2 Ω-cm in our case) below which no macropore can be obtained; and (5) the geometry of the cross-section of the pore (roughly circular or hexagonal or <b>rectangular)</b> <b>can</b> be tailored by choosing different resistivity wafers. In addition, we also observed, in agreement with previous reports [5, 15, 16] that for a wafer of given resistivity, the pore diameter increases almost linearly with formation current density, whereas etching time primarily governs the pore-depth. The effect of HF concentration and HF/DMF ratio is relatively complex and is discussed elsewhere [16]. The presence of DMF in the electrolyte {{plays an important role in}} the formation process as it is a very good solvent for positive charge carriers [27]. The high concentration of DMF increases hole current at the pore walls causing widening of the pores. Therefore, for the low resistivity (ρ = 0.1 to 0.5 and 2 to 5 Ω-cm) samples, porous structure could be obtained only when both the current density and HF/DMF ratio were maintained at lower values.|$|E
