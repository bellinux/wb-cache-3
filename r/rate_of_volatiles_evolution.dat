40|$|A {{series of}} novel polydimethylsiloxane/montmorillonite (PDMS/MMT) nanocomposites was prepared. The thermal {{degradation}} behaviour of these nanocomposites was studied {{by means of}} Thermal Volatilization Analysis (TVA) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The major degradation products were identified as cyclic oligomeric siloxanes from D 3 to D 7, and higher oligomeric siloxane residues. Other minor degradation products include methane, bis-pentamethylcyclotrisiloxane, propene, propanal, benzene and dimethylsilanone. The results demonstrate that the nanoclay significantly alters the degradation behaviour of the PDMS network, modifying {{the profile of the}} thermal degradation and reducing the overall <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> <b>evolution.</b> The results also indicate that the nanoclay promotes the formation of dimethylsilanone and benzene by inducing low levels of radical chain scission...|$|E

Pyrolysis is an important phenomenon in thermal treatment of wood, therefore, the successful modelling of pyrolysis to predict the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>evolution</b> is also <b>of</b> great importance. Pyrolysis experiments of waste spruce sawdust were carried out. During the experiment, gaseous products were analysed to determine a change in the gas composition with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the model of pyrolysis was created using Aspen Plus software.

40|$|Pyrolyses of the reactively {{flame retarded}} {{polystyrene}} copolymers styrene/diethyl(acryloyloxyethyl) phosphate(S/DEAEP), styrene/diethyl(methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphate(S/DEMEP), styrene/diethyl(methacryloyloxymethyl) phosphonate(S/DEMMP) and styrene/diethyl(acryloyloxymethyl) phosphonate(S/DEAMP) {{have been investigated}} {{with a view to}} obtaining information pertinent to the mechanism of their flame retardant behaviour. Studies were also carried out on the additive polystyrene systems containing triethylphosphate (TEP) and diethylethylphosphonate (DEEP) for comparison. All the systems contained 3. 5 wt% of phosphorus. A range of techniques were used, namely TG with EGA, DSC, SEM, laser and microfurnace pyrolysis mass spectrometry and isothermal pyrolysis/GC-MS, to study the decompositions under a range of conditions. In the case of the additive systems, the additive was shown to be evolved before polymer decomposition occurred. Very little, if any, char residues were observed. Thus the main mechanism of fire retardant action of the phosphorus incorporated into the polystyrene as an additive would occur in the vapour phase. This mechanism prevailed regardless of whether the additive was a phosphate (TEP) or a phosphonate (DEEP). The effectiveness of the fire retardant action would be limited as the fire retardant and fuel did not volatilise together. There was evidence that some interaction occurred in the condensed phase. In all the copolymers the phosphorus content of the char was substantial. This is characteristic of the condensed phase fire retardant action of phosphorus. SEM studies showed the interior of the char to be a network of channels which would give the char a sponge-like interior which would enhance thermal insulation. The surfaces were relatively dense thus providing a barrier to escape for any gaseous products formed in the interior. Char formation and cross-linking are assumed {{to be the result of}} the presence of the strong phosphoric and phosphonic acids resulting from initial pyrolysis. Since phosphonic is the weaker acid, the polymer degradation and release <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> products may be less inhibited in the case of the phosphonate-containing copolymers compared to the phosphate-containing copolymers. This is consistent with their shorter times to ignition. There was also evidence for some potential phosphorus vapour phase fire retardant action as phosphorus-containing species were identified among the pyrolysis products for all samples. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>evolution</b> from the copolymers was reduced compared to that of the corresponding additive system...|$|R

The moles of hydrogen ion consumed during alteration are calculated from the mineralogy of unaltered and altered rock.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} {{involved in}} the propagation of pulverised biomass ﬂames is not well understood. All biomass fuels release volatiles {{at a much lower}} temperature than coal and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> is much greater than for coal, typically 80 % compared to 30 %. Thus, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> from biomass fuels is much more important in the pulverised fuel ﬂame propagation than it is for coal, where the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> char oxidation is more important. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> from dry biomass follows three stages: the ﬁrst stage for typically 10 % <b>of</b> the <b>volatiles</b> occurs over 200 – 300 C, the second stage of about 70 % <b>of</b> the total <b>volatile</b> mass occurs over the temperature range 300 – 400 C. Finally, there is a slow loss <b>of</b> <b>volatiles,</b> accounting for remaining 20 % <b>of</b> <b>volatiles,</b> over the temperature range 400 – 900 C. Stagg’s quick approximation method was used to determine the kinetics for the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> yield. Biomass samples were found to have lower activation energies and higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> in comparison with coal samples, up to 300 – 400 C.

There is currently little understanding of the composition <b>of</b> the <b>volatiles</b> released at low temperatures from biomass, as most publications are for pyrolysis conditions at high temperature. It is possible that the volatiles are a mixture of mainly H 2, CO and CH 4 and the likely proportions of these were calculated from the elemental and thermo-gravimetric analysis.

Moreover, the effects of these parameters on the diffusion <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> a therapeutic agent (salicylic acid) to an in vitro external compartment were analyzed. Finally, the applicatory properties of the ointments prepared by way of a conventional technique (in a mortar) and with the aid of an unguator, were compared. The rheological parameters of the analyzed ointments suggest that the preparations made with an aid of an unguator, irrespective of the physicochemical characteristics of their vehicles, are characterized by higher values of diffusion coefficient (D). In addition, conventionally-prepared formulae containing salicylic were shown to be characterized by better viscous elasticity. Surprisingly, irrespective of the preparation technique, the ointments based on an absorptive vehicle (containing lanolin) were characterized by similar viscous elasticity. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> (water) component loss from ointments containing a 3 % solution of boric acid suggests that such formulae lose no more than 2. 3 % of their mass when exposed at 37 ℃.

All biomass fuels release volatiles at a much lower temperature than coal and the characterization <b>of</b> this <b>volatile</b> release is an important part of a pulverized biomass flame propagation model. <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> from dry biomass follow three stages: the first stage occurs over 200 – 300 oC and accounts for typically 10 % <b>of</b> the <b>volatile</b> loss.

Finally, there is a slow loss <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> accounting for about 20 % <b>of</b> the <b>volatile</b> loss over the temperature range 400 – 900 oC. These three stages were present in the coal samples but at much higher temperatures.

Thus, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>volatiles</b> for biomass flames is much more important in the flame propagation than it is for coal flames where the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> char oxidation is important.

Green anodes are produced by mixing all these ingredients and then forming them in a compactor. The final step is the baking of green anodes, which determines the final anode properties. During baking, volatiles evolve from the pitch which carbonizes and binds the particulate matter. Anode quality greatly influences the performance of electrolytic cells and has an impact on carbon consumption, energy use, green house gas emissions, and cost.

These EUV measurements and models results will compliment the other instruments that will provide direct in-situ as well as remote sensing observations of the Martian atmospheric response to this solar driver. This presentation will be an introduction of this instrument and its science measurements and goals to the larger community, as well as a status report on its progress...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermal release}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nuclear {{reaction}} products {{was investigated in}} offline annealing experiments. This work was motivated by {{the search for a}} high melting catcher material for recoiling products from heavy ion induced nuclear fusion reactions. Polycrystalline refractory metal foils of Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, W, and Re were investigated as catcher metals. Diffusion data for various tracer/host combinations were deduced from the measured release rates. This work focuses on the diffusion and the release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> p-elements from row 5 and 6 of the periodic table as lighter homologues of the superheavy elements with Z ≥ 113 to be studied in future experiments. A massive radiation damage enhancement of the diffusion velocity was observed. Diffusion trends have been established along the groups and rows of the periodic table based on the dependence of diffusion velocity on atomic sizes...|$|R
40|$|We {{precisely}} {{monitored the}} production kinetics <b>of</b> 16 <b>volatile</b> carbon compounds {{corresponding to the}} predominant higher alcohols and esters produced during the alcoholic fermentation of wine using an online GC system. We studied the gas-liquid partitioning of isobutanol, isoamyl acetate and ethyl hexanoate and showed that CO 2 stripping had {{no impact on the}} partition coefficient (k(i)). We formulated a predictive model for k(i) changes during the fermentation and calculated the gas-liquid balances <b>of</b> these <b>volatile</b> compounds throughout the entire fermentation process. Losses in the off-gas were highly compound-dependent. They were negligible for higher alcohols but very high for esters, with losses of up to 70 % for ethyl hexanoate at 30 degrees C. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>volatile</b> compound production, accumulation and loss could also be calculated with high precision. Loss rates were maximal at the end of fermentation, indicating that high final temperatures, although helpful in avoiding sluggish fermentations, can be very detrimental to aroma losses.
