2500|$|Construction of the Keban Dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1936 by {{the newly established}} Electric Affairs Survey Administration, but not started before 1966. Construction {{was carried out by}} the French-Italian consortium SCI-Impreglio and completed in 1974. Estimates of the total construction cost vary between US$85million and US$300million. At that time, archaeological rescue missions had also been carried out at important sites that were to be flooded. Flooding of the reservoir started in 1974 and led to the displacement of 25,000 people. During the flooding of the Keban Reservoir, Turkey maintained the discharge of the Euphrates at [...] per second, as agreed with the downstream countries of Syria and Iraq. However, {{as a result of the}} fact that Syria was at that time filling the reservoir of its newly constructed Tabqa Dam as well, in 1975 a dispute broke out between Syria and Iraq over the amount of water that flowed into Iraq. This dispute, exacerbated by drought which reduced the amount of available water even further, was solved by mediation of Saudi Arabia. After the initial filling of the lake, geological weaknesses in the bedrock on which the dam was built necessitated a temporary lowering of the lake level in order to carry out extensive <b>reinforcement</b> <b>works.</b> Reportedly, Keban Dam was the world's eighteenth-tallest dam at completion, creating Turkey's largest man-made reservoir and third-largest lake until the filling of the reservoir of the Atatürk Dam.|$|E

30|$|First, {{there is}} a high {{probability}} of delays in formwork and rebar construction in the free-form plane area in the planar element; according to the analysis, these factors have a significant influence on other processes. The importance of delay factors was high because the amount of additional formwork and installation work in the free-form plane increases and additional <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work</b> is generated.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 1996, {{after having}} <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work</b> done, the bridge {{suddenly}} collapsed and shut off fresh {{water and electricity}} between the islands.

50|$|The {{bridge was}} closed for <b>reinforcement</b> <b>works</b> between late 2008 and October 2009 {{as part of the}} Central Connector, a 3 km rapid transit {{corridor}} bus priority route connecting the Auckland CBD to Newmarket and other destinations. It received a $7 million carbon fibre strengthening upgrade to bring it up to current earthquake standards and to enable it to serve as a dedicated route for large numbers of buses. It can now accommodate up to 1200 bus trips a day. The bridge now has a load-carrying capacity of 40 tonnes, instead of the previous 13 tonnes. In October 2009 the bridge was reopened by Mayor John Banks. The footpaths are covered with curved transparent screens installed in 2002, to prevent people from falling or jumping off and providing weather cover (the bridge had suicide prevention barriers from as early as 1936, replaced with mesh screens in 1957 that were removed in 1997. After the removal, suicides increased fivefold, leading to a quiet re-installation in 2002). There have been no suicides from the bridge since then until 2015, and the feature has been called an example of best practice of preventing such acts.|$|E

40|$|In {{many cases}} of seismic {{reinforcement}} of over-track station buildings, a method is employed by which braces are installed to improve proof stress to resist seismic force. In light {{of the nature of}} station buildings, however, such <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work</b> has to be carried out while maintaining the functions of the building. This has often involved situations such as limitation of placement of braces, rethinking of placement plans and securing available substitute facilities, making work difficult. Meanwhile, much aseismatic <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work</b> is carried out along with improvements for barrier-free access. Such barrier-free improvement work is done to install elevators or escalators with the floor area often expanded in cases where there is no existing space to place them. Hence, if we can use such expansion of adjacent buildings to reduce seismic response of the existing building and to relatively improve its aseismatic performance, we will achieve reduction of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work</b> volume. The purpose of this development is to improve aseismatic performance of existing buildings by using add-on buildings adjacent to existing ones rather than by conventional methods. As shown in Fig. 1, one effective method would be to make the adjacent building an added vibration system to the existing building. By doing so, energy absorption by kinetic energy of the added system or by vibration control devices can reduce seismic response to that building. When such a system functions effectively, the bearing force required of the existing building can be lowered, and reinforcement volume can be reduced accordingly. As a system {{that can be used in}} such method, a linked-structure vibration control method where multiple independent structure...|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of concrete structures {{needs to be}} improved to compensate the  deterioraton induced by adverse environment, inadequate maintenance, or spontaneously varied natural conditions. The application of sectional augmentation or steel plate attachment employed to column elements  has limitations due to the increase of dead weight to foundations and reduced usability.  In contrast, the method employing FRP materials has been broadly propagated, because it enables comparatively simple construction work that could secure the integrity of concrete structures. Due to its advantages of excellent reinforcement effects together with superior durability and corrosion resistance realizable in a rather short construction period, the FRP materials have been broadly employed in recent maintenance and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>works</b> (Al-Nimry and Ghanem 2017).|$|E

50|$|The first {{building}} work is {{dated to}} about 1095, {{and consisted of}} a motte, which was enclosed in a spacious courtyard or bailey.

50|$|The {{complexity}} of the structure {{and a number of}} irregularities suggest that its construction was a lengthy affair. Evident signs of ancient restorations reveal structural failures resulting from intense use or from natural calamities.

Using novelty detection approaches for structural health monitoring presents significant challenges to the non-expert user. In this article, symbolic data analysis is introduced to model variability in tests. Hierarchy-divisive methods and dynamic clouds procedures are then used to discriminate structural changes used as novelty detection approaches for classifying structural behaviours.

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the use of fibre {{reinforced}} concrete in load-carrying structures, with an emphasis on shear capacity of beams with openings. The main focus has been the design and testing of four full-scale beams. Two beams with plain concrete and conventional reinforcement and two beams with steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC), both with and without conventional reinforcement. The beams were tested until failure and then compared to each other in order to establish the effect of fibres. Theoretically calculated capacities have also been carried out according to current guidelines and compared to the test results. The properties of both the fresh and the hardened concrete were studied and tested in accordance with current standards and regulations. Self compacting SFRC with 1 vol-% steel fibres were used, which corresponds to about 80 kg/m 3. The idea was to simplify the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work,</b> where the use of SFRC could serve as an adequate and cheaper alternative to the conventional shear reinforcement. A combination of both SFRC and conventional reinforcement would increase the total load-carrying capacity {{and at the same time}} lead to toughening and stiffening of the structure. The full-scale tests showed that by using 1 vol-% steel fibres the beam achieved the same capacity as the beams with conventional shear reinforcement. This suggests that SFRC is a promising alternative to conventional reinforcement. SFRC would simplify the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>work,</b> and ultimately lead to a reduction of man-hours involved in steel fixing. ...|$|R
