40|$|Abstract—Existing {{underground}} pipe jacking methods use a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rod</b> in a steel tube to obtain structural stiffness. However, some {{problems such as}} inconvenience of works and expensive materials resulted from limited working space and reinforcing works are existed. To resolve these problems, a new pipe jacking method, namely PST (Prestressed Segment Tunnel) method, was developed which used joint to connect the steel segment and form erection structure. For evaluating the flexural capacity of the PST method structure, a experimental test was conducted. The parameters considered in the test were span-to-depth ratio of segment, diameter of steel tube at the corner, prestressing force, and welding of joint. The flexural behaviours with the effect of load capacity in serviceability state according to different parameters were examined [...] The frame with long segments could increase flexural stiffness and the specimen with large diameter of concave corner showed excellent resistance ability to the negative moment. In addition, welding of joints increased the flexural capacity. Keywords—PST method, Pipe jacking method, Flexural behavior, Prestressed concrete...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{granular}} pile {{is one of}} {{the effective}} and efficient methods of ground improvement because of its ability in improving the bearing capacity and reducing the settlement of different soft soils. Conventional granular piles cannot be used as tension members to offer resistance under pull out loads. Granular Pile Anchor (GPA) {{is one of the}} recent ground improvement technique in devised for resisting pull out forces. In a granular pile anchor, the footing is anchored to a mild steel plate placed {{at the bottom of the}} granular pile through a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rod</b> or a cable. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of relative density of fill material, granular pile diameter on the pull capacity of the granular pile anchor and the comparison of encased and non-encased granular pile has been done. The laboratory model tests using GPAF system revealed that the pull-out capacity of the granular pile anchor increased with increasing relative density of the granular material. There was a maximum percentage increase of 35 % in the ultimate load when the relative density was increased from 50 to 70 % for 50 mm diameter pile. It was also revealed that the pull-out capacity of the granular pile anchor increased with increasing diameter of the granular pile anchor. The increase of 35 % was also obtained when the diameter was increased from 30 mm to 50 mm at a relative density of 70 %. For the encased pile, maximum increase in the percentage ultimate pullout load was obtained for pile diameter of 30 mm and it was about of 13. 2 %...|$|E

40|$|The use of fibre <b>reinforced</b> {{composite}} <b>rods</b> as concrete reinforcement material {{seems to}} be an effective solution to overcome durability problems of traditional steel reinforced concrete structures. The main advantages of fibre reinforced composite materials over steel include the excellent corrosive resistance, mechanical properties similar to steel, high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent fatigue resistance, among others [Alsayed et al, 2000], [Lees, J. M., 2001]. Typically, fibre <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> are produced by pultrusion, although, besides this technique, composite rods can also be produced using braiding techniques [Kadioglu, F. & Pidaparti, R. M., 2005], [Saikia, B. et al, 2005]. Braiding is a low cost technique that allows in-plane multiaxial orientation, conformability, excellent damage tolerance and core reinforcement [Soebroto et al, 1990], the production of ribbed structures and a wide range of mechanical properties may be improved when the core braided fabrics are reinforced with the appropriate type of fibres [Fangueiro et al, 2004, 2005 & 2006]. The current research work deals with the development of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> for civil engineering applications, namely to reinforce concrete structures as a substitute of steel rebars. The mechanical properties of composite rods, produced by braiding, are influenced by the type of fibre used as braided fabric core reinforcement, among other parameters. The objective of this experimental work is to evaluate the influence of the type of core reinforcement fibres on the mechanical performance of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods.</b> Several samples of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced using polyester fibres, for the production of braided fabrics, E-glass, carbon and HT polyethylene fibres, as braided fabrics core reinforcement, and polyester resin as polymeric matrix. Braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced on a vertical braiding machine incorporating an impregnation system specially developed for this purpose. Different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced maintaining the braided fabric structure and varying the type of core reinforcement fibre. Composite <b>rods</b> were <b>reinforced</b> with a single type of reinforcement fibres as well as with two and three types of fibres, varying the percentage of each type. In order to evaluate the volume fraction of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> produced, tests were performed according to the Portuguese Standard NP 2216 / 1988 (determination of mass loss by calcinations of glass fibre reinforced plastics). In order to evaluate the mechanical performance of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> produced, tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D 3916 - 94 standard, with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. A post-load of 50 KN was applied to the rods prior to performing the tensile tests. When compared to the steel rebars currently used in the construction industry, composite rods higher tensile strength. Current steel rebars, A 235 NL, A 400 NR/ER and A 500 NR/ER have values of tensile strength of 360 MPa, 460 MPa, and 550 MPa respectively. Composite rods present tensile strength higher than 550 MPa.
