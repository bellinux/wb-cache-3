40|$|It is well known, that {{tones of}} Lithuanian {{language}} {{for the first}} time have been described and illustrated using musical notes in the mid of 19 th century by Friedrich Kurschat (lt. Frydrichas Kuršaitis). No single attempt was made in order to analyze in-depth what specific prosodic features were covered by this material since the article of prof. A. Girdenis appeared in 2008. He concluded, that tone distribution is generally based on pitch range and contour differences (i. e. rising vs falling tone opposition). An alternative way of reconstruction proposed here reveals additional features which should be taken in to account as well. Measurements of prosodic parameters (i. e. pitch range, shape and vowel length) show that tones differ in terms of <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> change and duration. Rising tone (or to be more precise – sustained tone) can be defined as having longer duration and less intensive <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> change while the falling tone has opposite parameters – shorter duration and abrupt, steep pitch change.

40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with automatic throttle and elevator controls {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral control on the throttle or a combination of throttle and elevator controls. Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means of an automatic throttle control. 1. Introduction. The longitudinal stability of various aircraft with automatic throttle control has been investigated theoretically. Several types of throttle control have been studied. The main effects of elevator controls are known 1, but are summarised in this report. When a height lock is added to an elevator control an unstable mode is often introduced. This instabilit...|$|E

It is constrained by high-altitude (� 20, 000 km) satellite measurements of the energy spectra and pitch angle distributions and then fit to low-altitude (� 600 km) data that are sensitive to the longitude dependence of the electron losses. The fits provide estimates of the parameterized diffusion coefficient. The results show that the simple driftdiffusion model can account for the main features of the low-altitude radiation belt inside the plasmasphere during periods of steady decay. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> angle diffusion is usually stronger on the dayside than on the nightside, frequently by a factor � 10. The average derived lifetimes for loss into the atmosphere of � 10 days are comparable to the observed trapped electron decay rates. Considerable variability in the loss rates is positively correlated with geomagnetic activity. The results are generally consistent with electron scattering by plasmaspheric hiss as the primary mechanism for pitch angle diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Effects of density {{decrease}} in plasma injection regions and a latitude-dependent wave normal angle distribution on the energization of electrons by whistler mode waves at Jupiter are investigated. Previous work showed that whistler mode waves could enhance the fluxes {{of a few}} MeV electrons by {{an order of magnitude}} on a time scale of 30 days. However, density {{decrease in}} plasma injection regions and latitude dependence of the wave normal angle distribution of waves were not considered. Because this information is difficult to obtain from available observations, we perform a sensitivity study to demonstrate that the effect of density decrease on energization of electrons becomes important when the density inside injection regions is reduced to 25 % of that outside. We also investigate the effect of a latitude-dependent wave normal angle distribution on energization of electrons using a ray tracing program and demonstrate that a realistic latitude-dependent wave normal angle distribution increases the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> angle diffusion near the loss cone, and thus enhances the loss rate, of 1 – 3 MeV electrons.

Combining an experimental paradigm based on Ghitza and Greenberg (Phonetica, 66 (1 - 2), 113 - 126, 2009) for speech with the approach of Farbood et al. (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 39 (4), 911 - 918, 2013) for musical key-finding, listeners were asked to judge the key of short melodic sequences that were presented at a highly a compressed rate with varying durations of silence inserted in a periodic manner in the audio signal.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comprehensive}} analysis of resonant scattering of diffuse auroral electrons by oblique nightside chorus emissions present along a field line with an equatorial crossing of 6 R(E) at 00 : 00 MLT, using various nondipolar Tsyganenko magnetic field models. Bounce-averaged quasi-linear diffusion coefficients are evaluated for both moderately and actively disturbed geomagnetic conditions using the T 89, T 96, and T 01 s models. The {{results indicate that}} inclusion of nondipolar magnetic field leads to significant changes in bounce-averaged <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> both <b>pitch</b> angle and momentum diffusion for 200 eV to 10 keV plasma sheet electrons. Compared to the results using a dipole field, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> angle diffusion obtained using the Tsyganenko models are enhanced at all resonant pitch angles for 200 eV electrons. In contrast, for 500 eV to 10 keV electrons the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> angle scattering are enhanced at intermediate and/or high pitch angles but tend to be considerably lower near the loss cone, thus reducing the precipitation loss compared {{to that in a}} dipole field. Upper band chorus acts as the dominant cause for scattering loss of 200 eV to 2 keV electrons, while lower band chorus scattering prevails for 5 - 10 keV electrons, consistent with the results using the dipole model. The first-order cyclotron resonance and the Landau resonance are mainly responsible for the net scattering <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> plasma sheet electrons by oblique chorus waves and also primarily account for the differences in bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients introduced by the use of Tsyganenko models. As the geomagnetic activity increases, the differences in scattering rates compared to the dipole results increase accordingly. Nonnegligible differences also occur particularly at high pitch angles for the diffusion rates between the Tsyganenko models, showing an increase with geomagnetic activity level and a dependence on the discrepancy between the Tsyganenko model fields. The strong dependence of bounce-averaged quasi-linear scattering rates on the adopted global magnetic field model and geomagnetic activity level demonstrates that realistic magnetic field models should be incorporated into future modeling efforts to accurately quantify the role of magnetospheric chorus in driving the diffuse auroral precipitation and the formation of electron pancake distributions...|$|R

The aerodynamics behavior of SAFAT- 01 aircraft developed at SAFAT aviation complex were calculated at different angles of attack and side slip angles. The x,y and z forces and moments were calculated at flight speed 50 m/s and at sea level condition. Lift and drag curves for different angles of attack were plotted. The maximum lift coefficient for SAFAT- 01 was 1. 67 which occurred at angle of attack 16 o and Maximum lift to drag ratio (L/D) was 14 which occurred at α= 3 o, and the zero lift drag coefficient was 0. 0342. Also the yawing moment coefficient was plotted for different side slip angles as well as rolling moment. The longitudinal stability derivatives with respect to angle of attack, speed variation (u), <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> (q) and time rate of change of angle of attack were calculated using obtained CFD results.

This study aimed to investigate whether previous musical education improves pitch perception ability in these children. METHODS: Twenty-seven children with congenital/prelingual deafness of profound degree were studied. Test stimuli consisted of 2 sequential piano tones, ranging from C (256 Hz) to B (495 Hz). Children {{were asked to identify}} the pitch relationship between the 2 tones (same, higher, or lower). Effects of musical training duration, pitch-interval size, current age, age of implantation, gender, and type of cochlear implant on accuracy of pitch perception were evaluated. RESULTS: The duration of musical training positively correlated with the correct <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> perception. Pitch perception performance was better in children who had a cochlear implant and were older than 6 years than in those who were aged ≤ 6 years (ie, preschool). Effect of pitch-interval size was insignificant on pitch perception, and there was no correlation between pitch perception and the age of implantation, gender, or type of cochlear implant. CONCLUSIONS: Musical training seems to improve pitch perception ability in prelingually deafened children with a cochlear implant. Auditory plasticity might {{play an important role in}} such enhancement. This suggests that incorporation of a structured training program on music perception early in life and as part of the postoperative rehabilitation program for prelingually deafened children with cochlear implants would be beneficial. A longitudinal study is needed to show whether improvement of music performance in these children is measurable by use of auditory evoked potentials. 8 page(s...|$|E

Possible indices in hip mobility are passivehip internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER). A contributor of ankle mobility is passive ankle dorsi-flexion (PAD). This study examines {{the relationship of}} selected indices in hip and ankle mobility for collegiate baseball pitchers with the athlete’s respective coaches’ <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitching</b> performance (CR) and maximum pitched ball velocity (BV). Ten collegiate baseball pitchers (age= 20 ± 2 yrs, height= 72. 5 ± 3. 6 in, weight= 199. 1 ± 35 lbs.) volunteered for this study. Proceeding the assessment session, each athlete performed a series of static stretches. During the assessment session height, weight, IR, ER, and PAD were recorded for each athlete. The day before the assessment session, BV was determined from the average velocity of the fasted three pitches from a bullpen session of 25 fastball readings (BV= 87. 7 ± 4. 6 mph.) utilizing a Stalker Pro radar gun. IR and ER were determined by the participant lying face down on assessment table with the knee flexed to 90 degrees. IR was determined by measuring the degrees of movement with a goniometer when the femur was passively moved into internal rotation and ER when the femur was passively moved into external rotation. PAD was conducted using a tape measure placed on the floor perpendicular to the wall. With shoes removed, athletes placed the knee of the selected leg against the wall while sliding the heel away from the wall. The distance from the posterior side of the heel to the wall was measured and recorded for both legs and normalized to the athletes’ height. CR <b>of</b> the athletes’ <b>pitching</b> performance {{was provided by the}} athlete’s coach in response to a standardized question which quantified pitching performance using a 10 pt scale (10 =superior, 1 =inferior). IR, ER, and PAD scores were correlated with CR using Spearman’s (ρ) rank and with BV using Pearson’s rank (r). Moderate strength correlations existed between CR and non-dominant PAD (ρ= 0. 36) and dominant IR (ρ= 0. 33). Moderate strength correlations also existed between BV and non-dominant PAD (r= 0. 46), dominant IR (r= 0. 50) and non-dominant IR (r= 0. 47). Non-dominant PAD potentially correlates to BV because the increased range of motion in the ankle may create more torque, leading to a greater force coupling at the end <b>of</b> the <b>pitching</b> delivery. Dominant IR may increase the load on the drive leg which leads to more torque and drive stride for an increase in BV. Non-dominant IR potentially creates more torque and rotational momentum when the front side leg is planted at the completion <b>of</b> a <b>pitch.</b> It appears that the same indices for CR are not as applicable and pitching performance is dependent on various other factors...|$|R
40|$|International audience[1] The {{redistribution}} of energy during the recovery phase of geomagnetic storms {{related to the}} acceleration of electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt by cyclotron-resonant chorus waves is an important and challenging topic of magnetospheric plasma physics. An approximate analytical formulation of energy diffusion coefficients is derived in this paper, {{on the basis of}} a quasi-linear formalism valid for large enough bandwidths or for successive random scatter by uncorrelated waves of different frequencies and moderate average amplitudes. We make use of chorus wave parameterizations derived from CLUSTER measurements to show that oblique whistler waves can significantly increase the energy diffusion <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> small <b>pitch</b> angle electrons on the dayside. On the other hand, the energization <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the more numerous high pitch angle electrons is typically reduced by a factor of 2 on the dayside, while it remains nearly unchanged on the nightside where high-intensity waves are less oblique. Besides, lifetimes are strongly reduced on the dayside, which could also impact the long-term time-integrated acceleration <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> injected electrons. Comparison between the analytical formulas and full numerical results demonstrates a good agreement and provides new scaling laws as a function of whistler mean frequency, plasma density and particle energy. It is also suggested that the enhancement of energy diffusion of low energy electrons (< 100 keV) at small pitch angles with oblique waves could result in an intensification of wave growth at latitudes higher than 15. This might contribute to explain high chorus intensities measured by CLUSTER on the dayside at high latitudes. Citation: Mourenas, D., A. Artemyev, O. Agapitov, and V.
