25|$|It {{is clear}} that {{companies}} recognize ERM as a critical management issue. This is demonstrated through the prominence assigned to ERM within organizations and the resources devoted to building ERM capabilities. In a 2008 survey by Towers Perrin, at most life insurance companies, responsibility for ERM resides within the C-suite. Most often, the chief risk officer (CRO) or {{the chief financial officer}} (CFO) is in charge of ERM, and these individuals typically report directly to the chief executive officer. From their vantage point, the CRO and CFO are able to look across the organization and develop a perspective on the risk profile of the firm and how that profile matches its <b>risk</b> <b>appetite.</b> They act as drivers to improve skills, tools and processes for evaluating risks and to weigh various actions to manage those exposures. Companies are also actively enhancing their ERM tools and capabilities. Three quarters of responding companies said they have tools for specifically monitoring and managing enterprise-wide risk. These tools are used primarily for identifying and measuring risk and for management decision making. Respondents also reported that they have made good progress in building their ERM capabilities in certain areas.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} asset-backed securities for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) {{is that they}} bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different <b>risk</b> <b>appetites</b> and investing time horizons.|$|R
2500|$|The COSO [...] "Enterprise Risk Management-Integrated Framework" [...] {{published}} in 2004 defines ERM as a [...] "…process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting {{and across the}} enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within its <b>risk</b> <b>appetite,</b> to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Working {{capital is}} the amount of funds which are {{necessary}} to an organization to continue its ongoing business operations, until the firm is reimbursed through payments for the goods or services it has delivered to its customers. [...] Working capital is measured through the difference between resources in cash or readily convertible into cash (Current Assets), and cash requirements (Current Liabilities). As a result, capital resource allocations relating to working capital are always current, i.e. short-term. In addition to time horizon, working capital management differs from capital budgeting in terms of discounting and profitability considerations; they are also [...] "reversible" [...] to some extent. (Considerations as to <b>Risk</b> <b>appetite</b> and return targets remain identical, although some constraints – such as those imposed by loan covenants – may be more relevant here).|$|E

40|$|The Coase Theorem is {{analyzed}} {{in a setting}} in which pollution damages are a stochastic function of emissions and of natural environmental variability (e. g., weather). When pollution damages are stochastic, emissions create financial risks.

In this case, resource allocation decisions are not separable from the legal institutions that allocate risks, nor from the financial institutions that facilitate risk transfer. In particular, improvements in institutions for environmental risk management generally induce greater levels of pollution...|$|R

Matthews (2010) concludes that prior to 2005, the CAP successfully insulated EU domestic prices from the volatility of the world market but the price stability interventions became “increasingly intertwined with and dominated by” a motivation to simply transfer income to the EU farm sector. The associated “budget costs” and “environmental criticisms” motivated policymakers towards reforming agricultural policy supports and deciding to largely decouple farm subsidies from production in the 2003 reforms, which became enacted in 2005 (Capitanio and Adinolfi 2009).|$|R

40|$|The {{channels}} for the cross-border propagation of sovereign {{risk in the}} international sovereign debt market are analysed. Identifying sovereign credit events as extraordinary jumps in CDS spreads, we distinguish between the immediate effects of such events and their longer term spillover effects. To analyse “fast and furious” contagion, we use daily CDS data to conduct event studies around a total of 89 identified credit events in a global country sample. To analyse “slow-burn” spillover effects, we apply a multifactor risk model, distinguishing between global and regional risk factors. We find that “fast and furious” contagion has been primarily a regional phenomenon, whilst “slow-burn” spillover effects can often be global in scope, especially those of the recent European debt crisis. The global risk factors {{are found to be}} driven by investor <b>risk</b> <b>appetites</b> and debt levels, whilst the regional factors depend on economic fundamentals of countries within a region...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of cash protection strategies {{implemented in the}} South African market are investigated {{in order to establish}} if investors are able to add value through the use of dynamic portfolio insurance methods. The analysis is performed, using monthly data, from January 1961 to August 2014 using six alternative methodologies including both a Fixed Rate and Rolling Average Stop-Loss approach, a Lock-In approach, a Constant Mix strategy, a Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance ("CPPI") approach and an alternative CPPI approach using a Ratchet mechanism. The results indicate that the use of such cash protection strategies can markedly improve portfolio performance from a risk return perspective compared to a pure diversified investment strategy. Notably, the use of older, simpler trading strategies such as the Stop-Loss and Lock-In approaches at optimum threshold levels can still offer investors higher risk to reward benefits with less commitment required. These strategies, though, lack the flexibility observed with the more recently developed dynamic trading strategies in terms of providing for varying <b>risk</b> <b>appetites...</b>|$|R
40|$|We study a {{decentralized}} investment {{problem in}} which a CIO employs multiple asset managers to implement and execute investment strategies in separate asset classes. The CIO allocates capital to the managers who, in turn, allocate these funds to the assets in their asset class. This two-step investment process causes several misalignments of objectives between the CIO and his managers {{and can lead to}} large utility costs {{on the part of the}} CIO. We focus on i) loss of diversification ii) different <b>appetites</b> for <b>risk,</b> iii) different investment horizons, and iv) the presence of liabilities. We derive an optimal unconditional linear performance benchmark and show that this benchmark can be used to better align incentives within the firm. The optimal benchmark substantially mitigates the utility costs of decentralized investment management. These costs can be further reduced when the CIO can screen asset managers on the basis of their <b>risk</b> <b>appetites.</b> Each manager%u 2019 s optimal level of risk aversion depends on the asset class he manages and can differ substantially from the CIO%u 2019 s level of risk aversion. ...|$|R

40|$|Government-sponsored {{inquiries}} into trustee competence, {{and legislation}} regarding the protocols {{and practice of}} trustee decision making, have {{raised questions about the}} competence of trustees to make investment decisions consistent with the long-term interest of defined benefit pension plan beneficiaries. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of trustee competence in solving problems relevant to their investment responsibilities. Based upon a set of widely recognized problems drawn from the psychology literature, we assess their discount functions, their willingness to risk their own money and others money, their appreciation of probability, and their use of evidence to solve problems. For comparison, where appropriate we report the results of the same testing regime applied to a group of Oxford undergraduates. Our goals are fourfold: first, to demonstrate the nature of trustee competence in decision making; second, to demonstrate the range of trustee responses to problems relevant to investment; third, to assess trustees <b>risk</b> <b>appetites</b> in relation to their own and others money; and fourth, to draw implications from these results for the governance of trustee boards and their relationships with advisers and service providers. It is shown that trustee competence is surprisingly heterogeneous, and the lack of common approaches to problems relevant to investment practice has significant implications for fund governance. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Enterprise {{is often}} {{described}} as risk for reward, but {{it may be possible to}} reduce the risk while improving returns. According to SEDA, failure rates of SMMEs in South Africa range from 70 to 80 percent. The need for this study arose when it was found that most SMMEs did not have a formal system in place to mitigate their risks right from the outset in the feasibility study, the business plan design and the start–up of the business. This lack of mitigation controls could be a result of a lack of understanding of the enterprise risk management (ERM) methodology or an inappropriate ERM decision–making model to assist them in a way that would mitigate their risk and minimise financial losses. The ERM approach can anticipate unplanned occurrences and is a systematic way of foreseeing the future. Entrepreneurs and business owners take on risks to pursue new business objectives within their respective <b>risk</b> <b>appetites.</b> This study also evaluated several models of risk identification and the ERM methodology. In this study an ERM model, ISO 31000, was applied in a business case and a comparison was made between the risks identified in the business plan and the ERM approach. Master...|$|R
40|$|The Singapore {{government}} {{wanted to}} develop the local sports industry and upgrade the old national stadium. Mark Rathbone, partner of global advisory firm PwC, was appointed to consult and manage the procurement issues for the project. The government decided to finance the Sports Hub through a Public-Private Partnership to save on the capital outlay. Unitary payments would only be made once the facility was made available {{for use by the}} private consortium. As the integrator, Rathbone had to prepare a concession agreement that was perceived to be fair to all parties involved. He had to ensure that government entities as well as private stakeholders understood their roles and responsibilities in the bidding and building process. Once a preferred bidder was chosen, the main stumbling block was to finance the project. The 2008 financial crisis resulted in reduced <b>risk</b> <b>appetites</b> for banks. Rathbone had to put together a club deal by negotiating separately with 14 lenders. Banks were only willing to take on smaller quantum deals and extend loans with tenors of only ten years.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{information}} {{on the benefits of}} climate change adaptation planning being widely available and well documented, in the UK at least relatively few real-world cases of scenario led adaptation have been documented. This limited uptake has been attributed to a variety of factors including the vast uncertainties faced, a lack of resources and potentially the absence of probabilities assigned to current climate change projections, thereby hampering conventional approaches to decision making under risk. Decision criteria for problems of uncertainty have been criticised for being too restrictive, crude, overly pessimistic, and data intensive. Furthermore, many cannot be reproduced reliably from sub-samples of the UKCP 09 probabilistic dataset. This study critically compares current decision criteria for problems of uncertainty and subsequently outlines an improved criterion which overcomes some of their limitations and criticisms. This criterion, termed the Green Z-score, is then applied to a simplified real-world problem of designing an irrigation reservoir in the UK under climate change. The criterion is designed to be simple to implement, support robust decision making and provide reproducible results from sub-samples of the UKCP 09 probabilistic dataset. It is designed to accommodate a wide range of <b>risk</b> <b>appetites</b> and attitudes and thereby encourage its use by decision makers who are presently struggling to determine whether and how to adapt to future climate change and its potential impacts. Analyses using sub-samples of the complete probabilistic dataset showed that the Green Z-score had comparable reproducibility to Laplace and improved reproducibility compared to other current decision criteria, and unlike Laplace is able to accommodate different risk attitudes...|$|R
