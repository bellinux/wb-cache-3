Gyokuro tea is associated with the Uji region, the first tea-growing region in Japan. It is often made using smaller-leaf cultivars of the tea plant.|$|E

25|$|The {{series is}} known for its artistic use of cel-shading visuals {{together}} with its <b>rich</b> <b>color</b> palettes, stylized ambience, and crisp and strong real-time shadows. Developer Realtime Worlds was heavily influenced by comic books in creating the first Crackdown game and they used highlighted ink-like outlines to give it a comic feel. The game was also praised for its use of large draw distances that was seldom seen in other open-world games of its time. Crackdown 2 improved upon the visuals set upon by the first game. While using the same engine and the black outlining system, Ruffian Games used a more advanced crowd system, which allows more NPCs to be in the game while not affecting its play flow. Ruffian further tweaked Crackdown's draw distances by rendering the engine to allow the display of a larger vista of Pacific City.|$|E
500|$|Monet had {{previously}} painted a subject in different light and different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of atmospheric influences were increasingly concerned {{not only with}} specific effects but with the overall color harmonies that allowed him an autonomous use of <b>rich</b> <b>color.</b> The conventional wisdom was that the stacks were a simple subject but also an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers {{and friends of the}} artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis. [...] Monet undertook to capture the stacks in direct light and then to re-examine them from the same view-point in different, often more muted, light and atmospheric conditions. It was then not unusual for Monet, in search of harmonious transitions within the series, to alter the canvases back in his studio.|$|E

500|$|While {{discussing}} the game's visual elements and art direction, developers revealed {{that they used}} several locations on Earth, such as the Yemeni islands of Socotra, lagoon archipelagos of Polynesia, and central Sahara as sources of inspiration. The team also worked with science fiction novelist Laurent Genefort to create the game's world. Bruno Gentile, Art Director of From Dust, stated that the world possessed strong visual contrasts, with [...] "rich and swarming life full of weird shapes and colors". Inhabitants of From Dust wear masks, which serve as a motif representing mystery and uniqueness. Gentile commented that after the developers researched African and New Guinean tribes, one of Ubisoft Montpellier's concept artists developed {{the idea of a}} large mask, constructed from nacre. Chahi remarked that the team had drawn inspiration from various musical instruments, especially slit drums used on the Vanuatu islands, and indicated that music was [...] "a key part in the gameplay and design". While tribes do not develop technologically, the team decided that their culture would evolve as they discovered [...] "their world and their past". The game utilizes a <b>rich</b> <b>color</b> palette, which allowed the team to create strong color contrast and to [...] "express the beauty of nature".|$|E
