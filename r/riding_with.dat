5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened {{almost as}} soon as it began, but the top riders in the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain.

He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E

No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, <b>riding</b> <b>with</b> him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass.

40|$|Title: Effect of {{different}} types of bicycle tires on energy expenditure Objectives: The aim of this bachelor thesis is to determine the difference in energy expenditure when using different types of bicycle tires. Methods: The research group consisted of 5 males in age 26, 4 ± 2, 2 years. This was an experiment. The calculation of energy expediture was based on the amount of oxygen consumption (VO 2) and exhaled carbon dioxide (VCO 2), i. e. indirect calorimetry. For the analysis of respiratory gases MetaMax 3 B measuring device was used. Three types of bicycle tires were tested. The test ride was carried out in laboratory on the cycling rollers. Probands completed one test <b>ride</b> (<b>with</b> a cadence of 80 rpm) on each type of tires. Test ride lasted on average 4 : 55 ± 1 : 50 min. For results were processed values of 4 minutes steady state VO 2. Results: We found out the significant difference in energy expenditure between <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> road tires and <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> Fat Bike tires, and also between <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> trekking tires and <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> Fat Bike tires. The difference between <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> road and trekking tires was, due to the standard error of measurement, insignificant. Conclusion: The energy expenditure reached a significant increase while using tires with the largest contact patch compared to using tires with the smallest [...] ...|$|R
