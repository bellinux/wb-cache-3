Like the full-featured KAF2 mount, this has power contacts for the lens and supports <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> and MTF information {{transferred from the}} lens to the body, but lacks the mechanical stop-down coupler necessary for full compatibility with the oldest Pentax K-mount lenses.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{addition}} of the 18-135 series is the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, announced on 17 February 2016. New features are the new Nano USM and the possibility to connect the <b>Power</b> <b>Zoom</b> Adapter PZ-E1, which allows a soft zoom for video. The lens is also available as bundle with the Canon EOS 80D, which was announced same date.|$|R
5000|$|The lens {{features}} a compact construction colloquially {{referred to as}} a [...] "pancake lens" [...] and a micromotor-driven <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> controlled by a switch {{on the side of the}} lens. Given the lens' focal length of 16-50mm, it is generally regarded as a multipurpose lens, though underperforms in low light situations due to its slower variable minimum aperture of f/3.5-5.6.|$|R
50|$|The KAF2-mount is {{the same}} as the KAF-mount except that it adds two extra power {{contacts}} to the inside of the mounting ring and transmits modulation transfer function (MTF) data through the digital seventh contact. The power contacts were originally used for <b>power</b> <b>zooming.</b> Since the introduction of the K10D digital SLR model, they are mainly used for powering Silent Drive Motor and DC motor lenses.|$|R

50|$|The K10D {{featured}} a pentaprism viewfinder (instead of the slightly dimmer pentamirror on some previous models), full programmed, aperture and shutter priority modes, {{and a new}} Sensitivity-priority mode where the rear dial adjusts light sensitivity and the camera adjusts shutter speed and aperture to maintain correct exposure. Power contacts on the lens mount were introduced to enable Pentax's SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) for silent focusing. The power contacts also provide the <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> function in some FA lens that Pentax introduced in the 1990s. In addition, the K10D could write JPEGs and two versions of RAW files (PEF, and the Adobe specification DNG).|$|R

5000|$|Increasingly, macro {{photography}} is accomplished using compact digital cameras and small-sensor bridge cameras, {{combined with a}} high <b>powered</b> <b>zoom</b> lens and (optionally) a close-up diopter lens added {{to the front of}} the camera lens. The deep depth of field of these cameras is an advantage for macro work. [...] The high pixel density and resolving power of these cameras' sensors enable them to capture very high levels of detail at a lower reproduction ratio than is needed for film or larger DSLR sensors (often at the cost of greater image noise). Despite the fact that many of these cameras come with a [...] "macro mode" [...] which does not qualify as true macro, some photographers are using the advantages of small sensor cameras to create macro images that rival or even surpass those from DSLRs.|$|R
5000|$|In general, HDSLRs use {{the full}} imager area to capture HD video, {{though not all}} pixels (causing video {{artifacts}} to some degree). Compared with the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder, the HDSLR's much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics. [...] HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low-light performance. However, the low ratio of active pixels (to total pixels) is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts (such as moire patterns) in scenes with particular textures, and CMOS rolling shutter {{tends to be more}} severe. Furthermore, due to the DSLR's optical construction, HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on standard dedicated camcorders, such as autofocus while shooting, <b>powered</b> <b>zoom,</b> and an electronic viewfinder/preview. These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point-and-shoot camcorder, instead demanding some level of planning and skill for location shooting.|$|R

Ford was the first manufacturer to produce an electric vehicle using this type of battery system when it introduced the electric Ford Ka research vehicle in 2000. Also contributing to <b>Reflex's</b> <b>power</b> and performance are unique headlamps and taillamps that integrate solar panels.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades zoom lenses {{have become an}} {{important}} type of objective. Due {{to their ability to}} dynamically change magnification or field angle they are being used in many fields of application. Most zoom lenses consist of a number of lenses or lens groups. The magnification can be changed by axial shifting some of these lens groups with a more or less complicated moving function. However, in principle {{it should be possible to}} construct zoom lenses that do not rely on the movement of some of its components. Instead, the change in magnification is achieved by changing the optical power of at least two lenses within the system (optical <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> - OPZ). Moreover, for broadband applications it is highly favorable to use mirrors instead of lenses due to the absence of chromatic aberrations. Based on a "Schiefspiegler" approach an all-reflective OPZ objective with a <b>zoom</b> <b>power</b> of three consisting of four mirrors has been designed. Two mirrors are assumed to have a variable radius of curvature for changing optical power. During aberration correction special consideration has been given to the reduction of field curvature, since the optical power change strongly influences field curvature for different zoom positions. The simulation shows adequate image quality for photographic applications over the whole zooming range. For the realization of such an OPZ objective deformable mirrors with a comparatively large stroke are needed. Before starting a complex development of such devices three setups with different fixed focal lengths were built to prove and evaluate the concept for digital imaging...|$|R
50|$|The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 is {{a digital}} camera with HD video {{recording}} capability {{that is part of}} the Micro Four Thirds System. Though commonly referred to as a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera, it has no mirror or optical viewfinder, but has instead both a fold-out LCD screen and a (somewhat higher resolution) electronic viewfinder. Recording is to a SDHC or SDXC flash memory card in AVCHD or M-JPEG format, giving up to high quality HD 1080P video at 24fps with up to 2 hours per take on the USA or Canadian versions (for the European version it's 30 minutes per take maximum due to a European tax on video cameras). The GH2 is also notable for offering 1080/50i and 60i (interlaced) recording modes (compatible with broadcasting) as well as 24p, though 25p and 30p are not supported. The Micro Four Thirds System (crop factor 2 when compared to 35 mm still) does not offer the extreme shallow-focus effects possible with full-frame cameras. Optical image stabilisation is available on Panasonic MFT <b>zoom</b> lenses, and <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> and <b>power</b> focus is available on some Panasonic X series lenses.|$|R

As a six-year-old, Corrado I was a finalist at the 1991 German Federal Championships, and he began his international career the following year under Franke Sloothaak. The qualities that made Corrado I a Nations Cup-caliber jumper - cleverness, quick <b>reflexes,</b> <b>power,</b> and speed - also made him a challenging partner. Sloothaak described the young stallion as distractible with a strong temperament, and quite difficult to ride. The pair competed on the international circuit to the World Cup level.

50|$|The GF3 boasts an {{upgraded}} processor, {{so that it}} {{can focus}} much faster than predecessor GF1 and GF2 models, even though it uses the same 12MP four thirds sensor. The GF3 focus and reaction time is on par with its more expensive Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3 sibling, but the GF3 cannot match the image quality of the newer, higher resolution 16MP G3 sensor, especially under low light conditions where higher ISO (greater than 800) speeds are used. However, even though the GF3 uses the older 12MP sensor the in camera JPEG processing has been improved for better colors and better high ISO performance when compared to the GF 2 and GF1 camera bodies. The GF3 puts small size at a premium, and when paired with a pancake lens made by either Panasonic or Olympus will make a particularly attractive purse or pocketable large sensor, interchangeable lens camera. Examples of such pancake type lenses would be the Panasonic Lumix 14mm f/2.5, the Olympus 17 mm f/2.8 or the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 pancake lenses. The newly introduced Panasonic 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 X series <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> lens is a very compact zoom lens which in storage mode is only slightly larger than the Panasonic 20mm pancake.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} measure of the power {{spectrum}} on scales from 15 to 800 Mpc/h using the ROSAT-ESO Flux-Limited X-Ray(REFLEX) galaxy cluster catalogue. The REFLEX survey provides a sample of the 452 X-ray brightest southern clusters of galaxies with the nominal flux limit S= 3. 0 10 ^- 12 erg/s/cm 2 for the ROSAT energy band (0. 1 - 2. 4) keV. Several tests are performed showing no significant incompletenesses of the REFLEX clusters with X-ray luminosities brighter than 10 ^ 43 erg/s up to scales of about 800 Mpc/h. They also indicate that cosmic variance might be more important than previous studies suggest. We regard this as a warning not to draw general cosmological conclusions from cluster samples with a size smaller than <b>REFLEX.</b> <b>Power</b> spectra, P(k), of comoving cluster number densities are estimated for flux- and volume-limited subsamples. The most important result is the detection of a broad maximum within the comoving wavenumber range 0. 022 0 data. In the range 0. 02 <k< 0. 4 h/Mpc general agreement is found between the slope of the REFLEX P(k) and those obtained with optically selected galaxies.
