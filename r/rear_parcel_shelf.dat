25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E
50|$|Dead {{spots are}} a result of the maximum {{overshoot}} requirement from above. The power delivered to the internal LF antennas has to be tuned to give best performance i.e. minimum dead spots and maximum average overshoot. Dead spots are usually near the extremities of the vehicle e.g. the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E
5000|$|April 1974: Introduction of the R5 LS, {{same as the}} R5 TL {{but with}} a larger 1.3 engine, {{different}} design steel wheels, H4 iodine headlights, electric windscreen washers, fully carpeted floor ahead of the front seats, carpeted <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> electronic rev counter, daily totalizer, two-speed ventilation system, rear wiper, and illuminated ashtray with cigarette lighter.|$|E

50|$|The Super Saloon Extra and Royal Saloon {{versions}} {{were packed}} with {{features such as}} dual-zone climate control, AM/FM cassette stereo with six acoustically matched speakers, combined with a separate rear cassette stereo with headphones, with dashboard-installed integrated CD player, and separate A/C and stereo control buttons installed in the <b>rear</b> armrest, <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> mounted refrigerator, automatic headlights, reading lamps for all outboard seating positions, electrically adjusted tilt and telescoping steering column combined with a steering wheel and seat memory feature, glovebox mounted courtesy mirror among many things, while the slightly lower trim package Super Select was more modestly equipped.|$|R
5000|$|... 6-seater version. Three rows of seats: fixed {{front bench}} seat for driver and passenger, plus four single rear seats in two rows. The rear seats could be {{individually}} folded flat to the floor, allowing for a reconfigurable cargo area with an even loading surface. With all six seats up storage space was reduced to the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b> Original price on the Italian market: 743,000 Lire.|$|E
50|$|August 1985 saw {{the arrival}} of the 1.3 City and 1.3 City X. The 1.3 City was similar to the {{previous}} 1.3 base model. The 1.3 City X added full carpeting, cloth upholstery, head restraints, a <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> a radio and a manually operated choke. These models also did without the plastic bumpers, having more conventional steel bumpers with plastic end caps similar to the Maestro van.|$|E
50|$|The Visa's <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> was in two hinged sections, {{one in the}} car, {{the other}} on the tailgate, to allow objects that were {{slightly}} too tall to still fit without removing the shelf. When carrying larger loads, the part of the shelf attached to the tailgate could be folded up, and fixed with the elasticated support strings, to protect the rear window and heated rear screen elements.|$|E
40|$|For {{almost thirty}} years bast fibers such as flax, hemp, kenaf, sisal and jute {{have been used as}} {{reinforcing}} material in the molding process of both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices. The main application areas of these natural fiber reinforced composites in Europe are limited almost exclusively to the passenger car range. Typical components are door panels, <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelves,</b> instrument boards and trunk linings. Natural fiber reinforced composites have become prevalent due to their good mechanical properties and their low production costs. The main advantage in applying natural fibers as reinforcement in composite materials is the price. Nowadays this argument becomes more and more important due to the scarcity of synthetic raw materials and consequently, their rising prices. Additionally the low density (approx. 1. 5 g/cm³) of natural fibers confers them a very good lightweight potential. Other advantageous features of natural fiber composites include very good processing and acoustic properties. Further benefits such as good life cycle assessment and easier processability compared to glass fiber material should also be taken into account. Disadvantages of natural fibers are unevenness of the fiber quality and varying fiber characteristics due to differences in soil, climate and fiber separation and their low heat resistance (at temperatures exceeding 220 °C, some fiber components start thermal degradation). Another disadvantage of natural fiber reinforced materials is that with some matrices (mostly thermoplastic polymers) a sufficient impregnation of the fibers can only be achieved if the fiber content in the composite is kept low, usually below 50 wt. -...|$|R

50|$|Designed by Opel Stylist Erhard Schnell, the Opel GT was a fastback, {{that had}} neither an {{externally}} accessible trunk nor a conventional hatchback. There was a <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> behind the seats {{that could only}} be accessed through the main doors. Behind the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> was a fold-up panel that concealed a spare tire and jack.|$|R
50|$|It {{replaced}} the ZIL-4104 in 1985 and {{had virtually no}} mechanical changes compared with that model. The only major changes {{have been in the}} styling, which in some respects, notably in the rear-view mirrors, was subtly modernised compared to the styling of previous ZIL models. The front turn indicators were also modernised, with the rectangular horizontal line giving way to a more vertically oriented, door-like shape. The front headlights were also restyled, as was the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To {{celebrate}} the occasion, Volkswagen marketed a final, special series of 3,000 Beetles marketed as [...] "Última Edición" [...] (Final Edition) in light blue (Aquarius Blue) or beige (Harvest Moon Beige). Each car included the 1.6 engine, whitewall tires, a CD player with four speakers, chrome bumpers, trim, hub caps and exterior mirrors, a Wolfsburg emblem above the front trunk's handle, chrome glove box badge, body coloured wheels, tinted glass, a <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> and VW Última Edición plaque.|$|E
50|$|The {{tailgate}} opens over six-feet {{high and}} 60/40 rear seatbacks fold {{down for a}} flat cargo area. A hard cargo cover can fit flush on the floor when not needed and is reversible to carry wet or dirty cargo. The cabin includes several storage areas including a lockable center console that can hold a standard size laptop computer. The cargo hold is small size compared to most rivals and {{does not have the}} adjustable cargo tracks or a <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Series II was {{released}} in May 1960. The most notable external difference was the hidden boot and bonnet hinges. Interior storage was improved with the fitting of a full width <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> directly beneath the fascia.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after, in February 2008, a restyled Modus and new the Grand Modus were launched. Also that year, the Grand Modus {{replaced}} the Modus in Spain. The Grand Modus has an extended length of 4034 mm and a boot volume of 410 litres (...) below the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most {{competing}} systems used {{a separate}} heating system and an engine-mounted compressor, {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft via a belt, with an evaporator in the car's trunk to deliver cold air through the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> and overhead vents. General Motors made a front-mounted air conditioning system optional in 1954 on Pontiacs with a straight-eight engine that added separate controls and air distribution. The alternative layout pioneered by Nash [...] "became established practice and continues to {{form the basis of}} the modern and more sophisticated automatic climate control systems." ...|$|E
50|$|From 2008 to 2012, {{there was}} an {{optional}} Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) sound system available. At its core there are 14 speakers which (with {{the exception of the}} aluminium high-frequency tweeters) employ B&W's Kevlar composite speaker cones. Each front door contains a 168 mm woofer, a 100 mm mid-range speaker and a 25 mm dome tweeter (the latter two wired in parallel with a crossover), while each rear door houses a similar 168 mm woofer and 25 mm tweeter. As a centre speaker there is a 100 mm full-range driver, similar to the two 100 mm full-range 'surround' speakers located on the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b> The B&W system has been reviewed by journalists at Autocar magazine, who proclaimed it the best in-car system they have ever heard.|$|E
50|$|The Corgi {{design team}} {{came up with}} the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled {{headlights}} and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with a rear view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b> At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7 million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed.|$|E
50|$|In {{its normal}} {{interior}} configuration (with the back seats {{up and the}} <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> in place) the rear cargo area does have a noticeably small opening (52 cm by 82 cm) and an elevated lip necessitating the lifting of luggage quite high {{before it can be}} placed inside. However the boot (trunk) is relatively deep and spacious. In addition the rear seats fold down and both the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> and the <b>rear</b> divider panel (usually in place behind the back seats) can be completely removed, in essence turning the entire rear half of the car into a cargo area. As such the Toyota Sera has a large amount of available storage space for its size. The space-saving spare tire and changing kit are contained in a small compartment below the boot floor.|$|R
5000|$|Magna+ (0.8L) - Front {{and rear}} speaker grille, utility options like <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> tray, driver side central locking, 2 DIN Radio/CD/MP3 Audio with two {{speakers}} in front, USB port, auxiliary-in port and a digital clock and optional driver airbag.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{variation}} of the luxurious 250 GT, the 250 GT Lusso had a spacious interior, made possible by the forward position of the engine; this was an unusual design choice at the time for Ferrari, known for their sports cars which emphasized even front/rear weight distribution. [...] As the car was only a two-seater, there was a fairly capacious boot space with a <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> covered in quilted leather.|$|R
5000|$|This weight {{reduction}} {{was achieved}} by removing the spare wheel, rear counterweight, <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> and rear seats, and the standard fitment air conditioning. The main battery was also relocated {{to the rear of}} the vehicle in order to maintain weight distribution as much as possible. Lightweight fixed-back Recaro bucket seats graced the interior. Distinguishable from other TT Coupés by its two-tone paint scheme (Phantom Black pearl painted roof, pillars and mirror housings, in combination with either Avus Silver, Phantom Black, Mauritius Blue or Misano Red body colour) and unique 18" [...] 15-spoke cast aluminium alloy wheels, plus the same body kit as fitted to the TT 3.2 V6, the TT quattro Sport also featured black exhaust tailpipes and uprated suspension settings and new wheels, ½" [...] wider at the rear for improved handling. The brochure stated V6-spec brakes were to be fitted, however models delivered in the UK came with the standard 225 spec brake callipers which were red-painted.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of the convertible version of the TR7 required the interior light, {{which was in the}} headlining, to be removed. This was replaced by lights with integral switches in each of the door cards. A map light, mounted between the seats on the back panel below the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> was deleted. The convertible also required a smaller fuel filler cap, as the deck area in front of the boot lid was reduced to allow for the stowage of the hood. These modifications were also applied to the hard top for the 1978 year model (starting after the factory's summer shutdown in 1977), presumably to maintain commonality of parts on the assembly line. The wheel trims were also changed at this time, from smaller black trims that covered only the centre of the wheels, to larger silver ones, covering the whole wheel. However, {{only a small number of}} 1978 year model cars, with the smaller filler cap and lights in the door cards, were produced at Speke, due to the industrial action there in 1977-78.|$|E
5000|$|The Twingo I {{electronic}} centrally-mounted {{instrument panel}} had a speedometer, fuel gauge, clock, odometer and trip recorder controlled via a stalk-located button. A strip of warning lights was located behind the steering wheel. The rear seat featured a sliding mechanism to enable either increased boot space or rear seat legroom. The boot <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> {{was attached to}} the inside of the tailgate and lifted with the tailgate [...] - [...] or could clip back against the rear window when not required.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 {{introduced}} an extensive exterior redesign {{which included a}} longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The [...] 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over — even the luggage compartment was over [...] larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors—all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the Bose compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, {{and a set of}} four reversible carpeted floor mats.|$|R
50|$|Hatchbacks may be {{described}} as three-door (two entry doors and the hatch) or five-door (four entry doors and the hatch) cars. A model range may include multiple configurations, as with the 2001-2007 Ford Focus which offered sedan (ZX4), wagon (ZXW), and three or five-door hatchback (ZX3 and ZX5) models. The models typically share a platform, drivetrain and bodywork forward of the A-pillar. Hatchbacks may have a removable rigid <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> liftable with the tailgate, or flexible roll-up tonneau cover to cover the cargo space behind the rear seats.|$|R
5000|$|One major {{internal}} option came in {{the form}} of an advanced car audio system known as the Super Live Surround Sound or SLSS. The SLSS comprised a total of 10 speakers; 3 x 10 cm tweeters in the front console (left, right and centre), 2 x 10 cm door-mounted cones (left and right), 2 x tweeters and 2 x cones contained in a single, tube shaped unit mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> and a boot fitted 'Acoustic Resonance Woofer' (subwoofer). The SLSS came with a three mode Digital Sound Processor (DSP) which cycled through 'off', 'Casual' or 'Funky' mode by use of a button labelled [...] "WARP" [...] on the CD/Radio or CD/Radio/Cassette head unit. These produced slight differences in sound quality through preset values for settings such as bass and treble, as well as rotating the speakers in the rear unit to either project directly into the car or bounce off the rear window. A complete and functional SLSS is one of the most highly sought after options by Toyota Sera enthusiasts, but by being factory fit is quite hard to retro-fit.|$|E
5000|$|These safety {{features}} were all newly introduced passenger-car [...] "firsts" [...] on a production vehicle: padded door trim around the windows, heavily padded steering wheel (later {{to be replaced}} by an airbag with the Mercedes-Benz abbreviation of SRS standing for the English-language term Supplemental Restraint System), more comprehensive safety padding on the dashboard and around the interior, dual asymmetric windshield wipers, headrests with a center depression to locate the occupant's head in a more central position during a rear impact, a rain-water management system to improve visibility consisting of deep channels {{on both sides of the}} windshield and flowing into deeply channeled rain gutters, including similar designs on the side mirrors, rounded body shapes along the edges, such as the tops of the front fenders, etc., designed to ameliorate pedestrian injuries, ribbed rear taillamp lenses which would remain clearer of dirt on the recessed areas, an easy-to-access first aid kit stowed in a recessed compartment on the <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> prominently labeled with the universally recognized [...] "cross" [...] symbol which represents [...] "first aid", and several other subtle {{safety features}} related to both active and passive safety. The Mercedes Benz S-Class is a classic chauffeur driven car, and has frequently been used as standard by car hire companies. It is comfortable and safe as well as elegant looking; ideal for drives across the countryside or high class transport on a night out.|$|E
5000|$|A PA {{tested by}} the British {{magazine}} The Motor in 1958 had {{a top speed of}} 89.8 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 16.8 seconds. A petrol consumption of 25.2 mpgimp was recorded. The test car cost £1073 including taxes of £358. They tested the 2.6 Litre version with overdrive in 1960 and found the top speed had increased to 94.7 mph, acceleration from 0-60 mph to 15.2 seconds and fuel consumption improved to 26.8 mpgimp. The test car cost £1077 including taxes of £317. The car without overdrive cost £1014.In August 1959 the Cresta was given a facelift, with a new, larger, grille and the replacement of the three piece rear window with a single wrap around screen. The previous ribbed roof panel was replaced with a smoothly contoured version (with structural revisions to the C pillars and <b>rear</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> area to retain structural strength). The Vauxhall flutes on the front wings finally disappeared, replaced by a straight chrome side moulding which was also the division point for the two tone colour scheme. Further changes came in August 1960 with the introduction of a new engine of square dimensions (bore and stroke were both 82.55mm) with a redesigned, longer, cylinder block and a capacity of 2651cc. A further increase in compression ratio to 8.0:1 and larger valves in wedge shaped combustion chambers contributed to a power output of 95bhp at 4,600rpm. Increased diameter wheels allowed larger brakes to be fitted, but these were still of the drum type (Ford had introduced front disc brakes as an option on the rival Zephyr/Zodiac models in September 1960 and would make them standard in June 1961). Externally, there was a redesign of the rear lights, with shallower units replacing the elongated oval ones of the previous versions. The direction indicators, previously in the rear tail fins were now incorporated in the main lamp unit and the fins were now solid with a V for Vauxhall badge. The rear bumper was now a higher mounted straight topped design. The front sidelights and direction indicators, previously separate were now in a combined housing and there were redesigned wheel trims and hub caps. Inside, a redesigned fascia with a padded top and a horizontal speedometer was featured. In October 1961 the final updates to the PA series were made. Front disc brakes became an optional extra (four months after Ford had made them standard on the Zephyr/Zodiac). Separate front seats became an option to the standard bench and there was now wood trim to the fascia and door cappings. The PA Cresta continued in production in this form until replaced by the PB series in October 1962. During the 1970s many PA Crestas were modified and customised. The model was very popular with fifties revivalists; many were driven by teddy boys and were very much seen as part of the rock 'n' roll image. A 1960 PA Cresta features in the 1981 video for [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials, in which the band are wearing '50s-style clothing.|$|E
50|$|In {{structure}} the MGB was an innovative, modern design in 1962, utilizing a monocoque structure {{instead of the}} traditional body-on-frame construction used on both the MGA and MG T-types and the MGB's rival, the Triumph TR series. However components such as brakes and suspension were developments of the earlier 1955 MGA with the B-Series engine having its origins in 1947. The lightweight design reduced manufacturing costs while adding to overall vehicle strength. Wind-up windows were standard, and a comfortable driver's compartment offered plenty of legroom. A <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> was fitted behind the seats.|$|R
50|$|The series two Horizon {{launched}} in July 1982 had a 5 speed gearbox, and badged series II 5 speed. The bumpers were painted {{black and the}} rear windscreen was smaller, because the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> was raised to {{increase the size of}} the boot. Some models had an electronic LED 'econometer' which lit up several lights {{around the edge of the}} speedometer dial, There was also an LED tachometer on top of the range models which was a row of green,yellow and red LEDs and was positioned atop the steering column.|$|R
50|$|In October 1976, a {{year after}} introduction, a new de luxe version of the Kitten, branded as the Kitten DL, was announced. Improvements {{included}} revised springs and dampers and a changed anti-roll bar but mainly the DL model was an uprated interior improvement packaged which included more comfortable seats which reclined & tilted, modified door trims incorporating a map pocket made of coloured vinyl, a <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> volt meter & oil pressure gauge, radio with twin speakers, chrome hubcaps with chrome surrounds, extra additional carpet, front and rear fog lights {{and in some cases}} rear reversing lights.|$|R
