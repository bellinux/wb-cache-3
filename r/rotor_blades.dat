5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> {{are constructed}} from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> {{is derived from the}} BERP <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Mk1's metal <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> with aluminium and glass fibre composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B.

40|$|AbstractThe {{compatibility}} {{between a}} composite beam cross-sectional analysis {{based on the}} variational asymptotic approach, and a helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model {{which is part of}} a comprehensive rotorcraft analysis code is examined. It was found that the finite element cross-sectional analysis code VABS can be combined with a moderate deflection <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model in spite {{of the differences between the}} formulations. The new YF/VABS <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model accounts for arbitrary cross-sectional warping, in-plane stresses, and moderate deflections. The YF/VABS composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model was validated against experimental data and various <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> analyses by examining displacements and stresses under static loads, as well as aeroelastic stability of a composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> in hover, and forward flight vibratory hubloads of a four <b>bladed</b> composite <b>rotor...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vane-wake {{unsteady}} {{characteristics and}} its effects on <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> leading-edge were investigated with SST k-ω turbulence model in this paper. Conditions of different rotated speed (500 rpm, 1000 rpm, and 2000 rpm), <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> surface static pressure and heat transfer coefficient distributions were obtained from spectrum analysis of rotor surface lift and drag coefficient under corresponding conditions. Results show that: Along with the increase of speed, wake vortex shedding frequency and energy entropy around <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> flow field increase, which leads to relatively high energy loss; pressure surface of <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> static pressure reduces with increasing speed, whereas, suction surface static pressure increases, and overall heat transfer performance of <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> surface increases...|$|R
5|$|Several {{models have}} been derived from both AH-64A and AH-64D for export. The British-built AgustaWestland Apache (assembled from kits {{purchased}} from Boeing) {{is based on the}} AH-64D Block I with several different systems, including more powerful engines, folding <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> and other modifications for operation from Royal Navy vessels.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, after Operation Desert Storm, the AH-64B was a {{proposed}} upgrade to 254 AH-64As. The upgrade would have included new <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. Congress approved $82M {{to begin the}} Apache B upgrade. The B program was canceled in 1992. The radio, navigation, and GPS modifications, were later installed on most A-model Apaches through other upgrades.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's next {{generation}} Chinook, the CH-47D, entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, redundant and improved electrical systems, an advanced {{flight control system}} (FCS) and improved avionics. The RAF returned their original Mk1s to Boeing for upgrading to CH-47D standard, {{the first of which}} returned to the UK in 1993.|$|E
40|$|A {{drive system}} for a {{variable}} diameter rotor (VDR) system includes a plurality of <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> assemblies with inner and outer <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> segments. The outer blade segment being telescopically mounted to the inner blade segment. The VDR retraction/extension system includes a drive housing mounted {{at the root of}} each blade. The housing supports a spool assembly, a harmonic gear set and an electric motor. The spool assembly includes a pair of counter rotating spools each of which drive a respective cable which extends through the interior of the inboard <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> section and around a pulley mounted to the outboard <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> section. In operation, the electric motor drives the harmonic gear set which rotates the counter rotating spools. Rotation of the spools causes the cables to be wound onto or off their respective spool consequently effecting retraction/extension of the pulley and the attached outboard <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> section relative the inboard <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> section. As each blade drive system is independently driven by a separate electrical motor, each independent VDR blade assembly is independently positionable...|$|R

40|$|In the helicopter, {{the main}} <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> is mostly {{influenced}} by the aerodynamic forces and centrifugal forces during rotation. In this project both aerodynamic and centrifugal forces are considered for analysis. Dynamic analysis is performed and mainly aimed at calculating the vibrations and controlling them. The main objective is to perform modal analysis and calculate natural frequencies of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> Later on perform harmonic analysis to plot the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> response at these natural frequencies due to operational load. There by checking for resonance and avoiding it, will reduce vibrations on helicopter. NX-CAD software is {{used to create a}} 3 D model of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> This 3 D model is converted into parasolid and imported into Ansys to perform finite element analysis.

5|$|On 15 May 2003, AgustaWestland {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Bell Helicopter to undertake final assembly of the US101 in the U.S. Under the pact, AgustaWestland would produce the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> and main fuselage sections at its Yeovil, UK, facility. The company would also manufacture other components, including the gearbox, at its Cascina Costa, Italy facility; this represents a work share of 36 per cent. The remaining 64 per cent work share was split between Lockheed Martin (31 per cent) and Bell Helicopter (27 per cent) and other firms (6 per cent).|$|E
5|$|In 1982, India {{signed a}} {{contract}} to purchase several Mk42B Sea Kings, an upgraded variant to perform dual-purpose: anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions, following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma. These helicopters would operate from the Godavari-class frigates as well as replace the existing Sea Kings. A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B's avionics, especially the onboard software. Changes from the older Sea Kings included a brand new avionics suite, the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> {{as well as the}} integration of the Sea Eagle missile, which had been procured from Britain in 1983. Between 1988 and 1992, a total of 20 Mk42B Sea Kings were delivered to the Indian Navy.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Air Force ordered five Sea King Mk.48s {{to perform}} Search and Rescue {{missions}} in 1974, which entered service in 1976. They were upgraded with new <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> in 1987–1988, and with revised avionics, including new radar and provision of a FLIR turret under the nose from 1995. In 2007 Belgium ordered eight NH90 helicopters in 2007, of which four were navalised NFH helicopters intended {{to replace the}} Sea Kings in the SAR role. Delays in delivery of Belgium's NH90s, together with an increased demand for on the NH90s to operate from the Belgian Navy's frigates, {{has resulted in the}} retirement date for the Sea Kings being pushed back to at least 2018. Three Sea Kings remain operational as of 2017. Belgian Sea Kings had been carried out over 3300 SAR sorties by the end of 2016, with over 1750 lives saved.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} was performed using the rotating hot-wire technique within the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> passage and the stationary hot-wire technique for the exitflow of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> passage. The measurements reveal {{the effect of}} rotation and subsequent flow interactions upon the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> flowfield and wake development in the annulus-wall region. The flow near the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> tips {{is found to be}} highly complex due to the interaction of the annulus-wall boundary layer, the blade boundary layers, the tip leakage flow, and the secondary flow. Within the blade passage, this interaction results in an appreciable radial inward flow as well as a defect in the mainstream velocity near the mid-passage. Turbulence levels within this region are very high. This indicates a considerable extent of flow mixing due to the viscous flow interactions. The size and strength of this loss core is found to grow with axial distance from the blade trailing edge. The nature of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> exit-flow was dominated by the wake development...|$|R

5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs.

40|$|An {{important}} {{consideration in the}} development of modern helicopters is the vibratory response of the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> One way to minimize vibration levels is to ensure that natural frequencies of the spinning main <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> are well removed from integer multiples of the rotor speed. A technique for dynamically tuning a finite-element model of a <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> to accomplish that end is demonstrated. A brief overview is given of the general purpose finite element system known as Engineering Analysis Language (EAL) which was used in this work.

25|$|The {{effect is}} a {{consequence}} of sand hitting helicopter rotors in sandy environments. Abrasion strips on helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are made of metal, often titanium or nickel, which are very hard, but less hard than sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand striking the rotor blade can cause erosion.
