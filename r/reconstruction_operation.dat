50|$|Despite Brentford's strong form, Lee {{began the}} 2012-13 season out injured {{and due to}} the form of Simon Moore, he made just six appearances. He signed a new one-year {{contract}} extension in December 2012 and underwent a shoulder <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation</b> in March 2013, which would {{keep him out of}} first team action for six months. He made just five appearances during Brentford's promotion-winning 2013-14 season and spent much of the season as backup to new signing David Button. though he won a promotion medal by virtue of being a substitute {{on the final day of}} the season versus Stevenage. He signed a new one-year contract extension in February 2014, but after just one appearance in the first month of the 2014-15 season, he made the decision to retire in May 2015. Lee's persistent shoulder injury could be traced back to the ruptured biceps he suffered in 2005 and he admitted in 2011 that playing through injuries had caused lasting damage. Lee spent the 2014-15 season as third-choice goalkeeper behind David Button and Jack Bonham and after falling to fourth-choice behind Development Squad goalkeeper Mark Smith, he departed on loan in late March 2015. At the 2014-15 end-of-season awards dinner, Lee was presented with a long-service award for his five seasons at the club. He made 87 appearances during his time at Griffin Park.|$|E
5000|$|Direct to Implant ("One-Step") Breast Reconstruction Post-mastectomy {{reconstruction}} with {{a direct}} to implant, or [...] "one-step" [...] approach {{allows for a}} single-stage reconstruction of the breast mound in select patients. This approach is best suited for patients with good preservation of the breast skin after mastectomy. A permanent implant is inserted immediately following the mastectomy, forgoing the initial placement of a tissue expander and subsequent expansion process. At {{the time of the}} initial post mastectomy <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation,</b> the implant is positioned on the chest wall behind the pectoralis major muscle. Today, {{with the use of a}} dermal matrix (such as AlloDerm®), the surgeon can frequently use a permanent implant of the desired definitive volume during the initial surgery, provided the amount and quality of the breast skin remaining after mastectomy can accommodate the volume. The patient will have the definitive breast volume and approximate shape after the first operation. Depending on the quality of the result after allowing the initial reconstruction to settle and heal for a few months, a second stage reconstruction creating a more refined breast shape may still be desirable. This is an outpatient procedure that involves minor refinements in contour and symmetry potentially without exchanging the implant. The initial implant placement, and possible second stage, each take about one hour in the operating room.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{retrospective}} study concerning patients presenting with patella instability, treated using a Roux-Elmslie-Trillat <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation</b> and followed up for 10 years following surgery, is presented. Methods Pre-operative and follow-up radiographic evaluation included the weight-bearing anteroposterior and merchant views. Evaluation {{was carried out}} using the Insall-Salvati index, sulcus and congruence angle. The Roux-Elmslie-Trillat <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation</b> was performed on 18 patients. The clinical evaluation at follow-up was performed using the Knee-Society-Score (KSS) and Tegner-Score. Results Subjective results of the operation were classed as excellent or good in 16 of the 18 patients ten years after surgery; persistent instability of the patella was recorded in {{only one of the}} 18 patients. The majority of patients returned to the same level of sporting activity after surgery as they had participated in before injury. Conclusions The Roux-Elmslie-Trillat procedure could be recommended in cases presenting with an increased q-angle, trochlea dysplasia or failed soft tissue surgery. In the present study the majority of patients report a return to previous sporting activity ten years after surgery. </p...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{description}} coding {{has been}} shown to provide improved error resiliency for video streaming over error-prone channels. In a typical multiple description codec, the decoder simply reproduces the signal using the received description(s). The optimal reconstruction is obtained from the available description {{in the sense that the}} mean squared error is minimized. However, this <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation</b> does not consider the unique spatial and temporal properties underlying a video signal. In this paper, we propose a joint multiple description transform coding and statistical error concealment algorithm that adopts a maximum a posteriori estimation approach to compensate for the loss of descriptions. Our method considers not only the correlation between descriptions but also the spatial/temporal redundancy in video signals. Simulation results with several video sequences show that the proposed algorithm results in significant visual improvements over a conventional multiple description transform decoder...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new reconstruction operator {{to be used}} in a super-resolution scheme. Here, by reconstruction in super-resolution, we mean the back-projection operation, i. e. the way K low resolution (LR) images are aggregated to obtain a smooth high resolution (HR) image. Within this method, we replace the usual reconstruction procedure by a non-additive <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation</b> based on the nice properties of fuzzy partitions. This non-additive reconstruction operator re{{presents a}} convex family of usual additive reconstruction operators. The obtained reconstructed image is thus a convex family of usual reconstructed images. It allows the super-resolution method to be less sensitive to the choice of the reconstruction method. To make the reading of this method easier, it is presented with 1 D signals. We present some experiments to illustrate the proved properties of this new operator...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{question}} whether phrasal comparatives {{should be given a}} direct interpretation, or require an analysis as elliptic constructions, and answer it with Yes and No. The most adequate analysis of wide reading attributive (WRA) comparatives seems to be as cases of ellipsis, while a direct (but asymmetric) analysis fits the data for narrow scope attributive comparatives. The question whether it is a syntactic or a semantic process which provides the missing linguistic material in the complement of WRA comparatives is also given a complex answer: Linguistic context is accessed by combining a <b>reconstruction</b> <b>operation</b> and a mechanism of anaphoric reference. The analysis makes only few and straightforward syntactic assumptions. In part, this is made possible because the use of Generalized Functional Application as a semantic operation allows us to model semantic composition in a flexible way.
