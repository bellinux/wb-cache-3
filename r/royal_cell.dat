60|$|There {{is no room}} to {{tell how}} the {{experienced}} Melissa found a far-off frame so messed and mishandled by abandoned cell-building experiments that, for very shame, the bees never went there. How in that ruin she blocked out a <b>Royal</b> <b>Cell</b> of sound wax, but disguised by rubbish till {{it looked like a}} kopje among deserted kopjes. How she prevailed upon the hopeless Queen to make one last effort and lay a worthy egg. How the Queen obeyed and died. How her spent carcass was flung out on the rubbish heap, and how a multitude of laying sisters went about dropping drone-eggs where they listed, and said there was no more need of Queens. How, covered by this confusion, Sacharissa educated certain young bees to educate certain new-born bees in the almost lost art of making Royal Jelly. How the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill winds. How the hidden egg hatched true--no drone, but Blood Royal. How it was capped, and how desperately they worked to feed and double-feed the now swarming Oddities, lest any break in the food-supplies should set them to instituting inquiries, which, with songs about work, was their favourite amusement. How in an auspicious hour, on a moonless night, the Princess came forth a Princess indeed, and how Melissa smuggled her into a dark empty honey-magazine, to bide her time; and how the drones, knowing she was there, went about singing the deep disreputable love-songs of the old days--to the scandal of the laying sisters, who do not think well of drones. These things are, written in the Book of Queens, which is laid up in the hollow of the Great Ash Ygdrasil.|$|E
50|$|Termites swarm {{in order}} to reproduce. This is when large groups of the termite gather in a {{specific}} location to mate, before going separate ways to establish colonies. The alate group engages in the swarming behavior. The alate group swarms in late September through November in Southern California. On warmer days, the termites will swarm earlier in the day. Swarming occurs on days with temperatures between 26.7-37.8 °C (80 to 100 °F). The alates emerge from inside the wood nest, and as they reach the outside they will take off. The alates {{are not able to}} fly well, and therefore do not move far from their emergence point. When they land, they remove their wings and crawl around (wingless) to find a mate. Once a mate is found they engage in courtship activity. In finding a mate, the females crawl with the male behind. Once the female accepts the male they are now mated for life, and are now the king and the queen. In order to begin a colony, the male and female have to find a piece of wood with a hole in it, which they will enter and create a <b>royal</b> <b>cell.</b> This whole process can take three to four days. When they are done excavating they have to plug the hole with gut contents.|$|E
50|$|One theory {{stipulates}} that female larvae {{have the potential}} of following diverse pathways in development. Workers build <b>royal</b> <b>cells</b> for queen, but queens may also emerge from normal cells where males and workers emerge from. The queens in <b>royal</b> <b>cells</b> contain more food for the larvae, while the normal cells do not. In the normal cells, the larvae ingest less food and are therefore of smaller size and labeled as “miniature” or “dwarf” queens.|$|R
50|$|Queens {{are rare}} among a brood since only one mated queen {{is needed for}} each hive. An {{estimated}} 0.2% of a brood {{is made up of}} queens and this rate does not vary with the seasons. Queens are raised in the largest <b>cells,</b> known as <b>royal</b> <b>cells,</b> which are built {{on the edge of a}} comb.|$|R
5000|$|Caste {{determination}} in stingless bees {{is still}} not fully understood. There are two main theories of determination, {{and there is not}} enough conclusive data to establish which one is correct for M. scutellaris. One theory stipulates that female larvae have the potential of following diverse pathways in development. Workers build <b>royal</b> <b>cells</b> for queens, but queens may also emerge from normal cells where males and workers emerge from. <b>Royal</b> <b>cells</b> contain more food for the larvae, while the normal cells do not. In the normal cells, the larvae ingest less food and are therefore of smaller size and labeled as [...] "miniature" [...] or [...] "virgin" [...] queens. The other theory formulates that during development, female larvae have the decision of becoming a worker or a queen and therefore have the power of self-determination. The miniature queens would still gain a higher pay-off being a small queen rather than a worker. They then have the potential to be selected by the workers as the next queen when the active queen dies.|$|R
50|$|Singly mated queens of the P.subnuda {{will lay}} eggs within the <b>royal</b> <b>cells</b> and will lay a {{separate}} egg in each cell {{which has been}} supplied with food. Minutes before the queen lays her egg, the workers will regurgitate their food into the cell. The queen will lay her egg {{on top of this}} food and then the cell will be closed rapidly by the workers. Workers have mechanisms to disrupt this process and reproduce male progeny.|$|R
50|$|Caste {{determination}} in stingless bees is more variable than {{in honey}} bees. In Melipona, queens may be reared in both <b>royal</b> <b>cells</b> and small cells. Ones reared in small cells {{are smaller than}} normal queens, since they emerge from brood cells in which normally only workers and males are reared. Just like normal queens, miniature queens can successfully mate and head colonies. Queens and workers are produced in identically sized cells, and are typically produced in great excess of colony needs.|$|R
50|$|Nannotrigona testaceicornis {{have low}} {{investments}} in queens {{similar to those}} of species that rear their queens only in <b>royal</b> <b>cells.</b> The production of miniature queens {{can be explained by the}} caste conflict hypothesis. It assumes that selfish females reared in normal-sized cells become queens, instead of workers, because they have direct benefits in reproduction. If the mated queen dies during reproductive diapause, there are new queens in the nest available to be selected by workers. The selected miniature queen can mate and replace the dead one, assuring the future of the colony.|$|R
50|$|Like honey bees, stingless bees form perennial, swarm-founded colonies. M. scutellaris colonies {{typically}} contain around 1500 {{workers and}} are {{headed by a}} single, once-mated queen. Workers, gynes, and males are reared individually in similar-sized cells filled with larval food and are sealed by workers immediately after an egg is laid. In Melipona, queens may be reared in both <b>royal</b> <b>cells</b> and small cells. Queens reared in small cells, referred to as virgin queens, are smaller than normal queens because they emerge from brood cells in which normally only workers and males are reared. Just like normal queens, virgin queens can successfully mate and head colonies. Virgin queens and workers are produced in identically sized cells, and are typically produced in great excess of colony needs.|$|R
40|$|Some stingless {{bees are}} known to produce both large queens, reared from larger <b>royal</b> <b>cells,</b> and small "{{miniature}}" queens, reared from worker cells. Here we review {{what is known about}} miniature queens, and evaluate some major evolutionary hypotheses as to why they are produced. One hypothesis - that miniature queens are females who selfishly evade an intended worker fate - is shown to receive significant support. In particular, there is increasing evidence that the decision to become a miniature queen may be under genetic control of the developing females themselves. In addition, data from several species show that females gain significant fitness benefits from doing so, since miniature queens are frequently observed heading colonies and often are as productive as normal-sized queens. On the other hand, in some species miniature queens have a reduced fecundity or may have lower chances of being chosen as a new queen. This shows that the strategy may also have costs. Queens of the genus Melipona, which are also reared from worker-sized cells, are suggested to have the same evolutionary origins as miniature queens. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In {{one study}} {{it was shown}} that in 37 broods from five colonies of P. remota, 26.52% of the {{individuals}} or 2966 bees were male. Of the 2966 males, only {{two of them were}} produced in <b>royal</b> <b>cells.</b> Not all the samples in the experiment had males in the combs. 18.92% of the samples had no males. Out of the samples that contained males, 16.22% of the combs had males make up over half the population of individuals. This study also showed that brood combs collected in June and October 2003 showed the lowest frequency of males. It was shown in this study {{that there was a lot}} of variation in male production and male frequency in combs. In P. remota, as well as in other Melipona species, there are certain periods of time where there are more males produced. These periods are called male-producing periods. These periods are normally short and not synchronous with other colonies since each colony has their own schedule for when they reproduce. Also in P. remota most of the males born in the colony were produced only by the queen even though the workers are just as capable of producing males. It was also observed that in combs with lots of males, there was a lower percentage of workers indicating that when many males are produced, investment in workers decrease.|$|R

50|$|Queens are not genetically {{determined}} so {{any young}} female larva can become either a worker or a queen. In {{order to create}} a queen <b>cell,</b> <b>royal</b> jelly must be placed on the female larva. In cases of an unexpected loss of a queen, royal jelly can be applied to any female worker to create a new emergency queen. Although emergency queen rearing is possible, most often, the loss of a queen results in the dispersal of a colony. If a queen becomes separated from her hive, the workers will leave the nest to search for her. Finding and joining a queen is an innate response for workers. The workers' strong attraction to queens is seen when a queen is lost, after a hive disruption by a predator, and during colony migration.|$|R
