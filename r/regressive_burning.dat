40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a {{solid propellant rocket engine}} with a controlled rate of thrust buildup to a desired thrust level are discussed. The engine uses a <b>regressive</b> <b>burning</b> controlled flow solid propellant igniter and a progressive burning main solid propellant charge. The igniter is capable of operating in a vacuum and sustains the burning of the propellant below its normal combustion limit until the burning propellant surface and combustion chamber pressure have increased sufficiently to provide a stable chamber pressure...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a solid-propellant rocket igniter system that would build up thrust at a controlled rate of less than 0. 2 G/sec. The system consisted of a long burning, <b>regressive</b> <b>burning,</b> controlled flow igniter and an inhibited progressive burning surface in the main rocket motor. The igniter performed the dual role of igniting, under vacuum backpressure and low L* (motor free volume/nozzle throat area ratio) conditions, the nonrestricted portion of the propellant and providing the mass addition necessary to sustain combustion until the propellant burning area had increased sufficiently to provide a stable motor-chamber pressure. Two series of tests were conducted with existing small test motor hardware to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, (2) determine the important parameters governing the system, and (3) obtain design guidelines for future scaled-up motor tests. A quasi-steady-state mass balance for the ignition system was written and programmed for use as a motor design tool...|$|E
40|$|A {{particle}} swarm/pattern search hybrid optimizer {{was used}} to drive a solid rocket motor modeling code to an optimal solution. The solid motor code models tapered motor geometries using analytical burn back methods by slicing the grain into thin sections along the axial direction. Grains with circular perforated stars, wagon wheels, and dog bones can be considered and multiple tapered sections can be constructed. The hybrid approach to optimization is capable of exploring {{large areas of the}} solution space through particle swarming, but is also able to climb “hills” of optimality through gradient based pattern searching. A preliminary method for designing tapered internal geometry as well as tapered outer mold-line geometry is presented. A total of four optimization cases were performed. The first two case studies examines designing motors to match a given regressive-progressive-regressive burn profile. The third case study studies designing a neutrally burning right circular perforated grain (utilizing inner and external geometry tapering). The final case study studies designing a linearly <b>regressive</b> <b>burning</b> profile for right circular perforated (tapered) grains...|$|E
40|$|A {{miniature}} {{solid propellant}} rocket motor has been developed {{to be used in}} a program to determine those parameters which must be duplicated in a cold gas flow to produce aerodynamic effects on an experimental model similar to those produced by hot, particle-laden exhaust plumes. Phenomena encountered during the testing of the miniature solid propellant motors included erosive propellant burning caused by high flow velocities parallel to the propellant surface, <b>regressive</b> propellant <b>burning</b> as a result of exposed propellant edges, the deposition of aluminum oxide on the nozzle surfaces sufficient to cause aerodynamic nozzle throat geometry changes, and thermal erosion of the nozzle throat at high chamber pressures. A series of tests was conducted to establish the stability of the rocket chamber pressure and the repeatibility of test conditions. Data are presented which define the tests selected to represent the final test matrix. Qualitative observations are also presented concerning the phenomena experienced {{based on the results of}} a large number or rocket tests not directly applicable to the final test matrix...|$|R
