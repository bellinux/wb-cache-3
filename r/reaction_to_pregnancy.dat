40|$|This anthropological {{thesis is}} based on an {{evaluation}} carried out at South Cleveland Hospital on Teesside, where midwives offer counselling to bereaved parents following pregnancy loss. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies are utilised in the form of individual case studies, patient focus groups, and a standardised questionnaire distributed to medical professionals. The purpose of the evaluation is to ascertain the efficiency and efficacy of the service, the advantages or disadvantages of the service being administered by midwife/counsellors, and how any subsequent service might be improved upon. Given the fact that pregnancy loss was considered linguistically taboo until only a few years ago, the anthropological interest in the study examines the shift in emotional <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy</b> loss in western culture and the role of counselling in grief management following a loss. The work draws upon the expertise of several authors who have written on the issues concerning historical and cross cultural characteristics of pregnancy loss, the therapeutics of counselling in grief management, embodiment, narrative theory, performance, and the use of ritual in the creation of new social and cultural practices. It is concluded from the study that counselling is a ritual of post-modern times, the efficacy of which might depend upon clients' opportunity to 'perform' a ritual of any kind, rather than on the qualities inherent in a specific ritual such as counselling or headhunting, in accordance with Rosaldo (1993; 4 - 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{wide variety}} of psychosocial {{variables}} have been implicated in the onset and recovery from postnatal depression. A number of these factors were examined on {{a representative sample of}} pregnant Maltese women attending St Luke's Hospital. Method: A random sample of 239 pregnant women were interviewed at booking using a detailed sociodemographic history, the Revised Version of the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) and Maltese translation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The CIS-R was again administered over the phone at 36 weeks and the EPDS sent by post. At eight weeks postpartum, the CIS-R, modified version of the Social Maladjustment Schedule and the EPDS were again administered to 95. 8 % of women. Results: Onset of depression in the postpartum was not predicted by depressive symptomatology during pregnancy, marital status, level of education, planning of pregnancy, woman's, partner's or family's <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and marital adjustment. However being primiparous and employed during pregnancy were significantly associated with postnatal depression. In contrast, depressed women who remained depressed postnatally had a past personal psychiatry history and significantly higher scores on the CISR recorded at 36 weeks gestation. Limitation: The number of women examined in the study yielded a small number of depressed women, for which the results are limited in value. The sample is that of Maltese women booking in at the antenatal clinic, thus excluding women who present late, close to delivery date. The follow up period was limited to eight weeks postpartum only, excluding those who develop depressive episodes after 8 weeks. Conclusions: Some cases of postpartum depression may be traced back to pregnancy while others {{do not seem to be}} predictable during pregnancy further contributing evidence to the view that the prenatal period may be a separate entity from the postnatal period with regards to depressive illness...|$|E
40|$|The kidneys play {{a pivotal}} role in the {{adaptive}} physiology of the pregnant woman, presenting some changes at term similar to the changes found in preeclampsia – a state of increased risk of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The aim of these investigations was to explore possible similarities in blood pressure regulation, renal function and structure in normal term and preeclamptic pregnancy, to ascertain whether both conditions in fact are different degrees of an adaptive process in <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Blood pressure changes were studied in 600 normal pregnancies and in 166 women through their first three pregnancies, revealing an influence of gestational age, ethnicity, parity, baseline BMI and smoking habits - factors similar to known risk factors for preeclampsia. Renal functional changes were studied in 48 pregnant and 12 non-pregnant women, revealing a size- and/or charge-dependant alteration in the filtration process in pregnant women at term compared to non-pregnant women, the glomerular filtration further impaired in preeclampsia. Renal structural changes were studied in 36 hypertensive pregnant women and 12 healthy term pregnant women, and the typical preeclamptic lesion, glomerular endotheliosis, was found not only in all hypertensive patients but also in seven of the twelve controls. Clinically undetected renal disease was not diagnosed in any of the women, leaving very few clinical indications for the renal biopsy in pregnancy. This opinion could be underscored by the findings that cystatin C levels in pregnancy, not only reliably reflected the glomerular filtration rate, but also correlated significantly with estimated glomerular volume and the degree of endotheliosis. Serum cystatin C consequently seemed to closely reflect the renal functional and structural changes, which are believed to lead to increased blood pressure levels and urinary excretion of albumin, and may thus function as a marker for the stage of the transition between normal adaptive renal changes at term and preeclampsia...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores sexual {{decision}} making in relation to early parenthood amongst black and minority ethnic (BME) young parents in England. It is based on research funded by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit (formerly in the Department of Health) at the Department for Education and Skills in England.

The findings indicate that BME young people in this study shared some commonality of experience with the general population of young white British people who become parents early, such as aspects of sexual decision making, decisions around contraception, timing of sexual intercourse and choice of partner. One of the key findings was the level of acceptance and adjustment to becoming parents, which contradicted the negative assumptions usually attributed <b>to</b> teenage <b>pregnancy</b> and early parenthood...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to promote the {{psychological}} well-being of new parents during he transition to parenthood, the "Promoting Parenthood Project" was established in Ayrshire and Arran, Scotland. Models of Anticipatory Guidance (defined by three inter-related activities including the provision of factual information, the anticipation of common psychological <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> birth and early parenting and the mobilisation of coping resources) were examined in a comparative outcome study based {{within the context of}} existing local NHS ante-natal education provision. Significant differences were observed among the entire sample over time which supported earlier findings reported in the transition to parenthood literature. Specifically, findings corroborated earlier evidence suggesting that new parents experience a statistically significant decline in relationship satisfaction (as defined in this study by decreasing affectional expression) and that maximal relationship dissatisfaction appears to occur within the first three post-natal months. Interestingly, although gender differences were observed on measures of individual psychological well-being, relationship-based gender differences (with women experiencing significantly greater relationship dissatisfaction/greater dissatisfaction with partner's instrumental role performance than men) were not observed. Reasons for the findings obtained in the study were explored and future research options were discussed. The study raised substantive issues for future transition to parenthood research (including issues in changing cultural understandings of gender and parenthood), mental health promotion theory (including issues in the role of mental health promotion in the context of normative life-events) and practice-based issues for Midwifery and Clinical Psychology in the current NHS.

Nineteen primiparous adolescents (mean= 16, 21 years, SD= 1, 47), with no physical health complications, living at Vale do Rio dos Sinos/BR area, were interviewed {{at the second}} trimester of pregnancy. Four thematic categories emerged from the qualitative content analysis of the interviews: Family <b>reaction</b> related <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> Supportive family members, Type of support received from family and Expectations about family support after delivery. Results revealed that adolescents were supported through information, emotionally and/or instrumentally by family members since the pregnancy announcement, especially from their own mothers.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore women’s experiences of unwanted pregnancy in Shahroud public health centers. Methods: Purposive Sampling was conducted by means of focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews and by a semi-constructed questionnaire in this qualitative research. Five (FGDs) with 23 women in third trimester in pregnancy and 4 in-depth interviews with women with history of induced abortion were done. The method of Content analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: Results of the study can be divided into 4 categories: causes of naming pregnancy as an unwanted pregnancy, causes of unwanted pregnancy; husband, family and relatives’ <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> unwanted <b>pregnancy</b> and the process of acceptance of unwanted pregnancy. Not planning for <b>pregnancy</b> due <b>to</b> physical, emotional and financial non-readiness for pregnancy and believe in two child policy were the main causes of naming pregnancy as unwanted by women. Process of adapting <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy</b> included not accepting pregnancy, trying abortion, accepting fetus and finally negative emotions towards past thoughts about abortion. Fathers and mothers had important roles in acceptance and continuation of pregnancy. Conclusion: Women with unwanted pregnancy face emotional and psychological problems.

40|$|Since 1990 the United Kingdom has {{experienced}} an unprecedented focus upon adolescent pregnancy from Government. The Government {{has made its}} position clear that adolescent pregnancy and motherhood are a problem to be avoided (Department of Health Social Exclusion Unit Report 1999, Social Exclusion Unit Action Plan 2006). By 2010 it is the Government's intention <b>to</b> reduce adolescent <b>pregnancy</b> by 50 % of the current figure of 9. 5 % to 4. 5 % of all pregnancies (Department of Health Social Exclusion Unit Report 1999, Social Exclusion Unit Action Plan 2006). It is clear that Government statistics need closer examination. Adolescent pregnancy is a broad concept and headline statistics do not distinguish between planned or unplanned pregnancy and subsequent motherhood. A review of literature and theories of motherhood reveals a lack of explicit comment regarding the position of adolescent motherhood. It {{is not clear whether}} the experience of motherhood is universal or if there is difference based upon age, maturity, social and economic status (Lawson and Rhode 1993, Arendell 2000). This qualitative study focuses on a group of 36 adolescent mothers attending a Pupil Referral Unit in the North East of England. The Unit offered the mothers an educational provision in order to complete compulsory education. Insight is gained into the lives and experiences of the mothers and the coping strategies they employ in their adaptation to the role of mother. An adapted grounded theory framework is utilised which incorporates three methodological approaches; an observation period of three months, five focus group interviews, and fourteen semi-structured interviews. The methodology generated rich data that reflected the respondent's experiences of motherhood. What became apparent during the study were the respondents' emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and motherhood. Emotional reactions included denial, anger with the biological father, isolation from friends, and the need to bargain for financial support. This qualitative study is significant in the exploration of the experiences, needs and emotional responses of adolescents regarding pregnancy and motherhood and the coping strategies they employ. Recommendations for Government include the consideration of long term strategies that support adolescent mothers and their children. Long term investment and evaluation can contribute to adolescent mothers returning to education and making a significant contribution to the economy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor {{outcomes}} after childbirth {{are associated}} with physical ill health and with an absence of a positive sense of well-being. Postnatally poor physical health {{is thought to be}} influenced by the care received, the nature of the birth, and associated complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the effects of a range of clinical and other factors on positive outcome and well-being 3 months after childbirth. METHODS: This study used data on more than 5, 000 women from a 2010 National Maternity Survey about their experiences of maternity care, and health and well-being 3 months after childbirth. Positive outcome was defined as women reporting no problems and feeling "very well" at the time of the survey. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, several variables were significantly associated with positive outcome, including sociodemographic, antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal factors. In the final logistic regression model, young mothers, those without physical disability and those with no or few antenatal or early postnatal problems, were most likely to have positive outcomes. Other significant factors included a positive initial <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> the <b>pregnancy,</b> not reporting antenatal depression, fewer worries about the labor and birth, and access to information about choices for care. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows how positive outcomes for women after childbirth may be influenced by health, social, and care factors.

40|$|Introduction Pregnancy-induced {{hypertension}} (PIH) {{represents an}} extremely important problem in perinatology. Despite numerous clinical observations and studies, the etiology and exact sequence of pathophysiological events accompanying this specific disorder have remained still unresolved. The concepts most often considered are those that include genetic, endocrine and immunological mechanisms. Besides, one can also find in the literature considerations addressing potential participation of psychological factors in pregnancy-induced hypertension. Material and methods The study included two groups of women - 100 women with PIH and 100 of women with normal course of pregnancy, which were tested using two questionnaires concerning pregnancy as a stressful event and using strategies for coping with stress. Results and discussion Women with PIH experience pregnancy in a more stressful way than women with regular course of pregnancy. However, {{it is necessary to}} point out that respondents of both groups thought that pregnant women seek attention from everyone from their environment, and that their husbands/partners should pay special attention <b>to</b> them during <b>pregnancy.</b> The importance of relationship between partners during pregnancy and the emotional life of pregnant woman has been also examined by other researchers. These data suggest that pregnancy is an emotionally vulnerable period during which women demand special attention from the environment and especially from their husbands/partners. In view of using particular strategies to cope with stress, certain differences have been registered between the two groups of women. Namely, women with PIH utilize much more the mechanism of seeking social support and much less the mechanism of positive redefinition, compared with women with normal course of pregnancy. Conclusion From the psychosocial approach, pregnancy may be considered as a specific state of high emotional tension, which can represent a potent stressor. In the frame of specific <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> stress, <b>pregnancy</b> as a stress-inducing situation may lead to transformation of emotional tension to biochemical and vegetative response, and thus contribute to onset of pregnancy-induced hypertension...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} of fathers' transition to parenthood from mid-pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum. The subjects were 198 fathers from Greece (Athens) and 142 from Britain (Bristol). Social class, age and parity distributions were similar between the two populations. The culture and social structure experienced by each varied widely, however, and was a focus of interest. Two major themes in fatherhood across the two populations were explored: first, the father's instrumental role in provision of emotional and practical support to his partner and care for his child; and second the father's emotional <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> his partner's <b>pregnancy,</b> {{the birth of his}} child and early parenthood. In both cultures fathers reported that they took an active instrumental role in supporting their partner and in participating in childcare. Markedly more British fathers attended the delivery. There were no overall differences in the degree to which fathers participated in childcare though the nature of this participation varied. British fathers more commonly took on housework duties. During their partner's pregnancy Greek fathers experienced significantly higher malaise than their British counterparts and also reported feeling that they had less social support. Common to many fathers in both cultures during this time were fears that their partner might change or be damaged by the pregnancy. After the birth, {{there was no difference in}} emotional well-being between the Greek and British fathers. <b>Reactions</b> <b>to</b> fatherhood and enjoyment of the child were similar for the two cultures also. Patterns of correlation between variables both within and across the antenatal and postnatal time periods were, for the most part, similar for the two cultures.

40|$|Introduction/Aim. Induced {{termination}} of unwanted pregnancy after 12 th gestational week (late-term abortion) is legally restricted in Serbia {{as well as}} in many other countries. On the other hand, unwanted pregnancy very often brings women into the state of personal crisis. Psychiatric indications for legally approved late-term abortion on women’s demand include only severe psychiatric disorders. The aim of this paper was to compare sociodemographic, psychological characteristics and claimed reasons for abortion in the two groups of women with late-term demand for abortion - the group of women satisfying legally prescribed mental health indications, and the group of women not satisfying these indications. The aim of the study was also to determine predictive validity of the abovementioned parameters for late-term abortion as the outcome of unwanted pregnancy. Methods. A total of 62 pregnant women with demand for late-term abortion were divided into two groups according to the criteria of satisfying or not satisfying legally proposed psychiatric indications for late-term abortion after psychiatric evaluation. For the assessment of sociodemographic and psychological parameters sociodemographic questionnaire and symptom checklist - 90 revised (SCL- 90 ®) scale were used, respectively. The outcome of unwanted pregnancy was followed 6 months after the initial assessment. Results. The obtained results showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in educational level, satisfaction with financial situation, elevated anxiety and distress reactions. Unfavorable social circumstances were the main reason for an abortion in both groups and were predictive for an abortion. A 6 -month follow-up showed that women had abortion despite legal restrictions. Conclusion. Pregnant women with psychiatric indication for late-term abortion belong to lower socioeconomic and educational level group compared to women without this indication who have more frequently elevated anxiety and distress <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> unwanted <b>pregnancy.</b> It is necessary to have more accurate guidelines for mental health indications for legally approved late-term abortion, respecting social circumstances. Preventive measures are of great importance in order to lower the risk of illegally performed late-term abortions...|$|R
