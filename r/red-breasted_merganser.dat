One account suggests that bird populations are in trouble, notably the woodland warbler, which had population declines around 60 percent in 2008. Possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices, loss of habitats, soil depletion and erosion, and toxic chemicals. In 2006, there were concerns of possible bird flu after two wild swans {{on the lake}} were found diseased, but it was learned {{that they did not}} contain the deadly H5N1 virus.

50|$|The crofting practises on Berneray {{encourage}} {{a wide array}} of birdlife. On early summer evenings you can sometimes hear snipe drumming, and even the rasp of a corncrake. Mute swans can be seen on Loch Brusda, and greylag geese are common. In the winter they are joined by barnacle, and a few brent geese. Ravens and buzzards are often to be seen. Golden eagles and hen harriers are rarer sights, usually in the winter. Wading birds on the shore include redshanks, sanderlings, turnstones, oyster catchers, dunlin, curlews, whimbrels, ringed plovers and herons. Further out, around the shores of Berneray, are mallards, eiders, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>mergansers,</b> and, more rarely, black-throated and great northern divers. Shags and cormorants fish in the seas around Berneray throughout the year, and in summer you can see gannets diving.|$|R

A number of raptors breed on the island including buzzards, golden eagles and sea eagles. Game birds include snipe, grouse, pheasant, and woodcock. White-tailed eagles, which were reintroduced in the nearby Island of Rùm have migrated to Mull, where they now have a stronghold - they can occasionally be seen on Ulva, but are not known to nest there. Ravens also breed here. Puffin, black-legged kittiwakes, shag, common and Arctic tern, gannets, eider ducks, oystercatchers, curlews, redshanks, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>mergansers</b> and gulls nest on the island and the surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds.

Grey seals, which are larger and can be distinguished by the long [...] "Roman" [...] noses, also haul out there occasionally, but are more common off the West Beach.
