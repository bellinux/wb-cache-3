25|$|After hearing oral {{arguments}} in the case, the Supreme Court was conflicted as to the outcome. The papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall, released nearly a decade later, reveal {{that a majority of}} justices were initially inclined to affirm the Ninth Circuit. Justice Harry Blackmun was assigned to write a majority opinion to that effect, while Justice John Paul Stevens drafted a dissenting opinion. Sensing that some members of the Court might be persuaded to change their votes, Stevens wrote a dissent that <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> majority opinion, and could be changed to one with the substitution of a few words.|$|E
25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E

Johnston was announced as the film's director in August 1999, with Rosenberg still attached. Production was expected to begin in early 2000. Rosenberg's draft about teenagers on Isla Sorna was rejected in September 1999. Although Johnston felt that it was [...] "not a badly written script," [...] he also said, [...] "It <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bad episode of Friends". By December 1999, new writers had been hired to devise a better story for the film.|$|E

2500|$|In some places, the Megillah is not chanted, but is <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> letter, {{because of}} the name iggeret ("epistle"), which is applied (...) to the Book of Esther.

Creighton was famous for spending as much time crafting his prose as he did in research, and Creighton often claimed that the best historical work should <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> well-written novel. Creighton disliked what he called [...] "fat funereal volumes" [...] of unreadable biographies, and argued that well-written books should be the historian's objective.

Despite the multiple band lineup changes over the years, the core group remained tenacious and steadfast. They are applauded and adored by fans worldwide because they haven’t sold out to the corporate mindset looking for the one hit wonder of the week. Instead, they created a legacy of music that is at once entertaining as it is intelligent." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{since the}} text was {{intended}} to be explicitly satirical and hyperbolic, other critics are ambivalent about its rightful place as a science fiction precursor. For example, English critic Kingsley Amis wrote that [...] "It is hardly science-fiction, since it deliberately piles extravagance upon extravagance for comic effect" [...] yet he implicitly acknowledged its SF character by comparing its plot to early 20th century space operas: [...] "I will merely remark that the sprightliness and sophistication of True History make it <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> joke at the expense of nearly all early-modern science fiction, that written between, say, 1910 and 1940." [...] Lucian translator Bryan Reardon is more explicit, describing the work as [...] "an account of a fantastic journey - to the moon, the underworld, the belly of a whale, and so forth. It is not really science fiction, although it has sometimes been called that; there is no 'science' in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens, while {{agreeing with}} the decision, has {{suggested}} {{that it should have}} been more narrowly focused on the issue of privacy. According to Stevens, if the decision had avoided the trimester framework and simply stated that the right to privacy included a right to choose abortion, [...] "it might have been much more acceptable" [...] from a legal standpoint. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had, before joining the Court, criticized the decision for ending a nascent movement to liberalize abortion law through legislation. Ginsburg has also faulted the Court's approach for being [...] "about a doctor's freedom to practice his profession as he thinks best.... It wasn't woman-centered. It was physician-centered." [...] Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox wrote: [...] " [...] failure to confront the issue in principled terms leaves the opinion to <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> set of hospital rules and regulations.... Neither historian, nor layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded that all the prescriptions of Justice Blackmun are part of the Constitution." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 3, 1989, Herschfield sent {{a partial}} script to Jason Alexander, {{who was in}} New York City at the time. Herschfield had met Alexander {{when he was working}} on the CBS sitcom E/R. Alexander enjoyed the script and felt it <b>read</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Woody Allen film; therefore, he did a Woody Allen {{impression}} on his audition tape, and bought a pair of glasses to better resemble the character. Though Alexander thought his audition was [...] "a complete waste of time", both David and Seinfeld were impressed; Seinfeld stated [...] "the second we saw him, like two lines out of his mouth, we went 'That's the guy'". On April 10, 1989 at 9:00 A.M. Alexander did his first official audition and met David and Seinfeld. While in the waiting room for his final audition, Alexander saw that Larry Miller was also auditioning. Alexander was aware that Miller and Seinfeld were very good friends, and so figured that he would not get the part. After his final audition he returned to New York City, and when he landed he received a phone call informing him that he was hired.|$|E
