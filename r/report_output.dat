50|$|InstantAtlas Server is a specialist, enterprise-scale web {{reporting}} {{solution for}} managing and disseminating geographically spread indicator data. Instead of storing data in files and publishing regular outputs {{as you would}} with InstantAtlas Desktop, you manage data in a standard relational database such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle Database. You can also pull data dynamically from other external information systems. InstantAtlas Server solutions can be termed Local information systems, Community Information Systems (see Community indicators), 'Neighborhood Reporting Systems' and 'Area Profiling Tools'. The product occupies a niche space between more mainstream areas of Business Intelligence and Geographic Information Systems. The two primary styles of <b>report</b> <b>output</b> are area profiles and interactive 'data views'. The product is used {{for a wide range}} of international, national, regional and local solutions globally. The technical and licensing model means it is well suited to federated web-based administration, often by a partnership of organisations, and unlimited levels of end-user access (with content access managed through user logins).One of the primary drivers for customers is the need to engage better with citizens and empower communities with neighborhood level information through online channels. For example, Department of Health, New Zealand, uses it to publicly present patterns and trends in a wide range of health conditions across the country while Diabetes UK, a national charity, use it to highlight the differences in local service provision to citizens and to make their own lobbying more effective.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model of optimal {{contracting}} between a purchaser and a provider of health services. We assume that providers can increase demand by increasing quality but can also inflate activity through a manipulative effort (upcoding or DRG creep). We derive and compare the optimal price and audit policy for the purchaser under two scenarios: a) the purchaser can commit to a given audit policy (commitment); b) the purchaser cannot commit to a given audit policy (no commitment). If <b>reported</b> <b>output</b> is additive in quality and manipulation, we find that, if price is exogenously determined, the frequency of an audit is higher under the 'commitment' scenario than under the 'no commitment' one; also, under 'commitment', the degree of manipulation, quality and <b>reported</b> <b>output</b> are higher. If price is endogenous (i. e. it can be optimally chosen by the purchaser), then price is higher under 'no commitment' while the optimal audit policy, the equilibrium quality, manipulation and purchaser's net benefit are identical. If <b>reported</b> <b>output</b> is multiplicative in manipulation and quality, the purchaser sets a higher price under 'no commitment'. Nevertheless, quality and manipulation remain at lower levels, whereas auditing is more intensive than under commitment. The inability to commit now reduces the purchaser's net benefit.

Although {{there are}} {{substantial}} {{differences in the}} computational cost, however, with the current solutions of Big Data and Edge Computing, the required complexity is not an issue. In addition, the temporal restrictions associated to cell diagnosis {{are not the same}} as those applied to other network management functions such as packet scheduling at the link layer, which typically are more critical. In particular, the time to collect cell traces, which is defined by the <b>Report</b> <b>Output</b> Period (ROP), in general is much larger than the required time to execute the diagnosis method. The ROP is typically 15 min, while the proposed classification tree is executed in the order of milliseconds to seconds, depending on the number of cells.
