The study evaluates {{the effectiveness of}} partial to full columns of resin in anchoring 4 -ft, No. 6, grade 40 rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in potash, salt, trona, gypsum, and borate mine roofs. Pull tests were performed on over 600 <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in 11 evaporite mines. Column lengths ranging from 6 to 48 in (fully grouted) were evaluated for each test site. In general, comparative results among all test sites indicate that pull-out loads in excess of 10 tons (force) were attained with resin-grouted bolts having 13 to 75 pet less than a full column of polyester resin. Ten tons (force) of load-carrying capability compared favorably, in terms of strength, with the calculated yield strength of the rebar used in the tests, which was 8. 8 tons (force). The site-specific nature of each test site, due to the unique combinations of geology, mine-induced stresses, and other unknown parameters, prevented the establishment of valid generic column-length criteria. For these reasons, data to evaluate resin-column-length effectiveness are best obtained on a mine-specific basis...|$|E

Based on this information, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems will be developed for implementation in real time. For the prediction of roof geology and stability condition in real time, a micro processor was used and a program developed to monitor and record the drilling parameters of roof bolter. These parameters include feed pressure, feed flow (penetration rate), rotation pressure, rotation rate, vacuum pressure, oil temperature of hydraulic circuit, and signals for controlling machine. From the results of a series of laboratory and underground tests so far, feed pressure is found to be a good indicator for identifying the voids/fractures and estimating the roof rock strength. The method for determining quantitatively the location and the size of void/fracture and estimating the roof rock strength from the drilling parameters of roof bolter was developed. Also, a set of computational rules has been developed for in-mine roof using measured roof drilling parameters and implemented in MRGIS (Mine Roof Geology Information System), a software package developed to allow mine engineers {{to make use of the}} large amount of roof drilling parameters for predicting roof geology properties automatically. For the development of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> criteria, finite element models were developed for tensioned and fully grouted bolting designs.

40|$|The {{roof bolt}} system of a mine, if {{properly}} selected and installed, can allow for better roof control {{and reduce the}} potential for roof falls.

Further, NIOSH has conducted research into how various support parameters can affect the number of roof falls that occur, including support type. Today, the five main types of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> installed in U.

This paper describes each support in detail. Because of the importance of resin in the functioning of the majority of bolts installed, resin grouts are also discussed. Further, trends in the types of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> used are reviewed. Over the last 10 years, the significant trend has been the large reduction in the relative number of mechanical anchor bolts that are installed. These bolts have been replaced mainly by the resin-grouted rebar system. Data are also presented to show the impact of these changes in bolting on the number of roof falls...|$|E

This was achieved through the incorporation of new technologies, field data, numerical modeling and established theories in ground control analysis. All in all, {{a better understanding of}} the quasi-static behavior of underground coal mine roofs has been attained. Over the summer of 2010, the Department of Mining and Mineral Resource Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, in conjunction with Andy Hyett of YieldPoint Inc., Peabody and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), installed over one hundred and seventy instrumented extensometers, closure meters, shear-meters, passive rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> tension rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> and double lock rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> at three coal mines. Two of the three coal mines were room-and-pillar mines and the other a longwall mine. Data was routinely collected over a nine-month period to analyze shearing, dilation, and axial bolt loading occurring within the rock mass, and entry closure occurring between the excavation hanging-wall and foot-wall. Based on bolt loadings, shear, axial behavior and statistical analysis, initial results indicate that active <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> do not show superior performance for the added cost. Active bolts seem to show no difference from passive bolts in the initial loading phase either, indicating that tension bleed-off is a concern soon after installation; however, this observation was not captured, as the data loggers were not intrinsically safe. Considering the modeling results, the trends in axial loading seem to be calibrated but the magnitudes are not. Computer modeling also shows the potential to accurately model in situ bolt performance; however, challenges remain in obtaining a good match between numerical modeling and field observations...|$|E

To begin to improve this situation, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a statistical study of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> performance at a number of mines throughout the U. S. Case histories were collected from 37 mines with a variety of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> types and patterns in a wide range of geologic environments. Performance was measured in terms of the number of roof falls that occurred per 10, 000 ft of drivage.

The focus of this paper is on the more difficult conditions, where the roof is weaker and/or the stress is higher. Analysis of the results led to guidelines that can be used to make preliminary estimates of the required bolt length, capacity, and pattern. The guidelines are based on the depth of cover (which correlates with stress) and the roof quality (measured by the Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR), and the intersection span.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical design method for the truss-bolt system in reinforcing underground fractured rock roofs in coal mines. The analytical design method {{is based on}} the mechanical analysis of the fractured rock roof with reinforcement by inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and a horizontal tie-rod. The mechanical analysis for the system includes a non-linear bending model for the laterally inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and three upper and lower bounds. The lateral resistance of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in a truss-bolt-supported roadway is examined using classical theory of a non-linear beam in bending. The paper analyses the arching action by lateral behavior of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in reinforcing the fractured roof. Based on mechanical models, the design formula concerning the lateral bolt forces, tensions in the tie-rod in the truss system, as well as the reinforcement behavior have been derived. In order to ensure that the roof truss-bolt system reinforces the coal roof effectively, a lower bound of pre-tightening forces must be applied on the tie-rod for stabilizing the fractured roof by arching action. The pre-tightening forces exerted via the tie-rod also cannot be greater than its upper bound, since the excessive tightening force will cause localized failure in the rock near the bolt tail at the abutment of the fractured roof beam. The analytical formulas for both lower and upper bounds for truss pre-tightening forces are put forward in this paper. Furthermore, the paper also {{presents an}}alytical equations for designing the axial forces and dimensions for bolts in this kind of system. Parametric studies and optimization analysis are also carried out {{on the basis of the}} proposed approach. A flow chart and procedures are presented to show the analytical design method for this truss-bolt system. Case studies are presented to show how the method can be used in actual coal mining tunnels.

During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions. This research provides a data-driven foundation from which future research can be conducted for safety interventions to reduce the frequency and severity of incidences involving the roof bolter activities of bolting, handling of materials, and setting the TRS.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} development in coal mine ground control during the last century was the introduction of roof bolting during the late 1940 s and 1950 s. From an engineering standpoint, <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are inherently {{more effective than the}} wood timbers they replaced. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolts</b> promised to dramatically reduce the number of roof fall accidents, which then claimed hundreds of lives each year, and they were initially hailed {{as one of the great}} social advances of our time. Roof bolting also emerged at a time of rapid technologic transformation of the coal industry, and greatly accelerated the transition to trackless, rubber-tired face haulage. The U. S.

Case histories were reported showing that roof falls could be largely eliminated while productivity increased dramatically. Little wonder that, in the words of one contemporary observer, roof bolting has been adopted more rapidly than any other new technology in the history of coal mine mechanization.

The focus was on gaining understanding of the working principle of the testing technique and how the measured response was influenced by the presence of signal-modifying factors of the physical test block geometry, such as changes in material properties, boundary changes, cracks or empty boreholes. It was shown that the roof bolt integrity testing method aided by supervised machine learning methods could identify and classify both properly and improperly grouted <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> on the small sample of test bolts, in a series of tests conducted at the CSIR Centre for Mining Innovation premises. The method was also shown to be robust enough to do so even {{in the presence of the}} signal-modifying factors of the physical test block geometry...|$|E
30|$|Roof bolting is {{the primary}} roof support system in US {{underground}} mines. Roof bolting usually consists two major processes: drilling and bolting. In the drilling process, a hole is drilled to the desired length into the mine roof at the required location. In the bolting process, bolts, either conventional bolts, cable bolts or resin <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are inserted into the drilled hole for roof support. The fundamental problem of rock drilling is the breakage of fragments out of {{the face of a}} solid wall of rock (Teale 1965). The breakage of fragments generates particles of a wide size range out of the face of the rock surface.|$|E
40|$|More than 80 % of U. S. <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are fully-grouted, {{but about}} 1500 roof falls are {{reported}} each year. Anchorage {{failure of a}} fully grouted bolt can occur when the roof is active {{near the top of}} the hole. This paper reports on an extensive series of short-encapsulation pull tests (in which the bolts are installed with only 1 ft of resin) that were conducted in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Mine Safety Research Laboratory and operating mines in WV and PA. The tests confirmed that poor anchorage can been countered under some weak rock conditions. Suggestions for improving anchorage are included...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) classifies {{hearing loss}} as a {{separate}} illness category. Hearing loss accounted for 11 % of all illnesses in 2005 (U. S.

According to occupational data for coal mining provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) from 2000 to 2005, operators that exceeded 100 % noise dosage were from only seven types of machines: auger miners, bulldozers, continuous mining machines, front end loaders, roof bolters, shuttle cars (electric) and trucks (Title 30 CFR Part 62, 2000 - 2005). <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operators rank second among all underground machine operators that exceed 100 % noise dose.

40|$|Problem Operators of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> {{machines}} in underground coal mines {{do so in}} confined spaces and in very {{close proximity to the}} moving equipment. Errors in the operation of these machines can have serious consequences, and the design of the equipment interface has a critical role in reducing the probability of such errors. Methods An experiment was conducted to explore coding and directional compatibility on actual <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> equipment and to determine the feasibility of a visual feedback system to alert operators of critical movements and to also alert other workers in close proximity to the equipment to the pending movement of the machine. The quantitative results of the study confirmed the potential for both selection errors and direction errors to be made, particularly during training. Results Subjective data confirmed a potential benefit of providing visual feedback of the intended operations and movements of the equipment. Impact This research may influence the design of these and other similar control systems to provide evidence for the use of warning systems to improve operator situational awareness...|$|R
