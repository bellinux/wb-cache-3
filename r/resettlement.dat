5|$|Cariappa's {{alliance}} with the Indian Army was spread {{over a period of}} around three decades, during which he had broad experience of staff and command work. After his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. With a view toward ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964. He was also instrumental in setting up the Directorate of <b>Resettlement</b> (later Directorate General <b>Resettlement),</b> an inter-service organisation under the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare, Ministry of Defence, that looked after the various issues surrounding the <b>resettlement</b> of retired soldiers, especially those who retired young.|$|E
5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A <b>resettlement</b> community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another <b>resettlement</b> project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other {{agricultural}} {{projects in}} French West Africa, the French Sudan irrigation project initially relied on families voluntarily resettling along lines {{established by the}} colonial authority. Unable to attract enough volunteers, the colonial authorities began to try forced <b>resettlement</b> to the cotton project. The Office du Niger was founded in 1926 as the main organization facilitating planned, irrigated agricultural projects. Farmers resisted forced <b>resettlement</b> and petitioned for permanent land rights to the irrigated land (which was usually held as property of the Office du Niger). Despite these efforts, a significant cash crop economy did not develop in the French Sudan.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{individual}} meanings behind {{the patterns of}} residential mobility of former asylum seekers in Sweden. While there are numerous studies of residential segregation and migration patterns amongst natives and immigrants alike, fewer have asked the actual patternmakers what driving forces lie behind their decisions to resettle. This study aims to put light on former asylum seekers’ specific experiences of their <b>resettlements</b> and whether the asylum process in itself affect later migration patterns during the life-course. Through in-depth interviews seven respondents told their life stories with focus on how and why they resettled during their time inSweden. The study showed how the structural factors that initiated their general migration patterns of frequent <b>resettlements</b> gave way over time to less frequent moves where life-course events were the main factors. The {{results indicate that the}} asylum process may indeed affect subsequent <b>resettlements</b> in so far that the first own accommodation type of area seem to be important to future residential area choices throughout the life-course. The findings should be of interest for further studies on a greater scale and to policy makers trying to counteract segregation in the metropolitan areas of Sweden in a time of increased refugee flows...|$|R

5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for <b>Resettlement.</b> From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E

Cerezeda planned to develop Buena Esperanza as a commercial hub, linking a route from the Caribbean and Spain to the Pacific and the wealth of the recently conquered Peru.

5|$|Diem {{appointed}} Bui Van Luong—a {{family friend}} and devout Catholic—as {{the head of}} COMIGAL, the government <b>resettlement</b> agency. COMIGAL worked {{in cooperation with the}} United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American presence and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months in the job, Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic aid agencies and an advisory group from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the <b>resettlement</b> program. With more than 4,000new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s {{there were a}} number of <b>resettlement</b> plans for European Jews that were {{precursors}} to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings"). Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress. Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish <b>resettlement</b> in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated.|$|E

Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year.
