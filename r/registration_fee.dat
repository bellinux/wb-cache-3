5|$|David Furness {{stood for}} the British National Party. At {{the time of}} the {{election}} he was the party's organiser in west London and had stood in the 2011 Feltham and Heston by-election. The British National Party were de-registered by the Electoral Commission on 8 January 2016 for failing to pay the required <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> to the Electoral Commission, putting Furness' candidacy at risk. However, the BNP re-registered in February 2016 allowing Furness to stand.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, a {{total of}} 2,736 Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEVs were sold, making the plug-in hybrid the top selling new car {{in the country that}} month, {{representing}} a market share of 6.8% of all the new cars sold. Again in December 2013, the Outlander P-HEV ranked as the top selling new car in the country with 4,976 units, representing a 12.6% market share of new car sales, contributing to a world record plug-in vehicle market share of 23.8% of new car sales. The Netherlands is the second country, after Norway, where plug-in electric cars have topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. The strong increase of plug-in car sles during the last months of 2013 was due {{to the end of the}} total exemption of the <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> for corporate cars, which is valid for 5 years. From January 1, 2014, all-electric vehicles pay a 4% <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> and plug-in hybrids a 7% fee.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, a local residents' scheme gives 50 free {{crossings}} to car drivers {{resident in}} the Dartford and Thurrock council areas {{for an annual}} <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> of £10, with additional crossings at 20p each. On 1 March 2014, this scheme was extended to include privately owned two-axle goods vehicles. A further option was introduced giving unlimited free crossings for £20 annually. Around 44,000 drivers {{take advantage of this}} scheme each year.|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> for same-sex {{unions and}} the number of registered gay couples in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. In contrast to the other 15 German states, in Baden-Württemberg each administrative district decides independently about the level of <b>registration</b> <b>fees.</b> Consequently, there is not only considerable variation of the number of registered gay couples across the individual administrative units, but also among the <b>registration</b> <b>fees,</b> which we seek to explain by relying on theories of public administration, policy analysis and political economy. Our findings show that the varying levels of <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> for same-sex unions are primarily determined by the preferences of parties in the regional legislative committees. In this way, we can demonstrate that the definition of <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> is politicised, which contradicts the legal principles of equivalency and cost recovery...|$|R

5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E

25|$|The {{newly formed}} Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by {{expelled}} ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, contested its first municipal election since its formation in 2013. Smaller parties included the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which held several municipalities in its stronghold KwaZulu-Natal, and the Congress of the People (COPE), which {{was expected to}} decrease {{its share of the}} vote after the decline in support following the 2014 general election. The National Freedom Party (NFP), a breakaway from the IFP led by former IFP chairperson Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, was barred from participating in the election after it failed to pay its <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> to the Independent Electoral Commission. The party had support in areas where the IFP had been strong, and prior to the election governed a number of municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal in coalition with the African National Congress. The NFP was, however, allowed to contest the election in one municipality, Nquthu, where its local branch had paid the <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> on time. The party obtained just two seats in this council, down from five seats in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Upper Canada College is Canada's wealthiest {{independent}} school, {{having an}} endowment {{of more than}} $40 million (CAD). As of 2013, tuition fees range from $29,150 to $32,150 CAD (not including a $8,500 initial <b>registration</b> <b>fee,</b> books and uniform) for day-boy students and $52,010 to $58,510 for boarding (not including a $5,000 initial <b>registration</b> <b>fee).</b> An additional $500 technology fee is levied on {{all students in the}} Upper School, which covers the costs of a MacBook Air laptop computer, the associated software, and technological support. According to the school, less than 2% of the Canadian population can afford the full cost of attending the school. The institution has strict admissions standards, accepting approximately 25% of all applicants. The college began a fundraising campaign in 2012 to obtain $100 million for scholarships; a donation of $11 million was received, the largest single gift in Canadian independent school history. In 2013, UCC disbursed $3.7 million in financial aid to its students. Only students in grade five and above are eligible for this assistance. 15% of students at UCC receive financial assistance. The school plans to increase this to 20% in 2015.|$|E

For a vendor to operate within the radius, a <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> of R60,000 (approximately to US$7,888 or €6,200), {{had to be}} paid to FIFA. This fee was out of most local vendors' reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out of an opportunity for financial gain and spreading South African culture, in favour of multinational corporations.|$|E
