40|$|Signals are a {{lightweight}} form of interprocess communication in Unix. When a process receives a signal, the control flow is interrupted and a previously installed signal handler is <b>run.</b> <b>Signal</b> handling is reminiscent both of exception handling and concurrent interleaving of processes. In this paper, we investigate {{different approaches to}} formalizing signal handling in operational semantics, and compare them {{in a series of}} examples. We find the big-step style of operational semantics to be well suited to modelling signal handling. We integrate exception handling with our big-step semantics of signal handling, by adopting the exception convention as defined in the Definition of Standard ML. The semantics needs to capture the complex interactions between signal handling and exception handling. ...|$|E

The implementation details and performance results are discussed here. 1 REAL-TIME SIGNAL PROCESSING USING MULTIPLE DSP CHIPS DSPs are ideal for medium throughput applications, such as speech and digital audio. However, when attempting to meet real time constraints, one is often faced with the task of squeezing the application to fit onto relatively few instructions available per sample on a processor. For example, consider processing audio at a 44 KHz sampling rate on a processor with a 60 ns cycle time. Audio samples arrive once every 227 ms. Hence there are only about 380 instructions available to process each sample wh [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multiprocessor machine for realtime Digital Signal Processing that uses commercial programmable DSP chips. The architecture is a shared memory, single shared bus parallel processor designed to <b>run</b> <b>signal</b> processing tasks {{that can be}} statically scheduled. Compile time information inherent in such applications is used to constrain an order in which shared resources are accessed at run time. This leads to an efficient inter-processor communication mechanism and eliminates semaphore synchronization overhead. A proof-of-concept prototype of this architecture has been built. The implementation details and performance results are discussed in this paper. rate). Partitioned accross 4 processors, with 15 IPCs, we could fit in 28 voices. This example is not communication intensive; the low overhead IPC mechanism easily absorbs the extra cycles associated with IPC. 4. 3 QMF filter bank A filter bank was implemented to decompose audio from a CD player into 5 bands. The resynthesis bank was also implemented together with the decompostion part. This involved 16 multirate filters (18 taps each). There were 85 IPCs in the final schedule. 5 CONCLUSION We have presented the design and implementation of a multi-DSP architecture that acheives low overhead interprocessor communication with low hardware complexity. Program entry, scheduling and code generation for {{this can be done}} under the Ptolemy environment. Some applications have been run on the board. We plan to expand the existing I/O capability of the board by adding peripheral modules. This will enable us to evaluate the architecture under several other applications. Imposition of a single fixed order at run time means that no data dependency can be tolerated. To run non-SDF graphs on the OMA architecture, we use a presettable counter as the transaction controller. Any processor that has posession of the shared bus can make the transaction controller jump to another bus access schedule by presetting the schedule counter. Conditional branches can thus be handled by computing access schedules for each branch outcome and switching between them at run time. Compilation process for this scheme under the Ptolemy environment will be the subject of future research. We can the...|$|E
5000|$|The batting side {{starts the}} game by rolling the batting die. Any <b>runs</b> <b>signalled</b> are {{recorded}} on the scorecard. When a 'owzthat' appeal is signalled, the umpire die is rolled for a decision. The batsman has a 1/3 chance of being not out, if the 'Not Out' or 'No Ball' is signalled. As in real cricket a 'No Ball' entitles the batsman to an additional strike (roll) and an extra run. A batsman is out if 'bowled', 'stumped', 'caught', or 'L.B.W.’ are signalled, and the next batsman comes to the crease. Depending on the cricket format the batting side is dismissed when all the batsmen are out or and if the over limit is reached. The other side then bats {{in an attempt to}} score more runs and hence win.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} interaction between short run and long <b>run</b> locational <b>signals</b> and the coordination between generation investments and lumpy transmission investments. The short <b>run</b> locational <b>signals</b> we evaluate are sent by nodal pricing and the long run ones are sent by the average participation use-of-the-network tariff. Their joint implementation is also deemed. Numerical simulations are performed on a two-node network evolving during twenty years with increasing demand. The efficiency of these locational signals to coordinate the location of generation with lumpy transmission investments is measured. An independent Transmission System Operator invests to minimize {{the total cost of}} the network, that is to say the sum of the cost of congestion with the cost of transmission investments. And a unique generator behaving competitively chooses the location of her investments depending on two elements: the locational difference in generation investment costs and the costs of the network she may pay with short run nodal prices and with the long run average participation tariff. The network tariff varies with the transmission investments. And the transmission capacity greatly influences nodal prices. We find out that neither short run nodal prices nor long run average participation tariffs can thoroughly coordinate efficiently generation and transmission investments because of the lumpiness of transmission line capacities...|$|R
