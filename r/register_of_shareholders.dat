40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe Companies Act, 1973 ("the Act") {{contains}} no specific provision {{dealing with the}} relationship between a nominee shareholder and its principal, the beneficial shareholder. The Act merely contains a variety of references to this unique relationship without specifying the content thereof or elaborating on the rights <b>of</b> the beneficial <b>shareholder.</b> It is clear from the Act that no legal connection exists between the company and the beneficial shareholder and a company is only obliged to recognise its registered members. It has become apparent that beneficial shareholders need more protection than is currently afforded to them in terms of our common law. Currently beneficial shareholders have a common law right to claim return of their shares from any person (even bona fide third parties) in the event of the misappropriation of such shares by their nominee shareholders. Beneficial shareholders are unprotected if their nominee shareholders were to act contrary to their instructions, for example by not voting at the general meeting in accordance with the instructions <b>of</b> the beneficial <b>shareholders.</b> Having regard {{to the fact that the}} relationship between the beneficial shareholder and the nominee shareholder is based on agency or trusteeship, the beneficial shareholder will be entitle to compel its nominee to transfer the shares to another person. This may, however, have stamp duty implications and if the nominee refuses to give its cooperation in respect of such transfer, costly legal action may be the only solution for the beneficial shareholder. In deciding which section of the Act should be adapted to include the rights <b>of</b> beneficial <b>shareholders,</b> the following sections have been considered: Section 266 (statutory derivative action), section 252 (statutory remedy in the event of prejudice), section 440 K (compulsory acquisition of securities of minorities) and section 344 (h) (liquidation on grounds of equity). The only one of these sections which provides the court with a wide enough discretion to afford the required protection is section 252. An important point in this regard is that section 252 cannot effectively be extended to beneficial shareholders unless they also acquire the right to have access to the same company information as the members of the company would receive. In an attempt to create a balance between the needs to greater protection <b>of</b> beneficial <b>shareholders</b> and the avoidance of unnecessary cumbersome administrative obligations on companies, it is suggested that a <b>register</b> <b>of</b> beneficial <b>shareholders</b> be created and that companies be obliged to inform all beneficial shareholders appearing on such <b>register</b> <b>of</b> the same company information as is provided to registered members. The Act must make it clear that : • a beneficial shareholder can only be recorded in the register with the assistance of its nominee shareholder; • the relevant nominee shareholder must satisfy the company secretary that the person which is recorded in the register is in fact its principal; • the only two instances where the company secretary will be entitled to remove the beneficial shareholder is in the first instance where the beneficia] shareholder consents to such removal and secondly where the shares held by the registered member is transferred. The latter ground will avoid continued provision of company information to persons not involved with the company. No duty will be placed on companies to ensure that the names and addresses <b>of</b> beneficial <b>shareholders</b> are correct. This will be the responsibility <b>of</b> beneficial <b>shareholders.</b> The improved flow of company information will facilitate the improved awareness by beneficial <b>shareholders</b> <b>of</b> relevant events and together with the appropriate extension of section 252, will go a long way in improving the much needed protection <b>of</b> beneficial <b>shareholders.</b> Mercantile LawLL.

The following year, the Barilga Corporation, a construction company, became the first to sell corporate bonds through the MSE, with a USD4.4 million issue. In 2004, bond trading accounted for 96% of total securities turnover on the exchange. By that same year, the stock market had recovered somewhat as well, but retail investors remained suspicious of trading due to volatility and lack of transparency; MSE officials estimated that 80% of listed companies were majority-owned by private individuals. By February 2007, trading hours had expanded to one hour on each weekday. Weekly stock turnover at 7 September 2007 was 1.8 million shares valued at MNT1.7 billion, while 50,000 government bonds traded for a total consideration of MNT4.8 billion. Furthermore, the number <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>shareholders</b> bounced back to 483,100, three-and-a-half times the figure a decade earlier, and nearly half the peak number seen in 1995 after privatisations had completed.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rules}} regarding the internet-based exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights for public corporations incorporated in Canada, France, Germany, the U. S. (DelGCL & RMBCA), the UK and Switzerland. The traditional doctrine associates information, communication and voting with shareholder meetings. In addition, shareholder meetings regularly prompt reviews of management's activities exercised on behalf <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> by accountants or the judiciary. The analysis {{reveals that the}} current regimes <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> meetings merely provide for voting and information {{in the context of}} a digital environment, while communication and review is usually not replicated. The lack of all functions <b>of</b> traditional <b>shareholder</b> meetings is one reason of why exclusively virtual shareholder meetings have not gained widely spread acceptance across jurisdictions. Another reason is that a well-fitting design for the web-based exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights does not yet exist. Thus, the paper develops an advisable design <b>of</b> Virtual <b>Shareholder</b> Meetings that replicates all for functions <b>of</b> traditional <b>shareholder</b> meetings, while it is likely to reduce shareholder apathy at the same time. It argues that enabling more frequent opportunities for voting is the logical consequence of the developments of continuous disclosure requirements and continuous buy/hold/sell-decisions by market participants. Therefore, the virtual exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights should be achieved through (1) liberalizing currently existing legislative and practical barriers, and in particular, time and place restrictions on shareholder meetings; (2) re-integrating analyst and institutional investor meetings in the process <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> meetings, and (3) substituting for the traditional face-to-face accountability <b>of</b> managers to <b>shareholders</b> through specific electronic means. The latter involves, specifically, the use of RSS-Feed and XBRL-technologies for gathering and evaluating information, the use of the company's website as the central communication platform for management to shareholders and shareholders to shareholders, and the election <b>of</b> an independent <b>shareholder</b> rights manager (firm) by the shareholder body with procedural, technical, and organizational authority for organizing the exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights.

40|$|Democracy and {{participation}} <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> or {{the demand for}} their active participation in the meetings of the Assemblyhas increasingly gained in importance in modern conditions. This is because, negative trends of passivation, the limitations of democratic potential <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> and shareholders' rights abuse by the management body, especially in the work control and compensation policy <b>of</b> <b>shareholders,</b> have been observed in {{a detailed analysis of}} the application and results <b>of</b> the <b>Shareholder</b> Rights Directive. The passivity <b>of</b> <b>shareholders,</b> as one <b>of</b> the most striking features of their position in the joint stock company today, is the biggest problem and threat to democratic processes within the company. If we bear in mind that the most common definition <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> democracy is 'ability <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> to influence the management of the company', we can notice a clear picture of the seriousness and importance of the lack <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> participation. This is the reason why the author of this paper gradually examines the causes and consequences of the passivity <b>of</b> <b>shareholders,</b> the proposed changes in this context in the Law of the European Union and the practical implications of such solutions in practice. In addition, the author examines contemporary forms and conditions for shareholder democracy and the legal framework in the European Union and the Republic of Serbia. In this way, we analyze the situation in this area and point out shortcomings of certain solutions, as well as the implications they cause in practice. The main thesis from which starts the scientific work and which will be gradually proven through theoretical and practical analysis is that the wider social processes directly reflect {{on the state of the}} joint-stock companies, or the state of corporate governance. This means that the negative trends of modern democracy (in the constitutional sense) are almost mirrored in economic capital (EC) and our attempt in this paper is to prove that, through the analysis of existing solutions. On the other hand, some solutions <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> democracy are applicable in terms of contemporary socio-political relations and can produce a certain positive impact on the democratic processes...|$|R
