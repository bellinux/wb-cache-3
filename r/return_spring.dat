5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} is {{the control of}} the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> to pull back and close the throttle.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon has no {{gas system}} and the {{internal}} components have been modified accordingly. The bolt carrier with integral charging handle was recycled from the AK, but the piston rod and rotary bolt were removed and the piston extension was plugged with a steel insert. The <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> and guide rod are identical {{to those of the}} AK.|$|E

50|$|The {{method used}} {{to lock the}} drum against the device frame is {{by the use of}} two {{straight}} knurl edge discs that are thrown outwards by centrifugal force as they ride on parallel ramps milled into the drum's enclosed outer periphery. Two light <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> act as centrifugal force trips and as <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> to reset the discs when the fall load is released and the device is unlocked. A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the frame's lock ring.|$|R
50|$|Belleville washers {{have been}} used as <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> in {{artillery}} pieces, one example being the French Canet range of marine/coastal cannon from the late 1800s (75 mm, 120mm, 152 mm).|$|R
25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E
2500|$|Valve {{attachments}} in tenor {{and bass}} trombones were first {{seen in the}} mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German [...] "Quart-ventil", built onto a B tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a <b>return</b> <b>spring,</b> and was only intended to set the instrument in B or F for extended passages. Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.|$|E
2500|$|A single breaker {{driven by}} a cam and a <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> is limited in spark rate by the onset of contact bounce or float at high rpm. This limit can be {{overcome}} by substituting for the breaker a pair of breakers that are connected electrically in series but spaced {{on opposite sides of}} the cam so they are driven out of phase. Each breaker then switches at half the rate of a single breaker and the [...] "dwell" [...] time for current buildup in the coil is maximized since it is shared between the breakers. The Lamborghini V-8 engine has both these adaptations and therefore uses two ignition coils and a single distributor that contains 4 contact breakers.|$|E

50|$|The boilers {{were given}} steel fireboxes and the frame was reinforced, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} the drive. The outermost axles, which had side play, were given <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> to minimise hunting.|$|R
50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} rigidly into the {{locomotive}} frame. To improve curve running the wheel flanges {{of the driving}} wheels were reduced. The carrying axles were designed as Adams axles and had leaf <b>return</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a <b>return</b> <b>spring.</b> The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|E
2500|$|And yet, [...] "synchronization", in {{the usual}} sense of the word, between the rate of fire of a machine gun (firing as such, in a fully {{automatic}} manner) and the revolutions per minute of a spinning aircraft propeller is also a conceptual impossibility. A machine gun normally fires at a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by (for instance) strengthening and increasing the tension on a <b>return</b> <b>spring,</b> or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating. The propeller of an aircraft, on the other hand, turns at widely differing rates of revolution per minute, depending on the throttle setting, and whether the aircraft is climbing, flying level, or diving. Even if it were feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine's tachometer at which a machine gun's cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller – this would be very limiting.|$|E
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E
50|$|Other {{problems}} may be {{implicated in the}} case of older vehicles equipped with carburetors. Weak, disconnected, or mis-connected throttle <b>return</b> <b>springs,</b> worn shot-pump barrels, chafed cable housings, and cables which jump their tracks in the throttle-body crank can all cause similar acceleration problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} valves had single springs {{but there were}} <b>return</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the rockers to the pushrods. Engine accessories were mounted: distributor on a level with the cylinder head, the coil just in front. The petrol pump, oil filter and oil diprod were mounted aft of the distributor.|$|R

2500|$|The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} shotgun {{that resembles}} the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement {{of some of}} the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. [...] The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and [...] function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located {{on the left side of}} the receiver above the pistol grip. Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E

50|$|The valves in {{a typical}} {{four-stroke}} engine allow the air/fuel mixture into the cylinder {{at the beginning of}} the cycle and exhaust gases to be expelled at the end of the cycle.

50|$|As the {{recoil spring}} returns to its {{uncompressed}} state, it pushes the bolt body backward with sufficient force to cycle the action. The bolt body unlocks and retracts the bolt head, extracts and ejects the cartridge, cocks the hammer, and compresses the <b>return</b> <b>spring.</b> Once the bolt reaches {{the end of}} its travel, the <b>return</b> <b>spring</b> provides the force to chamber the next round from the magazine, and lock the bolt closed.|$|E
50|$|Disc brakes rely on {{pliability}} of caliper {{seals and}} slight runout to release pads, leading to drag, fuel mileage loss, and disc scoring.
