5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated in the statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E

25|$|On 13 September 1810, Epigmenio Gonzalez {{was arrested}} for having stockpiled weapons for an {{insurgency}} {{and the next day}} Mayor Miguel Domínguez and his wife Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez were arrested for their roles in the Conspiracy of 1810. With the conspiracy discovered, she still managed to get a warning to Miguel Hidalgo. He eluded capture and rushed to Dolores, where he gave his famous grito (the cry for independence). For her actions, La Corregidora was imprisoned several times between 1810 and 1817. She died impoverished and forgotten, but was later <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> she became the first woman to appear on a Mexican coin. Once the armed battle began, the city was taken by the royalist army and was the last major city to be taken by the insurgents.|$|E

500|$|Allosaurus was an allosaurid, {{a member}} of a family of large theropods within the larger group Carnosauria. The family name Allosauridae was created for this genus in 1878 by Othniel Charles Marsh, but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of Megalosauridae, another family of large theropods that {{eventually}} became a wastebasket taxon. This, along with the use of Antrodemus for Allosaurus during the same period, is a point that needs to be <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> searching for information on Allosaurus in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name [...] "Megalosauridae" [...] instead of [...] "Allosauridae" [...] include Gilmore, 1920, von Huene, 1926, Romer, 1956 and 1966, Steel, 1970, and Walker, 1964.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to {{his death}} came from many quarters, many paying tribute to his {{scientific}} prowess. His father recalled that [...] "he always got everything the first time. He always excelled." [...] Greg Sampson, Dirks' math teacher at Lewis and Clark, <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> his student had finished an advanced class in trigonometry in just two weeks, something no other student of his has ever done, saying [...] "he was just an amazing, amazing student." [...] Niles Pierce recalled how Dirks {{was willing to take}} a chance on working with a younger professor. His former postdoc was, he said, [...] "an unusual student, even for Caltech... He did remarkable things." [...] D. E. Shaw Research, his employer, called him [...] "a brilliant scientist who made tremendous contributions to our own research, and to the broader scientific community." ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E

[...] He made 2 centuries, 15 fifties and took 112 catches.

2500|$|In 1577 he was {{committed}} {{to the care of}} Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely with strict instructions as to his treatment. Cox could find no fault with him except that [...] "he was a gentle person but in the popish religion too, too obstinate." [...] In 1580 he was moved to Wisbech Castle, and there exercised a good influence among his fellow-prisoners; this was <b>remembered</b> <b>when,</b> in later years, the Wisbech Stirs broke out. Here, at his own cost, he repaired the road and set up a market cross in the town. Twenty-four years after the death of Queen Mary, he died in prison and was buried in an unknown grave in the parish church at Wisbech on 10 October 1584.|$|E
