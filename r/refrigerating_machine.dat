Only vapour compression machines are considered. A {{summary of the}} environmental assessment criteria such as ozone depletion potential (ODP), global warming potential (GWP, HGWP) and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) is given for the most popular derivatives of methane, ethane and propane. The total equivalent warming impact (TWEI, LEWI) of <b>refrigerating</b> <b>machines</b> is discussed for a few examples, when refrigerant leakage and CO_ 2 emissions due to the electrical power consumption are considered. It is shown how the filling quantity of the refrigerant in heat pumps effects the heating capacity. The choice of the appropriate refrigerant for the desired application range depends on many factors. The vapour pressure, the pressure ratio, the coefficient of performance, the temperature after compression, the volumetric cooling or heating capacity have a determining influence {{on the use of}} a defined refrigerant. The subcooling of the condensate and the superheating of the vapour have also influence on the coefficient of performance and the volumetric cooling or heating capacity.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the influence of a cylindrical adsorber on the performances of a solar adsorption <b>refrigerating</b> <b>machine.</b> The adsorber heated by solar energy contains an activated carbon-ammonia pair; it is composed by many cylindrical tubes welded using external fins.

Using real solar irradiance data as well as many initial conditions, the model computes for each point and in the considered time interval during the day, the temperature, the adsorbed mass, the pressure inside the adsorber and the solar performance coefficient (COP). The results show that the optimal diameter of the adsorber with fins is greater than the one without fins. Moreover the mass cycled in the case of an adsorber equipped with external fins is more significant than the one without fins, and the maximal temperature reached in the adsorber with fins attains 97 Â Â°C while in the adsorber without fins reaches 77 Â Â°C.
