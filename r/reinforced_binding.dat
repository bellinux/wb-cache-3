30|$|To better {{understand}} {{the effect of the}} mechanical and chemical characteristics among electrode components, the binding structural viewpoint of S with AHP and commercial linear binders (such as PVDF, PTFE) are expected to be different (Fig.  1 c). During the discharge process (Li insertion), owing to the formation of insulating Li 2 S on the carbon matrix, linear PVDF or PTFE are forced to mechanical stretch or moved by the expanded polysulfides. The volume density of Li 2 S (1.67  g/cm 3) is much lower than that of S (2.03  g/cm 3), which would cause a volume expansion of the S cathode of ∼ 22 % compared to their initial state during the whole discharge process. Upon charging (Li desertion) in the same cycle, the polysulfides shrink back to their original state; the linear binders, however, cannot fully follow the shrinkage of polysulfides, thus leading to an inevitably contact loss of electroactive materials from the carbon matrix, coupled with polysulfides dissolution, result in inferior performance of most sulfur-carbon composites. This issue becomes more prominent over extended cycling. On the contrary, AHP have plentiful amide side groups physically/chemically entangled to grasp polysulfides, leading to <b>reinforced</b> <b>binding</b> ability with polysulfides via hydrogen bonding [29, 30]. Thus, in this polymeric AHP binder provides multidimensional noncovalent interactions with the polysulfides surfaces through the amide groups. These interactions not only allow the AHP binder to accommodate the massive volume expansion of S cathodes during discharge process but also keep the polysulfides-binder interactions even during charge process.|$|E
40|$|Nonreducible oxides are {{characterized}} by large band gaps and are therefore unable to exchange electrons or to form bonds with surface species, explaining their chemical inertness. The insertion of aliovalent dopants alters this situation, as new electronic states become available in the gap that {{may be involved in}} charge-transfer processes. Consequently, the adsorption and reactivity pattern of doped oxides changes with respect to their nondoped counterparts. This Account describes scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments that demonstrate the impact of dopants on the physical and chemical properties of well-defined crystalline oxide films. For this purpose, MgO and CaO as archetypical rocksalt oxides have been loaded either with high-valence (Mo, Cr) or low-valence dopants (Li). While the former generate filled states in the oxide band gap and serve as electron donors, the latter produce valence-band holes and give rise to an acceptor response. The dopant-related electronic states and their polarization effect on the surrounding host material are explored with XPS and STM spectroscopy on nonlocal and local scales. Moreover, charge-compensating defects were found to develop in the oxide lattice, such as Ca and O vacancies in Mo- and Li-doped CaO films, respectively. These native defects are able to trap the excess charges of the impurities and therefore diminish the desired doping effect. If noncompensated dopants reside in the host lattice, electron exchange with surface species is observed. Mo ions in CaO, for example, were found to donate electrons to surface Au atoms. The anionic Au strongly binds to the CaO surface and nucleates in the form of monolayer islands, in contrast to the 3 D growth prevailing on pristine oxides. Charge transfer is also revealed for surface O 2 + that traps one Mo electron by forming a superoxo-species. The activated oxygen is characterized by a <b>reinforced</b> <b>binding</b> to the surface, an elongated O–O bond length, and a reduced barrier for dissociation, and represents an important intermediate for oxidation reactions. The charge-transfer processes described here are quenched if Li is inserted into the oxide lattice, neutralizing the effect of the extra electrons. The specific behavior of doped oxides has been explored on a mechanistic level, i. e. on thin-film model systems at ultrahigh vacuum and low temperature. We believe, however, that our results are transferrable to realistic conditions and doping might thus develop into a powerful method to improve the performance of nonreducible oxides in surface-catalyzed reactions...|$|E

30|$|This {{experiment}} {{demonstrates the}} large potential of macro-XRF imaging for the visualization of fragments of medieval manuscripts hidden in early–modern bookbindings. The {{invention of the}} printing press {{in the fifteenth century}} made manuscripts obsolete and bookbinders started recycling their strong parchment leaves to <b>reinforce</b> <b>bindings</b> of printed books. One in roughly every five early-modern books contains a fragment of a medieval manuscript hidden underneath the bookbinding. Systematically investigating these fragments will provide scholars with valuable information about transmission and variant readings of medieval texts. Four case studies were scanned with a Bruker M 6 Jetstream mobile XRF scanner. We were able to visualize hidden texts underneath black paint, paper and parchment at such a high resolution that they could be read and dated. One of the findings was an early twelfth-century excerpt of a text by the Venerable Bede in a sixteenth-century bookbinding. In addition, we were able to separately visualize the lower and upper text of a famous palimpsest. The main limitation of the current set-up is the scanning time, which took anywhere between 6 and 66 h. In order to systematically employ macro-XRF for researching medieval fragments, the scanning time needs to be decreased. Nonetheless, this experiment shows that the macro-XRF technique is extremely suitable for visualizing fragments of medieval manuscripts in a non-destructive way in order to read, date and localize them.|$|R

40|$|In theory, a {{perfectly}} rigid receptor {{will probably be}} an unbeatable binder. However, rigidity may {{not be easy to}} achieve in practice and it is certainly not Nature’s method to realise high affinity. In many proteins binding affinity is increased through non-covalent interactions within the protein. Thus there is a considerable incentive to follow Nature’s example and start exploring the use of secondary intra-receptor interactions to aid in the binding process. Secondary interactions within a receptor will <b>reinforce</b> host–guest <b>binding</b> when the same conformational rearrangement (or freezing of motion) is required for guest binding as for the formation of the intra-receptor interactions. Introducing secondary interactions will require rather elaborate synthetic receptors to be produced. With the recent developments in dynamic combinatorial chemistry, access to the desired structures should be facilitated.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{negative}} gene regulators acting at the 3 'UTR level, modulating {{the translation of}} cancer-related genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 3 'UTRs could impact the miRNA-dependent gene regulation either by weakening or by <b>reinforcing</b> the <b>binding</b> sites. Thus, the alteration of the normal regulation of a given gene could affect the individual's risk of cancer. Therefore, {{it is helpful to}} develop a tool enabling the researchers to predict which of the many SNPs could really impact the regulation of a target gene. At present, there are several available databases and algorithms able to predict potential binding sites in the 3 'UTR of genes. However, each algorithm gives different predictions and none of them gives, for each polymorphism, a direct measurement of the biological impact. We propose an approach allowing the assignment to each polymorphism a ranking of its biological impact. The method is based on a simple elaboration of predictions from preexisting well-established algorithms. As an example, we show the application of this approach to 140 genes candidate for colorectal cancer (CRC).

40|$|G {{proteins}} often bear myristoyl, palmitoyl and isoprenyl moieties, which favor {{their association}} with the membrane and their accumulation in G Protein Coupled Receptor-rich microdomains. These lipids influence the biophysical properties of membranes and thereby modulate G protein binding to bilayers. In this context, we showed here that geranylgeraniol, but neither myristate nor palmitate, increased the inverted hexagonal (HII) phase propensity of phosphatidylethanolamine-containing membranes. While myristate and palmitate preferentially associated with phosphatidylcholine membranes, geranylgeraniol favored nonlamellar-prone membranes. In addition, Gαi 1 monomers had a higher affinity for lamellar phases, while Gβγ and Gαβγ showed a marked preference for nonlamellar prone membranes. Moreover, geranylgeraniol enhanced the binding of G protein dimers and trimers to phosphatidylethanolamine-containing membranes, yet it decreased that of monomers. By contrast, both myristate and palmitate increased the Gαi 1 preference for lamellar membranes. Palmitoylation <b>reinforced</b> the <b>binding</b> of the monomer to PC membranes and myristoylation decreased its binding to PE-enriched bilayer. Finally, binding of dimers and trimers to lamellar-prone membranes was decreased by palmitate and myristate, but it was increased in nonlamellar-prone bilayers. These results demonstrate that co/post-translational G protein lipid modifications regulate the membrane lipid structure and that they influence the physico-chemical properties of membranes, which in part explains why G protein subunits sort to different plasma membrane domains.

40|$|Overcoming {{resistance}} to chemotherapy {{is a major}} challenge in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, especially since the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We show that silencing of the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein PHD 1, but not PHD 2 or PHD 3, prevents p 53 activation upon chemotherapy in different CRC cell lines, thereby inhibiting DNA repair and favoring cell death. Mechanistically, PHD 1 activity <b>reinforces</b> p 53 <b>binding</b> to p 38 a kinase in a hydroxylation-dependent manner. Following p 53 –p 38 a interaction and chemotherapeutic damage, p 53 can be phosphory-lated at serine 15 and thus activated.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by the loss of dystrophin, which can result from the loss of this binding. The N-terminal part of the latter binding site of dystrophin has been well documented using overlay assay and X-ray diffraction assays. However, the binding site at the C-terminal region of dystrophin has not been examined in detail. In the present work, we report a detailed analysis of the C-terminal binding domain as follows. (1). The full binding activity corresponding to the effective binding in vivo is expressed by the dystrophin fragment spanning amino acids 3026 - 3345 containing the ZZ domain at the C-terminus. Determination of this binding range is important not only for understanding of the mechanism of dystrophy, but also useful for the design of truncated dystrophin constructs for gene therapy. (2). The ZZ domain binds to EF 1 domain in the dystrophin fragment to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>binding</b> activity. (3). The cysteine 3340 in the ZZ domain is essential for the binding of dystrophin to beta-dystroglycan. A reported case of DMD due to missense mutation C 3340 Y may be caused by inability to fix dystrophin beneath the cell membrane. (4).

NMR and X-ray crystal structural analyses revealed that in these receptor molecules the benzamido moiety serving as a spectral signal reporter and the thiourea moiety as anion binding site were decoupled by the twisted N-N single bond and the two thioureido and amido NH protons experienced differed electronic environment. Yet the absorption spectra of 3 a-e in acetonitrile {{in the presence of}} anions such as AcO-, F-, and (HPO 4 _-) -P- 2 underwent substantial changes by the appearance of a new band at ca. 325 nm, which is red-shifted by ca. 60 nm, and of a clear isosbestic point at 270 mu, suggesting that anion binding led to the communication between thiourea binding site and benzamido signal reporter via probably a conformational change around the N-N bond. The new band energies were found correlating linearly with the Hammett constant of the substituent with a slope of - 0. 361 eV, indicative of the charge-transfer character of the absorption band. The binding constants for AcO- and F- of 3 a-e were obtained at not less than 107 M-I orders of magnitude, which are much higher than those of the corresponding N,N'-bisarylthioureas. We suggest that anion binding to the thiourea moiety in 3 a-e switches on charge transfer in the anion-receptor <b>binding</b> complex, which <b>reinforces</b> anion <b>binding</b> and therefore results in a dramatically enhanced binding affinity of the receptors.

The effects of altering the backbone, {{the type of}} ammonium group, the number of ammonium group, the hydrophobicity of the pendant group, and of varying the metal ions on the adsorption of BS's, were studied to elucidate the structure-activity relationship. The binding capacity of the resins for BS's generally increased with increasing number of ammonium groups per pendant group of the ammonium-bearing resins, and with higher charge of the metal complex cation of the metal-ion coordinated resin, demonstrating the primary importance of electrostatic interactions. It was also observed that, as the resin backbone was changed from hydrophilic polyacrylamide to hydrophobic polystyrene, the adsorption capacity increased substantially, demonstrating that hydrophobic interactions (H-H's) between the resin backbone and the BS's also {{play a significant role}} in the binding. The incorporation of hydrophobic segments -(CH$ sb 2) sb{ rm n}$- into the pendant groups on polyacrylamide resins increased binding capacity, but had no effect for the more hydrophobic polystyrene resins. Primary ammonium-bearing resins often showed higher binding capacities than their quarternary analogs, suggesting that H-bonding <b>reinforces</b> the <b>binding.</b> Isotherms with an S-shape observed for most polyacrylamide resins indicate a positive cooperativity in the binding due to H-H's and H-bonding among BS anions bound at adjacent positions within resin beads. Binding models have been proposed to depict the formation of pendant group-BS mixed reversed micelles and ordinary BS micelles. The studies of the kinetics of the binding of BS anions by the resins showed that a small resin particle size and more intense shaking substantially increase the rate of binding. This indicates that the binding process is mainly controlled by the diffusion of BS anions near and within the beads. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Many techniques were used in erosion control work, but most emphasis has been placed on the planting of trees, largely Populus and Salix species. The planting of trees has proven to have a beneficial effect on counteracting erosion by slumping and gullying, both in retired areas and in those still grazed. It may be assumed that this effect is due primarily to the <b>reinforcing</b> and <b>binding</b> effect of their root systems.

Moreover, SAP inhibited the binding of TH 3 to sulphatide, as well as anti-sulphatide IgM found in a range of sera, and anti-sulphatide IgG in the only sera sample in which it was found. The observation that anti-TH 3 idiotype monoclonal and polyclonal anti-SAP antibodies both inhibited the binding of TH 3 and IgM in sera (but not IgG) to sulphatide without binding to sulphatide themselves further demonstrated similar binding specificities.

The ATM/ATR phosphorylates SMC 1 and SMC 3, two core components of the cohesin complex to regulate checkpoint signaling and DNA repair. In this report, we show that the genome-wide binding of SMC 1 and SMC 3 after ionizing radiation (IR) is enhanced by <b>reinforcing</b> pre-existing cohesin <b>binding</b> sites in human cancer cells.

Consistently, both ESCO 1 and SMC 3 acetylation are required for intra-S phase checkpoint and cellular survival after IR. Although both IR-induced acetylation and phosphorylation of SMC 3 are under the control of ATM/ATR, the two forms of modification are independent of each other and both are required to promote reinforcement of SMC 3 binding to cohesin sites.

Stimulation leads to strong transcriptional activation of the LBP gene in a dose- and time-dependent manner. If the stimulated cells are additionally incubated with pentoxifylline, this leads to a down regulation of the LBP expression. The same goes for the incubation with other methylxanthine derivative as theophylline or caffeine. All these substances inhibit phosphodiesterase and cause an accumulation of cyclic APM (cAMP) in the cell. If stimulated hepatoma cells are directly incubated with cAMP, this also leads to a dose- and time-dependent reduction of LBP expression. Although the LBP promoter has cAMP responsive elements binding-sites, the obstruction effect doesn´t seem to be controlled by them, but by the activation of Gfi-site, an inhibitory transcription factor. Mutations of this site did not show any more inhibitory effects to raised cAMP levels. Because of the outstanding clinical significance of LBP within immune defence as well as the genesis of sepsis, the knowledge of the regulation and most of all the obstruction of the LBP expression plays an important role. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel therapie strategies...|$|R
40|$|CAF- 1 is {{essential}} in human cells for the de novo deposition of histones H 3 and H 4 at the DNA replication fork. Depletion of CAF- 1 from various cell lines causes replication fork arrest, activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint and global defects in chromatin structure. CAF- 1 is also involved in coordinating inheritance of states of genes expression and in chromatin assembly following DNA repair. In this study, we have generated cell lines expressing RNAi resistant versions of CAF- 1 and show that the N-terminal 296 amino acids are dispensable for essential CAF- 1 function in vivo. N-terminally truncated CAF- 1 p 150 is deficient in PCNA <b>binding,</b> <b>reinforcing</b> the existence of two PCNA binding sites in human CAF- 1, but the defect in PCNA binding {{has no effect on}} the recruitment of CAF- 1 to chromatin after DNA damage or to resistance to DNA damaging agents. Tandem affinity purification of CAF- 1 interacting proteins under mild conditions reveals that CAF- 1, is directly associated with the Ku 70 / 80 complex, part of the DNA dependent protein kinase, and the phospho-serine/threonine binding protein, 14 - 3 - 3 zeta. CAF- 1 is a substrate for DNA-PK and the 14 - 3 - 3 interaction in vitro is dependent on DNA-PK phosphorylation. These results highlight that CAF- 1 has prominent interactions with the DNA repair machinery, but that the N-terminus is dispensable for the role of CAF- 1 in DNA replication and repair coupled chromatin assembly...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMoesin, {{a protein}} of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin family, which links the plasma {{membrane}} to the cytoskeleton, {{is involved in}} multiple physiological and pathological processes, including viral budding and infection. Its interaction with the plasma membrane occurs via a key phosphoinositide, the phosphatidyl(4, 5) inositol-bisphosphate (PIP 2), and phosphorylation of residue T 558, which {{has been shown to}} contribute, in cellulo, to a conformationally open protein. We study the impact of a double phosphomimetic mutation of moesin (T 235 D, T 558 D), which mimics the phosphorylation state of the protein, on protein/PIP 2 /microtubule interactions. Analytical ultracentrifugation in the micromolar range showed moesin in the monomer and dimer forms, with wild-type (WT) moesin containing a slightly larger fraction (∼ 30 %) of dimers than DD moesin (10 - 20 %). Only DD moesin was responsive to PIP 2 in its micellar form. Quantitative cosedimentation assays using large unilamellar vesicles and quartz crystal microbalance on supported lipid bilayers containing PIP 2 reveal a specific cooperative interaction for DD moesin with an ability to bind two PIP 2 molecules simultaneously, whereas WT moesin was able to bind only one. In addition, DD moesin could subsequently interact with microtubules, whereas WT moesin was unable to do so. Altogether, our results point to an important role of these two phosphorylation sites in the opening of moesin: since DD moesin is intrinsically in a more open conformation than WT moesin, this intermolecular interaction is <b>reinforced</b> by its <b>binding</b> to PIP 2. We also highlight important differences between moesin and ezrin, which appear to be finely regulated and to exhibit distinct molecular behaviors...|$|R
30|$|Rahman et al. [3] {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and sawdust as raw materials for WPC fabrication by flat-press method, where sawdust and PET were used as <b>reinforcing</b> material and <b>binding</b> agent, respectively. PET {{in the form of}} bottles and containers of food is abundant, because packaging industries used PET intensively. Recycling of PET offers a potential solution for preventing environmental pollution and scope for manufacturing of WPCs. The effects of different mixing ratios of sawdust and PET on the physical and mechanical properties of WPCs was only considered for the study [3]. However, the effect of different particle sizes on WPCs containing wood particles and PET has not been studied yet. In an earlier research, Chen et al. [6] reported that the large size wood particles increased the bending strength and decreased the density of composites. In the meantime, natural decay resistance or durability is another important issue for the WPCs performance and recent concerns about it is increasing [13], because wood particles or fibers are biodegradable [13] and hygroscopic [2] in nature that exposed to extreme conditions. However, Rahman et al. [3] did not report the decay resistance of the WPCs in the earlier research. In addition, WPCs are designed for external use, where water absorption (WA) and varying exposure temperature are crucial factors affecting WPC performance [2]. Najafi et al. [2] reported that immersion temperature has negative effects on the WA of WPCs, and WA is one of the determining factors for the application of WPCs. Accordingly, research on the decay resistance and effect of immersion temperature on WA of WPCs containing wood particle and PET is imperative. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} assess the effects of different mixing ratios and particle sizes on the physical and mechanical properties along with decay resistance of WPCs. Moreover, the effects of immersion temperatures on WA and thickness swelling (TS) of the WPCs were also studied.|$|R
