40|$|En aquesta tesis, hi ha proposat un sistema automàtic de monitorització de víctimes en grans catàstrofes. Les noves sol·lucions d’interconnexió de dispositius, com les Xarxes Tolerants a Retards (DTNs) i les Xarxes de Sensors Sense Fils (WSNs), ofereixen un ample ventall d’oportunitats en entorns hostils on l’accés a les comunicacions és, o bé {{inexistent}} o bé inaccessible. Gràcies a la flexibilitat de les WSNs, i la seva facilitat de desplegament, poden fàcilment accedir a zones inexplorades o de difícil accés i monitoritzar els seus voltants per retornar informació valuosa. Les DTNs per la seva banda, poden suplir la mancança d’una xarxa de comunicacions rudimentària sense la necessitat d’aixecar una infrastructura de comunicacions, senzillament fent servir els recursos propers de manera oportunista. En aquest estudi, fem servir aquestes dues tecnologies per crear una arquitectura híbrida per ajudar al triatge de víctimes en escenaris d’emergència. L’habitual falta d’una infrastructura de comunicacions, i els escassos recursos fan d’aquest tipus d’escenari el lloc perfecte per treure tot el potencial de les DTNs i de les WSNs. En aquesta tesi, primer fem una mirada general a l’arquitectura, com les dues tecnologies funcionaran juntes, i com s’intercanviaran dades fent servir tecnologies d’Agents Mòbils (MA). Després, agafarem la construcció d’itinerari explícit dels MAs tradicionals i l’aplicarem als MAs funcionant sobre WSNs, amb les seves restriccions de còmput i de bateria. En tercer lloc, extendrem aquesta estructura d’itinerari explícit per funcionar amb clústers de WSNs, xarxes totalment autònomes amb els seus serveis de monitorització, amb l’única limitació de no poder ser més grans de 32 nodes. Tot això recolzat per proves i resultats que demostren la seva viabilitat i utilitat. Per acabar, presentem dues propostes teòriques, una per accedir i recuperar serveis <b>remots</b> en WSNs grans, i una altra per proporcionar control d’accés als nodes d’aquest tipus de xarxes. In this thesis, {{we propose}} an automated real-time monitoring system for victims in Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs). New networking solutions like Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) or Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) offer {{a wide array}} of opportunities in hostile environments where access to communications is either non-existent or broken. Due to the flexibility of WSNs, and their almost effortless field deployment, they can easily reach unexplored or unfriendly areas, monitor their surroundings and send back useful information. DTNs on their hand, can substitute a slow and high latency infrastructure based network without needing it, just using nearby resources opportunistically. In this study, we use this two technologies to create an hybrid architecture to help in the triaging of victims in emergency scenarios. The, usually, lack of a communication’s infrastructure, and the scarcity of resources, make this kind of scenarios a perfect place to obtain the most of DTNs and WSNs. In this thesis, we firstly present an overview of the architecture, how the two technologies are going to work together, and how they will exchange data using Mobile Agent (MA) technologies. Then, we take the explicit itinerary construction from traditional MAs and apply it to MAs working on wireless sensor nodes, with their resource restrictions and battery issues. Thirdly, we extend this itinerary structure to support WSNs clusters, fully autonomous networks with their own monitoring services, with the only limitation of not being larger than 32 nodes. This contributions are supported by tests and results which prove their feasibility and usability. Finally, we present two theoretical approaches, one to retrieve remote services in large WSNs, and another to provide access control for the nodes used in this kind of networks...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{have played}} a key role in the development of the Earth’s atmosphere. Without atmospheric particles rainfall would be nonexistent and the climate would be very different. However, anthropogenic emissions have changed the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols significantly through emissions of particles and precursor gases, particularly since the industrial revolution. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that atmospheric aerosols, both natural and anthropogenic, do not only influence Earth’s climate, but also have adverse effects on human health, ecosystems, as well as on air quality. The global distribution of the aerosols is very uneven; therefore atmospheric particles have very different concentrations and composition depending on the region. In southern Europe, and in particular in the western Mediterranean region, the meteorological conditions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation, together with the abrupt topography around the Mediterranean Sea, hinder aerosol dispersion and prevent atmospheric wet-scavenging processes. Moreover, Mediterranean region is highly influenced by both anthropogenic emissions from shipping, power generation, industrial processes and road traffic, among others sources, and natural emissions from African dust outbreaks, soil resuspension, wildfires, sea spray, and vegetation. All these particular and complex atmospheric dynamics result in higher concentrations of aerosols around the Mediterranean Basin than in northern Europe. A detailed study of the physical, optical and chemical properties of the continental background aerosols measured at Montsec (MSC) monitoring station is presented in this work. The MSC mountain site (1570 m a. s. l.) was established during the development of this thesis; it is located in the western Mediterranean and became a member of the GAW (Global Atmosphere Watch) network in 2014. Aerosol properties (particle mass (PM), particle number (N), absorption (σap), scattering (σsp) and chemical composition) from MSC were found to be comparable in magnitude to those from other remote sites in Europe, when removing African dust outbreaks influence. This suggests that a continental background designation for MSC site is applicable. Nevertheless, some differences between MSC and other European remote sites highlight the importance of new particle formation (NPF) processes as a source of particles, the lower contribution of combustion and industrial processes, the greater impact of shipping emissions, and the higher influence of biogenic emissions. Moreover, these differences corroborate the important contribution of long-range transport of mineral dust and reveal a high impact of regional dust resuspension in the western Mediterranean region. Continental background aerosols in this region are affected by natural and anthropogenic emissions which results in a PM 1 (PM of diameter less than 1 µm) comprised of (in decreasing concentrations) organic matter, sulfate, ammonium, mineral matter, nitrate, elemental carbon, sea salt and trace elements. The foremost PM 1 - 10 (PM of diameter between 1 and 10 µm) constituent is mineral matter, followed by organic matter, nitrate, sulfate, sea salt, ammonium and elemental carbon. Comparison of σap measurements with those of elemental carbon revealed an average mass absorption cross section (MAC) at MSC of 9. 1 m- 2 g- 1. A clear seasonal variation is observed for the majority of the aerosol parameters measured at MSC, with the highest values in summer and the lowest in winter, except for nitrate, in agreement with previous studies in the western Mediterranean. The reduced human activity at the weekend is reflected in the concentrations of PM 1 and BC with a delay of one day (minimum on Sunday and Monday), which confirms that MSC is located at a sufficient distance from direct anthropogenic emissions, although it is still affected by them. The intra-day variation of PMx, BC, σsp and PM 1 major inorganic components (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and chloride) shows poorly defined daily patterns in summer but clearer in winter, whereas concentrations of N and submicron organic aerosol show marked diurnal cycles throughout the year and regardless of the air mass origin, with a clear increase around midday. Els aerosols atmosfèrics han jugat un paper crucial en el desenvolupament de l’atmosfera terrestre. Sense les partícules atmosfèriques la pluja no hauria existit i el clima seria molt diferent. No obstant això, les emissions antropogèniques han canviat de forma significativa la composició química dels aerosols atmosfèrics degut a l’emissió de partícules i de gasos precursors. A més a més, nombrosos estudis han demostrat que els aerosols atmosfèrics, tant naturals com antropogènics, no només influencien el clima de la Terra, sinò que també provoquen efectes perjudicials per la salut humana, els ecosistemes i la qualitat de l’aire. En aquesta tesi doctoral es presenta un estudi detallat de les propietats físiques, òptiques i químiques dels aerosols de fons continental mitjançant les mesures realitzades a l’estació del Montsec (MSC, 1570 m s. n. m.). Aquesta estació de muntanya està situada a l’oest del Mediterrani, es va establir durant el desenvolupament d’aquesta tesi i forma part de la xarxa GAW (Global Atmosphere Watch) des de 2014. Les propietats dels aerosols (massa (PM), nombre (N), absorció (σap), dispersió (σsp) i composició química) mesurades al MSC van presentar magnituds comparables a les obtingudes a altres llocs <b>remots</b> d’Europa, una vegada eliminada la influència de les intrusions de pols sahariana. Per tant, la designació de fons continental és aplicable per a l’estació del MSC. Tanmateix, algunes diferències entre les propietats mesurades al MSC i les mesurades a altres estacions remotes europees van revelar que els processos de formació de noves partícules (angl., new particle formation, NPF) com a font de partícules són molt importants a la regió oest del Mediterrani. També van destacar que els processos industrials i de combustió tenen una menor contribució a la matèria particulada (angl., particulate matter, PM) ambiental, mentre que les emissions biogèniques i dels vaixells tenen un major impacte. A més a més, van corroborar que el transport de llarga distància de la pols del Sàhara és la font natural de partícules més important en aquesta regió, i van revelar que la pols de resuspensió regional té un impacte considerable...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of using inductive links for a vehicle application where wiring an electronic control unit (ECU) to the sensors or detectors become unfeasible or unpractical. The selected application is occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. Two ways of using inductive links are considered: 1) passive detection {{of the state of}} the seat detectors from a readout unit and 2) remote power transmission to a detection unit and subsequent data transmission by a wireless transceiver. Inductive links have been widely proposed for sensors placed in harsh or inaccessible environments, where wiring is unpractical. Usually, the sensor forms part of an LC resonant network. The resonant frequency is dependent on the quantity to be measured and is estimated from a coupled reader. We propose the use of inductive links for switch-type sensors. First, a comprehensive analysis for an arbitrary number of sensors is presented. Secondly, we show {{the feasibility of}} using inductive links for occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. The state (open or closed) of the related sensors was attained by first measuring the equivalent resistance of the readout inductor and then estimating its resonant frequency. Commercial ferrite-core coils were used to increase the detection distance. Experimental tests were carried out using an impedance analyzer connected to the readout coil and commercial seat detectors connected to the resonant network. The detection of the sensors¿ state was feasible at all tested distances, from 0. 5 cm up to 3 cm. The second proposed alternative consists on remote powering, via an inductive link, the electronic device where the seat detectors are connected. Resonant coupled coils were used in order to increase the powering distance range and the power efficiency. Working frequency was restricted to 150 kHz. Commercial small-size magnetic-core coils were selected and their resistance and quality factor over frequency measured. At the receiving network, a rectifier and a voltage regulator were required to provide a DC voltage supply to the autonomous sensor. Four type of voltage regulators were compared from the point of view of the system power efficiency. Both a theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented. Results showed that shunt regulators provide the best power efficiency over the other alternatives, which are linear series and switching buck and boost regulators. On the other hand boost regulators led to an unstable behavior of the system in most of the cases. The use of rechargeable batteries was also considered in order to increase the power efficiency. Achieved power efficiencies were around 40 %, 25 % and 10 % for coil distances of 1 cm, 1. 5 cm and 2 cm respectively. Experimental tests also showed that the autonomous sensor was properly powered up to coil distances of 2. 5 cm. Finally, different types of coils were assessed and the effect of metallic structures analyzed for the intended application. The final aim is, on the one hand, to increase the powering distance and, on the other hand, to minimize the influence of the metallic structures. Three different coil types, two with ferrite-core coils and one with an air-core coil were used. Numerical results showed that ferrite-core coils are less affected by the presence of metallic structures. Experimental results showed that the air-core coils provided a larger powering distance thanks to its much larger winding diameter. However, when approaching a metallic plate, the transferred power with the air-core coils to the load was insufficient for the intended application. On the other hand, ferrite-core coils barely noticed the presence of the metallic plate. As for the passive detection, the presence of a metallic plate below the primary air-core coil slightly affected the measured resistance values but detection for the four possible states of the seat detectors was still possible. Algunes aplicacions a l'entorn de l'automòbil no són possibles si no és mitjançant la connexió sense fils dels seus dispositius a causa que el cablejat és difícil o inviable. Alguns exemples els trobem en el monitoratge de sensors situats en parts rotatòries, com les rodes, o en elements extraïbles, com els seients. Els sistemes de monitoratge de la pressió de l'aire en les rodes (TPMS) són d'obligat compliment als EUA i ho seran en breu també als països membres de la UE per als vehicles de categories M 1 o N 1 aprovats a partir de l' 1 de novembre de 2012 o per als vehicles matriculats a partir de l' 1 de novembre de 2014. Actualment, els sistemes TPMS existents al mercat estan alimentats per piles. Amb tot, la vida útil exigida per a les bateries és d'uns 10 anys, esdevenint el seu ús un autèntic repte. Un altre element en contra de l'ús de bateries és la directiva 2006 / 66 /CE que limita el nombre màxim permès en els vehicles. D'altra banda, moltes furgonetes o mini furgonetes i vehicles familiars incorporen seients extraïbles amb l'objectiu d'aprofitar al màxim l'espai interior. Alguns models comercials incorporen en el seient extraïble el detector de cinturó de seguretat. Per evitar el cablejat, existeixen sistemes de detecció passiva mitjançant acoblament inductiu. A partir del present any 2012, una regulació de la agència nord-americana NHTSA requereix de l'ús de coixins de seguretat intel·ligents per minimitzar els riscos en nens. Aquests seients intel·ligents haurien de detectar si el passatger és un adult, una cadira infantil o si està lliure per evitar problemes ocorreguts en anterioritat amb els sistemes coixí de seguretat. Els sensors usats per a aquests coixins de seguretat intel·ligents requeririen d'energia per operar. Una opció per als seients extraïbles és la transmissió de potència via acoblament inductiu des del terra del xassís del vehicle fins al seient. També és possible usar l'acoblament inductiu per detectar l'estat de diversos sensors existents en els seients extraïbles mitjançant detecció passiva. Precisament, la detecció d'ocupació i de cinturó de seguretat en seients extraïbles ha estat seleccionada per aplicar la investigació present que consisteix, d'una banda, en el monitoratge de sensors de tipus commutat (dos possibles estats) via acoblament inductiu i, per una altra, en la transmissió mitjançant el mateix principi físic de la potència necessària per alimentar els sensors autònoms <b>remots.</b> En els dos casos, una primera bobina es fixaria en el seient extraïble, connectada als sensors, i una segona bobina se situaria sota la primera, en el terra del vehicle...|$|R

40|$|To be honest, we librarians are {{sometimes}} our own worst enemies {{when it comes}} to creating usable websites. Too much technical jargon, confusing navigational structures, and generally bad design plague many library sites (including my own at various times), and as a result, we as a profession devote quite a lot of text and talk to usability studies and web design guidelines. But beyond our own shortcomings, there is a more insidious threat to website usability: campus IT. Or for public libraries, the council IT department. The level of control that an external IT department wields over your web presence impacts how well you can respond to the needs of your <b>remot...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The music {{technology}} {{industry is}} only recently {{beginning to realize}} the potential of wireless communication technology for control and communication of data for music and multimedia applications. A new breed of musical devices is starting to integrate technology that allows the wireless transmission of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) messages, real-time audio and video data, control data for performance synchronization, and commands for remote hardware control of these instruments. The Yamaha Disklavier Mark IV piano, which debuted in 2004, is the first instrument with wireless capabilities built-in [1]. It communicates via the 802. 11 b protocol (WiFi), which allows the piano to transmit and receive information to/from nearby wireless controllers. The piano originally comes with two such controllers: the handheld Pocket <b>Remot...</b>|$|E
40|$|NAVAL ENGINEER This thesis {{explores the}} concept of welding in a space {{environment}} {{with the use of}} automation. Since the amount of time astronauts can work outside a spacecraft is limited, future construction and repair tasks will likely be assisted by automation. It is also likely that remote space welding will be needed for the construction of large-scale space structures in earth orbit as well as for lunar and martian ground-based structures. Due to the complex nature of the tasks to be accomplished, the equipment will probably not be fully autonomous but instead supervised by a human operator. The welding fabrication problem in space is examined in a broad sense, including some of the considerations for designing a human supervisory <b>remot...</b>|$|E
