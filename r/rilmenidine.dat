40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of <b>rilmenidine</b> with those of {{amlodipine}} on blood pressure, glucose metabolism, plasma lipid concentration and fibrinolysis parameters. DESIGN: A four-month randomized double-blind, parallel group study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Obese hypertensive patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (> or = 2. 3 mmol/l) and impaired glucose tolerance (OMS-ADA) were included (n = 52). A placebo run-in period of 2 weeks was followed by 4 months of double-blind treatment with either <b>rilmenidine</b> or amlodipine. Blood pressure was recorded using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral glucose tolerance test RESULTS: Of the 52 patients recruited, 47 (21 <b>rilmenidine</b> and 26 amlodipine) completed the 4 -month treatment period. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) with the two anti-hypertensive treatments (<b>rilmenidine</b> - 13. 9 /- 13. 5 mmHg; amlodipine - 17. 6 /- 15. 0 mmHg). Insulin concentrations under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load did not change significantly after treatment in both groups.

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{effects of}} long-term treatment with <b>rilmenidine</b> compared with atenolol on lipid and glucose metabolism and cardiovascular remodeling in hypertension. Material and methods. 37 patients with hypertension were randomized to <b>rilmenidine</b> 1 - 2 mg/day or atenolol 50 - 100 mg/day for 26 weeks. Standard oral {{glucose tolerance test}} with a parallel measurement of insulin and glucose levels was performed. The “areas under the curve” (AUC) for insulin and glucose were calculated. Plasma lipids, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and intima-media thickness (IMT) were measured. Brachial artery diameter during reactive hyperemia {{was used to test}} endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDVD). Results. Blood pressure reduction was equally achieved in both treatment arms. The fasting glucose level increased in the atenolol group from 4. 8 ± 0. 6 to 5. 2 ± 0. 7 mmol/l (p< 0. 01). The AUC of glucose in <b>rilmenidine</b> group decreased from 860 ± 93 to 737 ± 66 mmol/min/l (p< 0. 05), and it increased from 937 ± 86 to 989 ± 88 mmol/min/l (p< 0. 05) in the atenolol group. <b>Rilmenidine</b> showed a positive effect on lipid levels, while in the atenolol group a significant decrease of high density lipoprotein was observed. LVMI decreased with <b>rilmenidine</b> by 9. 6 % (p< 0. 05) and by 6, 9 % (not significantly) with atenolol.

40|$|Aim. To {{estimate}} an efficiency and tolerability of <b>rilmenidine</b> in hypertensive patients with {{different types of}} blood pressure (BP) daily profile – dipper and non-dipper. Methods. 23 patients with essential hypertension (EH), I-II stages, were included into the study. They were treated with rilmeneidine 1 mg daily during one month.

The effect of <b>rilmenidine</b> were compared with those induced by a diuretic drug (hydrochlorothiazide). After 1 month of placebo, 24 patients with essential hypertension were randomly allocated to either <b>rilmenidine</b> 1 mg once daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that an imbalance of the {{autonomic nervous system}} {{is involved in the}} genesis of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death during myocardial ischemia. In the present study we investigated the effects of clonidine and <b>rilmenidine,</b> two centrally acting sympathomodulatory drugs, on an experimental model of centrally induced sympathetic hyperactivity in pentobarbital-anesthetized New Zealand albino rabbits of either sex (2 - 3 kg, N = 89). We also compared the effects of clonidine and <b>rilmenidine</b> with those of propranolol, a ß-blocker, known to induce protective cardiovascular effects in patients with ischemic heart disease. Central sympathetic stimulation was achieved by intracerebroventricular injection of the excitatory amino acid L-glutamate (10 µmol), associated with inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis with L-NAME (40 mg/kg, iv). Glutamate triggered ventricular arrhythmia and persistent ST-segment shifts in the ECG, indicating myocardial ischemia. The intracisternal administration of clonidine (1 µg/kg) and <b>rilmenidine</b> (30 µg/kg) or of a nonhypotensive dose of <b>rilmenidine</b> (3 µg/kg) decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia (25, 14 and 25 %, respectively, versus 60 % in controls) and reduced the mortality rate from 40 % to 0. 0, 0. 0 and 12 %, respectively. The total number of ventricular premature beats per minute fell from 30 ± 9 in the control group to 7 ± 3, 6 ± 3 and 2 ± 2, respectively. Intravenous administration of clonidine (10 µg/kg), <b>rilmenidine</b> (300 µg/kg) or propranolol (500 µg/kg) elicited similar protective effects.

Main methods—The effects of α-methyldopa or <b>rilmenidine</b> on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and their variability were investigated in rats that received liquid diet without or with ethanol (5 % w/v) for 12 weeks. To evaluate the effect of each drug on cardiovascular autonomic control (BP and HR variability) in the absence or presence of ethanol, three time-domain indices of hemodynamic variability were measured: (i) standard deviation of mean arterial pressure (SDMAP), (ii) standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals, and (iii) root mean square of successive differences in R-R intervals. Key findings—In liquid diet-fed control rats, i. p. <b>rilmenidine</b> (600 μg/kg) or α-methyldopa (100 mg/kg) reduced BP along with decreases and increases, respectively, in HR. Both drugs {{had no effect on}} HR variability but reduced BP variability (SDMAP), suggesting a reduced vasomotor sympathetic tone. Ethanol feeding attenuated reductions in BP and SDMAP evoked by α-methyldopa but not by <b>rilmenidine.</b> Significance—We conclude that chronic ethanol preferentially compromises α 2 - but not I 1 - receptor-mediated hypotension in female rats probably via modulation of vasomotor sympathetic activity.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the acute effects of centrally acting antihypertensive {{drugs on the}} microcirculation of pentobarbital-anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The effects of the sympatho-inhibitory agents clonidine and <b>rilmenidine,</b> known to activate both alpha 2 -adrenoceptors and nonadrenergic I 1 -imidazoline binding sites (I 1 BS) in the central nervous system, were compared to those of dicyclopropylmethyl-(4, 5 -dimethyl- 4, 5 -dihydro- 3 H -pyrrol- 2 -yl) -amine hydrochloride (LNP 509), which selectively binds to the I 1 BS. Terminal mesenteric arterioles were observed by intravital microscopy. Activation of the central sympathetic system with L-glutamate (125 µg, ic) induced marked vasoconstriction of the mesenteric microcirculation (27 ± 3 %; N = 6, P < 0. 05). In contrast, the marked hypotensive and bradycardic effects elicited by intracisternal injection of clonidine (1 µg), <b>rilmenidine</b> (7 µg) and LNP 509 (60 µg) were accompanied by significant increases in arteriolar diameter (12 ± 1, 25 ± 10 and 21 ± 4 %, respectively; N = 6, P < 0. 05). The vasodilating effects of <b>rilmenidine</b> and LNP 509 were two-fold {{higher than those of}} clonidine, although they induced an identical hypotensive effect. Central sympathetic inhibition elicited by baclofen (1 µg, ic), a GABA B receptor agonist, also resulted in vasodilation of the SHR microvessels. The acute administration of clonidine, <b>rilmenidine</b> and LNP 509 also induced a significant decrease of cardiac output, whereas a decrease in systemic vascular resistance was observed only after <b>rilmenidine</b> and LNP 509. We conclude that the normalization of blood pressure in SHR induced by centrally acting antihypertensive agents is paralleled by important vasodilation of the mesenteric microcirculation. This effect is more pronounced with substances acting preferentially (<b>rilmenidine)</b> or exclusively (LNP 509) upon I 1 BS than with those presenting important alpha 2 -adrenergic activity (clonidine) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the cardiovascular effects of <b>rilmenidine,</b> moxonidine and clonidine in conscious wild-type and D 79 N α 2 A-adrenoceptor mice. The in vitro pharmacology of these agonists was determined at recombinant (human) α 2 -adrenoceptors and at endogenous (dog) α 2 A-adrenoceptors. In wild-type mice, <b>rilmenidine,</b> moxonidine (100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and clonidine (30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) dose-dependently decreased {{blood pressure and}} heart rate. In D 79 N α 2 A-adrenoceptor mice, responses to <b>rilmenidine</b> and moxonidine {{did not differ from}} vehicle control. Clonidine-induced hypotension was absent, but dose-dependent hypertension and bradycardia were observed. In wild-type mice, responses to moxonidine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) were antagonized by the non-selective, non-imidazoline α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, RS- 79948 - 197 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). Affinity estimates (pKi) at human α 2 A-, α 2 B- and α 2 C-adrenoceptors, respectively, were: <b>rilmenidine</b> (5. 80, 5. 76 and 5. 33), moxonidine (5. 37, < 5 and < 5) and clonidine (7. 21, 7. 16 and 6. 87). In a [35 S]-GTPγS incorporation assay, moxonidine and clonidine were α 2 A-adrenoceptor agonists (pEC 50 /intrinsic activity relative to noradrenaline) : moxonidine (5. 74 / 0. 85) and clonidine (7. 57 / 0. 32). In dog saphenous vein, concentration-dependent contractions were observed (pEC 50 /intrinsic activity relative to noradrenaline) : <b>rilmenidine</b> (5. 83 / 0. 70), moxonidine (6. 48 / 0. 98) and clonidine (7. 22 / 0. 83). Agonist-independent affinities were obtained with RS- 79948 - 197. Thus, expression of α 2 A-adrenoceptors is a prerequisite for the cardiovascular effects of moxonidine and <b>rilmenidine</b> in conscious mice. There was no evidence of I 1 -imidazoline receptor-mediated effects. The ability of these compounds to act as α 2 A-adrenoceptor agonists in vitro supports this conclusion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of the {{centrally}} acting antihypertensive drugs <b>rilmenidine,</b> moxonidine, clonidine and guanabenz on sympathetic tone with their effects on noradrenaline release in the cerebral cortex. In particular, the hypothesis was tested that <b>rilmenidine</b> and moxonidine, due to their high affinity for sympatho-inhibitory imidazoline I 1 receptors and low affinity for α 2 -adrenoceptors, lower sympathetic tone without causing an α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of cerebrocortical noradrenaline release. In rats anaesthetized with urethane, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and the concentration of noradrenaline in arterial blood plasma was determined. The release of noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex was estimated by microdialysis. Intravenous administration of <b>rilmenidine</b> (30, 100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), moxonidine (10, 30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), clonidine (1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and guanabenz (1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) led to dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia; the plasma noradrenaline concentration also decreased. After the two highest doses, all four drugs lowered noradrenaline release in the prefrontal cortex. At doses eliciting equal hypotensive and sympatho-inhibitory responses, <b>rilmenidine</b> and moxonidine inhibited cerebral cortical noradrenaline release at least as much as clonidine and guanabenz. The results show that <b>rilmenidine</b> and moxonidine lower cerebrocortical noradrenaline release at doses similar to those which cause sympatho-inhibition. This effect was probably due to an α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of the firing of locus coeruleus neurons and, in addition, to presynaptic inhibition of noradrenaline release at the level of the axon terminals in the cortex. The results argue against the hypothesis that <b>rilmenidine</b> and moxonidine, due to their selectivity for sympatho-inhibitory I 1 imidazoline receptors, do not suppress noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system...|$|E

Patients not satisfactorily controlled received a combined therapy on the same doses of the two drugs used. <b>Rilmenidine</b> and hydrochlorothiazide induced a significant reduction (p = 0. 01) of supine and erect systolic/diastolic blood pressure 23 hours after drug intake with no change in heart rate. This effect was due {{to a reduction in}} cardiac output (bioimpedance method) significant (p = 0. 05) only for <b>rilmenidine.</b> Both drugs controlled the increase of effort systolic blood pressure in comparison with placebo on systemic vascular resistance treadmill exercise testing. Effort cardiac output was increased by each treatment in comparison with baseline values. Both at rest and on exertion, there was no effect on systemic vascular resistance induced by the two drugs. In a second group of 10 {{patients with}} moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 105 to 115 mmHg), <b>rilmenidine</b> 1 mg was administered in order to evaluate its efficacy and hemodynamic effects (bioimpedance and radionuclide ventriculography), at rest and during a lying cycloergometer effort test. The drug induced a significant decrease in blood pressure at rest and on exertion four hours after drug intake. This effect was due to a reduction (p = 0. 05) in systemic vascular resistance, whereas cardiac output and heart rate remained unchanged. Our results show that the reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure induced by <b>rilmenidine</b> 1 mg is comparable with that induced by the well-known antihypertensive drug hydrochlorothiazide in mild hypertension.

We conclude that Imidazoline receptors as well as α 2 receptors are involved in morphine withdrawal symptoms and yohimbine as an α 2 -antagonist can suppress at least some effects of imidazoline agonists. It is suggested that α 2 -receptors are located down-stream to imidazoline receptors and their blockade can inhibit imidazoline effects...|$|E
40|$|The adverse {{biochemical}} {{and structural}} effects of antihypertensive drugs {{over a long}} period (clonidine, methyldopa, <b>rilmenidine,</b> amlodipine, ramipril) on hepatic tissue has been examined in this study. The results are considered to be beneficial for the identification of indications and contraindications in hypertensive patients. Severe bile duct proliferation, portal inflammation, interface hepatitis, focal necrosis and hepatocyte degeneration were demonstrated in the clonidine and amlodipine groups, which had higher oxidant parameters, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine amino transferase and lactate dehydrogenase activity and a higher amount of 8 -OH Gua. In the group receiving <b>rilmenidine,</b> all the histopathological findings were the same as those in the clonidine and amlodipine groups, except for bile duct proliferation and interface hepatitis. On histopathological examination of the cell anatomy, it was shown that methyldopa and ramipril caused mild liver damage. While clonidine and amlodipine gave rise to severe liver damage, <b>rilmenidine</b> caused moderate damage, and methyldopa and ramipril led to mild loss of liver function...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} chronic subcutaneous treatment with centrally-acting antihypertensive agents moxonidine, <b>rilmenidine</b> and clonidine on the baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) in conscious normotensive rabbits over 3 weeks. Infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside were performed at week 0 and at weeks 1 and 3 of treatment to determine mean arterial pressure (MAP) -HR baroreflex relationships. A second curve was performed after intravenous methscopolamine to determine the sympathetic baroreflex relationship. The vagal component of the reflex was determined by subtracting the sympathetic curve from the intact curve. Clonidine and moxonidine (both 1 mg/kg/day), and <b>rilmenidine</b> (5 mg/kg/day), reduced MAP by 13  3, 15  2 and 13  2 mmHg, respectively, but {{had no effect on}} HR over the 3 -week treatment period. Whilst all three antihypertensive agents shifted baroreflex curves to the left, parallel to the degree of hypotension, moxonidine and <b>rilmenidine</b> decreased the vagal contribution to the baroreflex by decreasing the HR range of the reflex whilst moxonidine also increased sympathetic baroreflex range and sensitivity. By contrast clonidine had little chronic effect on the cardiac baroreflex. The present study shows that second generation agents moxonidine and <b>rilmenidine</b> but not first generation agent clonidine chronically shift the balance of baroreflex control of HR toward greater sympathetic and lesser vagal influences. These changes if translated to hypertensive subjects, may not be particularly helpful in view of the already reduced vagal contribution in hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Rabbits {{were treated}} with {{intravenous}} clonidine (8 μmol kg- 1 day- 1), guanabenz (20 μmol kg- 1 day- 1), <b>rilmenidine</b> (80 μmol kg- 1 day- 1) or vehicle via osmotic minipumps. After 6 days treatment mean arterial pressure (MAP), pressor responses to intravenous α-methyl noradrenaline and depressor responses to intracisternal clonidine were studied, and [3 H]-yohimbine binding to forebrain and hindbrain examined in vitro. Clonidine, guanabenz and <b>rilmenidine</b> had similar effects on MAP and caused a similar attenuation of the depressor response to intracisternal clonidine, but only guanabenz attenuated pressor responses to intravenous α-methyl noradrenaline. <b>Rilmenidine</b> {{had no effect on}} [3 H]-yohimbine binding to brain membranes. Clonidine treatment decreased binding in hindbrain while guanabenz treatment decreased binding in both fore- and hindbrain. Thus, the depressor effects of chronic treatment did not correlate with the effects on [3 H]-yohimbine binding sites in rabbit brain suggesting that the blood pressure lowering effects of many centrally acting antihypertensive drugs are not necessarily dependent on binding to the α 2 -adrenoceptor site labelled by [3 H]-yohimbine...|$|E
40|$|Background: In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} treatment with chronic antihypertensive drugs (clonidine, methyldopa, amlodipine, ramipril and <b>rilmenidine)</b> on oxidant-antioxidant parameters and toxic effects on DNA in rat uterus tissue. In addition, uterus tissues were examined histopathologically. Materials and Methods: A total of 36 albino Wistar rats were divided into the following six groups: 0. 075 mg/kg clonidine group; 100 mg/kg methyldopa group; 2 mg/kg amlodipine group; 2. 5 mg/kg ramipril group; 0. 5 mg/kg <b>rilmenidine</b> group; and the healthy group. Rats underwent chronic drug administration for 30 days and at the end, biochemical and histopathological examinations were performed. All data were subjected to one-way ANOVA test. Results: We divided these drugs into the following three groups according to their effects on rat uteri: (I) mild negative effects (clonidine), (II) moderate negative effects (<b>rilmenidine,</b> methyldopa) and (III) drugs which had severe negative effects (amlodipine, ramipril). Conclusion: These data may help with selection of antihypertensive drugs, {{in order to determine}} which drugs have the lowest toxicity in pregnant and non-pregnant (pre-pregnancy) women...|$|E
40|$|Aim.   To assess {{antihypertensive}} {{efficacy of}} <b>rilmenidine</b> (Albarel, EGIS, Hungary) {{and its effect}} on cognitive function in elderly hypertensive patients. Material and methods. 30 elderly (in average 68 y. o.) hypertensive patients were observed. Each patient received therapy with <b>rilmenidine</b> 2 mg daily during 6 months. 24 hours monitoring of blood pressure before and after therapy was done in each patient. In order to assess cognitive disorders all patients passed neuropsychological tests, which allowed revealing damages of memory, attention, concentration, mental efficiency and psychomotor functions. Raten tests, Veksler test, vocal activity, memory (10 words), serial counting and kinetic probes were used. Results. After 24 weeks of monotherapy with <b>rilmenidine,</b> decrease in daily average systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 7. 2 % (p< 0. 01) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 5. 5 % (p< 0. 05) was observed. Therapy with <b>rilmenidine</b> showed decrease in daily average burden by SBP and by DBP (by 25. 3 % and 18. 8 % respectively; p< 0. 05) and daily average time index of hypertension for SBP and DBP (by 32. 5 and 60. 6 % respectively; p< 0. 05) According to the results of neuropsychological tests at the end of treatment, average time for Raten test completion decreased by 16. 7 % (p< 0. 05), and for Veksler test completion – by 15. 6 % (p< 0. 05). At the same time significant increase in vocal activity of patients is noted: number of words at free associations tests, verbs and plants denomination have grown by 5. 8 %, 5. 1 % and 6. 3 % respectively (p< 0. 05); number of mistakes in these tests decreased respectively by 71. 4 %, 50 % and 33. 3 % (p< 0. 05). Positive dynamics in characteristics of memory: number of words at first and last immediate and postponed reproduction increased respectively by 36. 4 %, 21. 6 % and 14. 1 % (p< 0. 05),  average time of serial counting and average time of memorization decreased respectively by 13. 2 % and 31. 8 % (p< 0. 05). Velocity in both hands increased, which was observed both in tests on grip and fingering, and on reciprocal coordination. Conclusion. Well-defined antihypertensive effect of <b>rilmenidine</b> in elderly AH patients is accompanied by significant improvement of cognitive functions. This greatly expands opportunities of treatment with <b>rilmenidine</b> in this age group. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{surge in}} {{arterial}} pressure during arousal in the waking period {{is thought to}} be largely due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In this study we compared in SHR the effects of chronic administration of the centrally acting sympatholytic agent <b>rilmenidine</b> with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on the rate of rise and power of the surge in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that occurs with arousal associated with the onset of night. Recordings were made using radiotelemetry in 17 adult SHR before and after treatment with <b>rilmenidine</b> (2 mg/kg/day), perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle in the drinking water for 2 weeks. <b>Rilmenidine</b> reduced MAP by 7. 2 ± 1. 7 mmHg while perindopril reduced MAP by 19 ± 3 mmHg. Double logistic curve fit analysis showed that the rate and power of increase in systolic pressure during the transition from light to dark was reduced by 50 % and 65 %, respectively, but had no effect on diastolic pressure. <b>Rilmenidine</b> also reduced blood pressure variability in the autonomic frequency in the active period as assessed by spectral analysis which is consistent with reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity. Perindopril had no effect on the rate or power of the arousal surge in either systolic or diastolic pressure. These results suggest that the arousal induced surge in blood pressure can largely be reduced by an antihypertensive agent that inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, while effective in reducing blood pressure, does not alter the rate or power of the surge associated with arousal...|$|E
