The reason for a problem or a contemplated refusal most frequently given by nurses was that they disagreed with the medication policy (34 % and 35 %, respectively). The reason for a refusal most frequently given by the gynaecologists, internists and nurses was that the nurses themselves were {{of the opinion that}} they did not have the necessary authorisation (95 %, 67 %, and 62 %, respectively).

40|$|In England and Wales, {{under the}} {{provisions}} of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005, the competent adult’s right to refuse future treatment has been placed onto a statutory footing in the form of Advance Decisions to Refuse Treatment (ADRTs). Two legal principles that are relevant to advance decisions involving <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> life-sustaining treatment are (i) the sanctity of life and (ii) autonomy. These 2 principles may often come into conflict when competent adults make contemporaneous or advance <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> life-sustaining medical treatment.

40|$|Discrimination and {{harassment}} of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) physicians from their colleagues and superiors are known. However {{there is little}} knowledge about the patients’ attitudes and discrimination toward physicians. A cross sectional Internet survey was conducted in urban Croatian regions. The {{participants were asked to}} answer questions regarding their socio-demographic status, the Attitudes Towards Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (ATLG), and whether they would refuse to see a LGB physician and, if so, why. Of the 1004 participants, 8. 8 % said they would refuse a male GB physician while 7. 9 % would refuse a female LB physician, and 7. 3 % would refuse both. The two most common reasons for discriminating were: “disaccord with political or religious beliefs” and “fear of being sexually harassed”. A logistical regression model showed that male sex, higher ATLG score and higher age were associated with more <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> male GB physicians. Also higher age, higher ATLG score were associated with more <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> female LB physicians, while personal contact with LGB people was associated with less <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> both groups. The observed prevalence of discrimination is significant. The results suggest that discrimination is based on emotional reasons and stereotypical beliefs. Educational efforts should be directed towards changing misconceptions about LGB people...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{situations in}} which refusal will occur and examined the refusal strategies and corresponding linguistic forms that can be employed to react to various refusal situations in Chinese culture. Since refusal is an act in response to other acts, acts that prompt refusals {{play an important role}} in the choices <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> strategies. Therefore, this paper categorizes situations <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> according to the initiating acts <b>of</b> <b>refusal.</b> Based on 160 video clips collected from five television series, this paper found that refusal is initiated by four types of acts: request, offer, invitation, and suggestion. Each type can be subcategorized in terms of their different communicative functions. The study can facilitate the instruction <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> to learners <b>of</b> Chinese from multiple pers-pectives. Although there are a number <b>of</b> studies <b>of</b> <b>refusal,</b> most <b>of</b> them deal with either English or Japanese (e. g., Morrow 1995, Gass & Houck 1999).

The problem of this research is the change of feeling from Landon to Jamie through refusals. In collecting the data, the writer used two stages, she watched the film several times, and she transcribed it. In doing the analysis, she also used four stages. First, she identified the first pair <b>of</b> <b>refusal.</b> Second, she identified the refusal utterances. Third, she identified the indirect refusal utterances and the last she analysed them. In this research, the writer found that in the communication, the main characters used the first pair <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> based on Beebe and Takahashi (1985). The <b>refusals</b> are <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> suggestion, request, and invitation.
