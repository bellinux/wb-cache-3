2500|$|Holter Dam was relicensed by {{the federal}} {{government}} in 1997. Until that year, a steering committee composed of state fish and wildlife experts, the Montana Power Company, the United States Bureau of Reclamation, the United States Forest Service, and representatives of agricultural irrigators and sportsmen managed Holter Dam to optimize recreation and to minimize negative impacts on fish and wildlife. The dam's owners were required to conduct an environmental impact statement as part of their 1997 relicensure, however. This document led to new guidelines, adopted by PPL, which requires the dam's owner to not only continue to operate Holter Dam as a run-of-the-river dam but also to maintain water levels behind the dam within a certain range. In January 2011, as part of its management efforts, PPL agreed to donate $1.2 million to fund 41 conservation projects along the Missouri and Madison rivers, which included restoring and increasing <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation</b> along [...] of the Missouri River below Holter Dam and a study of the walleye feeding habits below Holter Dam.|$|E

[...] The reservoir is surrounded by the Beartooth Wildlife Management Area, Gates of the Mountains Game Preserve, Gates of the Mountains Wilderness, and the Sleeping Giant Wilderness Study Area. There are abundant numbers of bald eagles, bighorn sheep, elk, falcons, golden eagles, hawks, mountain goats, osprey, and pelicans in the area. Meriwether Lewis first identified Lewis's woodpecker nearby. Birds of prey can routinely be seen plucking fish from Holter Lake and the Missouri River below the dam. An open-air tourboat offers river-based tours of the Gates of the Mountains. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages much of the surrounding public lands as a Recreation Area. BLM maintains four campgrounds at Holter Lake: Beartooth Landing (accessible only by boat; no land access), Holter Lake, Log Gulch, and Departure Point. BLM also controls access to the river below Holter Dam. BLM reconstructed the Holter Dam Campground in 2007. Conservation projects are also underway at Holter.

40|$|Choice {{experiments}} (CE – {{otherwise known}} as Choice Modelling) have become widespread as an approach to environmental valuation in Australia. There are, however, limited applications that {{have focused on the}} estimation of estuary values. Furthermore, none of the existing valuation studies have addressed catchment management changes in Tasmania. The CE study described in this report aims to elicit community preferences for natural resource management options in the George catchment in north-eastern Tasmania. The survey was administered in different sub-sample locations in Tasmania to assess the trade-offs respondents are willing to make between environmental attributes and costs. Catchment health attributes were the length of native <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation</b> and the number of rare animal and plant species in the George catchment. The area of healthy seagrass beds in the Georges Bay was used as a measure of estuary condition. Results from mixed logit models show that respondents are, on average, willing to pay between $ 3. 47 and $ 5. 11 for a km increase in native <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation</b> and between $ 7. 10 and $ 12. 42 per species for the protection of rare native plants and animals, ceteris paribus.

40|$|The stream {{ecology of}} the East River is {{investigated}} by using the benthic macro-invertebrates as indicator. Samples were taken from 12 selected sites with different environmental conditions from upper reaches to lower reaches. It is found that the biodiversity and bio-community index of benthic invertebrates maintain a relatively high level respectively in the upper reaches and middle reaches of the river, but they are reduced to nearly zero in the lower reaches. The analysis on samples obtained from the Zengjiang Bay and Xizhijiang Oxbow Lake indicates that the major ecological stress is loss of habitats due to reclamation and separation of riparian water from the river. The restoration strategies are suggested accordingly. The strategies include: 1. creating multiple habitats with high habitat diversity, such as riparian lakes, wetlands, backwater and sluggish flow zones and reconnect separated lakes with the river; 2. adjusting the operation scheme of the upstream reservoir to mitigate the impact induced by instantaneous fluctuation of flow discharge; 3. stabilizing river banks, controlling river erosion and protecting the <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to estimate the}} economic value of environmental services provided by restored instream flows in the water-scarce Yaqui River Delta in Mexico. The Yaqui River begins near the U. S. -Mexico border and continues for 400 Â km before reaching the Oviachic dam, but has not reached the nearby Gulf of California for decades due to diversions for irrigation. These diversions have degraded the riparian ecosystem, coastal wetlands, and estuaries. Environmental services provided by restored flows in the Yaqui River would include healthy <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation,</b> wetlands and estuaries, fish and wildlife habitats, non-use values, and recreation. A contingent valuation survey in 40 neighborhoods in the most populated Delta city, Ciudad Obregon, was administered to estimate non-market values of instream uses. Respondents were given a current and hypothetical Delta scenario (the latter assumed restored water flows in the River) and asked a willingness-to-pay (WTP) question regarding purchasing water for environmental flows through higher water bills. Results from 148 in-person interviews indicated that households would pay an average of 73 pesos monthly. WTP was found related to key variables suggested by economic theory and contingent valuation studies elsewhere: income, educational level, {{number of children in}} the household, and initial bid amount. These results will allow decision makers to compare the benefits generated by different water uses, including environmental services, and to manage scarce water resources under a long-term sustainable approach. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{analysed}} {{the spatial}} distribution of Eastern Cottontail () and {{its relationship with the}} habitat attributes of the agro-ecosystems in north-western Italy. We used generalised linear models to analyse the relationship between the occurrence of the cottontail and a series of landscape-level variables. Hierarchical partitioning was used to estimate the independent contribution of these variables. Our analysis showed that cottontail is typically a lowland species, in that it selected municipalities below 400  m a. s. l. and avoided higher elevations. Cottontails were more likely to occur where the edges of meadows and crop fields were higher. This might indicate the importance of these herbaceous habitats in cottontail feeding behaviour and also the significance of edge vegetation in providing cover. In addition, the extent of the hydrographic network positively affected cottontail presence, probably due to the permanent vegetation cover associated with the banks of rivers, streams and channels of the otherwise intensively cultivated and densely inhabited Po Plain. On the other hand, a prevalence of woodlands, tree plantations and large pastures negatively affected cottontail presence. This is surprising, because these habitats usually encourage cottontail presence in their native range. In general, however, cottontails prefer small woodlots and utilise only the edges of forests, while in Italy forests and pastures are large and typically located in hilly and mountain areas generally avoided by this species. In conclusion, our results confirm that the cottontail is an edge species whose presence is encouraged by crop margins, natural herbaceous habitats and extensive hydrographic networks with the associated <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation.</b> These characteristics are common in the Po Plain and are likely to facilitate a further expansion of cottontail...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Impatiens glandulifera is a blacklisted {{invasive}} alien {{plant species}} that exhibits high phenotypic variation along latitudinal gradients in its invaded range in Europe, with {{a preference for}} riparian, roadside and other moist or disturbed habitats. However, limited information exists on how different latitudinal populations perform in contrasting vegetation types. Furthermore, the impact of I. glandulifera litter {{on the performance of}} co-occurring species within different vegetation types has not been assessed. 	Methods In a greenhouse experiment, we compared performances of different latitudinal populations of I. glandulifera in two vegetation types (roadside vs. riverside) and with or without litter using a life-history trait-based approach. 	Key Results Performance of I. glandulifera was much lower in graminoid-dominated roadside vegetation turfs than in the herbaceous-dominated <b>riverside</b> <b>vegetation</b> turfs. Although the northern plants exhibited faster onset of flowering, they had lower growth rates, height at maturity and biomass than individuals from central and southern latitudes. Especially the northern plants had lower performance in the highly competitive roadside vegetation compared {{to the rest of the}} populations. Interestingly, I. glandulifera litter facilitated the performance of the invader but did not limit the biomass accumulation of the co-occurring species. 	Conclusions Our findings indicate that the performances of contrasting latitudinal populations of I. glandulifera depend on the invaded vegetation type. The southern and central latitudinal populations of I. glandulifera exhibited higher performances than the northern population. Although litter of I. glandulifera did not limit the performance of native species in invaded vegetation in our study, we show that litter can facilitate the invader s performance.
