5|$|The dodo {{was found}} {{interesting}} enough that living specimens {{were sent to}} Europe and the East. The number of transported dodos that <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. Based {{on a combination of}} contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> destinations alive.|$|E

5|$|All six Category5s in October and November <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> intensities in {{the western}} Caribbean, a region that Atlantic hurricanes {{strongly}} gravitate toward late in the season. This {{is due to the}} climatology of the area, which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season, as well as warm waters.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Sino-Soviet split, {{tensions}} along the Chinese–Soviet border <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> peak in 1969, and United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War. The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.|$|E
5|$|As {{the land}} fraud trials <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> conclusion, {{attention}} also {{turned to the}} Southern Pacific Railroad (which had acquired the O in 1887). Not only had the company violated {{the terms of the}} grant agreement, but in 1903, declared it was terminating land sales—in violation of the grant agreement—either as a hedge against future increases in land values or to retain the timber profits for itself.|$|E
30|$|By {{progressively}} reducing transmission {{powers and}} the number of potential transmitters (backoff), other transmitters are given more chance to <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> intended receivers. This is illustrated in Figure 2 in the third minislot, where T 1 and T 3 can <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> respective receivers due to the reduced interference.|$|R

5|$|Captive {{killer whale}} lifespans are {{typically}} significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, {{and a few}} have <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> 40s. Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca's caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{debris and}} ice were {{probably}} {{present at the}} lake, with fan deltas at Tunupa overlapping the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> maximum size shortly before the lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began. Two minor glacial advances, over 12,000 BP and about 11,000 BP, appear to coincide with Lake Tauca.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} overall size and crest size also {{corresponds}} to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, {{it seems that the}} large crests only developed in males when they <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.|$|E

5|$|September Category5s <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> {{strengths}} {{in any of}} the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, {{and open}} Atlantic. These places are where September tropical cyclones are likely to form. Many of these hurricanes are either Cape Verde-type storms, which develop their strength by having a great deal of open water; or so-called Bahama busters, which intensify over the warm Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division {{began their}} advance on 17 August, after the German Army {{had started to}} withdraw.

Here the division halted until early in September, when they returned to England to prepare for further airborne operations later in the war.|$|E
5|$|The Persians had {{the sympathy}} of several Greek city-states, {{including}} Argos, which had pledged to defect when the Persians <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> borders.

Thebes, though not explicitly 'Medising', was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived.|$|E

5|$|A {{turning point}} in the club's history came in the late 1970s. Singer, {{shareholder}} and lifelong Watford supporter Elton John became chairman in 1976, and appointed Graham Taylor as manager in 1977. The club achieved consecutive promotions between 1977 and 1979, and reached the First Division {{for the first time in}} their history in 1982. Furthermore, in 198283 Watford finished second in the First Division, and Luther Blissett was the division's top scorer with 27 goals. Consequently, Watford qualified for the UEFA Cup in 198384. They also <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> first FA Cup final, losing 20 to Everton at Wembley Stadium. Following Taylor's departure in 1987, Watford were relegated in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Although the Grand Fleet {{made several}} sorties {{over the next}} few years it is not known if Agincourt participated in them. On 23April 1918, Agincourt and Hercules were {{stationed}} at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> normal route so Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.|$|E
5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up by}} Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Civilians {{who took}} part in the {{evacuation}} suffered the consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians who followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually <b>reached</b> <b>their</b> destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E
