25|$|Beginning {{with the}} model year 1999, an {{increasing}} number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation.|$|E

5000|$|Reduce {{the amount}} of <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> oil {{produced}} by a refinery: <b>Residual</b> <b>fuel</b> oil is generally regarded as a low value product.

50|$|Residual fuel's use in {{electrical}} generation has also decreased. In 1973, <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> oil produced 16.8% {{of the electricity}} in the US. By 1983, it had fallen to 6.2%, and , electricity production from all forms of petroleum, including diesel and <b>residual</b> <b>fuel,</b> is only 3% of total production. The decline {{is the result of}} price competition with natural gas and environmental restrictions on emissions. For power plants, the costs of heating the oil, extra pollution control and additional maintenance required after burning it often outweigh the low cost of the fuel.

This study investigates the influence of biodiesel blend {{on the characteristics of}} residual and distillate marine fuels. Adequate correlation equations are applied to calculate the fuel properties of the blended marine <b>fuels</b> with biodiesel. <b>Residual</b> marine <b>fuel</b> RMA has inferior fuel characteristics compared with distillate marine fuel DMA and biodiesel. The flash point of marine fuel RMA could be increased by 20 % if blended with 20 vol% biodiesel.

50|$|Many {{refineries}} {{are using}} the lower end residual oil with higher sulphur content to produce more lighter oils (petrol, diesel, etc) by installing petroleum coker units. This process generates a solid fuel called Pet coke which has higher calorific value and sulphur. As developed countries have banned use of high sulphur pet coke and residual oils, these fuels further are converted in to synthetic natural gas and methanol in Methanation plants to avoid their disposal problem. Nearly 38% of <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> oils are consumed in the shipping sector. The International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), adopted by the IMO, has mandated that marine vessels shall not consume <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> oils (bunker fuel, etc) with a sulphur content greater than 0.1% from the year 2020.

40|$|In 2016, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{decided on}} global {{regulations}} to reduce sulphur {{emissions to air}} from maritime shipping starting 2020. The regulation implies that ships can continue to use <b>residual</b> <b>fuels</b> with a high sulphur content, such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), if they employ scrubbers to desulphurise the exhaust gases. Alternatively, they can use fuels with less than 0. 5 % sulphur, such as desulphurised HFO, distillates (diesel) or liquefied natural gas (LNG). The options of lighter fuels and desulphurisation entail costs, including higher energy consumption at refineries, and the present study identifies and compares compliance options {{as a function of}} ship type and operational patterns. The results indicate distillates as an attractive option for smaller vessels, while scrubbers will be an attractive option for larger vessels. For all vessels, apart from the largest <b>fuel</b> consumers, <b>residual</b> <b>fuels</b> desulphurised to less than 0. 5 % sulphur are also a competing abatement option. Moreover, we analyse the interaction between global SOX reductions and CO 2 (and fuel consumption), and the results indicate that the higher fuel cost for distillates will motivate shippers to lower speeds, which will offset the increased CO 2 emissions at the refineries. Scrubbers, in contrast, will raise speeds and CO 2 emissions...|$|R
