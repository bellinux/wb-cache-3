5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol.

There remains a substantial quantity of luxury <b>residential</b> <b>property,</b> upmarket shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E

Crossley led a head-on attack and downed one Do 17 while his {{squadron}} damaged several others. So close had the RAF fighters pressed home their attacks that the bombers had to move and jink to avoid their fire. It put the bomb-aimers off their aim. The Dorniers were already too close to their targets and the pilots could not realign before the formation was over and passed the aiming point. Having been thwarted from bombing their official targets they aimed for rail tracks {{to the north and}} east of the airfield. Some of the unit targeted RAF Croydon, three miles north-west of Biggin Hill. Others turned around without releasing their bombs. The crews that bombed the rail lines found they were a difficult target to hit at 15,000 feet. Some released their bombs at intervals in the hope of hitting their targets, however some bombs fell on <b>residential</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E

Econometric model [...] Chapter 5. Methodology and estimation [...] Chapter 6. Results [...] Chapter 7. Conclusion. Using 1992 Q 1 - 2014 Q 4 housing market, {{monetary policy}} and macroeconomic {{data for the}} Australian economy, this study investigates the dynamic impact of monetary policy on the Australian housing market. Considering number of purchased <b>residential</b> <b>properties,</b> dwelling investment and real estate prices as housing sector variables, the main objective {{of this study is}} to identify how households' or investors' purchasing decisions for <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> and dwelling investment on new constructions and renovation of <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> are influenced by the monetary policy shock, exchange rate and real estate prices shocks. To achieve the research goal, a seven-variable SVAR model is developed for the Australian housing market and the empirical findings of this study suggest that purchasing <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> and dwelling investment are significantly and consistently influenced by the monetary policy shock but dynamic effect of exchange rate shocks on the number of purchased <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> is insignificant. The interrelationship between monetary policy rate and purchasing <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> is also acknowledged in this study.
