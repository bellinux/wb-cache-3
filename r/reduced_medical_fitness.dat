40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{legislation}} {{has been introduced}} in Saskatchewan for mandatory reporting by physicians of patients considered medically unfit to drive, {{little is known about}} physicians' attitudes, knowledge or resources with regard to evaluating <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive. METHODS: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine Saskatchewan physicians' attitudes, knowledge, training, resources and current educational needs with regard to evaluating <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive. A questionnaire survey of all physicians in the province who were identified as likely to be involved in determining <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive was conducted between October and December 1996. RESULTS: Of the 1102 physicians who received a questionnaire, 690 (62. 6 %) responded, of whom 167 were excluded because they were not involved in assessing fitness to drive. Thus, 523 (55. 9 %) of the 935 eligible physicians surveyed completed the questionnaire. Most (57. 6 % [298 / 517]) of the respondents indicated that they do not hesitate to report patients medically unfit to drive; however, 59. 5 % (307 / 516) felt that the physician-patient relationship is negatively affected by reporting. Overall, 85. 5 % (444 / 519) of the respondents felt that restricted licensing is a fair alternative for people who might otherwise be denied a full licence. The availability of restricted licensing positively influenced the decision to report for 60. 3 % (313 / 519) of the respondents. Significantly more rural physicians than urban physicians believed that the need to drive was greater for rural residents than for urban dwellers (81. 2 % [95 / 117] v. 64. 2 % [257 / 400], p < 0. 001). Physician knowledge regarding specific <b>medical</b> conditions and <b>fitness</b> to drive was generally poor. The resource most commonly used in determining <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive was the Physicians' Guide to Driver Examination (71. 1 % [361 / 508] of respondents). The most useful continuing medical education methods indicated by physicians for assessing <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive included conference presentations, workshops and journal articles. INTERPRETATION: Most of the Saskatchewan physicians surveyed supported restricted licensing, and the availability of restricted licensing made them more likely to report patients considered medically unfit to drive. The physician-patient relationship was felt to be negatively affected by reporting...|$|R

40|$|Sláinte agus Tiomáint {{provides}} guidance on <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> {{to drive and}} is aimed primarily at medical professionals and those working at the interface between road safety and health e. g. On-road Driving Assessors, the National Driver Licence Service. It supports clinicians in providing guidance to patients who may have <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive issues. The guidelines highlight the need {{for all of us}} to appreciate that the state of our health impacts, to a greater or lesser degree, on our ability to drive safely. Driver fitness is governed by EU law and regulations made in Ireland under the Road Traffic Acts. Sláinte agus Tiomáint is an interpretation of these laws; however, the Directive/regulations form the overriding legal basis for driver <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> in Ireland. One of the objectives of Sláinte agus Tiomáint is to promote mobility and to do this in a way that is consistent with safety on our roads. Once a driver is aware of any health aspects that impact on driving and follows the advice of their doctor, they can continue to drive in most cases.

40|$|In the UK, {{licensing}} of {{taxi drivers}} is {{dealt with by}} local government authorities. In Scotland, before the recent reorganization of local government, taxi licensing was {{under the jurisdiction of}} District Councils, so a telephone survey was conducted of all 52 mainland Scottish District Councils to ascertain the procedures which were being employed in assessing <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive a taxi, {{for which there is no}} national standard. Medical enquiries relevant to fitness to drive were being made by 41 (79 %) of local authorities, but in 38 (73 %) this was limited to a single question about health. No enquiry regarding health status was being made by 11 (21 %) District Councils (all serving 100, 000 population size), and 20 of the 21 medium-sized (50, 000 - 100, 000) Scottish District Councils carried out medical examinations either when a relevant medical disorder was declared by the applicant, or when the applicant was above a defined age (which varied between local authorities). The small local authorities (population < 50, 000) examined only those applicants who declared medical disorders. This survey has shown considerable variation and limitations in the approach of the previously existing Scottish District Councils to the assessment of <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive of applicants for taxi licences. It is suggested that national standards and guidelines are required for <b>medical</b> <b>fitness</b> to drive in relation to taxi licensing...|$|R
