5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated.

5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a <b>rich</b> <b>mixture</b> being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E

5000|$|Cold engines also {{typically}} {{require more}} fuel and a <b>richer</b> <b>mixture</b> when first started (see: cold start injector), because fuel does not vaporize as well when cold and therefore requires more fuel to properly [...] "saturate" [...] the air. <b>Rich</b> <b>mixtures</b> also burn slower and decrease {{the risk of}} spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) when the engine is under load.

50|$|Nitromethane {{is usually}} used with <b>rich</b> air-fuel <b>mixtures</b> because it {{provides}} power {{even in the absence}} of atmospheric oxygen. When <b>rich</b> air-fuel <b>mixtures</b> are used, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are two of the combustion products. These gases often ignite, sometimes spectacularly, as the normally very <b>rich</b> <b>mixtures</b> of the still burning fuel exits the exhaust ports. Very <b>rich</b> <b>mixtures</b> are necessary to reduce the temperature of combustion chamber hot parts in order to control pre-ignition and subsequent detonation. Operational details depend on the particular mixture and engine characteristics.|$|R

25|$|Supercharging {{was used}} to force the charge into the cylinder, rather than {{crankcase}} compression, as on most two-stroke engines. This allowed {{the use of a}} conventional lubrication system, instead of the total-loss type found in many two-stroke engines. Stratified charge was used: the fuel was injected into a bulb-like extension of the combustion chamber where the twin spark plugs ignited the <b>rich</b> <b>mixture.</b> Operable air-fuel ratios of from 15 to 23:1 were available to govern the power produced between maximum and 60%. The <b>rich</b> <b>mixture</b> maintained near the spark plugs reduced detonation, allowing higher compression ratios or supercharger boost. Supercharger throttling was used as well to achieve idling. The supercharger throttles were novel vortex types, varying the effective angle of attack of the impeller blades from 60 to 30 degrees. This reduced the power required to drive the supercharger when throttled, and hence fuel consumption at cruising power.|$|E

This version had {{reworked}} rear suspension, the old swing axle was replaced with a De-Dion axle and the engine produced around [...] at 9600 rpm. In order to achieve this power however, the simplistically designed engine had been simply been fitted with larger superchargers over time. This fact, combined with the <b>rich</b> <b>mixture</b> required to burn methanol in the engine resulted in extremely poor fuel economy - the 159 achieved [...] miles to the gallon, compared to the Talbot-Lagos of the time, which delivered 10 miles to the gallon. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first Formula One Grand Prix not won by an Alfa primarily because Fangio and Farina both had to stop twice simply to re-fuel their cars – and the Ferrari of José Froilán González did better on fuel and would go on to win the race, with Fangio second. Still, the Alfa had the edge on performance and with wins in Switzerland, France and Spain, Fangio won his first of five championships that year. For their second-to-last World Championship race (until 1979), the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Alfa Romeo introduced a new evolution version known as the 159M, the [...] "M" [...] standing for Maggiorata ("enlarged").|$|E
50|$|When {{the engine}} is cold, fuel vaporizes less readily and tends to {{condense}} {{on the walls of}} the intake manifold, starving the cylinders of fuel and making the engine difficult to start; thus, a <b>richer</b> <b>mixture</b> (more fuel to air) is required to start and run the engine until it warms up.

To an observer outside the circle of light the whole scene was intensely vivid and picturesque, for the groups, being at different distances, were varied in size, and the intense light that shone on those nearest the fires shed a softer glow on those who were more distant, while on the few Indians who moved about in search of firewood it cast a pale light which barely sufficed to distinguish them from surrounding darkness.|$|E

In the European town one finds safety, spaciousness and hygiene; in the Chinese town, romance, overcrowding and disease. In spite of my affection for China, these transitions always made me realize that I am a European; for me, the Chinese manner of life would not mean happiness. But after making all necessary deductions for the poverty and the disease, I am inclined to think that Chinese life brings more happiness to the Chinese than English life does to us.

6000|$|The {{precedent}} {{was therefore}} established {{and the group}} normally constituted. Mrs. Assingham, meanwhile, at table, on the stairs, in the carriage or the opera-box, might--with her constant overflow of expression, for that matter, and its singularly resident character where men in especial were concerned--look across at Amerigo in whatever sense she liked: it was not of that Maggie proposed to be afraid. She might warn him, she might rebuke him, she might reassure him, she might--if it were impossible not to--absolutely make love to him; even this was open to her, as a matter simply between them, if it would help her to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed. And Maggie desired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacy of her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a small project for the morrow, privately entertained--the idea, irresistible, intense, of going to pay, at the Museum, a visit to Mr. Crichton. Mr. Crichton, as Mrs. Assingham could easily remember, was the most accomplished and obliging of public functionaries, whom every one knew and who knew every one--who had from the first, in particular, lent himself freely, and {{for the love of}} art and history, to becoming one of the steadier lights of Mr. Verver's adventurous path. The custodian of one of the richest departments of the great national collection of precious things, he could feel for the sincere private collector and urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at his capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentary thrift. He carried his amiability to the point of saying that, since London, under pettifogging views, had to miss, from time to time, its rarest opportunities, he was almost consoled to see such lost causes invariably wander at last, one by one, with the tormenting tinkle of their silver bells, into the wondrous, the already famous fold beyond the Mississippi. There was a charm in his [...] "almosts" [...] that was not to be resisted, especially after Mr. Verver and Maggie had grown sure--or almost, again--of enjoying the monopoly of them; and on this basis of envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the daughter, Mr. Crichton had at both houses, though especially in Eaton Square, learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character. It was at his invitation, Fanny well recalled, that Maggie, one day, long before, and under her own attendance precisely, had, for the glory of the name she bore, paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple, an alcove of shelves charged with the gold-and-brown, gold-and- ivory, of old Italian bindings and consecrated to the records of the Prince's race. It had been an impression that penetrated, that remained; yet Maggie had sighed, ever so prettily, at its having to be so superficial. She was to go back some day, to dive deeper, to linger and taste; in spite of which, however, Mrs. Assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated. This second occasion had given way, for a long time, in her happy life, to other occasions--all testifying, in their degree, to the quality of her husband's blood, its <b>rich</b> <b>mixture</b> and its many remarkable references; after which, no doubt, the charming piety involved had grown, on still further grounds, bewildered and faint.|$|E

40|$|Under light-load {{conditions}} in early-injection stratified-charge compression-ignition (SCCI) engines, excessive premixing {{can lead to}} undesirable levels of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Optimal stratification can reduce these emissions. In this work, the effects of changes in swirl, injection pressure, injector hole-size and number of holes, injection timing, and piston geometry on stratification are computationally investigated. It is shown that these parameters affect the stratification through their influence on the rate of spray penetration, drop vaporization, and fuel/air mixing. The outcome is characterized by examining {{the evolution of the}} spatial distribution of the fuel vapor in the chamber and its mass-based distribution function. All other parameters remaining the same, decreasing drop size leads to faster vaporization and <b>richer</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Increasing penetration leads to greater spreading and leaner mixtures. Increasing spray included-angle leads to greater spreading and leaner mixtures. Increasing injection pressure leads to increased mixing and leaner mixtures. Increasing injector hole-size leads to <b>richer</b> <b>mixtures</b> at lighter loads because the duration of injection is reduced and the fuel is confined closer to the axis. Increasing swirl leads to faster breakup of the head-vortex and confinement of the fuel closer to the axis, and hence <b>richer</b> <b>mixture.</b> J. Abraha...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the room temperature ageing of off-stoichiometric DGEBA/TETA epoxy formulations. The results obtained show that the epoxy <b>rich</b> <b>mixtures</b> have their inherent brittleness increased by the ageing treatment due to recrystalization of the unreacted epoxy monomers, although homopolymerization could also play a minor role. The initial reaction steps dominated by the amine addition reactions control the macromolecular structure and the mechanical performance of the stoichiometric and near stoichiometric formulation with excess of epoxy monomer. Plasticization due to absorbed -OH results on a significant increase of the deformability of these formulations. The amine <b>rich</b> <b>mixtures</b> have the more stable structures, although plasticization due to moisture absorption from the surrounding environment also produces an increase on the deformability of all, but one, of the formulations investigated...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} thermally treated biomass {{known as}} ‘steam exploded biomass’ or ‘black pellets’ was {{compared with the}} raw yellow pine wood feedstock to the process using the Hartmann dust explosion equipment.

The reactivity was determined from the initial rate of pressure rise prior to the vent bursting in the Hartmann equipment. The flame speed in the vertical tube of the Hartmann equipment was also determined as a reactivity parameter. Steam exploded milled pellets (BP) was found to have a higher reactivity, leaner MEC and higher flame speed, than the raw pine. The enhanced reactivity of BP was due to the greater proportion of fine particles.

The results obtained show that the <b>richer</b> <b>mixture</b> condition produced higher pressure trends at all tested points.
