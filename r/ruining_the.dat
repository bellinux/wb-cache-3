5|$|Game Revolution {{had a more}} {{critical}} review of Dino Crisis than others, saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> good elements. They were impressed by the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E
5|$|In the English-speaking world, recent {{productions}} of The Bartered Bride in London {{have included the}} Royal Opera House (ROH) presentation in 1998, staged at Sadler's Wells during {{the restoration of the}} ROH's headquarters at Covent Garden. This production in English was directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by Bernard Haitink; it was criticised both for its stark settings and for <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> Act II entrance of Vašek. It was nevertheless twice revived by the ROH – in 2001 and 2006, under Charles Mackerras.|$|E

We consider a sequence of risk processes, which converges weakly to the standard Wiener process when, for instance, the number of policies in a large insurance portfolio goes to infinity, and is added to the classical risk process. The resultant process is a diffusion perturbed classical risk model. We study this model and obtained <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> probabilities, <b>the</b> joint {{density function}} of the surplus immediately prior to <b>ruin,</b> <b>the</b> deficit at <b>ruin,</b> <b>the</b> time to <b>ruin</b> and <b>the</b> expected discounted penalty function for the diffusion risk model by the weak convergence. In other words, we show that these quantities converge weekly to the corresponding quantities of the diffusion risk model for large number of policies. Numerical illustrations of the expected discounted penalty function and ruin probabilities are also presented...|$|R

5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. <b>Ruining</b> <b>the</b> scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E

The bridegroom, Nigel McCulloch, {{went on to become}} the Bishop of Manchester. The production encountered difficulties with obtaining some footage; while filming a Seaman's Mission from Great Yarmouth, a wave flooded the boat, <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> sound-recording equipment, and a sequence featuring an open-air service taking place at daybreak on Easter Sunday at the most easterly point of the UK — at Ness Point, Lowestoft — was nearly missed after the sound recordist overslept.|$|E

5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E

Lyme is beaten into a coma and left for dead, although he is found by passersby and taken to a hospital. Duncan and Perrier escape, but are now disconnected from Meru and the others. Meanwhile, Meru, Bill, and Dusty follow up a different lead in Hong Kong. They too are attacked by the Eraser, resulting in Dusty and Bill's deaths. Meru escapes, and is now more resolved than ever to stop the Eraser.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd-century crisis {{started a}} chain-reaction of {{socio-economic}} effects that proved decisive {{for the development}} of the late army. The combination of barbarian devastation and reduced tax-base due to plague bankrupted the imperial government, which resorted to issuing ever more debased coin e.g. the antoninianus, the silver coin used to pay the troops in this period, lost 95% of its silver content between its launch in 215 and its demise in the 260s. Thus 20 times more money could be distributed with the same amount of precious metal. This led to rampant price inflation: for example, the price of wheat under Diocletian was 67 times the typical price under the Principate. The monetary economy collapsed and the army was obliged to rely on unpaid food levies to obtain supplies. Food levies were raised without regard to fairness, <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> border provinces where the military was mainly based. Soldiers' salaries became worthless, which reduced the army's recruits to a subsistence-level existence. This in turn discouraged volunteers and forced the government to rely on conscription and large-scale recruitment of barbarians into the regular army because of the shortfalls caused by the plague. By the mid-4th century, barbarian-born men probably accounted for about a quarter of all recruits (and over a third in elite regiments), likely a far higher share than in the 1st and 2nd centuries.|$|E

After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E

5|$|On 14 August 1782, Hector {{separated}} {{from the rest of}} the prize ships in heavy weather and on 22 August encountered two large French frigates, Aigle of 40 guns and Gloire of 32 guns. Together these vessels significantly outclassed the leaky ship of the line in weight of shot, but Captain John Bourchier determined to resist the French attack, preparing Hector as the French approached. The French ships surrounded Hector at 02:00 and the engagement was furiously contested, with Bourchier wounded early on and many of his officers following him below with serious injuries. Within a short period, Inman was the only officer remaining on deck, but he was able to successfully drive the French away following a failed attempt to board, although Hector was left in a severely damaged state with 75 men killed or wounded. A hurricane that followed the battle inflicted further damage and the ship was badly flooded, seawater <b>ruining</b> <b>the</b> food supplies and threatening to sink the ship completely. Some of the crew were so ill and exhausted that they collapsed and died while manning the pumps. Inman only managed to prevent the remaining sailors from fleeing below decks by carrying loaded pistols and threatening men who refused his orders. Once the storm had abated it was clear that Hector was foundering; her rudder and masts had been torn away and the pumps were unable to keep pace with the water leaking through the battered hull. For two weeks Inman made desperate efforts to keep the ship afloat, as food and water supplies ran low and the hull began to collapse in on itself. Fortunately for the men aboard Hector, the tiny snow Hawke appeared and approached the ship of the line to render assistance. Throwing his cargo overboard, Captain John Hill worked with Inman to supervise the transfer of all of Hectors remaining men, many of whom were wounded or sick, into Hawke as Hector rapidly sank. No men were lost in the operation and Inman was the last to leave, Hector disappearing ten minutes after the boat carrying him reached Hawke. The snow set sail for St John's in Newfoundland, its crew and passengers subsisting on short rations; they arrived off the port on the same day they consumed the last water supplies.|$|E
