5|$|Local wine-labeling <b>regulations</b> <b>are</b> slowly {{catching}} up with the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E

5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed {{in countries where}} <b>regulations</b> <b>are</b> not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.|$|E

The Tesla Model S {{is one of the few}} electric cars without warning sounds, because Tesla Motors will await until <b>regulations</b> <b>are</b> enacted. Volkswagen and BMW also decided to add artificial sounds to their electric drive cars only when required by regulation.|$|E
5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's <b>regulations</b> <b>are.</b> Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E

40|$|Regulation, even inefficient <b>regulation,</b> can <b>be</b> {{incredibly}} persistent. We {{propose a}} new explanation for regulatory persistence based on “regulatory fog”, where regulation obscures {{information about the}} effects of deregulation. This paper presents a dynamic model of regulation, in which the environment is stochastic such that the imposition of <b>regulation</b> can either <b>be</b> efficient or inefficient, and in which the regulator’s ability to observe the underlying need for <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> reduced when <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> imposed. As compared to a full-information benchmark, <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> highly persistent, even if there is a high probability of transition to a state in which <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> inefficient. This regulatory persistence decreases welfare and dramatically increases the proportion of time the economy spends under regulation. The ability to perform deregulatory experiments can improve outcomes, but only if they are sufficiently inexpensive and effective, and regulation will still remain more persistent than in the full-information benchmark.
