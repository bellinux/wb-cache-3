40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> {{and other}} {{ecological}} rainwater management methods {{in urban areas}} aims, among others, at: 1) reduction of total rainwater runoff and of its peak and 2) reduction of property damage and activity disruption, {{which is due to}} insufficient sewer network capacity. While <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> cannot substitute sewer networks, they can be used as integral parts of sewer systems in a cost-efficient way. In this paper, integration of <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> in sewer systems is investigated, by means of a case study, in Thessaloniki, Greece. The effect of location and size of <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> is examined, together with the quality of local sewer network. Our calculations have shown that existing infrastructure is insufficient and that construction of <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> could substantially mitigate the nuisance caused by inundation of streets and sidewalks during rain events...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>gardens</b> {{are often}} located near a building’s roof {{drainpipe}} (with or without rainwater tanks). Most <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> {{are designed to}} be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A French drain may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural water cycle displaced by urban development and allow for groundwater recharge. While <b>rain</b> <b>gardens</b> always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may also increase pollution unless remediation materials are included {{in the design of the}} filtration layers [...]|$|R

50|$|Sometimes a drywell with {{a series}} of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the <b>rain</b> <b>garden</b> will help {{facilitate}} percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an infiltration basin defeating its purpose. Depression-focused recharge of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a <b>rain</b> <b>garden</b> near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller <b>rain</b> <b>garden</b> basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table. In some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.|$|E
