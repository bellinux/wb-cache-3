5|$|The {{expansion}} {{is set on}} a post-apocalyptic version of Mount Desert Island, known in-game as The Island, which is north-east of the Commonwealth, Fallouts post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts. The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by <b>radioactive</b> <b>fog.</b> Because the creatures that live inside the fog are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn the fog into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E
40|$|In the {{afternoon}} on March 11, 2011,a huge earthquake and tsunami which {{occurred in the}} Pacific Ocean {{off the coast of}} East Japan crippled the Fukushima I(Daiichi) Nuclear Power Plant. In the following two weeks,a large amount of radioactive materials leaked from the plant. Areas as far away as Iitate, 40 kilometers northwest of the plant,got severely contaminated. Nakadori(middle third) of Fukushima Prefecture,and the northern Gunma and Tochigi were also badly contaminated. Eastern part of the Tokyo Metropolitan region and southern Iwate were also contaminated. In the evening of April 8, 2011,the Nuclear Team of the Disaster Response Group of Fukushima Prefecture announced the dose rates at 1, 648 schools and kindergartens in Fukushima. I found the data on the Internet,and picked one or two high numbers in each municipality,plotted them on the Google Map,and made the map public that day with the three isopleths of 8, 2,and 0. 5 μSv/h. That {{was the first of the}} radiation contour maps. Ms. Sachiko Hagiwara beautifully stylized the map,and it was published on the Internet on April 21, 2011 as the first version map. I continued to collect information,and published the revised version on June 18, 2011. This version was the first to depict the contamination in northern Tochigi and Gunma,eastern Tokyo Metropolitan region,and southern Iwate. I revised the map every 3 months,and the current map is the 8 th edition. Wind determined the distribution of radioactive contamination. Volcanic ashes from the volcanic eruption are transported by the wind at a high altitude of several kilometers and higher. However,radioactive materials leaked from the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant were transported by the wind near the ground surface. Looking at the meteorological data of that time period,wind directions at an altitude of 1 kilomete and higher cannot explain the distribution. I believe radioactive materials were carried by the surface wind whose altitude was dozens of meters off the ground at most. That is the reason why the isopleths of radiation seem to follow the ups and downs of geography,such as basins and mountain sides. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>fog</b> that passed over Minami Soma in Fukushima Prefecture at 9 PM on March 12 continued over Sendai Bay and reached Onagawa in Miyagi Prefecture at 2 AM on March 13. The contamination on March 15 was the worst. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>fog</b> that passed over Iwaki City in Fukushima Prefecture at 4 AM reached Kanto Plain at 6 AM. Since it was not raining,the fog then headed west and north until it hit the mountainous regions in Kanto and northern part of Gunma and Tochigi Prefecture, where, for the first time,it met the rain,and radioactive materials came fell to the ground with the rain. The contamination of Fukushima Nakadori also happened on that day. Radioactive materials that crossed the Abukuma Mountains came down with the snow. In {{the afternoon}},a particularly dense <b>radioactive</b> <b>fog</b> was spewed from the nuclear plant. Carried by the wind,it went straight in the northwesterly direction,and contaminated the areas all the way to Iitate and Fukushima City,which the fog hit at 6 PM. In the evening of March 20,areas near the Miyagi-Yamagata border and southern Iwate were contaminated. After that,the wind turned south,sending the fog past Mito City in Ibaraki Prefecture at 6 AM on March 21,and reaching Shinjuku,Tokyo at 9 AM. For 3 days from March 21 to 23,the Kanto region had intermittent rains. Moderate contamination seen in the eastern part of the Tokyo Metropolitan region is from this time period. The dates and times of contamination that I have just explained above do not coincide with the dates and times of explosions that took place at Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. Unit 1 exploded at 3 : 36 PM on March 12,and Unit 3 exploded at 11 : 01 AM on March 14. It was not at these moments that the large amount of radioactive materials leaked from the plant;the release of radioactive materials into the atmosphere coincide with sharp fluctuations in the reactor pressure. 2011 年 3 月 11 日に起こった大きな地震と津波のあとしばらくして、大量の放射性物質が福島第一原発から大気中に出た。私はその汚染分布を迅速に把握して地図に表現し、インターネットで即座に公表した。放射性物質は原発から連続的定常的に放出されたのではなかった。 3 月 12 日、 3 月 15 日、それから 3 月 20 - 21 日に大きな放出イベントがあった。原子炉格納容器の圧力が低下あるいは上昇したときに対応する。順に 1 号機、 2 号機、 3 号機からの放出だった。大気中に出たセシウムは 1 京 1000 兆ベクレル（ 11 PBq）。 1986 年のチェルノブイリ原発事故で出たセシウムの 1 / 12 である。しかし人口密度を考慮すると、被害は両者ほぼ同じかフクシマが 3 倍深刻である。芝生や森の林床だけでなく、アスファルトの上でも 2011 年 3 月に降り積もったセシウムはほとんど移動していない。そういった場所の放射線量率の自然減衰はセシウム 134 と 137 の半減期でよく説明できる。この事故で放出されたセシウムに起因するがん死の増加は 5300 人と見積もられる。今後 50 年間の福島中通りにおける放射能リスクは交通事故リスクの 1 / 2 である...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a selective overview of natural fogs {{in terms of}} fog types, forms and states of occurrence, physical, micro-physical, chemical and dynamic properties, basic characterizing parameters, etc. In focus are related achievements and contributions reported mainly {{during the last decade}} and a half, as a result of both laboratory studies and field observations. Processes of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation are analyzed in the aspects of condensation, nuclei diversity and specifics, as related to the activation, growth and deposition of fog droplets. The effect is highlighted of the water vapor’s partial pressure on the surface tension of the liquid water–air interface and the freezing point of the water droplets. Some problems and aspects of fog modeling, parameterization, and forecasting are outlined and discussed on the examples of newly developed relevant 1 D/ 3 D theoretical models. Important issues of fog impacts on the air quality, ecosystems, water basins, societal life, and human health are also addressed and discussed, particularly in cases of anthropogenically modified (chemical, <b>radioactive,</b> etc.) <b>fogs.</b> In view of reducing the possible negative effects of fogs, conclusions are drawn concerning the new demands and challenges to fog characterization imposed by the changing natural and social environment and the needs for new data on and approaches to more adequate observations of fog-related events...|$|R
