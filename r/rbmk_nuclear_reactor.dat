40|$|Earlier {{this year}} the Senate Intelligence Committee began to receive reports from {{environmental}} and nuclear scientists in Russia detailing the reckless nuclear waste disposal practices, nuclear accidents {{and the use of}} nuclear detonations. We found that information disturbing to say the least. Also troubling is the fact that 15 Chernobyl style <b>RBMK</b> <b>nuclear</b> power <b>reactors</b> continue to operate in the former Soviet Union today. These reactors lack a containment structure and they`re designed {{in such a way that}} nuclear reaction can actually increase when the reactor overheats. As scientists here at the University of Alaska have documented, polar air masses and prevailing weather patterns provide a pathway for radioactive contaminants from Eastern Europe and Western Russia, where many of these reactors are located. The threats presented by those potential radioactive risks are just a part of a larger Arctic pollution problem. Every day, industrial activities of the former Soviet Union continue to create pollutants. I think we should face up to the reality that in a country struggling for economic survival, environment protection isn`t necessarily the high priority. And that could be very troubling news for the Arctic in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{accidental}} {{reduction of}} the mass flow rate through a channel of a <b>RBMK</b> type <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> is expected to determine, besides other effects, {{the failure of the}} pressure tube. Due to the steam exiting with high velocity from the crack on the pressure tube, strong static pressure gradients interest the fuel pins closest to the opening. As a result, a “suction effect” takes place which might be strong enough to break the fuel pins and to cause them to be entrained out of the pressure tube. After introducing some hypotheses about the parameters governing the steam flow throughout the tube and the geometry crack, a CFD model was developed aimed at estimating, to a first approximation, the hydrodynamic loads acting on the fuel pins, and assessing the influence of several geometric and physical parameters on the loads. In addition, a simplified structural model for the fuel pin was used in order to estimate a range of loads which are expected to cause the failure of the pin, and a comparison was made against the hydrodynamic loads obtained through the CFD model. The result is that if the crack is large enough the loads are sufficient to cause the fuel pin collapse...|$|R

40|$|The main {{target of}} the master´s thesis is {{reviewing}} the generation III <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> in term of the nuclear safety. At first {{we have to learn}} some theory of the nuclear safety in order to understand safety systems of the generation III <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> Therefore the thesis is divided into two parts. Legislative and technical approaches to nuclear safety are mentioned in the first part. Regulatory bodies, whose task is to supervise nuclear safety in the nuclear power plants, belongs to the legislative approaches. There are defined terms such as defence in depth, redundancy, diversity, etc. There are mentioned methods to assessing nuclear safety – deterministic and probabilistic methods, especially probabilistic methods, for which a simple example is provided. There are also mentioned active and passive safety systems and their significance for nuclear safety and inherent safety too. There {{is an example of the}} function of the active and passive safety systems of the EDU nuclear power plant in conclusion of this issue.

40|$|Traditional safety {{performance}} requirements for <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> {{have been developed}} for critical reactors, whose kinetics characteristics differ significantly from sub-critical, accelerator-driven <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> In a critical <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> relatively small amounts of reactivity (negative or positive) can produce large changes in the fission rate. In sub-critical reactors, the self-multiplication (k) decreases as the sub-criticality (1 -k) increases, and the responsiveness to small reactivity changes decreases. This makes sub-critical <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> less responsive to positive reactivity insertions than critical reactors. Also, larger negative reactivity insertions are needed in sub-critical reactors to shut down the fission chain if the neutron source remains. This paper presents the results from a computational analysis of the {{safety performance}} of sub-critical, accelerator-driven <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> Coupled kinetics and thermal-hydraulics models are used to quantify the effectiveness of traditional protection and control system designs in sub-critical reactors. The analyses also quantify the role of inherent, passive reactivity feedback mechanisms in sub-critical reactors. Computational results are used to develop conclusions regarding the most favorable and effective means for reactor control and protection in sub-critical, accelerator-driven <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors...</b>|$|R
