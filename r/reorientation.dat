The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} <b>reorientation</b> to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations.

These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (RichardIII, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts.|$|E
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a <b>reorientation</b> of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} in the fcc-sc phases of fullerite C- 60 (C- 13 NMR line shape and spin-lattice relaxation time T- 1) {{is described in}} terms of discrete orientational states of molecules. Molecular <b>reorientations</b> in the low temperature orientationally ordered sc phase are assumed to take place about molecular symmetry axes. Transition into the high- temperature disordered fcc phase is modeled by additional molecular <b>reorientations</b> about C- 4 symmetry axes of the cubic unit cell. At low temperatures, the NMR line shape functions are demonstrated to depend significantly on the model of molecular <b>reorientations</b> in contrast with T- 1. In the vicinity of the phase transition at 260 K, T- 1 changes dramatically for all models, unlike the NMR line shape. The model of relatively fast molecular jumps about a single C- 3 symmetry axis along with slow <b>reorientations</b> about the other axes is found to adequately reproduce the T- 1 experiment and qualitatively reflects the temperature changes in NMR line shape...|$|R

The research study included three parts;In {{the first part of}} the research study, algorithms and software were developed for extracting geometrical information contained in STEP CAD files and for detecting potential collisions between parts during assembly along principal-axis assembly directions, based upon the extracted geometrical information. The developed software directly takes a STEP CAD file of a designed product assembly as input, and outputs six interference-free matrices representing collision information between parts in six principal assembly directions;In the second part of the research study, the algorithm developed in the first part was integrated into a genetic algorithm-based assembly sequence planner. The enhanced planner then was used to find assembly sequences with minimum <b>reorientations</b> automatically. The integrated assembly sequence planner directly takes a STEP CAD file of a designed product assembly as input, and outputs geometrically feasible assembly sequences requiring minimum reorientations;In the third part of the research study, a case study was conducted to verify the impact of assembly direction <b>reorientations</b> on assembly time, for both robot assembly and human operator assembly. Results of the case study show that, for both robot and human operator assembly processes, the number of <b>reorientations</b> in an assembly sequence has a significant impact on assembly time. The results support the primary research hypothesis that more assembly direction <b>reorientations</b> in a sequence require a longer assembly time.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1190s, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles, an Argyllman who was {{probably}} a meic Somairle candidate, was deposed and replaced by Michael (died 1203), a Manxman who {{appears to have been}} backed by Rǫgnvaldr. Cristinus' tenure appears to have spanned at least two decades, during a sustained period of meic Somairle power in the Isles. His downfall, however, came about at about time of the Crovan dynasty's resurgence under Rǫgnvaldr. The latter succeeded his father only years before, in 1187, and appears to have capitalised upon the infighting amongst the meic Somairle, and possibly even the downfall of Ragnall himself. Although the first known Bishop of Argyll, Haraldr, is accorded a tenure during {{the first quarter of the}} thirteenth century, it is likely that there were earlier bishops unknown to surviving sources. In fact, the diocese first appears on record in Liber Censuum, a Papal document dating to the last decade of the twelfth century; and it is possible that Cristinus, or an unknown successor, or perhaps even Haraldr himself, was the first dicocesan bishop. Whatever the case, Cristinus' tenure in the Isles may have witnessed an ecclesiastical <b>reorientation,</b> or shift of sorts, towards Argyll.|$|E

40|$|Volcanic {{stress field}} {{analysis}} has been lauded as a potentially {{powerful tool for}} midterm to long-term eruption forecasting. However, because tectonic processes can also produce localized stress field <b>reorientations,</b> evidence for a direct causal link between observed stress field <b>reorientations</b> and magmatic activity is of critical importance. In this study, we show that local stress field <b>reorientations</b> preceding changes in volcanic activity at the Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat, are observable using two independent measures of crustal stress (local (volcano-tectonic) earthquake fault plane solutions and measurements of shear wave splitting in regional earthquakes). We further demonstrate that the local stress field orientation during a 6 month period preceding the onset of eruptive activity at Soufrière Hills in 1999 is highly localized and spatiotemporally variable and that the spatial pattern of precursory local stress orientations is consistent with numerically modeled patterns of stress resulting from pressurization of a vertical dike. These observations provide compelling evidence for a direct causal link between pressurization of midlevel volcanic conduit systems by ascending magma and precursory local stress field <b>reorientations</b> and demonstrate that seismological analysis {{can be used to}} detect subtle local changes in stress that herald eruptive activity. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we present a}} new method to {{simulate}} realistic three-dimensional networks of biopolymers under shear. These biopolymer networks are important for the structural functions of cells and tissues. We use the method to analyze these networks under shear, and consider the elastic modulus, the non-affinity during deformation, the normal modes and the density of states. We expand our analysis to composite networks consisting of stiff and floppy filaments. In the final chapter of the thesis we incorporate the thermal and viscous interactions of the surrounding medium in the calculations, and present {{the results of the}} simulations of the shear frequency dependence of the network response. We find that non-affine <b>reorientations</b> are important for understanding the network response. These non-affine <b>reorientations</b> make the networks relatively soft under shear and delay the onset of stiffnening. In composite networks non-affine <b>reorientations</b> allow for an intricate interplay between the stiff and floppy filaments. The frequency-dependent response shows a transition from a soft, non-affine regime at low frequencies to a stiff, close-to-affine response at high frequencies. Promotor: G. T.
