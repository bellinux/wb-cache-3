40|$|In <b>medical</b> <b>consultation,</b> {{it is the}} doctor’s task {{to advise}} {{patients}} about health related problems. This advice might not immediately be acceptable to the patient, for instance, because he has to drastically change his behaviour. In such cases, the doctor could attempt to make the advice acceptable by providing argumentation. To analyse and evaluate argumentation in <b>medical</b> <b>consultation,</b> I will argue in this paper that, from a pragma-dialectical perspective, <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> could be analysed as a communicative activity type...|$|R

40|$|Primary care clinicians {{are often}} {{encouraged}} by government agencies to intervene systematically with all smokers. Pressure {{of time and}} pessimism about their own efficacy and patients' capacity to change {{are some of the}} reasons why clinicians do not feel it is appropriate to always advise every patient about unhealthy behaviours. Developments in patient centred approaches to the consultation and progress in the addictions field suggest that new consulting methods could be constructed which are more satisfying than giving brief advice to change. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a structured, teachable and acceptable intervention for clinicians to help patients consider their smoking during general <b>medical</b> <b>consultations.</b> Patient <b>centred</b> strategies derived from the stages of change model and motivational interviewing and its adaptations were explored in experimental consultations with 20 volunteer smokers. Feedback from them and from general practice registrars trained in the use of the method informed its development. Acceptability to clinicians was assessed by semi structured telephone interviews with 24 general practice registrars who participated in a randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of the method. Anonymous, written questionnaires were also completed by 20 of the registrars who recruited ten or more patients into the trial. The method is described. Key components are: establishing rapport, assessing motivation and confidence, and then depending on the response, asking standard scaling questions, asking about pros and cons of smoking, non-judgmental information sharing, brainstorming solutions and negotiating attainable goals and follow-up. The clinicians used the method with a total of 270 smokers, taking an average of 9. 69 min with each patient. Evaluation reveals that it is acceptable to the group of general practice registrars. Longer consultation time was seen as the main drawback. We conclude that acceptable methods for opportunistic health promotion can be developed by taking into account patient centred approaches to the consultation, developments from the addictions field and the practical problems faced by clinicians. The process can be further enhanced by considering feedback from those who are likely to receive and use the interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background: In recent years, {{patients}} have indicated {{a desire for}} more information about their disease and to be involved in making decisions about their care. We developed an aid called the “Decision Board ” to help clinicians inform patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer of the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy. We determined whether adding the Decision Board to the <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> improved patient knowledge and satisfaction compared with the <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> alone. Methods: Between October 1995 and March 2000, 176 women with lymph nodenegative breast cancer who were candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive the Decision Board plus the <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> (83 patients) or the <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> alone (93 patients). One week after the consultation, patients completed a questionnaire assessin...|$|R

In this paper we propose an online <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> system with load balancing as an assurance for maximum resource utilization. Rule-based fuzzy controlled load balancing is applied to a homogeneous system consisting of three medical centers with limited capacities. Performance was comparatively analysed using three weighted rule sets. The results reveal that the load balancing accuracy vary for different rule sets.

In conclusion, load balancing is an efﬁcient alternative approach that can avoid possible over-crowding or underloaded situations in an online <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} the associations of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure with <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> and hospitalisation among adolescents in Hong Kong. Methods: A total of 35827 secondary 1 (US grade 7) to secondary 5 students from 85 randomly selected schools completed an anonymous questionnaire on smoking, SHS at home, SHS outside home, <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> {{in the past}} 14 days, hospitalisation in the past 12 months, and socio-demographic characteristics. Current smoking was defined as any smoking in the past 30 days. SHS exposure was classified as none (reference), 1 – 4 and 5 – 7 days/week. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> and hospitalisation in relation to SHS exposure at home and outside home in current smokers. Analyses were also done among never-smokers for comparison. Results: Among all students, 15. 9 % had <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> and 5. 2 % had been hospitalised. Any SHS exposure at home was associated with AORs (95 % CI) for <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> and hospitalisation of 1. 69 (1. 14 – 2. 51) and 2. 85 (1. 47 – 5. 52) in current smokers, and 1. 03 (0. 91 – 1. 15) and 1. 25 (1. 02 – 1. 54) in never-smokers, respectively, (P, 0. 01 for interaction between smoking status and SHS exposure at home). SHS exposure outside home was generally not associated with <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> and hospitalisation in smokers and never-smokers. Conclusions: SHS exposure at home was associated with health services use among adolescent current smokers. Adolescent smokers {{should be aware of}} the harm of SHS in addition to that from their own smoking.
