40|$|Abstract—The spatial {{correlation}} {{among the}} images <b>retrived</b> from distributed video sensors leads to considerable data redundancy, thus resulting in significant performance degradation in {{energy efficiency and}} QoS satisfaction. In this paper, a correlation-aware QoS routing algorithm (CAQR) is proposed to efficiently deliver visual information under QoS constraints by exploiting the correlation among video sensors. Firstly, a correlation-aware differential coding scheme is designed {{to reduce the amount}} of traffic generated by correlated video sensors. Then, a correlation-aware load balancing scheme is proposed to prevent network congestion by spliting the correlated flows that cannot be reduced to different paths. Finally, these correlationaware schemes are integrated into an optimization QoS routing framework with an objective to minimize energy consumption subject to QoS constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves efficient delivery of visual information under QoS constraints in wireless video sensor networks. I...|$|R

However, it cannot be ruled out that a natal supernova explosion launched Scorpius X- 1 into an orbit like this from a birth place in the galactic bulge.

The harmonic spectra obtained agree well with the results simulated by TDSE in k space using Bloch states and show a two-plateau structure. Both of the cutoff energies of the two plateaus in the harmonic spectrum scale linearly with the field strength. We also study HHG driven by intense few-cycle laser pulses and find that the cutoff energy of the harmonic spectrum is as sensitive to the changes of the carrier envelope phase, as to HHG from gas samples, which suggests recollision pictures in HHG as found by recent experiments (Nature 522, 462 (2015)) ...|$|R
40|$|Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) were {{originated}} from {{the design of}} structured peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems. A DHT provides a key-based lookup service similar to a hash table. In this paper, we present the detailed design of a new DHT protocol, Tambour. The novelty of the protocol is that it uses parallel lookup to reduce <b>retrive</b> latency and bounds communication overhead to a dynamically adjusted routing table. Tambour estimates the probabilities of routing entries' liveness based on statistics of node lifetime history and evicts dead entries after lookup failures. When the network is unstable, more routing entries will be evicted in a given period of time, and the routing tables will be getting smaller which minimize the number of timeouts for later lookup requests. An experimental prototype of Tambour has been simulated and compared against two popular DHT protocols. Results show that Tambour outperforms the compared systems in terms of bandwith cost, lookup latency and the overall efficiency...|$|E

Because narrow-linewidth continuous-wave lasers are available only at certain wavelengths, heterodyning the comb tooth can be challenging. We present a new technique for direct characterization of the frequency noise of an optical frequency comb, requiring no supplementary reference lasers and easily applicable in all spectral regions from the terahertz to the ultraviolet. The technique {{is based on the}} combination of a low finesse Fabry-Perot resonator and the so-called "fringe-side locking" method, usually adopted to characterize the spectral purity of single-frequency lasers, here generalized to optical frequency combs.

This {{is similar to the}} highly organised motion generated at relaxation in ideal Euler fluids. The problem of the atmosphere is however fundamentally different since now there is an intrinsic length, the Rossby radius. Within the Charney Hasegawa Mima model it has been derived a differential equation governing the stationary, two-dimensional, highly organised vortical flows in the planetary atmosphere. We present results of a numerical study of this differential equation. The most characteristic solution shows a strong similarity with the morphology of a tropical cyclone.

The discussion {{takes place in the}} context of remote sensing applications, where the main constraint {{is to be able to}} invert the photon transport model against observations to <b>retrive</b> the properties of the observed media. To facilitate the solution of the radiative coupling between the vegetation and atmospheric layers, we use the same formal approach in both media, and specify the extinction and differential scattering coefficients in a similar way. The accurate description of the radiation transfer within a vegetation layer is complicated by the fact that both of these coefficients depend on the position of the external sources of radiation, and by the lack of precise knowledge about the radiative boundary conditions at the top and bottom of this layer. Effective solutions to the radiation transfer problem in plant canopies requires the introduction of specific hypotheses, for instance in the treatment of the multiple scattering contribution. JRC.
