Teddy is the man I wanna succeed. Lakoff observed that (4 a) is ambiguous (‘I want Teddy to succeed ’ vs. ‘I want to succeed Teddy’) while (4 b) is unambiguous (only ‘I want to succeed Teddy’). Lakoff’s proposed analysis involved what were referred to as “global rules”, rules that can examine the entire transformational derivation; something to the effect of “contract want to to wanna if there was never anything intervening between want and to. ” After empty categories were introduced into the arsenal of transformational grammar (specifically as “traces ” of moved wh elements) it was observed that they could be called upon to account for the wanna facts.

40|$|I There is {{something}} completely archaic yet very modern about {{the tone and}} issues of the 1920 s debates in the Economic Journal on the representative firm and increasing returns, also {{often referred to as}} ‘the cost controversy’. Then, as now, applied economists, “realitics”, as Sir John Clapham called them, and theoretical economists (‘analytics’) were often a race apart who neither properly understood nor appreciated each other’s roles and approaches. Then, as now, views differed on whether or not theory had to be directly applicable in explanations of ‘real world ’ observations and much misunderstanding occurred because the separation between logically coherent ‘high theory ’ in its own domain and, a separate issue, its direct applicability, was not made by protagonists in an argument. Or, if it were, one side would be concerned with the former, the other with the latter, without either making this understanding explicit.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A {{balanced}} approach between whole language and phonics instruction {{is the best}} way to teach beginning readers. This is a first grade reading curriculum that incorporates these two components. I chose the Four Blocks Literacy Model to form the backbone of my curriculum. The four components of this model include a guided reading block, a working with words block, a self-selected reading block, and a writing block. Each of these blocks was used daily throughout the curriculum. For each month, I decided what skills to focus on. Then I collected and developed lessons to meet the objectives. Finally, I wrote a comprehensive plan for each day. All of the books children read are high-quality children's literature. The working with words component, also known as phonics, uses the guided reading stories as its basis for teaching decoding. The writing block also relates to the story being read. The curriculum is based on many books that are recommended by reading experts. Authors cited include the McCrackens, Patricia Cunningham, Dorothy Hall, and Dorothy Strickland.

In particular, this study sought {{to answer the following}} question: “What are the contexts and social factors that influence religious motivation of collegeage LDS young adults to study religious texts?” To examine this question, a phenomenological approach was used to explore what participants had in common with feeling motivated to read religious texts. The primary sources of data came from one-on-one interviews that describe the personal experiences and perspectives of 10 college-age LDS young single adults. Sociocultural theory guided the analysis and interpretation of data and findings. Findings indicated the following: (a) regardless of the context, it appeared that involvement in discussions about the scriptures increased the likelihood of an individual feeling motivated to <b>read,</b> (<b>b)</b> even when other contexts included elements that encouraged scripture reading, it appeared that friends strongly influenced whether or not individuals felt motivated to read scriptures, (c) it appeared that environments of expectation influenced motivation to read, and (d) it appeared that individuals who spent time marking and writing in their scriptures felt motivated to read. Based on these findings, it is recommended that further research be done to explore the following: (a) What types of discussions influence motivation to read religious texts? (b) What other religious practices are influenced by friends? (c) How should expectations be communicated and maintained? (d) Is there a difference in motivation between marking (coloring) things in the scriptures and writing (journaling) in the scriptures?

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the possible effects of text experiences on story retelling with young children. The subjects are 210 Lebanese children, whose native language is Arabic, learning to read in English through using foreign culture books, mainly American. It is the belief that, while learning to read in a second language, children are also introduced to a new culture. Therefore, a key question is {{how are we going to}} make this process easier and more enjoyable to children who are a) learning to <b>read,</b> <b>b)</b> in a foreign language, and c) about a distant culture. Based on previous work with schema theory, two story books are used in this study to detect any differences in comprehension levels between stories of varied cultural backgrounds. One story is based on the Spanish concept of bull-fighting which is assumed to be foreign to the children and the other is with a familiar Lebanese background. Subjects were divided into four groups: the first group worked with pictures and had a discussion prior to reading to build the target-culture schema; the second had the schema activities after reading the story; the third discussed the cultural topic both before and after reading; and the last was a control group which did not have schema activities. Results show that familiarity with a topic before reading the text promotes comprehension, retention, and retelling of a text. Proficiency in the foreign language seems to have a great effect on text understanding when information about the topic is made available. Implications are drawn and suggestions given for practical approaches to developing children's reading through tasks in Lebanese classrooms...|$|E
