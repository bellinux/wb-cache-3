5|$|Elizabeth's {{personal}} <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> {{have been}} much debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.|$|E
5|$|Ferens' {{personal}} and <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> {{are evident in}} other of his parliamentary contributions. He tabled {{a number of questions}} concerning temperance, both at home and in the colonies. His first question in the Commons was about orphan schools. He later asked about railway accidents to children, and about trafficking of young girls in India.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Miller (1802–56) from Cromarty was a stonemason and self-taught geologist. His 1841 {{publication}} The Old Red Sandstone {{became a}} bestseller. The fossils founds in these rocks {{were one of}} his fascinations, although his deep <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> led him to oppose the idea of biological evolution.|$|E

5|$|Some foods {{were also}} off-limits, as the Tang court {{encouraged}} {{people not to}} eat beef (since the bull was a valuable working animal), and from 831 to 833 Emperor Wenzong of Tang even banned the slaughter of cattle {{on the grounds of}} his <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Tom Conway as Doctor Louis Judd, a New York City {{physician}} and psychiatrist who has treated Jacqueline Gibson for depression. It is revealed that during her counseling sessions, Jacqueline confided in Judd about the Palladist Satanic cult {{she had been}} involved in.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which {{contained}} ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred {{critique of the}} political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct. Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.|$|E
5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of <b>religious</b> <b>convictions.</b> Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), {{dressed in}} {{traditional}} Afghan robes, and interacted more closely with the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E
5|$|Once Brannan had {{returned}} to his sister's home, he renewed his <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> in the LDS church and was called by the apostle Wilford Woodruff to serve a local mission in Ohio. Before being called as a missionary he had married Harriet ("Hattie") Hatch and they were expecting their first child. His mission ended earlier than expected when he caught malaria and had to return home for his health. Once he had sufficiently recovered he was again called to help the church, but this time as a printer in Connecticut working alongside the apostle William Smith. While waiting in Connecticut {{to meet up with}} Smith, Brannan fell in love with Ann Eliza Corwin whose mother took care of the visitors in the local boarding house. Brannan planned to marry her and separate from his first wife. They were eventually married although it was said that Brannan had never officially divorced his first wife.|$|E

5|$|The premier night fighter aces in the RAF—Cunningham, Braham and Branse Burbridge—did not {{appreciate}} press attention. In {{the case of}} Cunningham and Burbridge, this may have stemmed from deeper <b>religious</b> <b>convictions</b> about combat and killing. Burbridge became a priest {{during the war and}} both he and Cunningham did not cooperate with biographers when approached to have their exploits described in print after the war. During the war, Braham also actively shunned the lime-light. One of the country's best-selling newspapers, the Daily Express, asked to interview him but he declined. Much to Braham's embarrassment, his father gave interviews about his then famous son in 1943. When no stories were forthcoming, the newspapers soon lost interest. Braham and Cunningham were certainly aware of each other {{as a result of the}} press attention, and a competitive rivalry developed. In his book Scramble, Braham mentioned with pride the night he surpassed Cunningham's score permanently.|$|E
5|$|In May 1818 Heywood {{declined}} {{command of}} the Canadian Lakes with the rank of commodore. As he had become content with shore life, {{he said he would}} only accept another appointment in the event of war. In retirement Heywood published his dictionary of the Tahitian language, wrote papers relating to his profession, and corresponded widely. He enjoyed a circle of acquaintances which included the writer Charles Lamb, and was a particular friend of the hydrographer Francis Beaufort. He destroyed much of his writing shortly before his death, but a document from 1829 survives, in which he expresses his views on the unfitness for self-government of Greeks, Turks, Spaniards and Portuguese, the iniquities of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, and the doubtful benefits of Catholic emancipation in Ireland. Of strong <b>religious</b> <b>convictions,</b> Heywood was increasingly interested in spiritual matters during the last years of his life. His health began to fail in 1828, and he died after suffering a stroke, aged 58, in February 1831. He was interred in the vault of Highgate School chapel, where a memorial plaque was dedicated on 8 December 2008.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Many people derive peace ofmind {{and purpose}} in life from their belief in God. For others, however, {{religion}} provides unsatisfying answers. Are there brain differences between believers and nonbelievers? Here we show that <b>religious</b> <b>conviction</b> is marked by reduced reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cortical system that {{is involved in the}} experience of anxiety and is important for self-regulation. In two studies, we recorded electroenceph-alographic neural reactivity in the ACC as participants completed a Stroop task. Results showed that stronger religious zeal and greater belief in Godwere associatedwith less firing of the ACC in response to error and with com-mission of fewer errors. These correlations remained strong even after we controlled for personality and cognitive ability. These results suggest that <b>religious</b> <b>conviction</b> pro...|$|R
