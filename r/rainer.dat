5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were {{a source of}} inspiration for poet <b>Rainer</b> Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E

5|$|Whether {{the pyramid}} was {{finished}} or left unfinished is disputed among experts. The egyptologist <b>Rainer</b> Stadelmann {{believes that the}} pyramid was indeed finished, but others, such as Miroslav Verner, think that the building was left unfinished because of the pharaoh's premature death. In particular, no traces of outer cladding were found, which could hint that there never was one because the pyramid was not completed.|$|E

They began dating in mid-2004, having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003). They were married on June 29, 2005, {{in a private}} Turks and Caicos ceremony.

5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set {{up near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet <b>Rainer</b> Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{dramatic}} and expressionistic style {{was met with}} puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco {{is regarded as a}} precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as <b>Rainer</b> Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.|$|E

5000|$|Under {{the more}} lenient fascist {{dictatorship}} of Ion Antonescu, Popa continued to speak his mind, in particular objecting to Romania's participation in World War II alongside Nazi Germany. He was, as Boia notes, [...] "an intransigent antifascist, who would naturally fit into {{any sort of}} plot against the regime". In 1942, following <b>Rainer's</b> retirement, he was transferred to Bucharest, where {{he worked as a}} professor for four years. After <b>Rainer's</b> death in 1944, he also took over the Anthropological Institute and reattached it to the medical school.|$|R
5|$|Kaegi {{discovered}} Pierre Schaeffer, musique concrète and the GRM {{radio broadcasts}} in Paris in 1951, yet his 1950s compositions are for traditional instruments; Ariadne in Zürich is for clarinet and piano 4 hands, Miniaturen, for oboe, bassoon and cimbalom, while the 1956 Sonate is for clarinet and piano. During the next decade, however, Werner Kaegi embraced electronic music {{and became a}} pioneer of Swiss electroacoustic music, predating other composers in the field, such as Bruno Spoerri and <b>Rainer</b> Boesch.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{continued}} to expand beyond trio and solo playing. In {{the spring of}} 2005 he premiered a song cycle that he had written for classical music singer Renée Fleming.

Mehldau also collaborated with guitarist Pat Metheny from 2005 – they recorded two albums together that year, along with Grenadier and Ballard, and in 2007 went on a worldwide tour.|$|E
