California voters amended the state's constitution in 2008 by passing Marsy's Law with a majority of 53.84%. The rights bestowed by Marsy's Law include the right to legal standing, the right to protection from the defendant, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> of all court proceedings, and the right to restitution. Marsy's Law also granted parole boards far greater powers to deny inmates parole.|$|E

40|$|Idon’t believe {{half of the}} American {{population}} or even a {{small portion}} knows what can happen {{to you when you}} are a victim of a crime going through the criminal justice process. —A crime victim, quoted in New Directions from the Field: Victims ’ Rights and Services for the 21 st Century, 1998 Crime victimization is a frightening and unsettling experience for the millions of Americans whose lives it touches each year. As recently as 1972, almost no services were available to help crime victims or their survivors repair the damage to their lives and property or contend with the traumatic and frustrating ordeal of prosecuting the offender. Today, however, due largely to the dedicated efforts of advocates, lawmakers, and crime victims, atremendous range of services and resources is available to help victims obtain justice and heal. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), the U. S. Department of Justice agency that advocates for the fair treatment of crime victims, wants you to know that if you or someone you love is a victim of crime—you have rights, you can get help, and you can work for positive change. You Have Rights Amajority of states have amended their constitutions to guarantee certain rights for crime victims. Typically, these include the following fundamental rights: The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> of all court proceedings related to the offense. The right to be reasonably protected from the accused offender. The right to have input at sentencing (in the form of a victim impact statement). The right to information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. The right to an order of restitution from the convicted offender. The right to notice of these rights. The right to enforce these rights. If you are a victim of or witness to a crime, these rights apply to you. You may obtain information about these rights through your local victim/witness assistance program (usually located in the prosecutor’s office), your state Attorne...|$|E

50|$|In re Gault, , was a {{landmark}} U.S. Supreme Court decision that held that juveniles accused of crimes in a delinquency proceeding must be afforded {{many of the}} same due process rights as adults, such as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> timely <b>notification</b> of the charges, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> confront witnesses, the right against self-incrimination, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> counsel.

50|$|Both Sanchez-Llamas and Bustillo filed state habeas {{petitions}} {{in their}} respective cases arguing that their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> consular <b>notification</b> had been violated.

The supreme courts of Oregon and Virginia both upheld the states' procedural bars. The two cases were then consolidated and argued before the United States Supreme Court.|$|R

In June 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled that foreign nationals who were not notified of their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> consular <b>notification</b> and access after an arrest may not use the treaty violation to suppress evidence obtained in police interrogation or belatedly raise legal challenges after trial (Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon). In March 2008, the Supreme Court further ruled that the decision of the International Court of Justice directing the United States to give [...] "review and reconsideration" [...] to the cases of 51 Mexican convicts on death row was not a binding domestic law and therefore could not be used to overcome state procedural default rules that barred further post-conviction challenges (Medellín v.

50|$|The {{judgment}} {{stated that}} the question for the Court's decision involved the constitutional law of the United Kingdom: it was whether the Crown's executive government is entitled to use the Crown's prerogative powers to give notice under Article 50 for the United Kingdom to cease {{to be a member}} of the European Union. The Court held that Parliament had the exclusive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> trigger <b>notification</b> under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), because it would result in a series of rights being nullified that were created by Acts of Parliament. The principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty required that only Parliament could overturn an Act of Parliament. This is expressed in the Case of Proclamations (1608), the Bill of Rights 1688 section 1, and continually confirmed since in cases including Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate, and R (Jackson) v Attorney General. The Crown has no power to alter domestic law through prerogative power.|$|R

50|$|Notification Center was {{released}} in iOS 5 to replace the previous system for dealing with push and local notifications. Instead of interrupting the user with an alert, Notification Center instead displays a banner {{at the top of}} the screen. This allows the user to continue using their device, and disappears after a set period of time. All previous notifications are collated into the Notification Center panel, which can be displayed in iOS by dragging down from the status bar, and in OS X by clicking on the notification center button (or using track-pad gestures, swiping from <b>right</b> <b>to</b> left). <b>Notifications</b> may be selected by the user, which redirects the user to the application where the notification was initially created, and marking that alert as read. Once a notification is read, it is removed from the panel. Users may also remove notifications without reading them by deleting individual alerts, or dismissing all of an application's alerts from within the application that is generating them. When an iOS device is locked, new notifications appear on the lock screen, and users may access the application generating an alert by swiping the application's icon with their finger from left <b>to</b> <b>right</b> along the <b>notification.</b>|$|R

Notifications regarding tax collection are carried out according to Tax Precedure Law whereas notifications regarding tax trials for tax disputes are carried out according <b>to</b> <b>Notification</b> Law. In order <b>to</b> solve <b>notification</b> related problems, an analogy should be drawn between Tax Precedure Law and Notification Law. Also, in the case of notifications via traditional methods, it is seen that significant information for tax payers may not be delivered on time and therefore tax claim collections may be legally impossible. Within this framework, in order to provide timely taxation and complete the taxation procedure, by virtue of the development in IT, electronic <b>notification</b> in addition <b>to</b> the said <b>notification</b> methods should take place in regulations.
