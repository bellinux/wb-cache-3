5000|$|The “Swoop and Squat” [...] scheme {{involves}} two cars: one drives {{beside the}} victim, {{while the other}} ‘swoops’ {{in front of the}} victim car and stops suddenly, causing a rear-end crash. The first car is usually full of accomplices who will claim that they were injured even if it was only a low-speed crash, submitting fraudulent claims to the insurance company. The swoop car is usually driven by an experienced <b>ring</b> <b>member,</b> while the “squat” car is generally full of either accomplices, or victims. In the 1990s poor Hispanic immigrants were recruited to drive the swoop cars: a high-risk job that nobody wanted, but for which the immigrants could be paid only $100. One such driver, Jose Luis Lopez Perez, died after a swoop and squat crash, leading to an investigation which revealed massive amounts of this fraud.|$|E

The poles are equi-angular spaced {{from each other and}} radially spaced about the Z-axis. The inner member extends along the Z-axis and is a highly magnetic permeable material. The magnetic member is formed about the inner member outer surface, extends along the Z-axis and is configured so one magnetic pole polarity is located at its outer surface and the other polarity pole is located at its inner surface. Preferably, the magnetic member is a radially magnetized permanent magnet. The inner surface of the <b>ring</b> <b>member</b> is magnetically coupled to the magnetic member and a face of each pole is coupled to the bearing member.

The actuator further includes a plurality of electromagnetic coils. Preferably, a coil is formed about each pole and at least 2 coils are formed about the inner member. When energized, the electromagnetic coils generate a modulated magnetic field that stabilizes the rotating member in the desired operational position...|$|E

However, identity dependent externalities may lead to the formation of small rings, as often observed in practice. Potential <b>ring</b> <b>members</b> may condition their participation on high transfer payments, as a compensation for their expected (negative) externalities if the ring forms. The others may therefore profitably exclude such "demanding" bidders, although risking tougher competition in the auction. We also analyze ring inefficiency in the presence of externalities, showing that a ring may prefer sending an inefficient member to the auction, if the efficient member exerts threatening externalities on bidders outside the ring, which in turn leads to a higher winning price.

[...] To keep the investigation secret, Bristow gave the reporters a cipher different from the Treasury code. Similar investigative work was done in Chicago and Milwaukee.

This is especially useful in the case of ring signature, as the exposure of a single secret key may result in the invalidity of thousands or even millions ring signatures which contain that particular user. However, most of the ring signature schemes in the literature do not provide forward security. The only one with this feature [14] relies on random oracles to prove the security.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we formalize {{the notion of}} a ring signature, which makes it {{possible}} to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature. Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination: any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself, and sign any message by using his secret key and the others ’ public keys, without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritative secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model, and exceptionally efficient: adding each <b>ring</b> <b>member</b> increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption...|$|E

The apparent role of ring meetings prior to the auction was to designate a serious bidder, and its bid, and the other firms then frequently submitted phony higher bids. The bidding data indicate that the bids of non-cartel firms, as well as their rank distribution, were related to cost measures, such as how much backlog a firm was carrying. In contrast, the rank distribution of higher cartel bids was unrelated to similar cost measures, and differed from the distribution of the low cartel bid. ...|$|E
