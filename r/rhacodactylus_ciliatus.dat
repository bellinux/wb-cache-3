50|$|<b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus,</b> the crested gecko, was {{believed}} extinct until rediscovered in 1994, and is gaining popularity as a pet.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} rich with animal life and {{is home to}} unusual creatures such as the Crested Gecko <b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus</b> and the world's largest gecko Rhacodactylus leachianus.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{color of}} the suras gecko is brown to gray. Two color {{patterns}} exist. A white spotted version is the recessive trait, and a white [...] "V" [...] pattern is the dominant trait. The gecko's appearance has often been described as similar to a large <b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus,</b> with larger eyes.|$|E
50|$|Geckos {{are members}} of the family Gekkonidae. They are {{reptiles}} that inhabit temperate and tropical regions. There are over 1,000 different species of geckos. They can be a variety of colors. Geckos are carnivorous, feeding on insects and worms. Most gecko species, including the crested gecko (<b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus),</b> can climb walls and other surfaces.|$|E
50|$|His primary {{fields of}} {{research}} included fish and reptiles. He {{is credited with}} describing the ichthyological genera Agonomalus, Neosebastes (gurnard scorpionfishes) and Glossanodon. He also described numerous new species, including the New Caledonian crested gecko, Correlophus ciliatis (changed to <b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus</b> in 1994, but reclassified as Correlophus ciliatis in 2012). Several species commemorate his name, an example being Paracanthobrama guichenoti.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1866 as Correlophus ciliatus by the French zoologist Alphone Guichenot {{in an article}} entitled [...] "Notice sur un nouveau genre de sauriens de la famille des geckotiens du Muséum de Paris" [...] ("Notes on a new species of lizard in the gecko family") in the Mémoires de la Société Scientifique Naturelle de Chérbourg. It was later renamed <b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus.</b> Recent phylogenetic analysis indicates that R. ciliatus and R. sarasinorum are not {{closely related to the}} other giant geckos, so these two species have been moved back to the genus Correlophus.|$|E
5000|$|Given its {{geographical}} isolation {{since the}} end of the Cretaceous, New Caledonia is a refugium, in effect a biological [...] "Noah's Ark", an island home to both unique living plants and animals and also to its own special fossil endowment. Birds such as the crested and almost flightless kagu (French, cagou) Rhynochetos jubatus, whose closest relative may be the distantly related sunbittern of South America, and plants such as Amborella trichopoda, the only known member of the most basal living branch of flowering plants, make this island a treasure trove and a critical concern for biologists and conservationists. The island was home to horned fossil turtles (Meiolania mackayi) and terrestrial fossil crocodiles (Mekosuchus inexpectatus) which became extinct shortly after human arrival. There are no native amphibians, with geckos holding many of their niches. The crested gecko (<b>Rhacodactylus</b> <b>ciliatus),</b> thought to have gone extinct, was rediscovered in 1994. [...] At 14 inches, Leach's giant gecko (Rhacodactylus leachianus), the world's largest and a predator of smaller lizards is another native. The only native mammals are four species of bat including the endemic New Caledonia flying fox.|$|E
