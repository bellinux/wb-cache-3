5|$|At a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> one {{of these}} entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the {{composer}} Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).|$|E
5|$|He {{broke through}} {{for his first}} five-wicket haul on English soil in his fifth match against Glamorgan, taking 5/63 in the first innings and scoring an unbeaten 68. He added 90 in the next match against Gloucestershire before facing the MCC at Lord's in the {{traditional}} dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests. He took 6/46 and 3/58 as Australia took victory. His wickets included leading Test batsmen Cowdrey and Ken Barrington. Davidson headed into the Tests with 257 runs at 42.83 and 26 wickets at 22.35 from eight matches.|$|E
5|$|Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, {{and was one}} of {{only four}} players {{remaining}} from before the war. However, he only played in two of the Tests due to illness and injury. His early season form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests.|$|E

5|$|Some players {{remained}} {{resentful of}} Craig's dubious elevation ahead of Harvey during the 1957–58 tour of South Africa but appreciated {{that he had}} not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates. On the tour, Harvey broke a finger at catching practice and missed the early tour matches. After it healed, Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI, in a virtual dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests. He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{crossed the}} border into South Africa and Davidson scored 100 and took a total of 4/62 against Transvaal as Craig's men started with a nine-wicket win. The next match was against a South African XI, and was {{effectively}} a dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests. Davidson scored 34 and took a total of 7/103 as the Australians crushed the hosts by an innings. He rounded off his Test preparation with match figures of 6/35 against Border and a 76 against Western Province.|$|E
5|$|Dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> {{the sketch}} went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having {{difficulty}} correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

5|$|In April 1944, {{under the}} command of I Airborne Corps, the brigade took part in Exercise Mush. This was a three-day {{exercise}} in the counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, during which the entire 6th Airborne Division was landed by air. Unknown to the troops involved, the exercise was a full-scale <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the division's involvement in the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy. In the invasion, the 6th Airborne Division's two parachute brigades would land {{in the early hours of}} 6 June in Operation Tonga; the 6th Airlanding Brigade would not arrive until almost dusk on the same day. Their objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area, between the rivers Orne and Dives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} match against Yorkshire, which was O'Neill's second for the tour, he scored an unbeaten 100 marked by his cover driving. He {{followed}} {{this with a}} 74 against Lancashire before a 124 two matches later against Glamorgan, which was described by Wisden as {{the best of the}} season. He scored 73 against Gloucestershire and made 122 on his first appearance at Lord's, against the Marylebone Cricket Club, in what was effectively a dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests. Australia went on to win by 63 runs. In the next match against Sussex, O'Neill was carried from the ground after suffering a knee injury, and after failing to bat in either innings, it appeared he would be sidelined for a substantial period.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{retained}} {{his place}} for the 1964 tour to England, and scored a century against Western Australia for the touring squad before departing for the northern hemisphere. After failing to pass 16 {{in his first two}} outings, he struck form against Glamorgan, scoring 65 and an unbeaten 109. He then added 151 and 17 not out, leading the way as the Australians defeated the MCC by nine wickets in a dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests. However, O'Neill scored 98 in the first four innings of the opening two Tests and was forced out of the Third Test with a knee injury, the only non-draw of the series, which Australia won. Nevertheless, he passed 50 {{in each of the four}} tour matches during this period, including a 134 against Yorkshire and 90 against Northamptonshire.|$|E

5|$|The {{environment}} of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management. These works were a success, with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, Ages Ago, opening in 1869. Ages Ago was also {{the beginning of a}} collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works. It was at a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> Ages Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan. The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|The tour started poorly for Harvey. In five {{innings in}} the first three weeks, he scored only 36 runs at 7.20, and this {{included}} a ten-wicket defeat at the hands of Laker and Lock's Surrey. It was Australia's first loss to a county side since 1912. Harvey began to run into some form after that, scoring 45 against Cambridge University before the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which fielded a virtual England Test team in what was effectively a dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests. Harvey made 225 in Australia's 413 and the hosts made 9/203 to draw the match. However, he was unable to replicate this form in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|After being omitted in {{the opening}} tour match against Worcestershire, Davidson made his debut on English soil against Leicestershire. He scored 63, {{featuring}} in a century partnership with Harvey, before taking 2/23 and 0/35 in an innings victory. In the next match against Yorkshire, he removed Len Hutton, regarded as the best batsman {{in the world at}} the time. In the nine first-class matches leading up to the Tests, Davidson performed steadily without being spectacular. He scored two fifties and passed 20 in every completed innings to aggregate 317 runs at 45.28, and took 17 wickets at 22.12, taking more than two wickets in an innings on only one occasion. That occasion was against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was a virtual England Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. In what was effectively a dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>for</b> the Tests, Davidson took 2/17 and 3/49, removing Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Johnny Wardle, Tom Graveney and leading batsman Denis Compton.|$|E
