5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} <b>reverse.</b> <b>It</b> ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In <b>reverse,</b> <b>it</b> produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or <b>reverse</b> <b>it.</b> Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event was the tag team {{encounter}} of Chris Benoit and William Regal against the team of Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista). The match started off with Batista and Chris Benoit, who brawled back and forth until Flair was tagged in. Flair and Benoit exchanged knife edge chops. Batista and Regal then spar, but Batista was able to gain control over Regal, until Benoit and Flair tag in to the match. Benoit and Flair spar back and forth, until Flair applied the Figure four lock only for Benoit to <b>reverse</b> <b>it</b> into the Crippler Crossface, in which Flair submitted to, giving the win to Benoit and Regal.|$|E

5|$|In seventh- and eighth-century England, most monasteries were Benedictine, but in {{the ninth}} century {{learning}} and monasticism declined severely. Alfred the Great (871–899) deplored the decline and started to <b>reverse</b> <b>it.</b> The court of Æthelstan (924–939), the first king of the whole of England, was cosmopolitan, and future reformers such as Dunstan and Æthelwold learned from Continental exponents of Benedictine monasticism. The English movement became dominant under King Edgar (959–975), who supported the expulsion of secular clergy from monasteries and cathedral chapters, and their replacement by monks. The reformers had close relations with the crown, furthering its interests and depending on its support. The movement was confined {{to the south and}} midlands, as the crown was not strong enough in the north to confiscate property from local elites to establish Benedictine foundations in the area. The movement declined after the deaths of its leading exponents {{at the end of the}} tenth century.|$|E

With 37 seconds left in the half, Atlanta tied the game on Norm Johnson's 44-yard field goal. However, Saints running back Fred McAfee returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards, with a facemask penalty against Sanders adding five more and giving New Orleans the ball on the Falcons 41. On the next play, Hebert completed a 26-yard pass to running back Dalton Hilliard, enabling New Orleans to retake the lead before halftime, 13-10, on Andersen's 35-yard field goal.|$|E

It plugged directly into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to the iPod Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear the iPod Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the Macedonian cavalry was the xyston, a double ended cornel-wood lance, {{with a sword}} as a {{secondary}} weapon. From descriptions of combat, {{it would appear that}} once in melee the Companion cavalryman used his lance to thrust at the chests and faces of the enemy. It is possible that the lance was aimed at the upper body of an opposing cavalryman in the expectation that a blow which did not wound or kill might have sufficient leverage to unseat. If the lance broke, the Companion could <b>reverse</b> <b>it</b> and use the other end, or draw his sword. Cleitus, an officer of the Companions, saved Alexander the Great's life at the Granicus by cutting off an enemy horseman's arm with his sword. Companion cavalrymen would normally have worn armour and a helmet in battle.|$|E
25|$|Lyons {{argues that}} the Constituent Assembly had liberal, rational, and individualistic goals {{that seem to have}} been largely {{achieved}} by 1791. However, it failed to consolidate the gains of the Revolution, which continued with increasing momentum and escalating radicalism until 1794. Lyons identifies six reasons for this escalation. First, the king did not accept the limitations on his powers, and mobilised support from foreign monarchs to <b>reverse</b> <b>it.</b> Second, the effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic Church, sell off its lands, close its monasteries and its charitable operations, and replace it with an unpopular makeshift system caused deep consternation among the pious and the peasants. Third, the economy was badly hurt by the issuance of ever increasing amounts of paper money (assignats), which caused more and more inflation; the rising prices hurt the urban poor who spent most of their income on food. Fourth, the rural peasants demanded liberation from the heavy system of taxes and dues owed to local landowners. Fifth, the working class of Paris and the other cities—the sans-culottes—resented the fact that the property owners and professionals had taken all the spoils of the Revolution. Finally, foreign powers threatened to overthrow the Revolution, which responded with extremism and systematic violence in its own defence.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Misunderstood", John Petrucci wrote {{and played the}} guitar solo, and then <b>{{reversed}}</b> <b>it.</b> He then learned how to play this reversed version, and after recording <b>it,</b> <b>reversed</b> <b>it</b> once more. This resulted in a solo like the original but with a unique twist {{to the way the}} notes sounded. His use of such a technique was predated by George Harrison, on the Beatles song [...] "I'm Only Sleeping". This track is in its shorter radio edit form on the cassette edition.|$|R

500|$|Many of {{the coins}} {{assigned}} to the Chera kings of Sangam age with a portrait and the legends [...] "Makkotai" [...] or [...] "Kuttuvan Kotai" [...] have been found near the Amaravathi river bed in Karur and elsewhere in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu state. They depict the royal emblem of the Cheras, the bow and arrow symbol, on the <b>reverse.</b> <b>It</b> was generally believed that the Satavahanas were the first indigenous monarchs to issue silver portrait coins. That has been disproved by the discovery of Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins belonging to the 1st century AD or a little later. Silver coins issued by Augustus and Tiberius have {{over a period of}} time been discovered in large numbers from the Coimbatore-Karur region.|$|E
500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In <b>reverse,</b> <b>it</b> produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; {{it had to be a}} separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of lead zirconate titanate (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E
500|$|In about 848 both mints {{switched}} to a common design known as Dor¯b¯/Cant– the characters [...] "Dor¯b¯" [...] on the obverse of these coins indicate either Dorobernia (Canterbury) or Dorobrevia (Rochester), and [...] "Cant", referring to Kent, appeared on the <b>reverse.</b> <b>It</b> {{is possible that the}} Canterbury mint continued to produce portrait coins at the same time. The Canterbury issue seems to have been ended in 850–851 by Viking raids, though it is possible that Rochester was spared, and the issue may have continued there. The final issue, again at both mints, was introduced in about 852; it has an inscribed cross on the reverse and a portrait on the obverse. Æthelwulf's coinage became debased {{by the end of his}} reign, and though the problem became worse after his death it is possible that the debasement prompted the changes in coin type from as early as 850.|$|E
