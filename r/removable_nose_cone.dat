5000|$|In {{all of the}} {{following}} <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> shape equations, L is the overall length of the <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> and R is the radius of {{the base of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>cone.</b> y is the radius at any point x, as x varies from 0, {{at the tip of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>cone,</b> to L. The equations define the 2-dimensional profile of the nose shape. The full body of revolution of the <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> is formed by rotating the profile around the centerline (C/L). While the equations describe the [...] "perfect" [...] shape, practical <b>nose</b> <b>cones</b> are often blunted or truncated for manufacturing or aerodynamic reasons.|$|R
40|$|A new <b>nose</b> <b>cones</b> {{concept that}} {{promises}} a gain in performance over existing conventional <b>nose</b> <b>cones</b> {{is discussed in}} this paper. It is shown that significant performance gains result from the adaptation of the exhaust flow to the ambient pressure. For this complex work, {{it was necessary to}} collect and study the various <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> shapes and the equations describing them? The paper objective was to identify the types of <b>nose</b> <b>cones</b> with ejector channels and specific aerodynamic characteristics of different types of <b>nose</b> <b>cones.</b> The scope {{of this paper is to}} develop some prototype profiles with outstanding aerodynamic qualities and low cost for use in construction projects for missile increasing their range and effect on target. The motivation for such a work is caused by a lack of data on aerodynamics for profiles of some <b>nose</b> <b>cones</b> and especially improved aerodynamic qualities that can be used in designing missiles/ rockets. This design method consists of a geometry creation step in which a three-dimensional geometry is generated, a mathematical model presented and a simple flow analysis (FLUENT Simulation from SolidWorks 2012 and ANSYS Simulation with SPH for fluid-structure interaction), step which predicts the air intake mass flow rate. Flow phenomena observed in numerical simulations during different <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> operations are highlighted, critical design aspects and operation conditions are discussed, and performance characteristics of the selected <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> are presented...|$|R

40|$|For a {{reusable}} {{space vehicle}} or a missile, {{the shape of}} the <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> has a significant effect on the drag of the vehicle. In this paper, the concept of morphing <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> is proposed to reduce the drag when the reentry vehicle flies back into the atmosphere. The conceptual design of the structure of morphing <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> is conducted. Mechanical design and optimization approach are developed by employing genetic algorithm to find the optimal geometric parameters of the morphing structure. An example is analyzed by using the proposed method. The results show that optimal solution supplies the minimum position error. The concept of morphing <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> will provide a novel way for the drag reduction of reentry vehicle. The proposed method could be practically used for the design and optimization of the deployable structure of morphing <b>nose</b> <b>cone...</b>|$|R
