5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas {{visited the}} same site as Lehmann and found a <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright yellow pigment made from crocoite also became popular.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and <b>red</b> <b>lead,</b> but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|Chromium {{minerals}} as pigments came to {{the attention}} of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains which he named Siberian <b>red</b> <b>lead.</b> Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the mineral was in fact crocoite (lead chromate) with a formula of PbCrO4.|$|E

5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply <b>Red</b> <b>lead</b> singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
25|$|Lead(II,IV) oxide, {{also called}} minium, <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> or triplumbic tetroxide, {{is a bright}} red or orange {{crystalline}} or amorphous pigment. Chemically, <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> is Pb3O4, or 2PbO·PbO2. It {{is used in the}} manufacture of batteries, lead glass and rustproof primer paints.|$|E
25|$|Old {{machine shop}} {{training}} texts speak of using <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> and white lead, often mixed into lard or lard oil. This practice is obsolete {{due to the}} toxicity of lead.|$|E

50|$|The White Sox got on {{the board}} in the third inning, as Shoeless Joe Jackson {{hit a home run}} to right field, cutting the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 5-1.|$|R
50|$|The White Sox struck {{back with}} a run of their own in the fifth inning, as Eddie Collins hit a {{sacrifice}} fly, scoring Swede Risberg, cutting the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 4-1. In the sixth inning, the White Sox cut the lead to 4-2 when Shoeless Joe Jackson singled home Buck Weaver. Happy Felsch then doubled, scoring Jackson, and cut the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 4-3, as Ruether was {{pulled out of the}} game, replaced with Jimmy Ring. Ring allowed a single by Ray Schalk, as Felsch scored, tying the game up at 4-4.|$|R
25|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> is used {{to treat}} ringworms and ulcerations, though the practice is limited due to its toxicity. Also, azarcón, a Mexican folk remedy for gastrointestinal disorders, contains up to 95% lead(II,IV) oxide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red</b> <b>lead</b> is {{virtually}} {{insoluble in water}} and in ethanol. However, it is soluble in hydrochloric acid present in the stomach, and is therefore toxic when ingested. It also dissolves in glacial acetic acid and a diluted mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} paints were red ochre, <b>red</b> <b>lead,</b> soot, calcium carbonate, and other earth colours, which were bound with fat and water. It also {{appears that the}} Vikings {{imported}} white lead, green malachite and blue azurite from Continental Europe. By using an electron microscope, chemists {{have been able to}} analyse traces of colours on runestones, and in one case, they discovered bright red vermilion, which was an imported luxury colour. However, the dominating colours were white and <b>red</b> <b>lead.</b> There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in Grettis saga, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a tree root and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in Egils saga where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with his own blood to see if the drink was poisoned.|$|E

50|$|In {{the eighth}} inning, Edd Roush led off the inning after {{being hit by}} a pitch, then moved to second after a Pat Duncan {{sacrifice}} bunt. Roush came around to score after a single by Bill Rariden, extending the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 10-1.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Reds</b> retook the <b>lead</b> in {{the bottom}} of the fourth inning, when Ivey Wingo singled to right field, scoring Larry Kopf. With two men on base, pitcher Dutch Ruether helped his own cause, hitting a triple, scoring Greasy Neale and Wingo, opening up the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 4-1. Morrie Rath then doubled to center field, scoring Ruether, {{increasing}} the Cincinnati lead to 5-1, followed by a Jake Daubert single, scoring Rath, giving Cincinnati a 6-1 and knocking Eddie Cicotte out of the game.|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} {{protective}} respiratory equipment {{can be traced}} back as far as the first century, when Pliny the Elder (circa A.D. 23-79) described using animal bladder skins to protect workers in Roman mines from <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> oxide dust. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci suggested that a finely woven cloth dipped in water could protect sailors from a toxic weapon made of powder that he had designed.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} painted with <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> primer and a lead-based topcoat, which was touched up as required. In the mid-1960s, a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats. Since 1990, acrylic topcoats {{have been used}} instead for air-quality reasons. The program was completed in 1995 {{and it is now}} maintained by 38 painters who touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded.|$|E
25|$|By 1795 {{the former}} Templar mills {{were being used}} for {{preparing}} lead. Sheets of lead were placed in clay pots and submerged in urine, then heated by decaying cow dung. The process converted the lead to lead oxide, {{and it was then}} finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> paint. A new watermill was established on the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the eighth inning, the White Sox made a last attempt to comeback, as a double by Shoeless Joe Jackson scored Eddie Collins and Buck Weaver, cutting the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 10-3. Chick Gandil tripled to right field, scoring Jackson, making it 10-4. Swede Risberg then hit it to Reds center fielder Edd Roush, who made an error, {{allowing}} Gandil to score, and cut the lead to 10-5 for the Reds. Cincinnati got out of the inning after a Ray Schalk groundout to stop the comeback.|$|R

25|$|These {{could be}} applied in three {{different}} ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body {{in the form of}} a lead compound in suspension, either from galena (PbS), <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or lead oxide (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the river is at Pilsley near Clay Cross in Derbyshire, from where it flows to the west for a short distance, before turning to the north. The valley is shared with the Derby to Rotherham Railway, which makes the first two {{of a total of}} 20 {{crossings}} before the river reaches the eastern edges of Danesmoor. It is joined by another stream before passing to the west of North Wingfield, after which the <b>Red</b> <b>Lead</b> Mill Brook joins from the west. Before reaching Chesterfield, Birdholme Brook joins it from the west at Birdholme, Calow Brook joins from the east at Hady, and the River Hipper joins it on the southern edge of the town.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required. If paints or coatings are used for isolation, they should be compatible with both metals. Bituminous or zinc chromate primers can be used between copper and aluminum. Bituminous, zinc chromate, or a <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> primer can be effective in separating copper from iron and other ferrous metals. Taping or gasketing with non-absorptive materials or sealants are effective in separating copper from all other metals. In areas with severe exposure, lead or similar gasketing materials should be used, except between copper and aluminum. Water draining from copper surfaces should be prevented from exposure to aluminum and galvanized steel as traces of copper salts may accelerate corrosion. In some cases, anodizing may protect thicker aluminum, such as aluminum window system mullions.|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} was {{investigated by the}} scientists of the National Gallery London. Rembrandt employed his usual limited number of pigments, such as ochres, vermilion, <b>red</b> lakes, <b>lead</b> white, lead-tin-yellow and bone black.|$|R
50|$|Both Eller and Williams pitched {{excellent}} {{to start}} the game, as it wasn't until the sixth inning before the Reds opened the scoring. Hod Eller led off the inning with a double, and came around to scoring after a Morrie Rath single, making it 1-0 for the Reds. Jake Daubert sacrificed bunted, moving Rath to third base, followed by a walk by Heinie Groh. Edd Roush then hit a triple to deep center field, scoring Rath and Groh, making it 3-0 for the Reds. Pat Duncan then hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Roush, extending the <b>Reds</b> <b>lead</b> to 4-0.|$|R
50|$|That {{would be}} the only offense the Reds could muster, as Cicotte pitched a {{complete}} game victory, leading the White Sox to a 4-1 win and cutting the <b>Reds</b> series <b>lead</b> to 4-3.|$|R
25|$|An appeal by {{the protest}} groups to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal {{three days before}} the sinking saw the project placed on hold until the case could be heard in full: {{supporters}} and opponents of the dive wreck agreed to participate in mediation in the meantime. The case was to be heard on 5 May, but was later postponed to July. On 15 September, the Tribunal ruled that scuttling of the ship could go ahead after the removal of any remaining wiring, which may contain polychlorinated biphenyls, canvas, insulation, and exfoliating <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> paint. The delays caused by the tribunal hearing meant that the original $5.8 million assigned to the scuttling project was expended, and the tribunal hearing, additional cleanup, and berthing fees brought the cost of the scuttling project to $8.5 million.|$|E
25|$|Fog, turbulence, and {{darkness}} altered the refueling schedule, shortening some contacts and delaying others. On six occasions the Question Mark was forced {{away from its}} flight track to refuel, once over Oceanside and five times over El Centro. Maintaining contact formation became more difficult as {{the weight of the}} planes changed during transfer, especially since the refueling pilot could not observe the Question Mark. On January 4, after the aircraft rendezvoused over the Imperial Valley, both nearly impacted the ground when they encountered an unexpected air pocket while refueling. Hoyt developed a system whereby Woodring tugged on a string tied to the pilot's arm if the C-1's speed was excessive. Early in the flight a window blew out of the C-2's cabin, but a replacement was eventually hauled up and installed by Hooe. A leak in a fuel line was repaired using a mixture of <b>red</b> <b>lead,</b> soap, and shellac hauled up by tanker.|$|E
