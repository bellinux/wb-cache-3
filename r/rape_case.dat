5|$|Monique Jeffries is a {{tough and}} street-wise detective with the Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police Department. After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit. The two occasionally clash personalities and have a sarcastic rapport with each other. While chasing a rape suspect during one case, Jeffries is nearly killed when the suspect gets into a car that explodes. She initially appears traumatized by the incident, but later feels exhilarated over having survived and starts behaving recklessly. She begins having several one-night stands and takes greater and greater risks at work, becoming something of a loose cannon at the Special Victims Unit. One night at a bar, she meets {{a man who had}} been a suspect in a previous <b>rape</b> <b>case</b> and has sex with him. When she reveals the incident during a session with a police therapist, she is taken out of active duty per One Police Plaza and works a desk job. She objects to the transfer and threatens to sue the department. Instead, she is transferred to the Vice department, and her old job in the Special Victims Unit is taken by Fin Tutuola (Ice-T).|$|E

The criminal disparity in <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> has failed to optimally deliver a basic legal value.

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{prominence}} given to events, issues or phenomena {{by the press}} {{goes a long way}} in determining people’s knowledge, exposure, views, opinions and/or suggestions about such events, issues and phenomena. Thus, the degree of prominence given to <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> by the press in Nigeria determines what Nigerians feel and know about rape and its attendant consequences. This is the bedrock of this study. It is aimed at ascertaining how Nigerian elite women view the coverage of <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> by Nigerian press. It is a qualitative study in which focus Group Discussion method (involving ten women selected from five state universities in the South Eastern) was used in achieving the aim of the study. The findings show that respondents, view press coverage of <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> as “under-representation ” and not “Mis-representation”. This is based on the cited newspapers which contain few <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> which were mostly buried in inside pages. Based on this finding, the study recommends that journalists in Nigeria be more sensitive to the plight of rape victims by giving <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> the prominence they deserve. This no doubt, will serve as deterrant to others who are likely to engage in this inhuman and devilish act...|$|R

The protests, widely covered by the national media, forced the Government to amend the Evidence Act, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Indian Penal Code; and created a new offence, custodial rape. Female activists also united over issues such as female infanticide, gender bias, women's health, women's safety, and women's literacy.|$|E

[...] The very nature of <b>rape</b> <b>cases</b> causes attorneys, many of whom are working for profit, to shy away. A thirty-seven-year-old Rape Crisis Center founder and executive director, also speaking anonymously, bemoaned the fact that accused rapists are difficult to convict which causes success-driven lawyers to instead seek out and fight hard for burglary or larceny cases, because there are [...] "no emotional issues, no time-consuming efforts and victims."
