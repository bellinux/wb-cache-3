40|$|As {{stated in}} the dissertation, "Throughout the 1980 s and into the 1990 s {{financial}} investors, corporate strategists and political leaders from the world largest economies were engaged in intensifying their focus on emerging or developing economies. The developing economies were seen as the new frontier for economic growth {{for some of the}} world's largest corporations. Not only did these developing economies provide the picture of opportunity - companies in the industrialized world became dependent upon on overseas markets for both economies of scale and increasing profits. Simultaneously, developing economies benefited as well. Capital, technology and management expertise flowed into these economies providing a basis for economic growth. However along with opportunity comes risk. Financial shocks rocked the global economy in the mid 1990 s, (beginning with the peso crisis that struck Mexico and then followed by the Asian financial crisis). Political instability in the form of increased crime, kidnapping, assassinations and guerrilla activity were on the rise. These economic and political shocks became the impetus for "capital flight", sending capital fleeing back to the safe haven of their domestic markets or other stable advanced economies. Firms in developing economies were forced to consider alternative avenues for increasing their economic well-being. One alternative that can be given serious consideration is <b>reverse</b> <b>investment.</b> Historically, developing nations have participated in foreign direct investments (FDI) outflows to more developed and advanced economies.

40|$|Judging by the {{provisions}} of its investment code and the apparent stability of the macro-economy, Ethiopia seems to offer a favourable investment climate for the private sector. However, Ethiopian manufacturing has experienced a declining rate of investment since the mid 1990 s. Like other Sub-Saharan African countries, {{more than half of}} manufacturing firms in Ethiopia have zero investment episodes; episodes that have become more persistent over time. This contrasts badly with high average profit rates in African manufacturing relative to average profit rates in OECD countries. Rather than being smooth and continuous, firm level investment in Africa is less frequent and lumpy. While this pattern of capital adjustment is not unique to Africa, the discontinuity and lumpiness is starker than what is observed in developed countries. The evidence in this paper suggests that such discontinuity and the lacklustre investment performance {{have more to do with}} uncertainty and irreversibility.

Empirical analyses of integration processes however require an extensively harmonized procedure to compile and disseminate FDI data.

In the recent past, comparability of FDI data has improved a lot: According to IMF surveys in 2001 and 1997, the Applicant Countries (ACs) in particular were rather successful in complying with the international standards.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{uncertainty}} on the investment decisions at the aggregated and firm level (for a sample of 383 Malaysian firms). It is not {{the aim of the}} study to revisit the already well explored investment theories; instead, the study seeks to bridge the “disconnect” between conventional investment theory and empirics. The ability of empirical investment literature in explaining investment behaviour has been generally disappointing because of the theoretical constraints and the difficulty in isolating the forces which affect investment behaviour (Caballero, Engel and Haltiwanger, 1995). And this is further aggravated by data measurement problems. In spite of the empirical challenges, the importance of investment to economies in terms of expanding the productive capacity, generating income and employment, continues to be the primary motivation for this study. In the case of Malaysia, investments by the private sector contributed 1. 6 percentage points to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2011. The spirit of the study is therefore investigative, probing for answers that can explain the investment behaviour; the empirical models are used mainly as vehicles to construct, present and explain the relationship of the determinants of investment {{in a manner consistent with}} theory. The study leverages on the micro foundations of the neoclassical investment theory and specify both the macro and firm-level investment models that analyse {{the effects of}} uncertainty on irreversible investment. In doing so, the findings from this study will provide greater clarity on how investment responds to prices and shocks, resulting in better targeted investment policies. This study uses the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation technique for both the macro and firm-level investment models as this method addresses the problem of endogeneity. The significance of the negative signs estimate for macroeconomic and firm specific uncertainties suggests that uncertainties weaken the response of investment to demand thus slowing capital accumulation and is consistent with the predictions of theory. In addition, the structure of the economy and the depth its financial system determine the size of the impact of the macro uncertainties. The firm-level analysis corroborates with the findings from the macro model, however, the effects of firm-specific uncertainties are stronger for firms that cannot <b>reverse</b> <b>investment</b> decisions and for those with greater market power. The results suggest that public policies directed at encouraging investments should be more broad-based. While there is still scope for both monetary and fiscal policies, some attention should also be given to managing the perception of risks. As such, consistent and transparent public policies are critical in order to maintain credibility which collectively has important implications on expectations and risks. Policies which promote competition in goods markets and deepen financial markets are important as they allow firms to enhance efficiency and diversify risks. However, the steps taken to develop the financial sector must be measured against the risks of it becoming a potential source of instability. In short, the findings of the study answer the three research questions posed in the study. Broadly, the findings suggest that the government should complement its investment incentives with policies which emphasize on the stability and sustainability of the growth process. Experience of many countries has shown that, when appropriate policies and incentives are in place, a dynamic private sector is the most effective engine for long-term economic growth...|$|E

30|$|Given the {{importance}} of AMH, a fresh study of efficiency of Indian stock market {{is required for the}} following reasons. First, a limited number of studies empirically tested EMH in context of India but the findings are mixed (E.g. Rao and Mukherjee 1971; Sharma and Kennedy 1977; Barua 1981; Amanulla and Kamaiah 1998; Poshakwale 2002, Hiremath and Kamaiah 2010, 2012 among others). There are no studies on Indian stock market, which investigated adaptive behaviour of stock markets. Second, the economic reforms in India were introduced in early 1990 s to infuse energy and vibrancy to the process of economic growth. In addition, capital market plans with setting up of National Stock Exchange (NSE) and changes in the market microstructure and trading practices from 1994 sought a transparent, fair and efficient market. As a result, India’s financial system grew by leaps and bounds in post liberalization era. As per the S & P Fact book (Standard and Poor’s 2012), Indian stock market now has the largest number of listed companies on its exchanges. The growing percentage of market capitalization to the GDP and the increasing integration of the Indian market with the global economy indicate the phenomenal growth of the Indian equity market and its growing importance in the economy. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that emerging markets like India exhibit different characteristics, which distinguish it from developed stock markets and such features influence the nature of market efficiency. Third, the capital market of India {{emerged as one of the}} important destinations for investment. The keen interest of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in Indian stock market for portfolio diversification and higher expected returns is evident from surging foreign investment into Indian capital market. The yield sensitive portfolio investments positively offer liquidity to local markets and sometime trigger panic in the market by <b>reversing</b> the <b>investments.</b> It is logical to expect influence of FIIs on efficiency. Finally, financial crises, both of domestic and foreign origin may affect efficiency of local financial markets.|$|R

The first essay is entitled “Does Low Book-to-market Predict Low Returns? The Other Side of Growth: Research and Development Investment”. In this essay, I develop a theoretical framework of the risk and return of R&D, and examine the relation between R&D and BM. This paper documents that the intersections of R&D and BM produce enhanced trading strategies, and that the four-factor model, with a R&D factor, outperforms the three-factor model. The second essay, entitled “Firm Characteristics and Momentum”, studies the momentum anomaly. In this essay, I examine the relations of firm characteristics and momentum in US stocks. Momentum effect seems to be less significant in recent years. Most importantly, this paper presents that firm size and growth option may {{plays an important role in}} momentum trading strategy.

The firm's production is characterized by its quantity and its flexibility, the latter corresponding to adaptability to changes in consumers' tastes or to new technologies. A larger output quantity entails larger private benefits to the manager, while increasing flexibility runs counter to the managers' private benefits. The manager decides upon non-verifiable investment in human and non-human capital so as to facilitate an increase in the output quantity (capacity investment) or to improve the firm's flexibility (investment in organizational adaptability). We compare the effects of the ownership regime on the manager's incentives to invest and on the aggregate welfare. The private firm under-invests in capacity and organizational flexibility. This is because the government holds up a part of the gains through ex post renegotiation of the initial (incomplete) contract. Our analysis also highlights a fundamental bias in the investment behavior of the state-owned firm: the manager of the public firm only invests in capacity (he may even invest more than under private ownership) but he never invests in organizational adaptability. The model shows that an increase in the government's bargaining power exacerbates the hold up problem when the firm is privately owned, but that this result may be <b>reversed</b> for capacity <b>investment</b> under public ownership. Finally, we show that the superiority of private or public ownership depends simultaneously on three factors: the respective bargaining power of the manager and of the government, the degree of specificity of investments and the relative weight of quantity and flexibility concerns in the social welfare. ...|$|R
