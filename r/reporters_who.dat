5|$|On August 2, 1923, President Harding died {{unexpectedly}} in San Francisco {{while on}} a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. He dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the <b>reporters</b> <b>who</b> had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered {{the oath of office}} in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.|$|E
5|$|Panggilan Darah was the directorial {{debut of}} Sutan Usman Karim, {{commonly}} known as Suska, a journalist and {{former member of the}} touring theatrical group Bolero under Andjar Asmara. With Panggilan Darah, which he also wrote, Suska became one of several <b>reporters</b> <b>who</b> entered the film industry in the 1940s.

The production house had previously released three films, all directed by Njoo Cheong Seng, but after Njoo departed for Fred Young's Majestic, Oriental had required a new director.|$|E
5|$|The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871– January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867– May 30, 1912), {{were two}} American aviators, engineers, inventors, and {{aviation}} pioneers who are generally credited after receiving {{information from the}} government meteorologist stationed there. Kitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from <b>reporters,</b> <b>who</b> had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.|$|E

5|$|Coverage in {{the towns}} and cities where Elite League clubs are based is more extensive, and local {{newspapers}} have dedicated ice hockey <b>reporters</b> <b>who</b> cover the local team. Local radio stations such as BBC Coventry & Warwickshire, BBC Radio Nottingham and BBC Radio Sheffield all provide live commentary of matches. These are either broadcast live on the stations themselves or are webcast through the stations' websites. Radio Sheffield also provides a weekly ice hockey programme Iceline while Radio Nottingham has broadcast a similar programme, Powerplay since the later stages of the 2005–06 season, and has a 15-minute weekly preview of games on a Saturday evening during the ice hockey season after the station's coverage of the local football teams is completed. BBC Coventry & Warwickshire have also followed suit with Faceoff, a programme broadcast on the first Thursday of the month during the season. Video footage can also be viewed from the website.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the <b>reporters,</b> <b>who</b> then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

25|$|The {{mass media}} face {{a number of}} {{pressures}} that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims {{in terms of their}} credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat <b>reporters</b> <b>who</b> {{know a great deal about}} certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.|$|E
25|$|For example: It is {{reported}} {{by such a}} large number of narrators that Muhammad enjoined Muslims to perform two ra'kat in Fajr, four ra'kat in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha and three ra'kat in the Maghrib prayer, yet the narrations of all the <b>reporters</b> <b>who</b> reported the number of ra'kat are not in the same words. Their words are different and even the events reported by them are different. But the common feature of all the reports is the same: the exact number of ra'kat. The hadith is thus said to be mutawatir in meaning.|$|E

In his biography My Life, Magic Johnson recalls instances when Abdul-Jabbar brushed him off when Magic (as a ball boy) asked for his autograph, Abdul-Jabbar froze out <b>reporters</b> <b>who</b> gave him a too enthusiastic handshake or even hugged him, and refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.|$|E
