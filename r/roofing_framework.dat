At present, the gathering of results of laboratory analyses, both public and private, has permitted the establishment of a database supporting an accurate and precise chronology which allows the work of Deneux to be viewed in a new light. For the first time in France and Belgium, a substantial effort was dedicated to the collection of a maximum of dendrochronological analyses in the aim of creating a synthesis of the history of architecture (Hoffsummer et al. 2002).

The igloo is a light nailed hardwood timber arch construction, where each arm is made up of two half arches more or less freely pinned at two abutments close to the ground level, and at a central or crown pin. Each half arch consists of two adjacent trusses laced together at top and bottom chord level and each truss consists of a top and bottom chord laced together in arch form. As a result, each truss is made up of four main timber chords sprung into arch form, and light timber bracing nailed into position to form a curved open-latticed box truss.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{architectural}} {{applications are}} frequently developed on the esthetic requirements of transparency and light that find good correspondence {{in the use}} of structural glass elements. Glass panels, for example, are widely used in the construction of domes, <b>roofs,</b> façades or <b>frameworks</b> in which, in conjunction with metallic bearing structures, they allow the realization of fascinating buildings. At the same time, they could be subjected to in-plane loads or multiple interacting actions that, in combination with high slenderness ratios, possible imperfections, limited tensile strengths and brittle behavior could put forward their collapse. Because of these reasons, numerous authors recently focused on the experimental, analytical, numerical analysis of the load-carrying behavior of glass panels under various loading conditions. In this paper, the buckling response of simply supported glass panels, affected by initial sine-shaped geometrical imperfections and subjected to various combinations of in-plane biaxial compressive/tensile loads, is investigated by means of large series of numerical simulations. The effects of various aspects (geometrical imperfections, slenderness ratio, boundary conditions, aspect ratio, and biaxial loading ratio) are highlighted.

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: The {{connective}} tissue {{system of the}} levator palpebrae superioris muscle (LPS) consists of the septa surrounding its muscle sheath, the superior transverse ligament (STL) {{commonly referred to as}} 'Whitnall's ligament' and the common sheath which is the fascia between the LPS and the superior rectus muscle (SRM). The anterior band-like component of the common sheath is called transverse superior fascial expansion (TSFE) of the SRM and LPS. It mainly extends from the {{connective tissue}} of the trochlea to the fascia of the lacrimal gland. A detailed description of the relation between the LPS and its connective tissue is presented. Furthermore, the course of the LPS in the orbit is described. The study was conducted to provide a morphological basis for biomechanical and clinical considerations regarding ptosis surgery. METHODS: Postmortem dissections were performed in 16 orbits from eight cadavers. The microscopical anatomy was demonstrated in six formalin preserved orbits from six cadavers which had been sectioned in the frontal and sagittal plane and stained with haematoxylin and azophloxin. Surface coil magnetic resonance imaging in the sagittal and coronal plane was performed in five orbits from five normal volunteers using a T 1 weighted spin echo sequence. RESULTS: The STL and the TSFE surround the LPS to form a fascial sleeve around the muscle which has attachments to the medial and lateral orbital wall. The TSFE, which is thicker than the STL, blends with Tenon's capsule. The STL and the fascial sheath of the LPS muscle are suspended from the orbital <b>roof</b> by a <b>framework</b> of radial connective tissue septa. MR images show that the TSFE is located between the anterior third of the superior rectus muscle and the segment of the LPS muscle where it changes its course from upwards to downwards. In this area, the LPS reaches its highest point in the orbit (culmination point). The culmination point is located a few millimetres posterior to the equator and superior to the globe. CONCLUSION: Whitnall's ligament can be considered to consist of two distinct parts [...] the TSFE inferior to the LPS and the STL superior to the LPS. Since the medial and lateral main attachments of Whitnall's ligament are situated inferior {{to the level of the}} culmination point of the LPS, the ligament itself is unlikely to suspend the levator muscle. However, a suspension of the LPS may be achieved by the radial connective tissue septa of the superior orbit. The TSFE in connection with the globe may have an additional supporting function. The elasticity of Whitnall's ligament and its connections with highly elastic structures including Tenon's capsule, may provide the morphological substrate for the previously proposed passive (that is, without orbicularis action) lowering of the lid during downward saccades...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{suggestions and}} recommendations {{on how to}} convert an old industrial building, built in 1958, to an office hotel. One of the main criteria was that the floor plan should be flexible. The building is situated at Jonsereds Fabriker and {{the study was conducted}} for Hantverkslokaler i Göteborg AB, the estate owner. The survey is initiated with study visits at various office hotels, together with studies of literature regarding office planning. One conclusion from the study visits is that meeting-places, where the different companies can meet and exchange ideas and services, are important. Another one, and probably the most important parameter when planning offices is that they should have windows. Furthermore, Partille municipality and Hantverkslokaler’s visions, for Jonsereds Fabriker, are formulated. They both have in common that they want to change the area from an industrial area and focus on companies in the service sector. Thereafter, a status report of the premises is conducted. The entrances, floor plan, <b>framework,</b> <b>roof,</b> windows and facades are examined. It is noted that the premises biggest drawback is that there are only windows along the north-western side and the entrance is vague, cramped and dark. The sketch process results in proposals and recommendations on how to adapt the premises. The key recommendations are to make a new, larger and more accessible entrance that connects to several premises, not only with the premises covered in this report. The new entrance is made in an architecture that stands out, to indicate that there is something happening on the inside. Furthermore, more daylight is needed. To resolve this issue it is recommended that the windows in the north-western side are exchanged for larger ones, that there are new windows put in in the south-eastern side and a replacement and expansion of today’s smoke ventilators to roof lanterns. In order to achieve a flexible floor plan, two volumes are placed along the two long sides of the room. These volumes contain the offices and are divided with flexible, easy to move, inner walls. This allows the office spaces size to be adapted for the tenants requirements. Because the offices are located along the outer wall they all have windows. A third volume is placed along the middle of the room. Within this, functions that do not need daylight can be located. Functions such as storage, copying and meeting rooms. On top of this volume it is proposed to build a loft, to maximize the floor usage. Finally, it is being discussed, among other things, what could have been done differently. The main aspect of the report is focused on making the most out of the premises potential and less consideration has been given to economic aspects, which can be considered a weakness...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY An {{interdisciplinary}} research program on organic pig production, EKOPIG, was financed by FORMAS and by SLU. Part IV of EKOPIG {{was carried out}} at SLU-Alnarp and emphasis was on housing systems for organic growing-finishing pigs. In this part, an animal house for organic growing-finishing pigs was built. The planning and construction of the building is described in this report. When planning {{the design of the}} animal house, a number of principles were taken into consideration. Among others, the pigs should be easy to control and monitor. It should also be easy to control feeding and production, to weigh the pigs, and to send them to slaughter. The labour requirement should be minimized by using automatic manure and feeding systems. The building construction should be simple, uninsulated, and self-ventilating, and to a major extent be constructed of locally available wooden material. In addition, dung contact between the animal groups should be avoided [...] The house had room for 128 growing-finishing pigs distributed into 8 pens of 16 pigs each (Figure 8). There were two different pen types, of which one had deep straw bedding (Figure 15), and the other had slanted floors and the “straw-flow” system (Figures 12 and 16). The pens were designed according to the EU and KRAV regulations (with or without letting the animals go outside). The total pen area was 1. 5 m 2 per pig inside and 1 m 2 per pig outside on the concrete area. The building was constructed at JBT’s research farm for pig studies at Odarslöv, and had bearing outer walls and <b>framework</b> <b>roof</b> trusses. The animal house was located near the existing manure container (Figures 1 and 2). The concrete floor was poured on location (Figure 3) upon which walls were built up of cavity cement blocks. The sides of the dung channel and the wall towards the animal area were also built of cavity cement blocks (Figure 4). The lower section of the wall was built of lightclinker blocks which were plastered on both sides, and above this section the wall was made of a wooden frame covered with wood panels (Figure 5). The roof consisted of cement fiber plates (Figure 6). There was natural ventilation due to the wooden slats on the walls and an open roof ridge with transparent covering. The roof ridge was furnished with a wind shield and was solid the first 4 m from each gable. The pen with the straw flow system had a lying area which was covered and a floor profile slanting to the dung channel (Figure 16). All the pens were placed in a row with openings towards the north (Figure 13) facing the concrete area and pasturage. An inspection passage was placed along one of the outside walls (Figure 9). The concrete outside lying area had the same design for all of the pens (Figure 14). The floor profile for the pens and concrete areas are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The pigs were fed using an automatic dry feed system (Figure 18) in transverse troughs (Figure 17), and over the troughs water pipes with nose valves were placed so the pigs had the possibility of wetting the feed. Roughage was distributed in containers placed in the concrete area on the stable walls (Figures 19 and 20). The pigs had free access to water via a water cup located in the dung alley (Figure 21). The water installations were protected from frost using an electric heating cable inserted in the water pipes in the animal house. Ordinary straw was used as bedding and it was handled in the form of big bales transported into the house using a tractor with a front loader (Figure 22). The dung from the animal house was managed both as solid and liquid manure. The pens with deep straw bedding were cleaned using a front loader once per batch, and the dung transported to an area for solid dung located near the animal house. The pens which had slanted floors were kept clean via the activity of the animals. Straw was distributed to the lying area and much of the straw carried out to the pen floor. Due to the animals’ activity it ended up in the dung area (10 % slant) {{at the lower end of}} the pen. There it was mixed with the dung and pressed down by the pigs through an opening between the floor and the pen wall (Figure 23). A dung alley/channel with concrete slats connected all the pens (Figure 24), and it was scraped daily using a cable driven scraper (Figure 25). The dung was moved to a pump well and then pumped over to a storage container. The manure was mixed before pumping by pumping it around (Figure 7) the dung channel on the outside area. During the planning phase for the animal house, many calculations for the use of feed, water, straw and as well as the quantities of dung and urine which would be produced were carried out (Table 1) An estimation of the building costs was carried out with the help of the data for cost estimation for farm production buildings obtained from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Table 8). The present calculation was based on the prices for 2002, and the estimated cost for the animal house was 1, 465, 000 SKK, or 11, 450 SKK per pig place. The building area per pig was 3. 9 m 2 including the service areas. The cost of the manure containers and straw storage was not included in this estimation. The size of the pasture areas was calculated and consideration was taken to the recommendations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus loading (Tables 2 – 5) per ha for pigs on pasture. An estimation was made of the amount of the produced manure which would remain in the house or be on the outside areas. For 4 of the 8 pens (Figure 26) fenced lots were made (Figure 28) which the pigs had access to in the summer months. Special transport alleys (Figure 27) out to these lots were also built to maintain a good longevity for these hard used areas. The pasture lots were established with a wide range of grasses (Table 6) which were completed later with more diverse species (Table 7) ...|$|R
