Transmission direction is indicated by an arrow on the label on the right ...|$|E
50|$|A two-port {{isolator}} {{is obtained}} simply by terminating {{one of the}} three ports with a matched load, which absorbs all the power entering it. The biassed ferrite is part of the circulator and causes a differential phase-shift for signals travelling in different directions. The bias field is lower than that needed for resonance absorption, and so this type of isolator does not require such a heavy permanent magnet. Because the power is absorbed in an external load, cooling is less of a problem than with a <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>isolator.</b>|$|E
50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>isolator,</b> but the {{magnetic}} biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal, while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the forward signal tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film. In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the resistive film on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{velocity}} shear on the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> of incompressible MHD surface waves are studied. It is {{found that there}} are generally values of the velocity shear for which the surface wave decay rate becomes zero. In some cases, the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> goes to zero even for very small velocity shears. It is {{also found that the}} <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> can be strongly enhanced at other values of the velocity shear, so the presence of flows may be generally important for determining the effects of <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption,</b> such as might occur in the interaction of p-modes with sunspots. Resonances leading to instability of the global surface mode can exist, and instability can occur for velocity shears significantly below the Kelvin-Helmholtz threshold.

The peak located near 445 nm is the plasmon <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> peak of Ag nanoparticles embedded in a partially oxidized Si matrix. Its intensity decreases with decreasing film thickness and disappears in a very thin sample. The peak located near 380 nm originates from the plasmon <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> of the thoroughly oxidized surface layer of the sample.

40|$|AbstractNeutron <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> {{radiography}} is {{a technique}} to enhance neutron transmission images of specific nucleus at neutron resonance energies. Demonstration measurements by using a lithium-glass pixel type scintillator and a gas electron multiplication (GEM) neutron detector were carried out at NOBORU beam line in MLF/J-PARC for sodium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, molybdenum, cadmium, indium, tantalum and gold. To discuss advantages of the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> radiography the mass attenuation coefficient at resonance energy of each element was compared to that at 25 meV. In addition a visibility index derived by a resonance peak cross section and a relative width (full width at half maximum divided by its resonance energy) was proposed to summarize visibility of the neutron <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> radiography for natural elements. The values of visibility index and the resonance energy indicated that large advantages of the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> radiography were obtainable for the following elements: sodium (Na), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), indium (In), xenon (Xe), cesium (Cs), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), rhenium (Re), iridium (Ir) and gold (Au) ...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{nanoparticles}} (gold, silver, copper) {{that are}} embedded in an insulating organic host material exhibit optical plasma <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> in the visible and near-infrared region. The spectral position, the half width {{and the intensity of}} the plasma <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> all depend on the particle size, the particle shape, and the optical behavior of the cluster and the host material. The optical extinction of various gold, silver or copper particle assemblies embedded in plasma polymer or gelatin was measured at 4. 2 K and 1. 2 K as well as at room temperature. The packing density of several samples was high enough to resolve a reversible increase of the plasma <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> intensity towards lower temperatures. Additionally, at larger silver particles D(m) > 50 nm a significant blue shift of the plasma <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> was measured. Particle size shape distribution were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For the first time, simultaneous measurements of the electrical and optical properties at one and the same particle assembly were performed at low temperatures. Contrary to the increasing optical extinction, the d. c. conductivity decreased to two orders of magnitude.

(1987) {{observation}} that the power in outgoing p-modes {{in the vicinity of}} sunspots is less than that incoming has prompted the present consideration of the possibility that this deficit is due to <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> occurring when the sunspot boundary has nonzero thickness. A simple planar analysis is used to characterize the requisite conditions for this effect, and to estimate the absorption coefficient. It is found that the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> effect is unlikely to explain the substantial loss of p-mode power observed over a substantial range of frequency and azimuthal order...|$|R

The irradiation time {{dependence of the}} synthesized silver and agar/silver nanoparticle absorption spectra and their antibacterial effect are studied and compared. In the agar/silver nanoparticle sample, as the irradiation time of argon glow discharge plasma or mercury lamp increases, the peak intensity and the full width at half maximum, FWHM, of the surface plasmon <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> band is increased, however a decrease of the peak intensity with oxygen glow plasma has been observed.

It is argued that the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> model is able to obtain the large absorption coefficients observed for nonaxisymmetric perturbations. For axisymmetric perturbations, departures from perfect cylindrical symmetry or the inclusion of a slight twist in the sunspot flux tube may be able to resolve the problem with the absorption of m = 0 wave modes.

40|$|Abstract. An {{analytical}} {{expression of}} the complex permittivity is derived for absorbing centres featuring inhomogeneous absorption-line broadening. Such an expression gives the dispersion law of the real part of the permittivity when the imaginary part has a Gaussian lineshape.

The analytical solution found {{is consistent with the}} Kramers–Kronig relation. We demonstrate that, like in the case of homogeneous absorption-line broadening, the refractive index increases at photon energies lower than the <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> energy also for inhomogeneous absorption-line broadening; if the absorbing centres emit Stokes-shifted radiation, such an increase can be exploited for passive and active waveguiding applications.
