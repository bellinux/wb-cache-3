In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some <b>recreational</b> <b>shooting</b> munitions.

25|$|Henry Bowman is the {{principal}} character, although the story begins in 1906, long before Bowman's birth on January 10, 1953. The story is told primarily from his perspective when {{he is in his}} early forties. Bowman grows up in the St. Louis, Missouri area, where much of the story takes place. He is a trained geologist, a self-taught expert marksman, a firearms, ammunition, and self-defense authority, and a pilot. Bowman lives on a rural acreage near the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. There is an abandoned stone quarry on his land which Bowman uses for <b>recreational</b> <b>shooting.</b> Bowman, in the novel, enjoys owning performance automobiles and driving at high speed on interstate highways. In one part of the novel, he races his hot-rodded GMC truck against a rival Porsche, with Bowman winning, driving in excess of 140mph to win. Bowman also has several forged identities that he uses for various purposes in the novel. Bowman is a proficient skydiver.|$|E

40|$|Damage to {{agricultural}} crops caused by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{continues to be}} a significant concern of farmers in Michigan and elsewhere in the United States. Policy changes that promise to reduce deer numbers may be long in coming, but better application of available damage control techniques may be an immediate alternative for farmers awaiting relief. Conversations with farmers, extension agents, and wildlife professionals suggest that some damage control techniques are underutilized by Michigan farmers, whereas other techniques are applied with little success despite promising field trials. We investigated producers’ practices to identify common weaknesses in how deer damage controls were being applied so that Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Cooperative Extension personnel could develop programs to improve the effectiveness of these applications. In January 1997, a 6 -page questionnaire was mailed to 250 agricultural producers who indicated that they used some form of deer damage control to protect their crops. Producers were queried about specific methods employed, intensity and frequency of applications, fence maintenance, hunting and shooting techniques, deer harvest ratios, integration of techniques, and the perceived effectiveness of controls and/or combinations of techniques. <b>Recreational</b> hunting, <b>shooting</b> permits, and block permits were the control methods used most frequently by respondents. Although 84 % of respondents expressed a desire to reduce the deer herd in the vicinity of their farm, most were not contributing effectively to achieving such a reduction through their own hunter management and deer harvest. Results suggest that educational and management opportunities do exist to encourage producers to more systematically apply and integrate available deer damage controls in Michigan...|$|R
5000|$|On Second Amendment Rights & Gun Control:I {{know that}} the {{firearms}} you keep to protect yourself and those you love do not threaten the public safety. I understand that the firearms you use to hunt and to enjoy <b>recreational</b> target <b>shooting</b> {{are not on the}} street and do not cause crime. I know that disarming the law-abiding has never deterred criminals and does nothing to reduce gun violence. I affirm that the right to keep and bear arms, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment, is an individual right - your individual right.I believe the solution to gun violence in America is not to strip freedom away from law-abiding citizens, but for our government to vigorously prosecute and punish violent criminals.Gun control is not crime control. Gun control is a cynical, manipulative scare tactic, sold by politicians who lack the heart to truly lead, preferring comforting delusions to challenging realities.In the United States Senate, I will oppose bills that only pretend to reduce gun violence. I will oppose legislation calling for ballistic fingerprinting, which would lead to no more than an enormous waste of taxpayer money. I will support the bill to end frivolous lawsuits against the firearms industry. I will call for a review of federal gun control laws, and urge the repeal of those laws that only burden the law-abiding and waste precious law enforcement resources.There are already over 30,000 gun control laws on the books and gun violence is still a serious problem in America. In the United States Senate, I will aggressively support genuine crime control through the enactment of laws to impose swift, certain and severe mandatory sentences for anyone convicted of having or using a firearm during the commission of a crime.” Michael Benjamin ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recreational</b> ground {{squirrel}} <b>shooting</b> {{is a popular}} activity throughout the western United States {{and serves as a}} tool for managing {{ground squirrel}} populations in agricultural regions. Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) are routinely shot in California, Nevada, and Oregon across habitats that overlap with breeding avian scavengers. Ground squirrels shot with lead (Pb) -based bullets may pose a risk to avian scavengers if they consume carcasses containing Pb fragments. To assess the potential risk to breeding avian scavengers we developed a model to estimate the number, mass, and distribution of Pb fragments in shot ground squirrels using radiographic images. Eighty percent of shot carcasses contained detectible Pb fragments with an average of 38. 6 mg of Pb fragments. Seven percent of all carcasses contained Pb fragment masses exceeding a lethal dose for a model raptor nestling (e. g. American kestrel Falco sparverius). Bullet type did not influence the number of fragments in shot ground squirrels, but did influence the mass of fragments retained. Belding's ground squirrels shot with. 17 Super Mag and unknown ammunition types contained over 28 and 17 times more mass of Pb fragments than those shot with. 22 solid and. 22 hollow point bullets, respectively. Ground squirrel body mass was positively correlated with both the number and mass of Pb fragments in carcasses, increasing on average by 76 % and 56 % respectively across the range of carcass masses. Although the mass of Pb retained in ground squirrel carcasses was small relative to the original bullet mass, avian scavenger nestlings that frequently consume shot ground squirrels may be at risk for Pb-induced effects (e. g., physiology, growth, or survival). Using modeling efforts we found that if nestling golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and Swainson's hawks (B. swainsoni) consumed shot ground squirrels proportionately to the nestling's mass, energy needs, and diet, 100 % of the nestling period would exceed a 50 % reduction in delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase production threshold, the last 13 - 27 % of the nestling stage would exceed a reduced growth rate threshold, but no nestlings would be expected to exceed a level of Pb ingestion that would be lethal...|$|R
