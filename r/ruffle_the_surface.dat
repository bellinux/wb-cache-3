6000|$|... "Just the {{difference}} between smooth water and rough--you <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of a canal with a lazy oar, while I run the channel of Piombino in a mistral, shoot the Faro of Messina in a white squall, double Santa Maria di Leuca in a breathing Levanter, and come skimming up the Adriatic before a sirocco that is hot enough to cook my maccaroni, and which sets the whole sea boiling worse than the caldrons of Scylla." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus reigned and vegetated Wolfert Webber {{over his}} {{paternal}} acres, peaceably and contentedly. Not but that, {{like all other}} sovereigns, he had his occasional cares and vexations. The growth of his native city sometimes caused him annoyance. His little territory gradually became hemmed in by streets and houses, which intercepted air and sunshine. He was now and then subject to the irruptions of the border population, that infest the streets of a metropolis, who would sometimes make midnight forays into his dominions, and carry off captive whole platoons of his noblest subjects. Vagrant swine would make a descent, too, now and then, when the gate was left open, and lay all waste before them; and mischievous urchins would often decapitate the illustrious sunflowers, {{the glory of the}} garden, as they lolled their heads so fondly over the walls. Still all these were petty grievances, which might now and then <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of his mind, as a summer breeze will <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of a mill-pond; but they could not disturb the deep-seated quiet of his soul. He would seize a trusty staff, that stood behind the door, issue suddenly out, and anoint the back of the aggressor, whether pig or urchin, and then return within doors, marvellously refreshed and tranquillized.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately {{the wind}} veered round to the {{south-east}} {{soon after the}} departure of the canoes from Moose Fort, and although there was not enough of it to <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the river, it had the effect of checking the influx of ice from James's Bay. The tide, too, began to ebb, so that the progress of the canoes was even more rapid than it appeared to be; and long before the sun set, they were past the point {{at the mouth of the}} river, and coasting along the shores of the salt ocean.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning {{the weather was}} still and dull. Not a breath of wind <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> river.|$|R
60|$|The {{fire was}} kicked out and they took {{themselves}} to their boat. A strong wind was coming up, <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of Firefly Lake.|$|R
6000|$|The breeze {{appeared}} to have been waiting for an invitation, for one or two [...] "cat's-paws" [...] <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> sea as he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|There was not {{a breath}} of wind to <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the glassy sea, as {{the captain of the}} sandal-wood trader reached the shore and uttered a low cry like the hoot of an owl. The cry was {{instantly}} replied to, and in a few minutes a boat crept noiselessly towards the shore, seeming, in the uncertain light, more like a shadow than a reality. It was rowed by a single man. When within a few yards of the shore, the oars ceased to move, and the deep stillness of the night was scarcely broken by the low voice of surly Dick demanding--"Who goes there?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{evening when}} these {{different}} parties {{set out on}} their various expeditions. The sun was descending to the horizon {{in a blaze of}} lurid light. The slight breeze, which wafted his Britannic Majesty's ship slowly along the verdant shore, was scarcely strong enough to <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the sea. Huge banks of dark clouds were gathering in the sky, and a hot unnatural closeness seemed to pervade the atmosphere, as if a storm were about to burst upon the scene. Everything, above and below, seemed to presage war--alike elemental and human--and the various leaders of the several expeditions felt that the approaching night would tax their powers and resources to the uttermost.|$|E
60|$|At {{four o'clock}} fifty-eight persons landed; but the tides being {{extremely}} languid, the water only left the higher {{parts of the}} rock, and no work could {{be done at the}} site of the building. A third forge was, however, put in operation during a short time, for the greater conveniency of sharpening the picks and irons, and for purposes connected with the preparations for fixing the railways on the rock. The weather towards the evening became thick and foggy, and there was hardly a breath of wind to <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water. Had it not, therefore, been for the noise from the anvils of the smiths who had been left on the beacon throughout the day, which afforded a guide for the boats, a landing could not have been attempted this evening, especially with such a company of artificers. This circumstance confirmed the writer's opinion with regard to the propriety of connecting large bells to be rung with machinery in the lighthouse, to be tolled day and night during the continuance of foggy weather.|$|E
60|$|It {{was blowing}} now in short {{frequent}} puffs, which <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> water, and caused the Black Eagle to surge slowly forward over the rollers. A {{few drops of}} rain came pattering down upon the deck. The great bank of cloud was above the ship, still hurrying wildly across the heavens.|$|R
60|$|New York policemen never {{laugh when}} on duty. There is {{probably}} {{something in the}} regulations against it. But Officer Donahue permitted the left {{corner of his mouth}} to twitch slightly, and a momentary muscular spasm disturbed the calm of Officer Cassidy's granite features, as a passing breeze <b>ruffles</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of some bottomless lake.|$|R
60|$|The sea rose {{as if by}} magic. Where, for weeks, {{scarcely}} a ripple had <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> water; now great waves, with crested tops, tore along. The air was full of blinding foam, swept from {{the tops of the}} waves; and it was difficult for those on board even to breathe, when facing the force of the wind.|$|R
60|$|Maisie's {{desire to}} show what justice she did her had by this time become so intense as to have brought with it an inspiration. The great effect of their {{encounter}} had been to confirm her sense of being launched with Sir Claude, to make it rich and full beyond anything she had dreamed, and everything now conspired {{to suggest that a}} single soft touch of her small hand would complete the good work and set her ladyship so promptly and majestically afloat as to leave the great seaway clear for the morrow. This was the more the case as her hand had for some moments been rendered free by a marked manoeuvre of both of her mother's. One of these capricious members had fumbled with visible impatience in some backward depth of drapery and had presently reappeared with a small article in its grasp. The act had a significance for a little person trained, in that relation, from an early age, {{to keep an eye on}} manual motions, and its possible bearing was not darkened by the memory of the handful of gold that Susan Ash would never, never believe Mrs. Beale had sent back--"not she; she's too false and too greedy!"--to the munificent Countess. To have guessed, none the less, that her ladyship's purse might be the real figure of the object extracted from the rustling covert at her rear--this suspicion gave on the spot to the child's eyes a direction carefully distant. It added moreover to the optimism that for an hour could <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of her deep diplomacy, ruffle it to the point of making her forget that she had never been safe unless she had also been stupid. She in short forgot her habitual caution in her impulse to adopt her ladyship's practical interests and show her ladyship how perfectly she understood them. She saw without looking that her mother pressed a little clasp; heard, without wanting to, the sharp click that marked the closing portemonnaie from which something had been taken. What this was she just didn't see; it was not too substantial to be locked with ease in the fold of her ladyship's fingers. Nothing was less new to Maisie than the art of not thinking singly, so that at this instant she could both bring out what was on her tongue's end and weigh, as to the object in her mother's palm, the question of its being a sovereign against the question of its being a shilling. No sooner had she begun to speak than she saw that within a few seconds this question would have been settled: she had foolishly checked the rising words of the little speech of presentation to which, under the circumstances, even such a high pride as Ida's had had to give some thought. She had checked it completely--that was the next thing she felt: the note she sounded brought into her companion's eyes a look that quickly enough seemed at variance with presentations.|$|E
40|$|Translations, says Gideon Toury, are {{facts of}} target {{cultures}} – but the perceived status of source texts has a bearing on how these are reflected or refracted {{in the target}} language. This proposition is particularly evident {{in the case of}} classics: when translators have to work on literary creations occupying a pivotal position in the source/target cultures, they adopt strategies of literalness and ennoblement which betray a quasi-religious awe – on the one hand, a desire to <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the revered original as little as possible; and on the other, a determination to reproduce the supposed “classical qualities” of the classic even when they are not present in the source. In this dissertation, Paola Venturi studies how the “idea of classic” influences translation theory and practice, and substantiates her theoretical observations by looking at Italian translations of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English classics. A marked – and historically determined – disparity between source and target readerships, and the translators’ reverence for their prestigious originals, conspire to produce Italian versions which are much more “wooden” and “elegant” than their English counterparts...|$|E
60|$|From {{the variety}} of reflection, may also be deduc'd the cause why a small breez or gale of wind <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of a smooth water, makes it appear black; as also, on the other side, why the {{smoothing}} or burnishing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of whitened Silver makes it look black; and multitudes of other phænomena might hereby be solv'd, which are too many to be here insisted on.|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} the canoes swept out to sea, {{and made for}} the point far ahead like race-horses. Although the clouds {{continued}} to gather, the wind did not rise, and {{it seemed as though}} they would get over easily, when a sudden gust came off the shore--a direction whence, from the appearance of the clouds, it had not been expected. <b>Ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> water for a few seconds, it passed away.|$|R
60|$|They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn, {{without a}} <b>ruffle</b> on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of his unfathomable depths, {{drinking}} his old wine, {{and go down}} into the streets.|$|R
60|$|In the roads, {{standing}} {{in for the}} shore before a gentle breeze that scarcely <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> sapphire <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> Caribbean, came a stately red-hulled frigate, flying the English ensign.|$|R
60|$|On {{the fifth}} morning that succeeded the {{breaking}} of the storm, described in the last chapter, the sun rose in gorgeous splendour and shone upon a sea that was clear and burnished like a sheet of glass. The wind had ceased suddenly, and a perfect calm prevailed; but although no breath of air <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> deep, the long swell rose and fell as if the breast of ocean were still throbbing from its recent agitation.|$|R
60|$|The soft breeze {{that was}} blowing {{scarcely}} <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of this beautiful river; {{two or three}} picturesque barks, called mystics, with long latine sails, were gliding down it. A little aid of the imagination might suffice to picture them as the light caravels of Columbus, sallying forth on their eventful expedition, while the distant bells {{of the town of}} Hnelva, which were ringing melodiously, might be supposed as cheering the voyagers with a farewell peal.|$|R
60|$|The moon {{had risen}} and {{commenced}} her course through a sky {{which was so}} clear that the planets shone like resplendent jewels, and the distant stars like diamond dust. Not a breath of air <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> sea; nevertheless, its slumbering energies were indicated by the waves on the outlying coral reef, which, approaching one by one, slowly and solemnly, fell with {{what can only be}} called a quiet roar, hissed gently for a moment on the sand, and then passed with a sigh into absolute silence.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{had just}} set, the sea breeze was {{rustling}} and tumbling in <b>the</b> woods and <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> grey <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after {{the heat of}} the day, chilled me through my jacket.|$|R
6000|$|Happily, {{in those}} highly favoured climes weather has not usually {{to be taken}} much into account. The sun arose out of the ocean's breast with the same unclouded beauty that had marked his rise every morning for a week previously, and would {{probably}} mark it for a week to come. The sweet scents of the wooded heights floated down on the silver strand; <b>the</b> sharks <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> lagoon with their black fins, the birds hopped or flew from palm-tree to mimosa-bush, and the waterfowl went about according to taste on lazy or whistling wings, intent on daily business, much as though nothing unusual were [...] "in the air." ...|$|R
60|$|She thanked him, {{and sitting}} down {{was silent for}} a few moments while she gazed across the lawn. Some of the guests were sitting in the shadow by the water's edge, their summer clothes making blotches of bright color among the gray rocks. Out on the lake, a young man knelt in the stern of a canoe, {{swinging}} a paddle that flashed in the sun, while a girl trailed her hand in the sparkling water. As the craft passed the landing she began to sing. No breath of wind <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> now, and <b>the</b> dark pine-sprays were still. A drowsy quietness brooded over the tranquil scene.|$|R
60|$|During these {{short but}} {{pleasant}} hours, the adventurer {{who had been}} so oddly called into the command of the Bristol trader, appeared in a new character. Though his conversation was characterized by the frank manliness of a seaman, it was, nevertheless tempered by the delicacy of perfect breeding. The beautiful mouth of Gertrude often struggled to conceal the smiles which played around her lips and dimpled her cheeks, like a soft air <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of some limpid spring; and once or twice, when the humour of Wilder came unexpectedly across her youthful fancy, she was compelled to yield to the impulses of an irresistible merriment.|$|R
50|$|Sea {{trout and}} salmon are an {{important}} part of Loch Maree's ecosystem providing food for black-throated diver and otter (Lutra lutra) for which the loch is a designated Special Area of Conservation and Special Protected Area under the EU Habitats Directive. Juvenile trout can be an important part of the diet of black-throated diver. The loch also has two separate populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) about which little is known. One form of charr, with a big eye which feeds on the bottom in deep water matures at less than 15 cm. The other form grows to over 32 cm and can sometimes be seen in shoals <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> when <b>the</b> loch is calm.|$|R
60|$|While she {{was thus}} engaged she {{became aware of}} a low moaning noise and a {{stirring}} of the air about her which caused the leaves and grasses to quiver without bending. Then followed an ice-cold wind that grew in strength until it blew keen and hard, <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> marshy pools. Still Rachel went on with her task, for her basket was not more than half full, till presently the heavens above her began to mutter and to groan, and drops of rain as large as shillings fell upon her back and hands. Now she understood {{that it was time}} for her to be going, and started to walk across the island--for at the moment she was near its farther side--to reach the deep, rocky river-bed or donga.|$|R
60|$|At last it came. A few cat's-paws <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> sea, distending {{the sails}} for a moment, then leaving them flat and loose as before. This, however, was sufficient; another such puff {{and the ship}} was almost out of danger, but before it came, the {{projecting}} summit of the smaller berg was overhanging the deck. At this critical moment the wind began to blow steadily, and soon the Dolphin was in the open water beyond. Five minutes after she had passed, the moving mountains struck with a noise louder than thunder; the summits and large portions of the sides fell, with a succession of crashes like the roaring of artillery, just above {{the spot where the}} ship had lain not quarter of an hour before, and the vessel, for some time after, rocked violently to and fro, in the surges that the plunge of the falling masses raised.|$|R
60|$|Waves {{are caused}} by wind, which first <b>ruffles</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> sea into ripples, and then, acting with {{ever-increasing}} power on <b>the</b> little <b>surfaces</b> thus raised, blows them up into waves, and finally into great billows. Sometimes, however, winds burst upon the calm ocean with such sudden violence that for a time the waves cannot lift their heads. The instant they do so, they are cast down and scattered in foam, and the ocean {{in a few minutes}} presents the appearance of a cauldron of boiling milk! Such squalls are extremely dangerous to mariners, and vessels exposed to them are often thrown on their beam-ends, even though all sail has been previously taken in. Generally speaking, however, the immediate effect of wind passing either lightly or furiously over the sea is to raise its surface into waves. But these waves, however large they may be, do not affect the waters of the ocean more than a few yards below its <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> water below their influence is comparatively calm, being affected only by ocean currents.|$|R
6000|$|This chain bore all the evidences {{of being}} very old ice--compared to which {{that of the}} {{so-called}} [...] "ancient sea" [...] was absolutely juvenile. On the ice-plain, which was apparently illimitable {{to the right and}} left, were hundreds of pools of water in which the icebergs, the golden clouds, the sun, and the blue sky were reflected, and on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of which myriads of Arctic wild-fowl were sporting about, making the air vocal with their plaintive cries, and <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> glassy <b>surfaces</b> of <b>the</b> lakes with their dipping wings. The heads of seals were also observed here and there.|$|R
6000|$|It was a bright, clear, {{beautiful}} {{morning when}} we first launched our little boat and rowed out upon the placid waters of the lagoon. Not a breath of wind <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> deep. Not a cloud spotted the deep-blue sky. Not a sound that was discordant broke {{the stillness of the}} morning, although there were many sounds--sweet, tiny, and melodious--that mingled in the universal harmony of nature. The sun was just rising from the Pacific's ample bosom, and tipping the mountain-tops with a red glow. The sea was shining like a sheet of glass, yet heaving with the long, deep swell that, all the world round, indicates the life of Ocean; and the bright seaweeds and the brilliant corals shone in the depths of that pellucid water, as we rowed over it, like rare and precious gems. Oh, it was a sight fitted to stir the soul of man to its profoundest depths! and if he owned a heart at all, to lift that heart in adoration and gratitude to the great Creator of this magnificent and glorious universe! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{water was}} smooth, {{the sun had}} sunk behind the range, and a warm breeze that <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> shining <b>surface</b> with silky ripples blew off the shore. The rumble of the surf came in a deep {{undertone}} through the throb of the engine, and the launch sped on with a frothy wave curling at her bows. Now and then Clare glanced quickly at the helmsman, who sat with his arm thrown round the tiller. She thought he looked disturbed, and felt sorry, though she told herself that she had done the proper thing.|$|R
60|$|It was a June morning. There {{had been}} few breezes and no storms for some weeks past, {{so that the}} usual swell of the ocean had gone down, and there were {{actually}} no breakers on the rock at low water, and no <b>ruffling</b> of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> at all at high tide. The tide had, about two hours before, overflowed the rock and driven the men into the beacon house, where, having breakfasted, {{they were at the}} time enjoying themselves with pipes and small talk.|$|R
60|$|He {{found himself}} {{presently}} {{back in the}} cool and pleasantly austere surroundings of his sitting room and threw himself into an easy-chair drawn {{up in front of}} the wide-flung windows. A strong breeze, against which a flight of seagulls leaned, was stirring the trees in the Embankment Gardens and <b>ruffling</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> water. The pall of smoke eastward seemed here and there cloven by a wind-swept avenue of clearer spaces. He felt a sudden and passionate distaste for his recent environment,--the faint perfume which had crept out from the girl's hair and face as she had leaned towards him, the brushing of her clothes against his, the daring exposure of silk stocking, the continual flirtatious appeal of her eyes and lips. He felt himself in revolt against even that faint instinct of toleration which her prettiness and at times subtle advances had kindled in him. He let his thoughts rest upon the more wonderful things which smouldered in his brain and leaped like fire through his veins when he dared to think of them. The room seemed suddenly purified, made fit for her presence.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after this}} a soft gentle breeze sprang up. It came direct from Fairyland, {{as if the}} mermaids {{referred}} to by Gurney had been touched by the kindly feelings harboured in the sailors' bosoms towards their islet, and had wafted towards them a last farewell. The oars were shipped immediately and the sails hoisted, and, {{to the satisfaction of}} all on board, the Maid of the Isle gave indications of being a swift sailer, for, although the puff of wind was scarcely sufficient to <b>ruffle</b> <b>the</b> glassy <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> sea, she glided through the water under its influence a good deal faster than she had done with the oars.|$|R
60|$|It {{therefore}} {{happened that}} Savine, irritated by a journalistic {{reference to the}} tardiness of that season's road-making, went down {{to see how the}} work entrusted to Geoffrey was progressing. He was accompanied by his daughter, who desired to visit the wife of a prosperous rancher. It was towards noon of a hot day when they alighted from their horses in the mouth of a gorge that wound inland from the margin of a lake. No breath of wind <b>ruffled</b> <b>the</b> steely <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> lake. White boulder and somber fir branch slept motionless, reflected in the crystal depths of the water, and lines of great black cedars, that kept watch from the ridge above, stood mute beneath the sun.|$|R
