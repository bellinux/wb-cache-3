50|$|This climate {{occurs in}} the Aegean Islands, {{especially}} the Cyclades and the Dodecanese, southern and Evia, low-lying areas of Attica, the western, eastern and southern low-lying Peloponnese ares, and the low-lying areas of Crete. During the summer, the weather is most frequently sunny and dry, and any precipitation falls {{in the form of}} showers or thunderstorms from cumuliform clouds. The air is usually hot during the day and pleasantly warm at night, but there are some very windy days, especially in the Cyclades islands and around them. Heatwaves may occur, but they are usually quite mild at the coastal areas, where temperatures are moderated by the relatively cooler sea and the sea breeze. Winters are wet and any snow that falls does not last long, especially in the south-facing slopes. <b>Rain</b> in this <b>climate</b> <b>zone</b> receive a relatively higher amount of precipitation.|$|R

40|$|Background: In the US, {{residential}} and commercial building infrastructure combined consumes about 40 % of total energy usage and emits about 39 % of total CO 2 emission (DOE/EIA "Annual Energy Outlook 2013 "). Building codes, as used by local and state enforcement entities are typically tied to the dominant climate within an enforcement jurisdiction classified according to various <b>climate</b> <b>zones.</b> These <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> are based upon a 30 -year average of local surface observations and are developed by DOE and ASHRAE. Establishing the current variability and potential changes to future building <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> {{is very important for}} increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing energy costs and emissions in the future. Objectives: This paper demonstrates the usefulness of using NASA's Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) atmospheric data assimilation to derive the DOE/ASHRAE building <b>climate</b> <b>zone</b> maps and then using MERRA to define the last 30 years of variability in <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> for the Continental US. An atmospheric assimilation is a global atmospheric model optimized to satellite, atmospheric and surface in situ measurements. Using MERRA as a baseline, we then evaluate the latest Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) climate model Version 5 runs to assess potential variability in future <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> under various assumptions. Methods: We derive DOE/ASHRAE building <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> using surface and temperature data products from MERRA. We assess these zones using the uncertainties derived by comparison to surface measurements. Using statistical tests, we evaluate variability of the <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> in time and assess areas in the continental US for statistically significant trends by region. CMIP 5 produced a data base of over two dozen detailed climate model runs under various greenhouse gas forcing assumptions. We evaluate the variation in building <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> for 3 different decades using an ensemble and quartile statistics to provide an assessment of potential building <b>climate</b> <b>zone</b> changes relative to the uncertainties demonstrated using MERRA. Findings and Conclusions: These results show that there is a statistically significant increase in the area covered by warmer <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> and a tendency for a reduction of area in colder <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> in some limited regions. The CMIP analysis shows that models vary from relatively little building <b>climate</b> <b>zone</b> change for the least sensitive and conservation assumptions to a warming of at most 3 zones for certain areas, particularly the north central US {{by the end of the}} 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|Barmah Forest virus (BFV) {{disease is}} the second most common mosquito-borne disease in Australia, but the {{linkages}} of the wetlands and <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> with BFV transmission remain unclear. We aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} the wetlands, <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> and BFV risk in Queensland, Australia. Data on the wetlands, <b>climate</b> <b>zones,</b> population and BFV cases for the period 1992 to 2008 were obtained from relevant government agencies. BFV risk was grouped as low-, medium- and high-level based on BFV incidence percentiles. The buffer zones around each BFV case were made using 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50 km distances. We performed a discriminant analysis to determine the differences between wetland classes and BFV risk within each <b>climate</b> <b>zone.</b> The discriminant analyses show that saline 1, riverine and saline tidal influence were the most significant contributors to BFV risk in all <b>climate</b> and buffer <b>zones,</b> while lacustrine, palustrine, estuarine and saline 2 and saline 3 wetlands were less important. These models had classification accuracies of 76 %, 98 % and 100 % for BFV risk in subtropical, tropical and temperate <b>climate</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. This study demonstrates that BFV risk varies with wetland class and <b>climate</b> <b>zone.</b> The discriminant analysis is a useful tool to quantify the links between wetlands, <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> and BFV risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the influence of thermal performance of envelopes in shallow-buried buildings on energy consumption for different <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> of China. For the purpose of this study, an effective building energy simulation tool (DeST) developed by Tsinghua University was chosen to model the heat transfer in underground buildings. Based on the simulative results, energy consumption for heating and cooling for the whole year was obtained. The results showed that the relationship between energy consumption and U-value of envelopes for underground buildings is different compared with above-ground buildings: improving thermal performance of exterior walls cannot reduce energy consumption, on the contrary, may result in more energy cost. Besides, it is can be derived that optimized U-values of underground building envelopes vary with <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> of China in this study. For severe cold <b>climate</b> <b>zone,</b> the optimized U-value of underground building envelopes is 0. 8 W/(m 2 ·K); for cold <b>climate</b> <b>zone,</b> the optimized U-value is 1. 5 W/(m 2 ·K); for warm <b>climate</b> <b>zone,</b> the U-value is 2. 0 W/(m 2 ·K) ...|$|R

40|$|The cost-optimal {{level of}} energy {{performance}} for buildings shall be identified {{according to the}} European directive of 2010. The Swedish building stock needs comprehensive knowledge and an overall strategy for the cost-optimal level of renovation. This paper studies the contribution of Swedish <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> to the cost-optimal level of renovation on a multi-story residential building in Sweden from the building owner perspective. The building space heat demand is simulated for four Swedish <b>climate</b> <b>zones.</b> The net present profit (NPP) method is defined and {{used in this study}} in order to analyze the cost-optimal level and the cost-effective renovation of building envelope components (e. g., attic floor, basement walls, exterior walls and windows). The implication of different discount rates is studied, as well. The results show that the optimum renovation of the building envelope offers 51 % more energy savings for space heating when the building is in a northern <b>climate</b> <b>zone</b> compared to a southern zone. The study suggests that different renovation strategies for the building stock renovation need to be identified, separately, for each <b>climate</b> <b>zone.</b> The NPP analysis identifies the minimum required investment and maximum achievable energy savings that are needed to have a cost-effective renovation. The broad range of studied <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> provides the opportunity to apply the obtained results to other <b>climate</b> <b>zones</b> by either interpolation or extrapolation of NPPs for the buildings with similar characteristics...|$|R
