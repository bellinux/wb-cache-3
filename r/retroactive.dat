5|$|In 2003 the AACR {{renamed the}} award, {{stripping}} the honor from Rhoads posthumously. The AACR {{indicated that the}} new name would be <b>retroactive</b> and past awardees would receive updated plaques.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 2008 the 1.5 patch was {{released}} and included {{the addition of}} trophy support. A total of 57 trophies {{are available in the}} game, 10 of which are <b>retroactive</b> and can be obtained based on previously recorded statistics without the user having to complete tasks a second time. A further 34 are based upon gameplay and so are not <b>retroactive.</b> The trophies can be attained Split-screen or Unranked as well. Each of the available expansions also feature an additional 4 trophies.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{returned}} from his doping suspension and won the General classification of the 2012 Vuelta a España This marked the first overall Grand Tour win since Andy Schleck's <b>retroactive</b> victory of the 2010 Tour de France.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} stint with the Crimson Tide, Crisp led Alabama to their only undefeated season in 1930 {{en route to}} a 20–0 record, the SoCon Championship, and <b>retroactive</b> {{recognition}} as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. The squad also included Alabama's first All-American, Lindy Hood.|$|E
5|$|With {{the final}} polls already closed before the bowl season, Tennessee {{retained}} {{possession of the}} national championship. In following years, however, several selectors have named Maryland as the <b>retroactive</b> 1951 national champions: Jeff Sagarin, the College Football Researchers Association, DeVold System, Dunkel System, and National Championship Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Reconciling the {{continuity}} of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as <b>retroactive</b> continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a more realistic level.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Victoria Cross {{was created}} by Queen Victoria in 1856 to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man's lengthy or meritorious service. She signed a Royal Warrant on 29 January 1856 that officially instituted the VC. The order was <b>retroactive</b> to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|After 1907, Cooke's {{dominance}} of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus <b>retroactive</b> national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team was never the consistent winner {{that it was in}} the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923–1924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. Their case, however, was declared inadmissible, with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot be challenged. The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's <b>retroactive</b> victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, narrowed {{the gap in the}} Championship from six points to just two.|$|E
5|$|Jim Tatum {{was hired}} in 1947, after a brief stint at Oklahoma where he had led the Sooners to a conference {{championship}} in his only season there. He was Maryland's sixth head coach in eight years, but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school's most successful head coach in modern history. During his tenure, he led Maryland to two national championships (one <b>retroactive),</b> three conference championships, three perfect seasons, six top-20 final rankings, and five bowl game appearances. Seven of his players were named first-team All-Americans, including five consensus All-Americans. Under Tatum, Maryland finished every season with a winning record.|$|E
5|$|Morales' {{government}} also introduced measures to tackle Bolivia's endemic corruption; in 2007, {{he used a}} presidential decree to create the Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight Against Corruption. However, critics highlighted that MAS members were rarely prosecuted for the crime, the main exception being YPFB head Santos Ramírez, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment for corruption in 2008. Conversely, a 2009 law that permitted the <b>retroactive</b> prosecution for corruption led to legal cases being brought against a number of opposition politicians for alleged corruption in the pre-Morales period; many fled abroad to avoid standing trial.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 1913 Crean and the {{remaining}} crew of the Terra Nova arrived in Lyttelton, New Zealand, and shortly after returned to England. At Buckingham Palace the surviving members of the expedition were awarded Polar Medals by King George and Prince Louis of Battenberg, the First Sea Lord. Crean and Lashly were both awarded the Albert Medal, 2nd Class for saving Evans's life, these were presented by the King at Buckingham Palace on 26 July 1913. Crean was promoted {{to the rank of}} chief petty officer, <b>retroactive</b> to 9 September 1910.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{authorized}} the President's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500. Representatives also received a <b>retroactive</b> pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed {{the law and the}} bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 2012, Berry's lawyer {{announced}} that Berry and Aubry had reached an amicable custody agreement in court. In June 2014, a Superior Court ruling called for Berry to pay Aubry $16,000 {{a month in}} child support (around 200k/year) {{as well as a}} <b>retroactive</b> payment of $115,000 and a sum of $300,000 for Aubry's attorney fees. Berry and Martinez confirmed their engagement in March 2012, and married in France on July 13, 2013. In October 2013, Berry gave birth to their son. After two years of marriage, in 2015 the couple announced they were divorcing. The divorce became final in December 2016.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 {{prohibits the}} {{election}} or appointment to any {{federal or state}} office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason. However, a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation. In 1898, the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3's limitation. In 1975, the citizenship of Confederate general Robert E. Lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution, <b>retroactive</b> to June 13, 1865. In 1978, pursuant to Section 3, the Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate president Jefferson Davis.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} present day gallantry awards traces {{back to the}} rule of East India Company in India. The first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834, as the Order of Merit, which was later renamed as Indian Order of Merit in 1902. During the First World War, the awards were {{classified}} based on the English traditions for senior officers, junior officers, and enlisted men. Post-independence, the British honours and awards informally came to an end. However, attempts to institute new awards for India to honour the war heroes of 1947–1948 Indo-Pakistani War failed, as India was still a dominion. Eventually, the award was established on 26 January 1950, with <b>retroactive</b> effect from 15 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 55 {{official}} governors of New Jersey, with several others acting as governor for a time. In the official numbering, governors are counted only once each, and traditionally, only elected governors were included. However, legislation signed on January 10, 2006, allowed acting governors {{who had served}} at least 180 days to be considered full governors. The law was <b>retroactive</b> to January 1, 2001; it therefore changed the titles of Donald DiFrancesco and Richard Codey, affecting Jim McGreevey's numbering. The current governor is Chris Christie, who took office on January 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|David's {{character}} arc {{throughout the}} Alien prequel series, with his role becoming increasingly central, has been lauded by critics. Kevin Lincoln of Vulture magazine described David {{as being the}} best cinematic villain in years, due to his dynamic personality and ability to win against the characters in Alien: Covenant. John Squires of Bloody Disgusting praised David for supplanting the main protagonist of the first four films, Ellen Ripley, as the overall best character of the franchise in 2017. Squires perceived David's passion to become a creator in Alien: Covenant as a <b>retroactive</b> explanation for poisoning Holloway in Prometheus. Eschewing from most reviews, Wenlei Ma from News.com.au complimented Fassbender's ability to portray David, though she criticized the mystery lost by revealing the character's true intentions.|$|E
5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional <b>retroactive</b> lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Such {{a retreat}} {{was not an}} option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles. One of Social Credit's 1935 {{promises}} had been the introduction of recall for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act. As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own Okotoks-High River riding, where he had been elected in a by-election shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed themselves of the legislation. On April9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association, and by fall it had gathered the signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate. In response, the Social Crediters repealed the Recall Act <b>retroactive</b> to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their workers into signing the petition, and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression (1929–35) {{led to a}} fall in European copper prices which {{severely}} damaged {{the economy of the}} Copperbelt. In February 1931 the Mkubwa mine was shut down, followed {{over the next few months}} by the Chamishi, Nchanga and Mulfira mines. Construction work at the Roan Antelope and Nkana mines was nearing completion at this time, leading to large-scale unemployment; the mines employed 31,941 people during in 1930, and 6,677 by the end of 1932. Many unemployed African workers remained, instead of returning to their rural homes. During the period between 1931 and 1932, the European population in the region reduced by 25 per cent. In 1935, the Northern Rhodesian administration doubled urban taxes and reduced them in rural areas to counter the depression and related losses incurred by the closure of one of the region's four mines. The provincial commissioner implemented the tax in May (<b>retroactive</b> to 1 January) after the signing of the Native Tax Amendment Ordinance, and was aware of the latter.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 election, New York state {{officials}} asserted that Al Franken Inc. {{had failed to}} carry required workers' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek <b>retroactive</b> credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A <b>retroactive</b> law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Mota {{was named}} the Marlins' closer in spring {{training}} since Benítez became a free agent following the 2004 season. He {{did not get a}} save opportunity until April 22, which he converted in a 4–2 win over Cincinnati. He got his second save of the year the next day in another 4–2 win over Cincinnati. However, he was placed on the disabled list on May 1 (<b>retroactive</b> to April 24) with inflammation in his right elbow. He was activated on May 27, but Todd Jones, who had been filling in for Mota, remained the closer. Mota had a 1.69 ERA through his first 11 games, but 12 earned runs allowed over his next seven games raised his ERA to 7.27. On June 24, he was the winning pitcher in the Marlins' 7–4 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He got his only other win of the year on August 30, when he gave up a run in two innings in a 7–6 victory over St. Louis. Mota posted a 3.81 ERA over his final 38 games to finish the season 2–2 with a 4.70 ERA in 56 games. On November 24, Mota was traded with Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell to the Boston Red Sox for four prospects: Jesús Delgado, Harvey García, Hanley Ramírez, and Aníbal Sánchez.|$|E
5|$|Young led his {{league in}} wins five times (1892, 1895, and 19011903), {{finishing}} second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two {{more than the}} runners-up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, {{but this was not}} uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the <b>retroactive</b> league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.|$|E
5|$|However, Claiborne {{was offered}} a {{position}} as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia, and arrived at Jamestown, {{on the north shore}} of the James River in 1621. The position carried a 200acre (80hectare) land grant, a salary of £30 per year, and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed. His political acumen quickly {{made him one of the}} most successful Virginia colonists, and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1,100acres (445hectares) of land and a <b>retroactive</b> salary of £60 a year from the Virginia Colony's council. He also managed to survive the March 1622 attacks by native/Indian Powhatans on the Virginia settlers that killed more than 300colonists. His financial success was followed by political success, and he gained appointment as Councilor in 1624 and Secretary of State for the Colony in 1626. Around 1627, he began to trade for furs with the native Susquehannock Indians from further north on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and two of its largest tributaries, the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers. To facilitate this trade, Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which he intended to make the center of a vast mercantile empire along the Atlantic Coast. Claiborne found both financial and political support for the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson, William Cloberry, John de la Barre, and Simon Turgis.|$|E
