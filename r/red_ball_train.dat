Gamblers will prefer gambles with worse {{odds that}} {{are drawn from}} a large sample (e.g., drawing one <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> from an urn {{containing}} 89 <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> and 11 blue balls) to better odds that are drawn from a small sample (drawing one <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> from an urn containing 9 <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> and one blue ball).|$|R
2500|$|For example, {{in a bag}} of 2 <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> and 2 blue balls (4 {{balls in}} total), the {{probability}} of taking a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is however, when taking a second ball, the probability of it being either a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> or a blue ball depends on the ball previously taken, such as, if a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> was taken, the probability of picking a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> again would be [...] since only 1 red and 2 blue balls would have been remaining.|$|R
5000|$|Manipulation: Three {{performers}} used warped metal {{sheets to}} juggle and manipulate a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> that they each had; {{later in the}} act, they {{got rid of the}} metal sheet and juggled the <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> as well as many other <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> and a bowler hat each. This act was removed in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|But the {{probability}} of selecting a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> on the second draw given that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> has already been selected in the first draw is 0, and is not equal to {{the probability}} that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is selected in the second draw which is equal to 1/2 (i.e. [...] ). Thus, [...] and [...] are not independent.|$|R

50|$|The game ended if a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> or a green ball splashed down. If the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> splashed down, {{either on}} its own or with other colored balls, the player lost half of their {{winnings}}. The player could walk away with their winnings at any point, ending the game. If the green ball splashed down without a <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> the player won the jackpot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only way}} the game ends (besides the player saying [...] "I'll stop") is if a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> or a green ball {{splashes}} down. If the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> splashes down, either by itself or with other colored balls - even the green one - the player loses half their winnings. If the green ball splashes down with no <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> the player's total is bumped to $100,000.|$|R
50|$|The beta-binomial {{distribution}} {{can also}} be motivated via an urn model for positive integer values of α and β, known as the Polya urn model. Specifically, imagine an urn containing α <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> and β black balls, where random draws are made. If a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is observed, then two <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> are returned to the urn. Likewise, if a black ball is drawn, then two black balls are returned to the urn. If this is repeated n times, then the probability of observing k <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> follows a beta-binomial distribution with parameters n,α and β.|$|R

50|$|In Regina, Saskatchewan left-turn {{signals are}} {{designated}} by two-bulb light configuration with one (or two) <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> and one LED arrow. When a left-turn cycle begins the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> will {{change to a}} flashing green arrow to permitted all traffic turning left. When the left-turn cycle ends the flashing green arrow will turn to a solid amber arrow for 5 to 3 seconds then change back to a <b>red</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{only way}} the game ends (besides the captain saying [...] "I'll stop") is if a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> {{splashes}} down. If the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> splashes down, either by itself or with other colored balls, the team loses half their winnings. If the green ball splashes down without either <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> the team's total is bumped to $50,000 on the Special, or $75,000 on the series proper (maximum payment $50,000 or $75,000).|$|R
5000|$|The game of snooker {{generally}} {{consists of}} two phases. The first phase is {{the situation in which}} there are still <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> on the table. In the first phase, {{at the beginning of a}} player's turn, the balls [...] "on" [...] are all remaining <b>red</b> <b>balls.</b> The player must therefore attempt to first hit and pot one or more <b>red</b> <b>balls.</b> For every <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> potted, the player will receive 1 point. When a red has been potted, it will stay off the table and the player can continue the break. If no red has been potted or a foul has been made, the other player will come into play.|$|R

25|$|To {{understand}} why the two distributions are different, we may consider the following extreme example: An urn contains one <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> with the weight 1000, and a thousand white balls each with the weight 1.

5000|$|Starting position: In the Korean version, the {{cue ball}} is placed beside {{one of the}} <b>red</b> object <b>balls</b> for the opening shot, and play commences by hitting the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> on the {{opposite}} side of the table (as in three-cushion billiards). In the Japanese version, the cue ball is placed behind the second <b>red</b> object <b>ball,</b> and play commences by hitting the <b>red</b> object <b>ball</b> nearest to the cue ball.|$|R

50|$|If a team obtains Lingo, {{that team}} {{receives}} a bonus and {{is provided with}} a new Lingo card with new balls. Green balls carry over to a new Lingo card, but <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> do not. Thus, {{at the start of}} a new Lingo card, there will again be three <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> in the ball basin.|$|R
50|$|Go Ballistic - One {{contestant}} {{would stand}} in a rocket with smoke whilst plastic balls were rained on them from above. Their teammates had six buckets of balls into a conveyor belt.

2500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to score more [...] than one's opponent by potting [...] in the correct order. At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown, and the players then take turns to hit shots by striking the cue ball with the [...] of the cue, their aim being to pot one of the <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> into a pocket and thereby score a point, or, if this is not possible, to at least hit a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> so as to avoid making a foul shot. If the striker pots a <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> he or she must then pot one of the six [...] "colours" [...] (in snooker, the term colour is understood to exclude the <b>red</b> <b>balls).</b> If the player successfully pots a colour, the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> then another colour, and so on. This process continues until the striker fails to pot the desired ball, at which point the opponent comes to the table to play the next shot.|$|R
5000|$|Michigan uses a 3-lamp traffic signal, with a <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> yellow arrow, {{and green}} arrow; during the {{permissive}} turn, the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> flashes. At about 372 locations a flashing <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> signal on a [...] "protected" [...] left turn traffic signal indicates that {{left turning traffic}} may, after a full stop, complete their turn {{if and only if}} there is a long enough break in oncoming traffic. The flashing red usually occurs when the oncoming traffic has a green signal. This function is not enabled at intersections where it may not be safe to do so (restricted view of oncoming traffic, heavy pedestrian crossings, or double-lane left turns are good examples). Michigan usually indicates signals that are dedicated to turning traffic with a sign displaying [...] "LEFT" [...] or [...] "RIGHT". This sign is normally illuminated at night. More recent installations in Michigan, however, have used flashing yellow arrow signal heads, which typically have not included left-turn signal signage. All flashing <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> signals in Michigan will gradually be phased out in favor of the flashing yellow arrow. The flashing <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> was also used in Maryland.|$|R

25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is not taken in the first draw is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is not taken in the second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not taken in the first draw, is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of not taking the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> in n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius’ model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|R
50|$|In Make or Break?, contestants {{could win}} {{a variety of}} prizes. First of all the snooker player would do a breakshot of the 6 <b>red</b> <b>balls.</b> Contestants would be given ninety seconds to answer five general {{knowledge}} questions asked by Davidson. Each correct answer allowed the snooker player to remove one <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> from the table. Once the questions have been asked, the snooker player and Virgo discuss which of the <b>red</b> <b>balls</b> to discard, based on their positions after the breakshot and therefore ease to pot them. After the questions were answered, the remaining time {{was given to the}} snooker player to clear the snooker table with six reds minus one for each question answered correctly on the table. One <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> and each coloured ball represented a prize, ranging from champagne, short breaks, televisions, computers and games consoles. The black ball represented the Mystery Star Prize, often a holiday.|$|R
