50|$|Rocks {{and other}} {{geological}} materials experience strain according three distinct modes, elastic, plastic, and brittle {{depending on the}} properties of the material and the magnitude of the stress field. Stress is defined as the average force per unit area exerted on each part of the <b>rock.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is the part of stress that changes the volume of a solid; shear stress changes the shape. If there is no shear, the fluid is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Since, over long periods, rocks readily deform under pressure, the Earth is in hydrostatic equilibrium to a good approximation. The pressure on rock depends only on the weight of the rock above, and this depends on gravity and the density of the rock. In a body like the Moon, the density is almost constant, so a pressure profile is readily calculated. In the Earth, the compression of rocks with depth is significant, and an equation of state is needed to calculate changes in density of rock even when it is of uniform composition.|$|E

Later, Zhou and Yang [4] discussed the asymmetric <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to the shallow tunnel in strata with inclined ground surface, and proposed a method to calculate the asymmetric <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to the tunnel in strata with inclined ground surface by key block theory. Yang et al. [5] analyzed the calculation of <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to three tunnels with large transection and small neighborhood in shallow surrounding rock; they suggested that the conventional method to calculate the <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to shallow tunnel with small neighborhood should be improved. He et al. [6] studied the asymmetrical load effect on tunnels in geologically inclined bedding strata. They found that the <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> at the left wall of a tunnel is greater than that at the right wall. As the dip angle of bedding strata increases, the asymmetrical load gradually tends to be symmetric. In Zhou’s [7] recent research, he studied the method to calculate the <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> for shallow asymmetric tunnel, and presented a method to determine a proper depth for shallow asymmetric tunnel in strata with inclined ground surface.|$|E

30|$|A {{computational}} method of <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to an ultra-shallow tunnel is presented by key block theory, and its mathematical formula is proposed {{according to a}} mechanical tunnel model with super-shallow depth. Theoretical analysis shows that the tunnel is subject to asymmetric <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> due to oblique topography. The <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to the tunnel crown and sidewall {{is closely related to}} the surrounding rock bulk density, tunnel size, depth and angle of oblique ground slope. The <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to the tunnel crown is much greater than that to the sidewalls, and the load applied to the left sidewall is also greater than that to the right sidewall. Meanwhile, the safety of the lining for an ultra-shallow tunnel in strata with inclined surface is affected by <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> and tunnel support parameters. Steel pipe grouting from ground surface is used to consolidate the unfavorable surrounding rock before tunnel excavation, and the reinforcing scope is proposed according to the analysis of the asymmetric load induced by tunnel excavation in weak rock with inclined ground surface. The tunneling procedure of bench cut method with pipe roof protection is still discussed and carried out in this paper according to the special geological condition. The method and tunneling procedure have been successfully utilized to design and drive a real expressway tunnel. The practice in building the super-shallow tunnel has proved the feasibility of the calculation method and tunneling procedure presented in this paper.|$|E

40|$|It is {{of great}} {{importance}} to reasonably estimate the surrounding rock load of a double-arch tunnel for the design, construction and stability evaluation of the tunnel. Currently, the basic theory on surrounding <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> of double-arch tunnels is insufficient for properly making the design and calculations. Generally, simplified calculations based on experience are used, such as the calculation method of Protodyakonov 2 ̆ 7 s theory, the building code method and others.

Taking some factors into consideration, such as different stress states, different construction methods and different sizes of double-arch tunnels, the pressure evolution of the surrounding rock was analyzed during step-by-step excavation of the double-arch tunnel. The results showed that in each condition the surrounding <b>rock</b> <b>pressure</b> of the double-arch tunnel displayed skewed distribution characteristics.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{an extension of}} the Khristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD) model to the case when the confining <b>rock</b> <b>pressure,</b> which closes a hydraulic fracture, varies in the direction of its propagation. The extension is impelled by the need to simulate fracture hampering (acceleration) when it penetrates into a layer with increased (decreased) <b>rock</b> <b>pressure.</b> The paper presents the problem formulation, an efficient numerical method for its solving, examples of fractures propagating through layers with various stresses and general conclusions. It is established that when the fracture enters a layer with increased rock stresses (positive stress contrast), it actually stops. In this case, the fluid particle velocity drops practically to zero and the velocity near the tip oscillates about a small value until the fluid pressure increases {{to the level of the}} increased <b>rock</b> <b>pressure.</b> In the opposite case, when the fracture enters a layer with decreased stresses (negative stress contrast), the fracture front accelerates until the fluid pressure drops to the level of the decreased <b>rock</b> <b>pressure.</b> Physical considerations and numerical results imply that the transition through a boundary of layers with different stresses may be characterized by a simple dimensionless parameter. The latter is defined as the ratio of the average difference between the fluid and rock pressures (at the moment of reaching the contact) to the stress jump at the contact. The parameter is applicable to contacts with positive as well as negative contrasts.
