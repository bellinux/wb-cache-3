50|$|Prior to 1973, unoccupied {{properties}} {{were entitled}} to a full <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the rates paid. Effective from 1973, vacant properties could only enjoy a 50% <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the rates. In late 1973, vacancy refund for domestic properties was abolished. Refund for non-domestic vacant properties was eventually removed on 1 July 1995. Thereafter, <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> rates is not allowed for vacant properties unless they are vacated {{as a result of}} a Government initiated court order. Refunds are also allowed for vacant open land, providing it is not used for the parking of motor vehicles.|$|R

25|$|A {{postage meter}} is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> or franking, to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> meters. A postage meter imprints an amount <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The postage meter was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney, receiving a patent for the invention on October 14, 1902.|$|R

Thereafter, postage stamp use in the U.S. quickly doubled, and by 1861 had quadrupled.|$|R

The Court also ruled that Kellems and her co-plaintiff David Kellems were not entitled to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> penalties they had paid on account of their refusal to withhold taxes, as the Kellems were unable to show that their refusal was with reasonable cause under the law. For another period in question, a jury did find that Kellems conduct was not willful, {{and that she was}} therefore entitled to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> penalty she had paid.|$|R
