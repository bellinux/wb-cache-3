The club {{had set up}} a special amortisation fund using Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981 mainly for the abnormal signings prior 2002–03 season, (such as Davide Bombardini for €11million account value in June 2002, when the flopped player exchange boosted 2001–02 season result) and the tax payment of 2002–03 was rescheduled. In 2004–05, Roma made a net profit of €10,091,689 and followed by €804,285 in 2005–06. In 2006–07 season the accounting method changed to IFRS, which meant that the 2005–06 result was reclassified as net loss of €4,051,905 and 2006–07 season was net income of €10,135,539 (€14.011million as a group).

(€1.56million as a group) The gate and TV income further slipped in 2009–10 with a net loss of €21,917,292 (already boosted by the sale of Alberto Aquilani; €22million as a group) despite sporting success (finishing in second place in 2009–10). Moreover, despite a positive equity as a separate company (€105,142,589), the AS <b>Roma</b> <b>Group</b> had a negative equity on the consolidated balance sheet, and fell from +€8.8million to −€13.2million. In the 2010–11 season, Roma was administrated by UniCredit as the Sensi family failed to repay the bank and the club was put on the market, which also saw Roma not have a major signing in 2010–11. Concurrently with no selling profit on the players, Roma's net loss rose to €30,589,137 (€30.778million as a group) and the new owner already planned a re-capitalization after the mandatory bid on the shares. On the positive side, TV income was increased from €75,150,744 to €78,041,642, and gate income increased from €23,821,218 to €31,017,179. This was because Roma entered 2010–11 Champions League, which counter-weighed the effect of the new collective agreement of Serie A. In 2011–12, the renewal of squad and participation in 2011–12 UEFA Europa League had worsened the financial result, which the €50million capital increase (in advance) was counter-weighted totally by the net loss.

A proposed capital increase by €100million for Roma was announced on 25 June 2014; however, until 22 May 2014, NEEP already injected €108million into the club, which depends on public subscription; more than €8million would convert to medium-long-term loan from shareholder instead of becoming share capital.|$|E

40|$|The Roma {{people have}} many times, {{and for a}} long period of time been {{described}} in a negative way, as a group of people unlike every other. Both novels and encyclopedias has been a part of this misleading discourse and therefore contributed to large misunderstandings. Also scholarly research from Sweden, and elsewhere, has featured inaccurate representations of the Roma people and altogether this has created negative attitudes towards Roma people which are still today a considerable problem. However, the last few years positive changes has taken place and today the Roma people is an official minority group in Sweden which, among other things, has led to promising possibilities, especially in schools, for a deeper understanding of the Roma people in the future. Reading Roma literature I believe is an important part of this. Katarina Taikon and Hans Caldaras both consider themselves Roma. They also have in common that they want to give voice for the group of Roma that has lived in Sweden since mid-nineteenth century. Even though one can’t claim there is such a thing as an overall Roma identity the two authors have, separately, given a picture of the Roma as a unique group of people with certain individuality. Although, their way of doing this is distinctively different from how it has been done before. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to describe how the <b>Roma</b> <b>group</b> identity is pictured in two books written by Roma. When looking at the concept of identity and group identity from this perspective it becomes obvious that the topics of culture and ethnicity are strongly related. In this study I have performed a comparative analysis through close readings of the two books and looked at the <b>Roma</b> <b>group</b> identity as constructed by the sub identities culture, as “a way of life”, and ethnicity, as a production of identity through writing of history as well as a group of people with a unique culture. The <b>Roma</b> <b>group</b> identity has also been looked upon as partly constructed by people outside of the group. The analysis of the two books has shown that the aspects of what describes the <b>Roma</b> <b>group</b> identity can be divided in to four different, but not independent, themes. The different themes have, one by one, shown examples of individuality concerning this group in relationship to other groups of people. Furthermore it has become clear that this group of Roma for a long time have been put in the role of being, and partly even being produced as, the “other” which also has impacted the characteristics of the <b>Roma</b> <b>group</b> identity...|$|E

People-processing organizations classified Roma as "socially disabled" in different administrative contexts. In the early 1960 s adult male Roma were classified as socially disabled on the labor market. Later during the same decade, experts and professionals increasingly focused attention on the Roma family as a problematic institution. In this context, Roma adults were classified as disabled in relation to the normative representations of parental capacities during that time, while Roma children of school age were defined as children with difficulties and put in special groups for children with problems. The related interventions were justified by a discourse on social inclusion, but in reality produced a web of measures, practices and yet further interventions, which in the long run have contributed to perpetuate the social marginality of <b>Roma</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

With a focus on Roma youths in Konik, Montenegro, and their involvement in hip-hop we wanted to explore what this culture meant to them in relation to their context. An ethnographic approach was used in collecting the empirical data through observations, interpreting music lyrics and conducting qualitative semi-structured interviews. Five young Roma boys from Konik, all involved in hip-hop, were interviewed. Theoretical perspectives on identity, youth culture and stigmatization were central. In addition, Bourdieu’s theory regarding cultural capital was emphasized and connected to youths and hip-hop. The empirical material showed that involvement in hip-hop provided the Roma youths with a group identity that they referred to in positive terms. Contextual factors of stigmatization excluded the <b>Roma</b> <b>group</b> from the majority population and the engagement in hip-hop created a possibility for the youths to be someone. The cultural capital gained through hip-hop was not used to verify and legitimate an authentic Roma identity.

40|$|The present work {{sheds light}} on the anthropological {{complexity}} of the roma communities living inside Italian borders, and on the welfare their host Country provides them. The analysis is built upon four case studies on local communities and, bearing in mind that each testimonial comes with its own subjective biases, all contributions are used as a framework where the theoretical debate between redistribution and recognition can be developed. Each case study revises the whole path followed by a specific <b>roma</b> <b>group</b> since their first steps in the place they reside into, highlighting all kinds of difficulties that impaired the entwining of beneficial networks with the host community: households, institutions, associations. Both spatial segregation in “campi nomadi” and the negation of citizenship appear to be cumbersome obstacles to integration.
