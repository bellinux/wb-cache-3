40|$|This paper {{develops}} a virtual platform of an underwater manipulator {{mounted on a}} submersible vehicle via the three-dimensional simulator “Webots” for teleoperation through a <b>replica</b> <b>master</b> arm. The graphical, kinematic and dynamic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with 7 functions, consisting of {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOFs) and a parallel gripper, while the “Jiaolong” deep manned submersible vehicle, operating below the sea surface down to 7000 meters, is chosen as the underwater manipulator carrier. This study uses the virtual platform for training an operator to telepresence control the virtual manipulator to complete basic tasks in subsea environments. When training the operator, one has to consider uncertain external disturbances and the visual impacts that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, one designs two typical underwater operational tasks: grasping a marine organism sample, and reaching at a given position. This paper presents the comparative studies: 1. The performances demonstrated by remotely controlling the virtual manipulator and the real manipulator; 2. The operating performances delivered by three operators before and after training when using the platform...|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} {{of producing}} multiple polymeric masters from an original glass master mold has been developed, which enables {{the production of}} multiple poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) -based microfluidic devices in a low-cost and efficient manner. Standard wet-etching techniques were used to fabricate an original glass master with negative features, from which more than 50 polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) positive <b>replica</b> <b>masters</b> were rapidly created using the thermal printing technique. The time to replicate each PMMA master was as short as 20 min. The PMMA <b>replica</b> <b>masters</b> have excellent structural features and {{could be used to}} cast PDMS devices for many times. An integration geometry designed for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, which contains normal deep microfluidic channels and a much deeper optical fiber channel, was successfully transferred into PDMS devices. The positive relief on seven PMMA <b>replica</b> <b>masters</b> is replicated with regard to the negative original glass master, with a depth average variation of 0. 89 % for 26 μ m deep microfluidic channels and 1. 16 % for the 90 μ m deep fiber channel. The imprinted positive relief in PMMA from master-to-master is reproducible with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 1. 06 % for the maximum width and 0. 46 % for depth in terms of the separation channel. The PDMS devices fabricated from the PMMA <b>replica</b> <b>masters</b> were characterized and applied to the separation of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled epinephrine sample...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With a {{huge number}} of users and a very large scale of data, an Online Social Network (OSN) service has to {{partition}} its data among multiple servers inside a data center. As data are often partitioned randomly, the response time in accessing the data is however unpredictable. Researchers have proposed social locality to address this concern: if a server hosts the <b>master</b> <b>replica</b> of a user’s data, it must also host a <b>replica</b> (either <b>master</b> or slave) of every friend of this user, thus enabling convenient access of all of them on the same server. However, doing so comes with two overheads: the replication storage and the traffic of maintaining replica consistency. Existing work focuses on the former, but overlooks the latter that can consume considerable network resources. In this paper, we study social-locality-aware partitioning of the OSN data while meeting diverse performance goals of data center networks. We formulate the traffic optimization problem and propose a new traffic-aware data partitioning algorithm. Through the evaluations with a large-scale, real-world Twitter trace, we further show that, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm significantly reduces traffic without deteriorating the load balance among servers and causing extra replication storage.

30|$|Most of {{the other}} studies, however, use a simpler {{approach}} for fabrication of flexible molds for the R 2 R and R 2 P NIL processes, where a <b>replica</b> of a <b>master</b> mold is used as the flexible mold for the roller imprint process. In general, the desired structures are first patterned onto a silicon or quartz substrate using conventional nanolithography techniques such as EBL and followed by the RIE process, similar to its P 2 P variant. The replication of the master mold can then be conducted using several methods. One of the common techniques involves deposition of an anti-stick layer onto the master mold, followed by a layer of metal such as nickel directly onto the master mold, where it will then be peeled off {{to be used as}} a flexible mold in the roller nanoimprint process as observed in [32, 43, 46]. In some cases such as in [30], an imprint <b>replica</b> of the <b>master</b> mold is first obtained using nanoimprint lithography (step-and-repeat technique) onto a resist-coated wafer, where a nickel layer is then deposited onto the imprint and peeled off to be used as the flexible mold in the imprint process published in [42].|$|R

30|$|Alternatively, {{the imprint}} <b>replica</b> of the <b>master</b> mold {{may also be}} {{produced}} via the polymer cast molding technique using non-sticking polymers such as PDMS or ETFE {{to be used as}} the flexible soft mold for the imprint process as observed in the work of a few research groups [7, 15, 35]. It is highlighted in the work of Ye et al. [59] that polymer cast molds (typically made of PDMS) are usually more preferable in the UV-based roller imprinting process due to their advantages of being low cost, low surface energy (fewer sticking issues), chemically inert, elastic, and simpler to produce as compared to metal molds.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of ways the {{replication}} management system can handle the updates of replicas. The updates may be designed around a centralized model where a single <b>master</b> <b>replica</b> updates all others, or a decentralized model, where all peers update each other. The topology of node placement may also influence the updates of replicas. If a hierarchy topology is used then updates would flow in a tree like structure through specific paths. In a flat topology it is entirely a matter of the peer relationships between nodes as to how updates take place. In a hybrid topology consisting of both flat and hierarchy topologies updates may take place through specific paths and between peers.|$|R
