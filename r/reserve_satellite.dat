40|$|Regeneration is {{the process}} of renewal or repair of damaged cells and tissue. In {{skeletal}} muscle, regeneration is accomplished by satellite cells, which are rare, mononucleate, mitotically quiescent myogenic precursor cells normally present in undamaged muscle tissue. When stimulated by injury, overuse, or disease, satellite cells will become activated to proliferate and form a pool of replacement myoblasts which will differentiate to replace necrotic muscle fibers. These cells may also have the quality of self-renewal associated with stem cells. Due mainly to technical difficulties caused by their rarity, difficulty of isolation, and lack of identifying markers, satellite cells have not been as well studied as other myogenic cells. Here I present work in which I establish a reliable means of isolating and culturing mouse satellite cells resident on single explanted myofibers; a molecular marker for satellite cells which also yields information about their mechanism of activation, and a method of multiplex single-cell RT-PCR which allows simultaneous detection of six genes from a single satellite cell. Using these techniques, I have determined the temporal coexpression pattern of the four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) in single activated satellite cells over the first four days of a regeneration response in vitro. I have also assayed satellite cell cDNA pools for expression of genes important in regulating myogenesis, cell cycling, and cell fate decisions in other myogenic lineages. Finally, I have performed these analyses on MyoD-null satellite cells, which are differentiation-deficient in vivo, and present possible mechanisms for this based on gene expression; this analysis also suggested a potential marker for activated satellite cells which will return to the <b>reserve</b> <b>satellite</b> cell population and may act as myogenic stem cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{embryonic}} and fetal life, {{skeletal muscle}} growth {{is dependent upon}} the proliferation and the differentiation of a population of resident muscle progenitors, from which derive the muscle stem cells of the adult, the satellite cells. Under poorly defined extrinsic and intrinsic influences, muscle progenitors proliferate, differentiate or enter a quiescent state to become <b>reserve</b> <b>satellite</b> cells. Despite their primordial role, surprisingly little is known on the homeostasis of resident progenitors during embryogenesis. Preliminary studies in chick and mouse describing the key progenitor populations contributing to muscle growth during embryogenesis have led to differing results that {{could be due to}} technical issues or to fundamental differences between animal models. To address this question, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the state of differentiation and proliferation of muscle progenitor cells from the time of their emergence within the dermomyotome until late fetal life, when they adopt a satellite cell-like position under the basal lamina. This was done by immunostaining against key players of myogenic differentiation, in muscles chosen from different regions of the body in two model organisms, the chick and mouse. This study identified two co-existing populations of progenitors during embryonic and fetal life in both chick and mouse: a minor, slow-cycling pool of undifferentiated resident progenitors which express Pax 7, co-existing with a major fast-cycling population that co-express Pax 7 and the early myogenic differentiation marker Myf 5. We found that the overall proliferation rate of both progenitors drastically decreased with embryonic age, as an increasingly large portion of slow and fast-cycling progenitors entered quiescence during development. Together, this data suggests that the cellular strategies that drive muscle growth during embryonic and fetal life are remarkably conserved in amniotes throughout evolution. They rely on the tight regulation of proliferation, entry in quiescence, and modulation of the cell cycle's length for both of the co-existing populations of muscle progenitors to maintain the homeostasis of growing muscles during development...|$|E

Fire incidence was found to be correlated with multiple variables which probably covary. Rainfall, vegetation type and geology showed the strongest correlations with fire incidence. Recurrent fire has impacted negatively on forest structure, ground cover biomass and species composition in two forest reserves, but more marked in the wetter Worobong South Forest Reserve than the drier Tain II Forest Reserve. Basal area has reduced from 40 m 2 ha - 1 in least-degraded to < 1 m 2 ha - 1 in heavily-degraded stand in Worobong South Forest Reserve, along with tree density, whereas canopy openness has increased from 6 % in least-degraded to 83 % in heavily-degraded forest. In Tain II Forest Reserve, however, the heavily-degraded forest has lost close to 50 % of its maximum value in terms of basal area, tree density and canopy cover, all in approximately 20 years. Early-burning, with maximum seedling height growth rates of 130 cm yr - 1 and 40 cm yr - 1 for Worobong South and Tain II Forest Reserves respectively, might help control the fires, and restore forest canopy in about 10 to 20 years if regularly maintained, but must be accompanied by green firebreaks. Complete protection from fire (during convalescence), on the other hand, would take between five and 15 years to restore forest canopy, but at huge resource cost.

All rights <b>reserved.</b> Future <b>satellite</b> missions, from 2022 onwards, will obtain near-global measurements of cirrus at microwave and sub-millimetre frequencies. To realise the potential of these observations, fast and accurate light-scattering methods are required to calculate scattered millimetre and sub-millimetre intensities from complex ice crystals. Here, {{the applicability of the}} ray tracing with diffraction on facets method (RTDF) in predicting the bulk scalar optical properties and phase functions of randomly oriented hexagonal ice columns and hexagonal ice aggregates at millimetre frequencies is investigated. The applicability of RTDF is shown to be acceptable down to size parameters of about 18, between the frequencies of 243 and 874 GHz. It is demonstrated that RTDF is generally well within about 10 % of T-matrix solutions obtained for the scalar optical properties assuming hexagonal ice columns. Moreover, on replacing electromagnetic scalar optical property solutions obtained for the hexagonal ice aggregate with the RTDF counterparts at size parameter values of about 18 or greater, the bulk scalar optical properties can be calculated to generally well within ?? 5 % of an electromagnetic-based database. The RTDF-derived bulk scalar optical properties result in brightness temperature errors to generally within about ?? 4 K at 874 GHz. Differing microphysics assumptions can easily exceed such errors. Similar findings are found for the bulk scattering phase functions. This finding is owing to the scattering solutions being dominated by the processes of diffraction and reflection, both being well described by RTDF. The impact of centimetre-sized complex ice crystals on interpreting cirrus polarisation measurements at sub-millimetre frequencies is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{potential of}} the limb regeneration blastema, a mass of mesenchymal cells of mixed origins, was once considered as being pluripotent, capable of forming all cell types. Now evidence asserts that the blastema is a heterogeneous mixture of progenitor cells derived from tissues of the amputation site, with limited developmental potential, plus various stem cells with multipotent abilities. Many specialized cells, bone, cartilage, muscle, and Schwann cells, at the injury site undergo dedifferentiation to a progenitor state and maintain their cell lineage as they redifferentiate in the regenerate. Muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>reserve</b> stem cells that are active in repair of injured muscle may also dedifferentiate and contribute new muscle cells to the limb blastema. Other cells from the dermis act as multipotent stem cells that replenish dermal fibroblasts and differentiate into cartilage. The blastema primordium is a self-organized, equipotential system, but at the cellular level can compensate for specific cell loss. It is able to induce dedifferentiation of introduced exogenous cells and such cells may be transformed into new cell types. Indigenous cells of the blastema associated with amputated tissues may also transform or possibly transdifferentiate into new cell types. The blastema is a microenvironment that enables dedifferentiation, redifferentiation, transdifferentiation, and stem cell activation, leading to progenitor cells of the limb regenerate...|$|R

Existing areas of suitable elephant habitat need to be protected not only from human development but from the elephants themselves. As most elephant populations in South Africa are enclosed and multiplying, there is some increasing cause for concern as the damage caused will escalate and could reach unsustainable proportions. This study examined the utilization of satellite images for the detection of elephant induced ecosystem modification. A pilot study was conducted on four medium sized Game Reserves (each ± 30 000 ha) in South Africa. The aim was to ascertain the feasibility of using image analysis as instrument by which Game Reserve managers could assess biodiversity richness, habitat loss, and population-habitat viability. NDVI as indicator of primary production in vegetation is one of the instruments used to evaluate whether the carrying capacity for elephants of each Game Reserve has been reached and to compare the current biomass with those of previous years. The study also looked at the use of the woody canopy cover as target for change detection analysis.

40|$|Regeneration is {{unevenly}} {{spread throughout}} the animal kingdom. Some of the invertebrates {{have a very high}} regenerative capacity but the capacity to replace lost or damaged tissues in mammals is limited. Among the vertebrates, the aquatic salamanders are the champions of regeneration, being able to regenerate body parts such as their limbs, tail, and jaw. Understanding the cell- and molecular machinery underlying these events can in the end lead to improvements in the field of regenerative medicine. When a salamander limb is amputated, a so called blastema is formed {{at the tip of the}} stump. This is a mesenchymal growth zone, from where the cells for the new limb originate. The skeletal muscle is believed to contribute to the blastema and the newly formed limb during regeneration in salamanders. There are two possible mechanisms by which this could occur. First, the muscle <b>reserve</b> cells, <b>satellite</b> cells, become activated, and after subsequent expansion they incorporate in to the blastema. Second, the multinucleated muscle cell dedifferentiates in a cellularization process, forming several new progenitor cells that contribute to the regenerate. These two mechanisms are the subjects of study in this thesis. In the first paper, satellite cells were monitored during the regeneration of the salamander limb. The satellite cell population was found to be restored after several rounds of amputation/regeneration, demonstrating a robust mechanism to replenish this cell population. By genetically labeling satellite cell progeny with GFP, cells were traced during limb regeneration. The labeled cells were found to contribute to cartilage tissue as well as to muscle, suggesting that they have lineage switching potential. The satellite cell marker Pax 7 was rapidly down regulated in the blastema, indicating that the blastema has a reprogramming activity. In the second paper, the link between injury and dedifferentiation of muscle was explored. Previously it was shown that the skeletal muscle fiber must suffer a direct cellular injury in order to dedifferentiate in vivo. This led us to hypothesize that a programmed cell death response initiated by the injury, is linked to the dedifferentiation of this cell type. In order to investigate this, cellular events were examined after treating the cells with a known cellularization inducer called myoseverin, and pro-apoptotic drugs. The responses after these treatments were found to be similar, they both evoked cellularization of the muscle cells, and this was preceded by features of an activated apoptotic machinery. By inhibiting the intrinsic pathway of the apoptotic machinery, cellularization was inhibited. Finally, dedifferentiated progeny generated by pro-apoptotic stimuli was found to be capable of reentering the cell cycle and proliferate. Together these results indicate that the injury is directly linked to dedifferentiation through the apoptotic machinery...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{regenerative}} {{capacity of}} skeletal muscle, chronic myopathy and muscle trauma present significant clinical problems with limited therapeutic options. Myogenic cell therapies are being actively investigated to mitigate muscle degeneration that otherwise progresses to fibrosis and long-term loss of function. The rationale for {{this strategy is}} based on augmenting the native myogenic progenitor or stem cell <b>reserve,</b> populated by <b>satellite</b> cells, by transplanting myogenic cells into the injured muscle. However, engraftment efficiency in myogenic cell transplantation is impaired by rapid cell death, which represents a precipitous loss of cell viability within 48 hrs of injection, therefore severely limiting engraftment and tissue regeneration. Upon transplantation, cells experience a host response of rapid inflammation; an environment of oxidative and inflammatory stress that may cause a dramatic loss in cell viability. This effect may determine the regeneration capacity irrespective of the cell's multilineage differentiation potential. Our lab has isolated and characterized multiple populations of myogenic progenitors from murine and human skeletal muscle, including the muscle derived stem cell (MDSC) isolated by a modified preplate technique. In our studies of MDSCs, we observed an increase in post-transplantation survival and skeletal muscle regeneration capacity over that of early preplate myoblasts. Furthermore, a strong correlation of improved survival and regeneration with inflammatory and oxidative stress resistance emerged. In this dissertation, we examined the role stress resistance and survival during myogenic differentiation of MDSCs. By treating the transplanted cells with a membrane permeable reactive oxygen species scavenger, XJB- 5 - 131, prior to transplantation, the survival and myogenic differentiation capacity under stress conditions was significantly improved. Furthermore, we isolated a novel sub-population of muscle derived cells with elevated stress resistance from murine and human skeletal muscle by their enhanced aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. ALDHlo and ALDHhi cells were characterized {{in terms of their}} myogenic potential and stress tolerance in vitro and muscle regeneration capacity in vivo. These studies are aimed at understanding the importance of survival and stress tolerance of transplanted cells in skeletal muscle cell therapy and how this tolerance modifies the efficacy of cell therapy...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) catalyses the {{polymerization}} of ADP-ribose {{units from}} donor NAD+ molecules on target proteins, {{resulting in the}} attachment of linear or branched polymers. The negative charges of poly(ADP-ribose) change the target protein affinity for DNA. PARP- 1 exerts numerous functions in cellular physiology, from maintenance of DNA stability and integrity to transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control but {{its role in the}} G 0 -G 1 transition is not yet completely defined. The exit from quiescence is a highly regulated and conserved process started by extra cellular stimuli. These stimuli, for instance serum stimulation, trigger a signal cascade, including MAPK activation, that culminates in the transcriptional induction of Immediate Early Genes (IEGs). Our group has recently reported that PARP- 1 activity promotes cell cycle re-entry through the induction of a set of IEGs, such as c-myc, c-fos, junB and Egr- 1. On the basis of these previous finding we studied the mechanism by which PARP- 1 modulates IEGs in fibroblast cells. We highlighted that PARP- 1 affects the IEG expression at transcription level. Then analyses of chromatin status of c-myc promoter evidenced that this region is more condensed in absence of poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation upon mitogen stimulation of resting fibroblasts. Further, ChIP experiments showed a complex dynamics of PARP- 1 binding and chromatin poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation at the same region during G 0 -G 1 transition. Indeed PARP- 1 is associated with silent c-myc promoter during quiescence but, following mitogen stimulation, activated PARP- 1 is displaced from it in concomitance with chromatin poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation. These PARP- 1 activities are associated with the switch of transcription factor occupancies on the c-myc promoter. Moreover the dynamics of PARP- 1 binding at the promoter suggested a possible implication of the enzyme in the repression of c-myc gene during G 0 instauration. According with this hypothesis we found that overexpression of PARP- 1 accelerates c-myc shut off during G 0 entry. Since many early events induced during cell-cycle re-entry are shared by different cell lineages in several physiological condition, it was investigate whether PARP activity plays a role in other cell systems undergoing G 0 –G 1 transition. The attention was focused on skeletal myoblasts made quiescent by suspension culture. This muscle cell system mimics the function of muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>reserve</b> cells and can be activated by restoring cell adhesion to substrate. We found that in the myoblast context, the inhibition of PARP- 1 activity delays the induction of proliferation and interfers with both the upregulation of IEGs and the expression of the myogenic factor MyoD that normally occurs following reserve cell activation. This kind of analysis may open new ways of investigation in the study of cell cycle exit control that characterize stem cell differentiation or quiescence...|$|R

According to recent estimations, world wetlands account for 6. 2 to 7. 6 percent of earth’s surface. Wetlands are considered {{an integral part of}} the global ecosystem as they prevent or reduce severity of floods, feed groundwater aquifers and provide a unique habitat for flora and faun and lots of other benefits including water quality maintenance, agriculturalproduction, fisheries, and recreation. loodwater retention, provision of wildlife habitat, soil erosion control, maintaining the diversity of entire landscapes and are among other benefits. In addition, they can form cornerstone elements for regional conservation strategies. Zhao et al (2010) based on landscape data produced from integrated Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images and spatial metrics, presented a survey of wetland landscape changes in the Pearl River estuary from 1979 to 2009, and explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of wetland change. Yue et al (2003) using three series of satellite images in 1984, 1991 and 1996 studied changes in the landscape of the Yellow River Delta wetland. Kashaigili et al (2006) focused in their research on human and developmental activities in the study area for the periods 1973 and 1984, and 1984 and 2000. Landsat MSS and Landsat-TM images were used to locate and quantify the changes. Gilmore et al (2008) examined the effectiveness of using multi-temporal satellite imagery, and field spectral data to classify and map the common plant communities that may provide coastal resource managers, municipal officials and researchers a set of recommended guidelines for remote sensing data collection for marsh inventory and monitoring. International Wetlands of Ajay-Gol, Alma-Gol and Ala-Gol are located at, dry steppe and Warm Turkman sahra desert in Turkmenistan, near to the border of Iran and Turkmenistan. They are among unique ecosystems and international wetlands of Iran. In terms of geographic location, Alma gol Wetland is in geographical coordinates 37 ˚ 25 ̒N to 54 ˚ 38 ΄E and Aji gol Wetland is in 37 ˚ 24 ̒N to 54 ˚ 40 ΄E. Ala gol wetland is located in geographic coordinate of 37 ˚ 20 ΄ northern latitude and 54 ˚ 35 ̒ east. In this research, Changes of three international wetlands, that is Alma gol, Aji gol and Ala gol as globally important ecosystems are investigated using multi temporal images. For monitoring changes in the Wetlands, TM and ETM satellite sensor imagery for 1987, 2000, 2005 and 2010 after atmospheric and geometric correction with maximum likelihood classifier method in six classes of water, saltlands, arid lands, low vegetation density, average and high vegetation were classified. With transfer classification results to the GIS environment and using analytic function of Union Changes occurred in the primary - secondary matrices over the period studied (1987 - 2010) were evaluated. 2 - MethodologyTo achieve the main objectives of the study, available TM and ETM satellite sensor imagery for 1987, 2000, 2005 and 2010 Alma gol, Aji gol and Ala gol international wetlands were selected. In preprocessing stage, after preparing the multi temporal images of region, radiometric, Geometric and normalization techniques were applied. In processing stage, the visual interpretation of images related to the study area and the reflective properties of water in the infrared band that is almost zero, the separation of land and water in the wetland area was identified. In addition to the visual methods, other digital image processing techniques like the ratio of bands, bands subtraction, and principal component analysis were used to identify areas of change. In post processing stage, the field survey and using GPS device in the study area with picking up required training samples the Envi software environment was applied to the MLC method. 3 – DiscussionIn the present study, with field survey and using GPS device and considering to the distribution of land covererage, six classes of usage in the areaof mentioned wetlands were selected as follows: Water, saltlands, arid lands, low vegetation density, average and high vegetation. It was attempted to regard distribution of sample areas in selecting training samples with overlapping training samples and creating false color composite images so that normal distribution of samples is obtained. After classifying images of 1987, 2000, 2005 and 2010 extracted raster maps were converted to vector format for producing final change detection maps. Spatial distribution changes occurring during 1987 to 2010 could be derived from the change maps. In these maps using the Union extension, six classified land use layer for the years 1987 - 2000, 2000 - 2005 and 2005 - 2010 are overlaid on each other and spatial Values changes in primary and secondary matrices were calculated. 4 – ConclusionResults show that during the research period (1987 - 2010) many changes in land use area has occurred which these changes include reduction in wetlands area from 2591. 8 hectares in 1987 to 1280. 6 hectares in 2010, reduction of salt lands, reduction in vegetation with high density, increase in vegetation with low/average density, and finally stability of thearid land area. The main causes of these changes should be explored in issues such as droughts, dam construction, extra wetlands water consumption in agriculture, fish farming and construction of canals and roads.
