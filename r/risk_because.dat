5|$|A {{survey of}} American adults {{conducted}} in April 2014 showed that 60 percent {{had heard about}} Heartbleed. Among those using the Internet, 39 percent had protected their online accounts, for example by changing passwords or canceling accounts; 29 percent believed their personal information was put at <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> of the Heartbleed bug; and 6 percent believed their personal information had been stolen.|$|E
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|The sinkhole's {{collapse}} in Guatemala City's Zona 2 left at least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at <b>risk.</b> <b>Because</b> {{of the role}} played by sewage pipes in the sinkhole's collapse, Sam Bonis, along with other geologists, has demanded that the government inspect the sewer system more regularly.|$|E
50|$|Uncollateralised XCSs (that {{are those}} {{executed}} bilaterally without a credit support annex (CSA) in place) expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and credit <b>risks.</b> Funding <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> {{the value of}} the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. Credit <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> the respective counterparty, for whom {{the value of the}} swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations.|$|R
30|$|This lending process {{involves}} high <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> {{the borrower}} {{is not always}} willing or capable of paying on time. Hence, choosing the credible borrowers to reduce investment risk is a key point for lenders to consider.|$|R
50|$|Phentermine and {{topiramate}} {{was approved}} with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program {{to ensure that}} benefits of treatment outweigh the <b>risks.</b> <b>Because</b> of the teratogenic risk associated with phentermine/topiramate ER therapy, phentermine/topiramate ER is distributed via certified pharmacies.|$|R
5|$|Zebras and {{wildebeest}} group {{together in}} open savannah environments with high chances of predation. This grouping strategy reduces predation <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> larger groups decrease each individual’s {{chance of being}} hunted, and predators are more easily seen in open areas. The seasonal presence of thousands of migratory wildebeests reduces local lion predation on giraffe calves, resulting in greater survival of giraffes.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> it is not very soluble in water.|$|E
30|$|Convexity axiom {{means that}} the global risk of a {{portfolio}} should be equal or less than the convex combination of its partial <b>risks.</b> <b>Because</b> lower measured <b>risk</b> is better in coherent measures of risk, this axiom {{is consistent with the}} diversification effects.|$|R
50|$|In economics, {{moral hazard}} occurs when one person takes more <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> someone else bears {{the cost of}} those risks. A moral hazard may occur where the actions of one party may change to the {{detriment}} of another after a financial transaction has taken place.|$|R
40|$|Transparent risk {{communication}} {{is an essential}} component of informed decision making. Unfortunately, many people struggle to understand <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> they lack practical mathematical and risk literacy skills. Our research shows that well-designed visual aids improve risk understanding by encouraging more thorough deliberation and reducing biased risk representations...|$|R
5|$|Narayan {{performed}} in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries. His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai, {{was cut short}} when an impatient audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, drove him from the stage. Narayan pondered giving up the sarangi and becoming a singer. He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed at the major music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial.|$|E
25|$|A {{family history}} of {{melanoma}} greatly increases a person's <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> mutations in several genes {{have been found in}} melanoma-prone families. People with a history of one melanoma are at increased risk of developing a second primary tumor.|$|E
25|$|Motion {{and speed}} of the {{aircraft}}. A slow aircraft is at greater risk than a fast one (relative to travel across the viewer's line of sight). Helicopters are at greatest <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> they can hover, presenting a relatively stationary target.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, system level {{innovation}} {{required by}} changing {{a service to}} become sustainable involves high <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> of high levels of uncertainty. The high financial risk {{is one of the}} greatest barriers for many companies, as the financial rewards of providing a sustainable service can be difficult to predict.|$|R

30|$|Second, another {{necessary}} condition {{pertains to the}} reliability of the test results, that is, the certainty with which we can classify students according to a chosen test instrument. Neglecting this conditions poses serious <b>risks,</b> <b>because</b> people easily can be misclassified based on their test results, and such classification errors can have severe consequences for their future professional advancement.|$|R
25|$|Experienced free-divers are at {{particular}} <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> of their practiced ability {{to suppress the}} carbon dioxide induced urge to breathe. Some argue that the highest risk may be to intermediate skilled divers who are training hard and have not recognised their limits.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} family {{knows that}} the service person may be killed {{in the line of}} duty, but may accept that <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> they understand the values of duty, honor, and country. The mission is one in which the brat shares by extension through his military parent.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} {{inherently}} at <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> over 70% {{of its population}} occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. Any catastrophic event such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, or habitat loss would have a devastating impact on the Indian rhino's status. However, small population of rhinos may be prone to inbreeding depression.|$|E
50|$|A Cornell {{study from}} 2006 {{determined}} that teens {{are more likely}} to consider risk while making a decision, and {{for a longer period of}} time, than adults. They {{are more likely to}} overestimate the risks, in fact. Teens also, however, will take <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> they find the reward (such as instant gratification or peer acceptance) more valuable.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} {{weakness}} of Narendra Chaudhary, the Jawans said [...] "He {{had only one}} weakness- a cup of tea". Narendra Singh was so fearless that when it come to diffuse bombs he keep whole team away from bomb and himself took <b>risks.</b> <b>Because</b> of his such abilities he was always in Hit list of Naxalites.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{hydrocarbon}} monoterpenes and thymol in particular degrade rapidly (DT50 16 days in water, 5 days in soil) in the environment and are, thus, low <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> of rapid dissipation and low bound residues, supporting the use of thymol as a pesticide agent that offers a safe alternative to other more persistent chemical pesticides that can be dispersed in runoff and produce subsequent contamination.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} {{about the safety of}} aprotinin. Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but serology (measuring antibodies against aprotinin in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> the correct interpretation of these tests is difficult.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{have been shown}} to be useful as a supplement for athletes in speed-based events, such as middle-distance running, lasting from about one to seven minutes. However, overdose is a serious <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> sodium bicarbonate is slightly toxic; and gastrointestinal irritation is of particular concern. Additionally, this practice causes a significant increase in dietary sodium.|$|E
25|$|Jumping - {{is another}} <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> if the legs do not land {{properly}} {{after an initial}} jump, there may be damage to the meniscus in the knees, sprain to the ankle by everting or inverting the foot, or damage to the Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius if {{there is too much}} force while plantar flexing.|$|E

50|$|The {{long-term}} {{storage of}} DUF6 presents environmental, health, and safety <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> of its chemical instability. When UF6 {{is exposed to}} moist air, it reacts with {{the water in the}} air to produce UO2F2 (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride) both of which are highly corrosive and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.|$|R
40|$|International {{politics}} affects oil trade. But does {{it affect}} the oil-exporting developing countries more? We construct a firm-level dataset for all U. S. oil-importing companies over 1986 - 2008 to examine how these firms respond to changes in "political distance" between the U. S. and her trading partners, measured by divergence in their UN General Assembly voting patterns. Consistent with previous macro evidence, we first show that individual firms diversify their oil imports politically, even after controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity. We conjecture that the political pattern of oil imports from these individual firms is driven by hold-up <b>risks,</b> <b>because</b> oil trade {{is often associated with}} backward vertical FDI. To the extent that developing countries have higher hold-up <b>risks</b> <b>because</b> of their weaker institutions, the political effect on oil trade should be more significant in the developing world. We find that oil import decisions are indeed more elastic when firms import from developing countries, although the reverse is true in the short run. Our results suggest that international politics can affect oil revenue and hence long-term development in the developing world...|$|R
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{may be a}} late sequela {{of cardiac}} surgery. About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection {{have a history of}} open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency are at particularly high <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> aortic insufficiency causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta. This can cause dilatation and weakening of the walls of the ascending aorta.|$|E
25|$|The barrier {{was always}} a short {{distance}} inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier – between the actual borderline and the barrier – was readily accessible but only at considerable personal <b>risk,</b> <b>because</b> it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.|$|E
25|$|John Fremont Melby (July 1, 1913 – December 18, 1992) was a United States diplomat, {{who served}} in Russia from 1943 to 1945 and in China from 1945 to 1948. He held other {{positions}} with the Department of State until 1953, when he was dismissed as a security <b>risk</b> <b>because</b> of his long and intimate association with the playwright Lillian Hellman, {{who was accused of}} communist ties. He later became an academic specializing in Far Eastern affairs.|$|E
