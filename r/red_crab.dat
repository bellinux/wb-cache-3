5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island <b>red</b> <b>crab,</b> Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer.

5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E

25|$|Twenty {{terrestrial}} and intertidal {{species of}} crab {{have been described}} here, of which thirteen are regarded as true land crabs, being dependent on the ocean only for larval development. Robber crabs, known elsewhere as coconut crabs, also exist in large numbers on the island. The annual <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> mass migration (around 100 million animals) to the sea to spawn has been {{called one of the}} wonders of the natural world. This takes place each year around November – after the start of the wet season and in synchronisation with the cycle of the moon. Once at the ocean, the mothers release the embryos where they can survive and grow until they are able to live on land.|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} {{particularly}} {{noted for its}} prodigious populations of Christmas Island <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> (Gecarcoidea natalis), whose mass migrations at spawning time may number over a hundred million individuals. The bright red carapaces and sheer density of crabs make their routes to the sea observable from the air. Nonetheless, the populations of <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> are threatened {{by the arrival of}} the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes). The ant was accidentally introduced between 1915 and 1934, and without any native ant species to compete against, rapidly formed 'supercolonies' of extremely high density. Populations of the ant have been observed bringing down <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> over a hundred times their combined biomass. A. gracilipes is thought responsible for killing up to 30 million of the park's crabs.|$|R

25|$|Associations with {{species of}} pitcher plants {{are so many}} and varied {{that the study of}} Nepenthes infauna is {{something}} of a discipline in its own right. Camponotus schmitzi, the diving ant, has an intimate degree of mutualism with the pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata; it not only retrieves prey and detritus from {{beneath the surface of the}} liquid in the pitchers, but repels herbivores, and cleans the pitcher peristome, maintaining its slippery nature. The ants have been reported to attack struggling prey, hindering their escape, so there might be an element of myrmecotrophy to the relationship. Numerous species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in the liquid, where their larvae play various roles, depending on species; some eat microbes and detritus, as is common among mosquito larvae, whereas some species of Toxorhynchites also breed in pitchers, and their larvae are predators of other species of mosquito larvae. Apart from the crab spiders on pitchers, an actual small, <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> Geosesarma malayanum will enter the fluid, robbing and scavenging, though reputedly it does so at some risk of being captured and digested itself.|$|E

50|$|One {{environmental}} parameter {{that requires}} regulatory {{function of the}} <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> is the season due to the temperature change. Mature female <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> must remain in warmer water (near 4 °C) to ensure the eggs {{will be ready for}} hatching, while the male <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> stay in relatively cold water (near 1.5 °C) to conserve energy output. In spring (May), female <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> move to shallow coastal areas to moult and spawn, and males join the females in the shallow water prior to moulting. In the summer (mid-June through mid-November), these crabs spend their time in fairly deep water, below established summer thermocline. When the thermocline breaks down, the <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> migrate back to intermediate depths where they remain until the female <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> release the eggs fertilized in the previous spawning.|$|R

2500|$|Pteropods {{and brittle}} stars both form {{the base of}} the Arctic food webs and are both seriously damaged from acidification. Pteropods shells {{dissolve}} with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages. For pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium. Pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate which is needed for aragonite creation. Arctic waters are changing so rapidly that they will become undersaturated with aragonite as early as 2016. Additionally the brittle star's eggs die within a few days when exposed to expected conditions resulting from Arctic acidification. Acidification threatens to destroy Arctic food webs from the base up. Arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators. For example, pteropods are [...] "a key prey item of a number of higher predators – larger plankton, fish, seabirds, whales". Both pteropods and sea stars serve as a substantial food source and their removal from the simple food web would pose a serious threat to the whole ecosystem. The effects on the calcifying organisms at {{the base of the}} food webs could potentially destroy fisheries. The value of fish caught from US commercial fisheries in 2007 was valued at $3.8billion and of that 73% was derived from calcifiers and their direct predators. Other organisms are directly harmed as a result of acidification. For example, decrease in the growth of marine calcifiers such as the American lobster, ocean quahog, and scallops means there is less shellfish meat available for sale and consumption. Red king crab fisheries are also at a serious threat because crabs are calcifiers and rely on carbonate ions for shell development. Baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95days. In 2006 red king cab accounted for 23% of the total guideline harvest levels and a serious decline in <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> population would threaten the crab harvesting industry. [...] Several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800million people depending upon the emission scenario.|$|E
6000|$|The zoology {{of these}} broken islets of the Chonos Archipelago is, as {{might have been}} expected, very poor. Of quadrupeds two aquatic kinds are common. The Myopotamus Coypus (like a beaver, but with a round tail) is well known from its fine fur, which is an object of trade {{throughout}} the tributaries of La Plata. It here, however, exclusively frequents salt water; which same circumstance has been mentioned as sometimes occurring with the great rodent, the Capybara. A small sea-otter is very numerous; this animal does not feed exclusively on fish, but, like the seals, draws a large supply from a small <b>red</b> <b>crab,</b> which swims in shoals near {{the surface of the}} water. Mr. Bynoe saw one in Tierra del Fuego eating a cuttle-fish; and at Low's Harbour, another was killed in the act of carrying to its hole a large volute shell. At one place I caught in a trap a singular little mouse (M. brachiotis); it appeared common on several of the islets, but the Chilotans at Low's Harbour said that it was not found in all. What a succession of chances, or what changes of level must have been brought into play, thus to spread these small animals throughout this broken archipelago! (13/3. It is said that some rapacious birds bring their prey alive to their nests. If so, in the course of centuries, every now and then, one might escape from the young birds.

50|$|Robber <b>crabs,</b> <b>red</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{and blue}} crabs are {{completely}} wiped out from infested areas. Populations of other ground and canopy dwelling animals, such as reptiles and other leaf litter fauna, have also decreased. During crab migrations, many crabs move through areas infested with ants and are killed. Studies {{show that the}} ant has displaced an estimated 15-20 million crabs by occupying their burrows, killing and eating resident crabs, and using their burrows as nest sites. This factor has greatly depleted <b>red</b> <b>crabs,</b> and made their annual land migrations far more perilous.|$|R
50|$|Overall, the <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> and adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs.</b> Juvenile <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's volume regulation is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|R
40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of benthic <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> (Pleuroncodes planipes) were analyzed to document {{number of items}} and composition. The crabs were captured along a series of latitudinal transects covering depths from 50 to 250 m, during March (12 stations) and September 1990 (8 stations). The number of food items decreased significantly from March to September at 150 and 200 m depth, the only strata compared since <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> are usually absent from the coast above 100 m in summer. The particulate organic matter (POM) varied from 60 to 70 % of total food items. The zooplankton fraction, mainly crustaceans, foraminiferans, and radiolarians, was second in importance. Phytoplankton was the next most important group, and was represented by 17 genera in March and 11 in September. The mean number of diatoms in stomachs per station decreased significantly (73. 5 versus 7) from March to September. The number of genera/station showed the same pattern (5. 36 versus 3. 6). The most abundant (number of cells) and frequent (presence over number of stations) diatom genera in March were Nitzschia, Melosira and Cocconeis in that order, accounting for 74 % of the relative importance index. In September, Cyclotella, Nitzschia and Melosira accounted for 42 % of the importance index. The stomach contents in benthic <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> indicate a decreasing availability of food in the area from winter-spring through the summer. This pattern correlates well with the diminishing intensity of the coastal upwelling system and weakening of the California Current.
