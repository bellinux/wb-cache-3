5|$|From {{the mid-1990s}} Preston North End started a {{complete}} <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> Deepdale {{to convert it}} into a modern all-seater stadium.

5|$|In June 2009, {{the club}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} state-of-the-art 26,828 seater stadium {{on the site of}} the now-demolished old Cardiff Athletics Stadium at a cost of £48million.

5|$|The cruise port of Puerto Costa Maya was {{severely}} damaged, causing Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's two largest cruise operators, to divert {{away from the}} port until at least 2009.

5|$|Two major {{projects}} are being undertaken {{on the southern}} portion of the line: the <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> the Cortlandt Street station, and the <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> the new South Ferry terminal. Following the September 11 attacks, the Cortlandt Street station was destroyed, and as a result, is being completely rebuilt with a new connection to the World Trade Center PATH station. In 2009, a new station at South Ferry opened to replace the old South Ferry loop station. The new station, a two-terminal, was intended to increase capacity and to save travel times. However, just three years later it closed {{as a result of}} Hurricane Sandy, which completely flooded the station. The loop station was temporarily open to serve the area, but it closed in June 2017 when the newer station reopened.|$|E

5|$|Again about 1505 the <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> {{the church}} of San Pietro in Oliveto began, a {{commission}} probably won by Sanmicheli. Note that the reliefs are the only figurative works there, {{in addition to the}} fine carvings on pilasters and frames of the chapels, a specialism of the Sanmicheli that no longer met contemporary tastes. The ultimate answer from Gasparo not long in coming: with the ark of Sant'Apollonio of 1508, he established once and for all his artistic superiority, which was by then certainly much more preferred by the Brescian clientele.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the war, {{architect}} Charles Holden drew up {{plans to}} redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. <b>Rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> the city centre eventually began 10years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, {{with the arrival of the}} University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> the eastern ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright {{wrote of the}} west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E
