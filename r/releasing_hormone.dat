5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
25|$|The GI tract <b>releases</b> <b>hormones</b> from enzymes to help {{regulate}} the digestive process.

50|$|Endocrine {{cells of}} the {{anterior}} pituitary are controlled by regulatory <b>hormones</b> <b>released</b> by parvocellular neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamic capillaries leading to infundibular blood vessels, which in turn lead to a second capillary bed in the anterior pituitary.

25|$|Cushing's disease refers only to hypercortisolism {{secondary}} to excess production of ACTH from a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (secondary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (Corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone)</b> (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism).

50|$|The major {{center of}} neuroendocrine {{integration}} in the body {{is found in the}} hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Here hypothalamic neurosecretory cells release factors to the blood. Some of these factors (<b>releasing</b> <b>hormones),</b> <b>released</b> at the hypothalamic median eminence, control the secretion of pituitary hormones, while others (the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin) are released directly into the blood.|$|R
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} not needed {{if there are}} no symptoms. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may help with pain and bleeding while paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with pain. Iron supplements may be needed in those with heavy periods. Medications of the gonadotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> agonist class may decrease the size of the fibroids but are expensive and associated with side effects. If greater symptoms are present, surgery to remove the fibroid or uterus may help. Uterine artery embolization may also help. Cancerous versions of fibroids are very rare and are known as leiomyosarcomas. They do not appear to develop from benign fibroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of gametes is induced in {{both male and}} female mammals by the same two hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The {{production of}} these in turn is induced by a single <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone,</b> gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which {{has been the focus of}} most of the research into immunocontraception against gamete production. GnRH is secreted by the hypothalamus in pulses and travels to the anterior pituitary gland through a portal venous system. There it stimulates the production of FSH and LH. FSH and LH travel through the general circulatory system and stimulate the functioning of the gonads, including the production of gametes and the secretion of sex steroid hormones. Immunity against GnRH thus lessens FSH and LH production which in turn attenuates gamete production and secondary sexual characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Neurons of the {{arcuate nucleus}} secrete gonadotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> (GnRH) {{into the blood}} of the {{pituitary}} portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that, in turn, is the result of an oscillator or signal generator in the central nervous system ("GnRH pulse generator"). In the years preceding physical puberty, Robert M. Boyar discovered that the gonadotropin pulses occur only during sleep, but as puberty progresses they can be detected during the day. By the end of puberty, there is little day-night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses.|$|E
5000|$|For hormone {{secretion}} {{regulated by}} the negative feedback loop: when gland X <b>releases</b> <b>hormone</b> X, this stimulates target cells to <b>release</b> <b>hormone</b> Y. When there is an excess of hormone Y, gland X [...] "senses" [...] this and inhibits its <b>release</b> of <b>hormone</b> X. As shown in the figure, most endocrine hormones are controlled by a physiologic negative feedback inhibition loop, such as the glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal cortex. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which directs the anterior pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. Glucocorticoids not only perform their respective functions throughout the body but also negatively affect the release of further stimulating secretions of both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, effectively reducing the output of glucocorticoids once a sufficient amount has been released.|$|R

25|$|For frozen-thawed embryo {{transfer}} or transfer of embryo from egg donation, no previous ovarian hyperstimulation {{is required for}} the recipient before transfer, which can be performed in spontaneous ovulatory cycles. Still, various protocols exist for frozen-thawed {{embryo transfer}}s as well, such as protocols with ovarian hyperstimulation, protocols in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen and/or progesterone. A Cochrane review in 2010 of randomized studies came to the result that there generally is insufficient evidence to support the use of one intervention in preference to another, but with some evidence that in cycles where the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen or progesterone, it is beneficial to administer an additional drug that suppresses hormone production by the ovaries such as continuous administration of a gonadotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> agonist (GnRHa). For egg donation, there is evidence of a lower pregnancy rate and a higher cycle cancellation rate when the progesterone supplementation in the recipient is commenced prior to oocyte retrieval from the donor, as compared to commenced day of oocyte retrieval or the day after.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa causes {{alterations}} {{in the female}} reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute {{to a loss of}} bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{subjects}} were studied {{to test the}} feasibility of a combined anterior pituitary function test using iv administration of four hypothalamic releasing hormones: ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone, human GH-releasing hormone, GnRH, and TRH. Initially, nine normal men were studied with various combinations of these four hormones to exclude {{the possibility that they}} might inhibit or synergize with each other in releasing the individual anterior pituitary hormones. When given in combination, the <b>releasing</b> <b>hormones</b> were administered as sequential 20 -sec iv infusions in the following order and doses: ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone, 1 μg/kg; GnRH, 100 μg; human GH-releasing hormone, 1 μg/kg; and TRH, 200 μg. Plasma or serum samples were assayed for ACTH, cortisol, GH, PRL, FSH, LH, and TSH at multiple times for 120 min after injection. Compared to individual administration, combined administration of these four hypothalamic <b>releasing</b> <b>hormones</b> caused no apparent inhibition or synergism with respect to the individual hormone responses of these normal subjects. Sideeffects of the combined test were the same as those observed with individual hormone administration. No unusual or dangerous side-effects were observed. Having confirmed the efficacy of combined administration of the four <b>releasing</b> <b>hormones,</b> we administered the combination to five additional normal men and 12 normal women. Anterior pituitary hormone and cortisol responses were the same in men and women, except for a lower LH and a greater PRL response in women. There was a rapid increase in all hormones, with peak levels usually reached by 60 min. Adequate assessment of individual hormone responses can be achieved by assaying a basal and only 2 (or 3 in the case of ACTH and GH) postinfusion samples.
