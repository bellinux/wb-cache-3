5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he rarely did for presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Saxbe fix {{has become}} {{politically}} uncontroversial. Both Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>Presidents</b> {{have used the}} fix, and indeed Republican outgoing President George H. W. Bush helped Democratic incoming President Bill Clinton execute the fix by signing it into law {{on the eve of}} Clinton's inauguration. The fixes that have been enacted for Obama's cabinet have passed in both the House and the Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent. Outgoing Republican President George W. Bush signed the Saxbe fixes for both Hillary Clinton and Ken Salazar into law for the incoming Democratic Obama administration.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of <b>Republican</b> <b>Presidents</b> Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
50|$|The {{policy is}} a {{political}} flashpoint in the abortion debate, with Republican administrations adopting it and Democratic administrations rescinding it. The policy was enacted by <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Ronald Reagan in 1984, rescinded by Democratic President Bill Clinton in January 1993, re-instituted in January 2001 as <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> George W. Bush took office, rescinded on January 23, 2009, as Democratic President Barack Obama took office and reinstated on January 23, 2017, as <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Donald Trump assumed the office.|$|R

50|$|Historically, more {{progressive}} {{leaders in the}} Republican party supported environmental protection.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of McKinley's {{election}} in 1896, African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche K. Bruce, an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents.</b> McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.|$|E

25|$|The {{party has}} won 24 {{of the last}} 40 U.S. presidential {{elections}} {{and there have been}} a total of 19 <b>Republican</b> <b>Presidents,</b> the most from any one party.

25|$|The three-term Republican Governor John Engler (1991–2003) {{preceded the}} former two-term Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm (2003–2011). The state has elected {{successive}} Republican attorneys general twice since 2003. The Republican Party currently holds {{a majority in}} both the House and Senate of the Michigan Legislature. Michigan supported the election of <b>Republican</b> <b>Presidents</b> Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Donald Trump. The current Governor Rick Snyder (2011–present) is a Republican.|$|E
25|$|As {{economic}} growth slowed, <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> relied on foreign loans. Saavedra (1920–25) and Hernando Siles Reyes (1926–30) borrowed {{heavily in the}} United States to finance major development projects, despite opposition by Bolivian nationalists to the favorable terms for the lender. The so-called Nicolaus loan aroused national indignation because it gave the United States control over Bolivia's tax collections {{in return for a}} private banking loan of US$33 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw {{election}} or succession of <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Eisenhower had defeated conservative leader Senator Robert A. Taft for the 1952 nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower Administration. Voters liked Ike much more than they liked the GOP, and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position. After 1970, the liberal wing began to fade away.|$|E

President Gerald Ford was almost shot while leaving the hotel in September 1975 by a woman named Sara Jane Moore. A former Marine named Oliver Sipple moved her hand so that Ford was not hit. President Ronald Reagan was a {{frequent}} guest of the hotel. The St. Francis also hosted many world leaders, including Queen Elizabeth II and Emperor Hirohito of Japan.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} presidential elections, Montana has {{voted for the}} Republican {{candidate}} in all but two elections from 1952 to the present. The state last supported a Democrat for president in 1992, when Bill Clinton won a plurality victory. Overall, since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 {{percent of the time}} and <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> 40 percent of the time. In the 2008 presidential election, Montana was considered a swing state and was ultimately won by Republican John McCain, albeit by a narrow margin of two percent.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{conservatives are}} strongest in the South, Mountain West and Midwest, where they draw support from social conservatives. The moderates tend to {{dominate}} the party in New England, and used to be well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford, they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s, they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the cabinets of <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents.</b> In Vermont, Jim Jeffords, a Republican Senator became an independent in 2001 due to growing disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership. In addition, moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several New England States, while Lincoln Chafee, a former moderate Republican senator is an independent-turned-Democrat former governor of Rhode Island. Former Senator Olympia Snowe and current Senator Susan Collins, both of Maine, and former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts are notable moderate Republicans from New England. Former Senator Mark Kirk {{is another example of}} a moderate Republican from a Democratic stronghold, Illinois, who ironically held the Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama. From 1991 to 2007, moderate Republicans served as governors of Massachusetts. Prominent Republican moderates have included former Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George Bush Sr., as well as former Senate leaders Howard Baker and Bob Dole, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and former New York City Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.|$|E

500|$|Trotter's {{opposition}} to Booker T. Washington placed him {{at odds with}} Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> who relied on Washington as an adviser and otherwise enjoyed widespread African-American support. Trotter supported the southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 election. [...] Wilson, in a brief meeting with Trotter and other NERL members, made vague statements about fair treatment of African Americans. But, he succumbed to pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and agreed to segregate federal offices. The NAACP and NERL (then known as the National Independent Political League, or NIPL) protested, and Trotter secured a meeting with Wilson at the White House in November 1913. [...] Wilson said that his policies were not segregationist, but Trotter characterized Wilson's denial as [...] "preposterous".|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} run for president, Reagan's {{campaign}} advisor, George Will, tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for the campaign. Will wrote that if [...] "labor and management, who make steel or cars or shoes or textiles, made their products {{with as much}} energy and confidence as Springsteen and his merry band make music, {{there would be no}} need for Congress to be thinking about protectionism". A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A."
