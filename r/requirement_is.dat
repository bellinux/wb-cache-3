30|$|Reprioritization {{should focus}} on the views of {{developers}} as many non functional <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> better prioritized by the developers rather than the clients. Svensson et al. (2011), after the analysis of eleven software developing firms, reported that prioritization of quality <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> a neglected activity. Quality <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> taken as low priority requirements and the main stress is on implementing functional ones.|$|R

5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E
50|$|In Investigation, {{the first}} three classes of <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> {{gathered}} from the users, from the business and from the development team. In each area, similar questions are asked; what are the goals, what are the constraints, what are the current tools or processes in place, and so on. Only when these <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> well understood can functional <b>requirements</b> <b>be</b> developed.|$|R

5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, when World Rugby was {{considering}} {{a change in}} the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president Bernard Laporte announced that the body would require that all France national team members hold French passports. This <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years' residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement remain eligible for selection even if they do not hold French passports.|$|E

United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E
5|$|The lophophore and mantle are {{the only}} {{surfaces}} that absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which is circulated through the mantle and driven either by contractions of {{the lining of the}} coelom or by beating of its cilia. In some species oxygen is partly carried by the respiratory pigment hemerythrin, which is transported in coelomocyte cells.The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> not measurable.|$|E

5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that any}} non-federal recipient of federal assistance that passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as pass-through entities and subrecipients, respectively) {{is responsible to}} monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations. This <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the fact}} that they are both equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
5|$|Tigers can {{occupy a}} wide range of habitat types, but will usually require {{sufficient}} cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with the multiple felines in a pride. A further habitat <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> the placement of suitably secluded den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation. Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially open grassland and savanna as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.|$|E
