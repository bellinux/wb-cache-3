5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying the bridge to dismantle it and <b>reassemble</b> in Costa Rica, as he believed it would be cheaper to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own the bridge, and the plan never went through.|$|E

5|$|Between 1869 and 1870, {{the society}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as Literary Hall, where it could hold its meetings and <b>reassemble</b> the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.|$|E
40|$|The <b>reassembling</b> of {{a simple}} {{connected}} graph G = (V,E) is an abstraction of a problem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. The <b>reassembling</b> process has a simple formulation (there are several equivalent formulations) relative to a binary tree B (<b>reassembling</b> tree), with root node {{at the top and}} $n$ leaf nodes at the bottom, where every cross-section corresponds to a partition of V such that: - the bottom (or first) cross-section (all the leaves) is the finest partition of V with n one-vertex blocks, - the top (or last) cross-section (the root) is the coarsest partition with a single block, the entire set V, - a node (or block) in an intermediate cross-section (or partition) is the result of merging its two children nodes (or blocks) in the cross-section (or partition) below it. The maximum edge-boundary degree encountered during the <b>reassembling</b> process is what we call the alpha-measure of the <b>reassembling,</b> and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is its beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp. beta-optimization) of the <b>reassembling</b> of G is to determine a <b>reassembling</b> tree B that minimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure). There are different forms of <b>reassembling.</b> In an earlier report, we studied linear <b>reassembling,</b> which is the case when the height of B is (n- 1). In this report, we study balanced <b>reassembling,</b> when B has height [log n]. The two main results in this report are the NP-hardness of alpha-optimization and beta-optimization of balanced <b>reassembling.</b> The first result is obtained by a sequence of polynomial-time reductions from minimum bisection of graphs (known to be NP-hard), and the second by a sequence of polynomial-time reductions from clique cover of graphs (known to be NP-hard) ...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{experiments}} in our laboratory have successfully <b>reassembled</b> infectious polyoma virions from dissociated virion products. Virions treated with ethyleneglycol-bis-N,N'-tetraacetic acid and the reducing agent beta-mercaptoethanol at pH 7. 5 were dissociated to a 48 S DNA-protein complex and capsomere subunits. The virion dissociation products were not infectious by plaque assay and lacked hemagglutination activity. These virion dissociation products were <b>reassembled</b> to intact virions by overnight dialysis against a reassembly buffer containing CaCl 2, dimethyl sulfoxide, and Triton X- 100 in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7. 4. The biophysical {{characteristics of the}} <b>reassembled</b> virions were identical to those of untreated virions in that the <b>reassembled</b> virions had a sedimentation value of 240 S in sucrose gradients and a buoyant density of 1. 315 g/cm 3 in CsCl isopycnic gradients. The <b>reassembled</b> virions were intact as determined by electron microscopy and {{were found to be}} 60 % resistant to DNase I treatment. Biologically, the <b>reassembled</b> purified virions were found to partially regain both hemagglutinating activity and plaque-forming ability...|$|R

5|$|In 1888, after {{spending}} sixteen years cataloging Newton's papers, Cambridge University kept {{a small number}} and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's. The collection was broken up and sold {{for a total of}} about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to <b>reassemble</b> an estimated half of Newton's collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to <b>reassemble</b> the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, Jeopardy! {{traveled}} to Boston to <b>reassemble</b> 12 past Teen Tournament contestants {{for a special}} Teen Reunion Tournament. In 2008, the 25th season began with reuniting 15 contestants from the first two Kids Weeks {{to compete in a}} special reunion tournament of their own. During the next season (2009–2010), a special edition of Celebrity Jeopardy!, called the Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, was played in which twenty-seven contestants from past celebrity episodes competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000 for charity; the grand prize was won by Michael McKean.|$|E
40|$|Virus {{particles}} were <b>reassembled</b> {{in vitro}} from tomato aspermy virus strain V (V-TAV) RNA and {{a mixture of}} subunits prepared from V-TAV and 35 S-labelled cucumber mosaic virus strain T (T-CMV). Immunodiffusion tests showed that the <b>reassembled</b> particles reacted with polyclonal antisera raised against both V-TAV and T-CMV. Radioactivity {{was found in the}} precipitin line formed between the <b>reassembled</b> particles and antiserum raised against T-CMV {{as well as in the}} precipitin line formed between the <b>reassembled</b> particles and antiserum raised against V-TAV. This shows that 35 S-labelled T-CMV protein subunits were incorporated with V-TAV protein subunits into the same particles. Thus, coat proteins of V-TAV and T-CMV can coassemble and form mixed-subunit capsids in vitro. B. Chen, J. W. Randles and R. I. B. Franck...|$|R
40|$|Conditions are {{reported}} {{under which the}} <b>reassembled</b> intermediates of the heat-shock protein Hsp 16. 3 after being denatured in 8 M urea were detected by mainly using urea-gradient PAGE (with modifications) and urea-denaturing pore-gradient PAGE. Hsp 16. 3 is the small heat-shock protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which exists as a specific nonamer and was proposed to form a trimer-of-trimers structure. The refolding and <b>reassembling</b> of this protein was achieved rapidly by dilution or dialysis, suggesting an effectively spontaneous recovery of quaternary structure. Data presented in this report demonstrate that the in vitro <b>reassembling</b> process of Hsp 16. 3 protein occurs through a spontaneous and effective stepwise mechanism. Modified urea-gradient PAGE may provide a general method for studying the <b>reassembling</b> processes of other oligomeric proteins...|$|R

5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to <b>reassemble</b> the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei <b>reassemble</b> around them.|$|E
5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house had become a Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though {{the house had been}} heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to <b>reassemble</b> it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E

5|$|The Romney Literary Society reorganized on May 15, 1869. Following the reorganization, {{the society}} built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870 while also {{undertaking}} an initiative {{to bring the}} West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind to its old Romney Classical Institute campus. The construction of Literary Hall {{was part of the}} society's effort to revive the organization and <b>reassemble</b> its original library. The society set about recovering original volumes and purchasing new ones, and the library reopened with 700 volumes. For a period of ten years between 1870 and 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall. As older members died, interest in the society began to dwindle. The society's meetings were held less frequently, and its last recorded meeting was held on February 15, 1886.|$|E
5|$|The second voyage was {{to reduce}} the {{garrison}} and replace HM Sloop Hound, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop Penguin, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in Endeavour. Endeavour sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of Penguin, and four ship's carpenters whose job was to <b>reassemble</b> Penguin on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April Endeavour and Hound sailed for England with their crew. One of Penguin's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set two million years ago. The {{inhabitants}} of the planet Krikkit built a race of androids called the Krikkitmen to wipe out all life in the universe. They were stopped by the Time Lords, who trapped Krikkit within a temporal prison. A group of Krikkitmen which escaped the Time Lords' sentence are trying to <b>reassemble</b> the components of a key which can free Krikkit—components which happen to resemble elements of the Earth game of cricket, itself actually {{a reflection of the}} ancient war. The Doctor and Sarah stumble upon this plot when they see the Krikkitmen steal the Ashes during a test match at Lords. They then travel to the planet Bethselamin to foil {{the next step in the}} Krikkitmen's quest.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to <b>reassemble</b> the model from storage.|$|E
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to <b>reassemble</b> for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
5|$|During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units {{had become}} widely scattered, with forces being {{deployed}} to Cyprus, and the 9th Division and the 18th Infantry Brigade coming under siege in Tobruk. Blamey {{would spend the}} rest of the year attempting to <b>reassemble</b> his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successor, John Curtin, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were forced to give way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British 70th Division. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the Greek War Cross, First Class.|$|E

40|$|The <b>reassembling</b> of {{a simple}} {{connected}} graph G = (V, E) is an abstraction of a problem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. Its simplest formulation is in two steps: (1) We cut every edge of G into two halves, thus obtaining a collection of n = ∣ V ∣ one-vertex components, such that for every v ∈ V the one-vertex component {v} has ∣ degree(v) ∣ half edges attached to it. (2) We splice {{the two halves of}} every edge together, not of all the edges at once, but in some ordering Θ of the edges that minimizes two measures that depend on the edge-boundary degrees of assembled components. A component A is a subset of V and its edge-boundary degree is the number of edges in G with one endpoint in A and one endpoint in V − A (which {{is the same as the}} number of half edges attached to A after all edges with both endpoints in A have been spliced together). The maximum edge-boundary degree encountered during the <b>reassembling</b> process is what we call the α-measure of the <b>reassembling,</b> and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is its β-measure. The α-optimization (resp. β-optimization) of the <b>reassembling</b> of G is to determine an ordering Θ for splicing the edges that minimizes its α-measure (resp. β-measure). There are different forms of <b>reassembling,</b> depending on restrictions and variations on the ordering Θ of the edges. We consider only cases satisfying the condition that if the an edge between disjoint components A and B is spliced, then all the edges between A and B are spliced at the same time. In this report, we examine the particular case of linear <b>reassembling,</b> which requires that the next edge to be spliced must be adjacent to an already spliced edge. We delay other forms of <b>reassembling</b> to follow-up reports. We prove that α-optimization of linear <b>reassembling</b> and minimum-cutwidth linear arrangment (CutWidth) are polynomially reducible to each other, and that β-optimization of linear <b>reassembling</b> and minimum-cost linear arrangement (MinArr) are polynomially reducible to each other. The known NP-hardness of CutWidth and MinArr imply the NP-hardness of α-optimization and β-optimization...|$|R

5|$|In {{the idea}} of Matt Bozon, who created the game's {{universe}} based on Erin's character, at the beginning, the game was planned for the SNES or PC. He and Erin pitched the game with help from veteran programmer Jimmy Huey, who worked with WayForward at the time. After the completion of Xtreme Sports, Voldi Way, the founder and owner of WayForward, greenlit a Game Boy Color version of the game. As Huey had already built a graphics engine for Xtreme Sports, this engine was adapted to suit Shantaes needs. This allowed the game to showcase rare effects on GBC games, like parallax scrolling and transparency effects. In {{the first four months}} of development, the team created most of the animation, and Huey programmed an art-capturing tool that allowed to take full-colored animation frames, turn them into three-colour chunks and <b>reassemble</b> the whole on the GBC's screen.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans {{arrived in}} late May 1457 and marched through the Mat River Valley. Skanderbeg tried {{to delay the}} vanguard, {{composed}} of Akıncı cavalrymen, but upon {{the approach of the}} main force, decided to retreat. Both Isak bey and Hamza were familiar with Skanderbeg's tactics so the Albanian leader adopted a new one. He split his army into several groups and ordered them to march in separate directions through the mountains and remain unseen by the Ottoman forces until the signal to <b>reassemble</b> was given. The Albanians remained in separate formations until September, by which time the Ottomans had become both exasperated and convinced that Skanderbeg had been defeated. On 2 September 1457, Skanderbeg finally gave the order for his armies to regroup and launched a surprise attack on the Ottoman camp, killing and capturing up to 30,000 men. Among them was Hamza who was later sent as a prisoner to Naples in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{combinatorial}} extension (CE) {{method is}} similar to DALI in that it too breaks each structure in the query set {{into a series of}} fragments that it then attempts to <b>reassemble</b> into a complete alignment. A series of pairwise combinations of fragments called aligned fragment pairs, or AFPs, are used to define a similarity matrix through which an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment. Only AFPs that meet given criteria for local similarity are included in the matrix as a means of reducing the necessary search space and thereby increasing efficiency. A number of similarity metrics are possible; the original definition of the CE method included only structural superpositions and inter-residue distances but has since been expanded to include local environmental properties such as secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.|$|E
