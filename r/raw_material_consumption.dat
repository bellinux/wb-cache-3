Some metals and minerals, energy commodities, and timber products {{are not included in}} this review for various reasons. The period reviewed is from 1961 to 1988. A prominent characteristic of the metals market during the past 15 years has been its very slow growth. In some years <b>consumption</b> of several <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> has even declined. Explaining the causes of this slowdown, in the face of moderate economic growth, has become a topical issue. The slowdown has important implications for a number of developing countries that rely heavily on exports of these materials. The severity and persistence of post- 1973 declines in metals intensity per unit of GNP, prompted the conjecture that it may have been structural.

Despite representing 15% in volume, glass only contributes 4% to the total production value. On the other side, flexibles are a material that is extremely valuable, representing 22% of total value while only embodying 3% of the production size. In 2014, two thirds of Brazilian <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>consumption</b> took place in the alimentary sector and one third in the non-alimentary sector.

Moreover, the total value/volume ratio is higher for food than for non-food packaging, which indicates an overall higher turnover of non-food packaging.|$|E
50|$|The {{generalized}} Murray’s law {{defines the}} basic geometric features for porous materials with optimum transfer properties. The generalized Murray’s law {{can be used}} to design and optimize the structures of an enormous range of porous materials. This concept has led to materials, termed as the Murray materials, whose pore-sizes are multiscale and are designed with diameter-ratios obeying the generalized Murray’s law.As lithium battery electrodes, the Murray materials can reduce the stresses in these electrodes during the charge/discharge processes, improving their structural stability and resulting in a longer life time for energy storage devices. This material could also be used for boosting the performance of a gas sensor and a photocatalysis process that broke down a dye using light.To achieve substances or energy transfer with extremely high efficiency, evolution by natural selection has endowed many classes of organisms with Murray materials, in which the pore-sizes regularly decrease across multiple scales and finally terminate in size-invariant units. For example, in plant stems and leaf veins, the sum of the radii cubed remains constant across every branch point to maximize the flow conductance, which is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis. For insects relying upon gas diffusion for breathing, the sum of radii squared of tracheal pores remains constant along the diffusion pathway, to maximize gases diffusion. From plants, animals and materials to industrial processes, the introduction of Murray material concept to industrial reactions can revolutionize the design of reactors with highly enhanced efficiency, minimum energy, time, and <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>consumption</b> for a sustainable future.|$|E

Studies reveal that there is significant percent calcium aluminate in ladle furnace slags which is the main compound of ladle fluxes. These fluxes are widely used to clean steel production processes. Hence, using of ladle furnace slags as a part of ladle fluxes can be considered as an economical recovery for these materials. In current study, the LF slags of Mobarakeh Steel Company (MSC) was separated from metallic part and also was crashed and sized.
