25|$|During World War II, various chloroalkanes were in {{standard}} use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, {{after the war}} they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with Halon 1301 was conducted {{under the auspices of}} the US Armed Forces, while Halon 1211 was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with warships, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>personnel.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Dielectric {{absorption}} is {{the name}} given to the effect by which a capacitor, that has been charged for a long time, discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called dielectric relaxation, [...] "soakage", or [...] "battery action". For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage, {{but it can be}} as much as 15% for electrolytic capacitors. The voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>personnel.</b> In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used.|$|E
