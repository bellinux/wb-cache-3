40|$|An innovating {{solution}} for throttle-free load control for spark-ignition engines is Variable Valve Timing system (VVT System, or VVA - Variable Valve Actuation System). In {{this paper is}} presented an analytic method for kinematic analysis of the valve timing mechanism with three elements, which mainly includes the camshaft, the roller <b>rocker</b> <b>finger</b> and an intermediate rocker arm. This type of mechanism ensures a continuous valve lift (VVL System) between two extreme valve heights. It is also presented the numerical example for the variable valve lift mechanismâ€™s motion...|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, Shull toured {{in support}} of Buckcherry, the Deftones and Canadian <b>rockers</b> <b>Finger</b> 11, and booked Die Mannequin on a tour with Sum 41 on their Strength in Numbers' tour followed by a European tour in 2007 with Danko Jones.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Braden {{sank into}} the <b>rocker</b> and <b>fingered</b> a {{waistcoat}} pocket full of cigars {{that looked like a}} section of a cartridge-belt.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a <b>rocker</b> arm, <b>finger,</b> or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use rocker arms. Rocker arms are actuated by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual ball studs in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
50|$|Guitarist Jonny <b>Rocker</b> {{broke his}} <b>finger</b> whilst playing {{football}} in July 2010 {{a few hours}} before the band were due to go stage opening for Papa Roach. The band decided to carry on and play the show as a four-piece, {{and the rest of the}} summer headline and festival dates were also performed as a four-piece.|$|R
50|$|Its 3G81 three-cylinder engine has a {{displacement}} of 548 cubic centimetres and features three intake valves and two exhaust valves incorporated into each cylinder. The valves {{are controlled by}} twin overhead camshafts through roller cam followers on <b>finger</b> <b>rockers</b> with hydraulic automatic lash adjusters. Gasoline is electronically injected through triple-jet nozzles (also a technological first). The water-cooled turbocharger operates through an air-to-air intercooler. The ignition timing advance is also controlled electronically, and a knock-sensing system is included.|$|R
5000|$|The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg {{over the}} {{previous}} model. The most notable feature of the [...] "M" [...] are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, {{both of which were}} designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear body work that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for US). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and <b>rocker</b> arm (<b>finger</b> follower) per valve (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (lash) was now adjusted with shims (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tyre width was increased to a 170 mm section width. The gauges also changed to white coloured needles (previously amber coloured).|$|R
5000|$|The band {{consisted}} of guitarist/vocalist Terry Sharpe, guitarist/vocalist Paul Bowen, bassist Sean Martin and drummer Liam L'Estrange. The group sported {{a mix of}} punk and mainstream pop influences. Early sets {{consisted of}} such 1960s pop standards as [...] "Please Please Me" [...] by The Beatles and [...] "Sugar, Sugar" [...] by The Archies {{at a time when}} such light, happy fare was an anathema to the punk community. The band also stood out from their punk contemporaries with their tight, sophisticated harmonies. Appropriately, they opened for groups as diverse as Teen Idols the Bay City Rollers and aggressive punk <b>rockers</b> Stiff Little <b>Fingers.</b> Because of their clean-cut, boys-next-door image, sugary songs, and amiable persona, they were sometimes even tagged the [...] "Bay City Rollers of punk".|$|R
