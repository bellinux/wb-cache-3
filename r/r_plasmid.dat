40|$|We have {{examined}} the association of an F′ plasmid and an <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> in Proteus mirabilis with a rapidly sedimenting material that is generated by sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis and low speed centrifugation. Virtually all of the chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the F′ plasmid DNA {{are associated with the}} rapidly sedimenting material after gentle lysis and centrifugation. A portion of <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> NR 1 DNA (usually 5 to 25 %) is not bound to the rapidly sedimenting material and is recovered in the supernatant fraction. This difference in binding is not related {{to the size of the}} plasmid DNA, since F′ plasmids and R plasmids of different molecular weights showed the same behavior. <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA labeled by a brief pulse of [3 H]thymine is recovered in the supernatant fraction to a lower extent than the total <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA. It would appear that <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> replication takes place in association with the rapidly sedimenting material. With prolongation of the [3 H]thymine pulse, the [3 H]thymine-labeled <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA is recovered in the supernatant fraction with the same probability as the total <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA. This finding indicates that a change in <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> attachment to the rapidly sedimenting material occurs some time after its replication. The differences observed in the replication of F′ plasmids and R plasmids in P. mirabilis may be related to their different modes of association with the rapidly sedimenting material...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) {{preparations}} from Haemophilus influenzae Rd strains carrying a chromosomally integrated, conjugative, antibiotic resistance transfer (<b>R)</b> <b>plasmid</b> {{were exposed to}} ultraviolet radiation and then assayed for antibiotic resistance transfer on sensitive wild-type Rd competent suspensions and on similar suspensions of a uvr- 1 mutant unable to excise pyrimidine dimers. No host cell reactivation of resistance transfer (DNA repair) was observed. Parallel experiments with ethanol-precipitated, heated, free <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA preparations gave much higher survival when assayed on the wild-type strain compared to the survival on the uvr- 1 strain. These observations indicate that additive genetic transformation (in this case, {{the addition of the}} integrated <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> to the recipient genome) involves single-strand insertion...|$|E
40|$|Ten penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains {{isolated}} from 2000 to 2008 {{were characterized by}} multilocus sequence typing, multiantigen sequence typing, and plasmid typing. Sequence analysis showed that 8 strains contained a TEM- 1 β-lactamase gene. However, two other genetically distinct PPNG strains, isolated in 2004 and 2008, each contained a TEM- 135 β-lactamase on different plasmids, a Toronto/Rio type <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> and an Asia type <b>R</b> <b>plasmid,</b> suggesting independent origins of these PPNG strains...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 475 Salmonella strains {{belonging}} to 5 serovars, isolated from a pig farm {{which had been}} heavily contaminated with Salmonella for the past 2 years were tested for antibiotic susceptibility and detection of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Thirty-three Escherichia coli isolates from the same farm were also examined in a similar way. Out of 475 strains 348 (73. 2 %) were resistant {{to one or more}} antibiotics such as tetracycline (Tc), streptomycin (Sm), sulfadimethoxine (Su), chloramphenicol (Cm) and kanamycin (Km), and 247 (85. 2 %) out of 290 strains belonging to 3 serovars examined harboured conjugative <b>R</b> <b>plasmids.</b> There was no change in the pattern of drug resistance during this survey nor any variation in the pattern of resistance of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids,</b> whatever the serovar. The antibiogram pattern Tc Sm Su, mainly S. typhimurium, was common among Salmonella strains. Among the transferred resistance patterns, the thermosensitive <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> conferring the Tc marker detected in this study were Fi-, and belonged to incompatibility group H 1, whereas the <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> conferring Sm Su resistances which coexisted in the same host were Fi+, and compatible with the reference <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> tested. The I alpha plasmid conferring Cm resistance alone was isolated from S. anatum and the FII plasmid conferring Sm Km resistances was also isolated from S. typhimurium. In contrast, the 33 E. coli strains examined were resistant to three or five antibiotics and most of the resistance markers were located on conjugative <b>R</b> <b>plasmids.</b> I alpha plasmids conferring Cm resistance alone or FII plasmids conferring Cm or Km markers were common in the E. coli strains. H 1 and H 2 plasmids conferring multiple resistance markers were also found in them. The genetic properties of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> derived from Salmonella or E. coli strains are compared, and the potential spread of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> between strains of Salmonella and E. coli is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Plasmids {{harboring}} multiple antimicrobial-resistance determinants (<b>R</b> <b>plasmids)</b> {{were transferred}} in simulated natural microenvironments from various bacterial pathogens of human, animal, or fish origin to susceptible strains isolated {{from a different}} ecological niche. <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> in a strain of the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae O 1 E 1 Tor and a bovine Escherichia coli strain were conjugated to a susceptible strain of the fish pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in marine water. Conjugations of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> between a resistant bovine pathogenic E. coli strain and a susceptible E. coli strain of human origin were performed on a hand towel contaminated with milk from a cow with mastitis. A similar conjugation event between a resistant porcine pathogenic E. coli strain of human origin was studied in minced meat on a cutting board. Conjugation of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> between a resistant strain of the fish pathogenic bacterium A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and a susceptible E. coli strain of human origin was performed in raw salmon on a cutting board. <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> in a strain of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and a human pathogenic E. coli strain were conjugated to a susceptible porcine E. coli strain in porcine feces. Transfer of the different <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> was confirmed by plasmid profile analyses and determination of the resistance pattern of the transconjugants. The different <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> were transferred equally well under simulated natural conditions and under controlled laboratory conditions, with median conjugation frequencies ranging from 3 x 10 (- 6) to 8 x 10 (- 3). The present study demonstrates that conjugation and transfer of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> is a phenomenon that belongs {{to the environment and}} can occur between bacterial strains of human, animal, and fish origins that are unrelated either evolutionarily or ecologically {{even in the absence of}} antibiotics. Consequently, the contamination of the environment with bacterial pathogens resistant to antimicrobial agents is a real threat not only as a source of disease but also as a source from which <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> can easily spread to other pathogens of diverse origins...|$|R
40|$|The Haemophilus influenzae <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> specifying {{resistance}} against one, two, or three antibiotics which {{have emerged in}} different parts of the world were shown to have closely related but not identical plasmid cores. The gene for ampicillin resistance in the H. influenzae plasmid pKRE 5367 is part of a transposon similar to Tn 3, which was transposed from pKRE 5367 onto RSF 1010 in Escherichia coli. An indigenous H. influenzae plasmid (pW 266) was isolated. Its properties correspond to those of the H. influenzae <b>R</b> <b>plasmids,</b> except for the presence of a drug resistance transposon. The in vitro-generated H. influenzae <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> carrying an ampicillin resistance transposon, a tetracycline resistance transposon, and a transposon for combined tetracycline-chloramphenicol resistance resembled the natural isolates. The findings support the hypothesis that the <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> of H. influenzae are of multiclonal evolutionary origin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe minimum {{antibiotic}} concentrations {{for selecting}} an <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> in vivo were determined in germfree mice colonized by two isogenic strains of Escherichia coli, {{one of which}} carried an <b>R</b> <b>plasmid.</b> Seventy groups of three gnotobiotic mice were given low doses of ampicillin, colistin, flumequin, gentamicin, tetracycline, or streptomycin via drinking water for 2 weeks. The equilibrium between susceptible and resistant populations of bacteria was monitored daily in feces and {{compared with that of}} control mice given pure water. This model yielded reproducible data, and dose and response were strongly correlated. The minimum selecting doses ranged from 0. 9 to 12. 8 micrograms/ml of water, depending on the antibiotic and the <b>R</b> <b>plasmid.</b> The use of mathematical models and complementary in vitro experiments accounted for the effect of the low antibiotic levels...|$|E
40|$|A mutant of the <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> R 1 which synthesizes a {{beta-lactamase}} with altered kinetic characteristics was isolated.

Agents Chemother. 12 : 368 [...] 372, 1977). The model also accounts for the high level of penicillin resistance specified by the <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> RP 1...|$|E
40|$|A temperature-sensitive fi− <b>R</b> <b>plasmid,</b> pJY 1, which confers {{resistance}} to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfonamide, {{was found in}} a drug-resistant strain of Vibrio cholerae (biotype El Tor) isolated in the Philippines in 1973. The <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> is temperature sensitive for transferability but not for stability in the hosts. pJY 1 is stably maintained either in V. cholerae or in Escherichia coli at a range of culture temperatures from 27 to 42 °C. Compatibility tests with reference R plasmids revealed that pJY 1 belongs to the J group. Growth of V. cholerae carrying pJY 1 is poor on TCBS (thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose) selective plates when the microbe is subcultured in nutrient broth at temperatures higher than 37 °C...|$|E
40|$|<b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> {{identified}} in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in our laboratories were classified by their incompatibility characters by using intraspecies conjugation in P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Two {{clinical}} isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one a pyocin type 5 strain from Atlanta, could transfer gentamicin {{resistance by}} conjugation. Donor and recipient strains inactivated gentamicin by acetylation. The <b>R</b> <b>plasmids,</b> pMG 1 and pMG 2, also determined resistance to sisomicin, another substrate of gentamicin acetyltransferase I, sulfonamides, and streptomycin, but not resistance to kanamycin, neomycin, tobramycin, butirosin, or BB-K 8. They were transmissible to many strains of P. aeruginosa, including a Rec− strain, {{but not to}} Escherichia coli or other enterobacteriaceae. These <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> were compatible with <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> transmissible to P. aeruginosa from E. coli, including members of C, N, P, and W incompatibility groups. From a strain carrying pMG 1 and a compatible plasmid, pMG 1 was transferred independently but transfer of the second plasmid often resulted in cotransfer of pMG 1. In contrast, pMG 1 and pMG 2 were incompatible with pseudomonas <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> <b>R</b> 931 and R 3108, and with R 931 they readily formed recombinant plasmids. The four plasmids in this incompatibility group determine additional biological properties, including resistance to inorganic and organic mercury compounds, to ultraviolet light, and to certain deoxyribonucleic acid phages. pMG 1 and pMG 2 also phenotypically inhibited pyocin production. Consequently such <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> alter the phage and pyocin types of their host strains...|$|R
40|$|A {{conjugation}} system initially {{discovered in}} beta-lactamase-producing gonococci mobilized small non-selftransmissible <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> encoding beta-lactamase (penicillinase) production into other gonococci, Neisseria, and Escherichia coli. This conjugation system was mediated by a separate selftransmissible plasmid of 23. 9 X 10 (6) daltons, pFA 2. Conjugative plasmids capable of mobilizing <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> {{were also found}} in nearly 8 % of the non-penicillinase-producing gonococci. These were similar to pFA 2 in size, buoyant density, and restriction endonuclease digest patterns but were less efficient than pFA 2 in mobilization of the penicillinase plasmid pFA 3. The presence of conjugative plasmids in gonococci isolated before the appearance of penicillinase-producing strains indicates that a conjugation system for plasmid transfer predated the appearance of <b>R</b> <b>plasmids</b> in gonococci...|$|R
40|$|Gentamicin {{resistance}} in Klebsiella pneumoniae {{involved in an}} outbreak at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital was due to a transmissible <b>R</b> <b>plasmid.</b> In addition to gentamicin, this plasmid conferred resistance to tobramycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and sulfathiazole. R plasmids which transferred this complex antibiogram were identified in several clinical isolates, including four different serotypes of K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus morganii. The covalently closed circular form of all R plasmids isolated had a sedimentation coefficient of 76 S to 77 S, corresponding to a molecular weight of 58 × 106. The possibility that a single <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> {{was responsible for the}} dissemination of multiple drug resistance among all of these different clinical strains was examined by characterizing the plasmids by using EcoRI restriction endonuclease. The same 15 fragments were obtained from each of the 10 plasmids analyzed. Their molecular weights ranged from 4 × 105 to 11 × 106. Thus, we conclude that each of the 10 plasmids present in the various clinical strains isolated from the hospital over a 7 -month period originated from a common source and that <b>R</b> <b>plasmid</b> transfer was important in their spread...|$|E

The enzymes from bacterial and mammalian sources used only beta-NADPH and beta-NADH. THe Km value for alpha-NADPH (16 microM) was 4 -fold greater than that for beta-NADPH (4 microM), while the maximal velocity of the alpha-NADPH-catalyzed reaction was 70 % of that seen with the beta-NADPH. beta-NADP+ and alpha-NADP+ were competitive inhibitors of the R 67 enzyme. Pyridine nucleotide analogues such as deamino- and acetyl-NADPH were used readily by bacterial, plasmid, and mammalian enzymes, whereas thio-NADPH was used only by the plasmid enzyme.
