30|$|The above {{results suggest}} a {{significant}} influence of GBHs on the uptake of some micronutrients, their root-to-shoot translocation and, {{in the case}} of the study by Cakmak et al. [82], on their accumulation in mature GS soybeans. Importantly, these findings demonstrate the potential for nutritional disruption of this kind to occur following exposure of GS plants to a small fraction of the recommended herbicidal dosage, such as may occur by accident due to spray drift or <b>root</b> contact with <b>herbicide</b> residues in soil. Mechanisms underlying the observed antagonism between GBHs and crop nutrition were not conclusively identified by these studies. It has been suggested, however, that the observed declines in uptake, as well as in-plant transport of micronutrients, might be related to the ability of glyphosate to form poorly soluble glyphosate–metal chelates within plant tissues and/or within the rhizosphere [82, 83]. Ozturk et al. [84] inferred that the formation of glyphosate–Fe complexes might have restricted the availability of Fe(III), crucial for the maintenance of Fe-reductase enzyme activity, in plant cells.|$|R
40|$|Background: Herbicide {{resistance}} in agrestal weeds {{is a global}} problem threatening food security. Non-target-site resistance (NTSR) endowed by mechanisms neutralising the herbicide or compensating for its action is considered the most agronomically noxious type of resistance. Contrary to target-site resistance, NTSR mechanisms are far from being fully elucidated. A part of weed response to herbicide stress, NTSR {{is considered to be}} largely driven by gene regulation. Our purpose was to establish a transcriptome resource allowing investigation of the transcriptomic bases of NTSR in the major grass weed Alopecurus myosuroides L. (Poaceae) for which almost no genomic or transcriptomic data was available. Results: RNA-Seq was performed from plants in one F 2 population that were sensitive or expressing NTSR to herbicides inhibiting acetolactate-synthase. Cloned plants were sampled over seven time-points ranging from before until 73 h after herbicide application. Assembly of over 159 M high-quality Illumina reads generated a transcriptomic resource (ALOMYbase) containing 65, 558 potentially active contigs (N 50 = 1240 nucleotides) predicted to encode 32, 138 peptides with 74 % GO annotation, of which 2017 were assigned to protein families presumably involved in NTSR. Comparison with the fully sequenced grass genomes indicated good coverage and correct representation of A. myosuroides transcriptome in ALOMYbase. The part of the herbicide transcriptomic response common to the resistant and the sensitive plants was consistent with the expected effects of acetolactate-synthase inhibition, with striking similarities observed with published Arabidopsis thaliana data. A. myosuroides plants with NTSR were first affected by herbicide action like sensitive plants, but ultimately overcame it. Analysis of differences in transcriptomic herbicide response between resistant and sensitive plants did not allow identification of processes directly explaining NTSR. Five contigs associated to NTSR in the F 2 population studied were tentatively identified. They were predicted to encode three cytochromes P 450 (CYP 71 A, CYP 71 B and CYP 81 D), one peroxidase and one disease resistance protein. Conclusions: Our data confirmed that gene regulation is at the <b>root</b> of <b>herbicide</b> response and of NTSR. ALOMYbase proved to be a relevant resource to support NTSR transcriptomic studies, and constitutes a valuable tool for future research aiming at elucidating gene regulations involved in NTSR in A. myosuroides...|$|R

Mecoprop ((+) - 2 -(4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy) propanoic acid), difenzoquat (1, 2 - dimethyl- 3, 5 - diphenyl - 1 H- pyrazolium), dinoseb amine (amine salt of 2 -(1 -methylpropy 1) - 4, 6 -dinitrophenol), and diclofopmethyl (methyl ester of (+) - 2 -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy]propanoic acid) sometimes reduced the severity of take-all disease on the seminal and crown <b>roots.</b> The <b>herbicides</b> also reduced the incidence of 'whiteheads' associated with take-all injury. In additional evaluations, mecoprop, difenzoquat, and dinoseb did not affect severity of disease on the roots, but whiteheads again were reduced. Diclofop-methyl applied at 1. 12 kg ai/ha in early January often reduced the severity of take-all disease on seminal and crown roots. Higher rates of this herbicide, however, occasionally increased disease severity. The number of seminal roots produced by plants treated with diclofop-methyl often depended upon both application rate {{and the level of}} take-all stress. Crown root and tiller production were stimulated by diclofop-methyl. Low rates of difenzoquat, dinoseb, and mecoprop often increased tillering as well. The responses of the wheat plant to all four herbicides generally were greatest in plots with take-all disease. Fresh weights of individual tillers generally were reduced in response to herbicide application. Stimulations of tillering in diseased plots treated with diclofop-methyl progressively declined when applications were delayed after early January. Grain yields were greater in diseased plots treated with mecoprop, difenzoquat, and dinoseb than in the untreated check in 1982. Grain yield was either reduced or unaffected by diclofopmethyl, regardless of the level of take-all disease present. Herbicides did not affect grain yield in 1983. In vitro growth of three isolates of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici was not inhibited by diclofop-methyl at concentrations below 10,uM. Data suggest that herbicides reduced take-all disease by altering wheat growth, allowing diseased plants to compensate for take-all injury. Susceptibility of root tissues to infection also may have been reduced in some cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mikania micrantha Kunth, {{commonly}} known as bitter vine, American rope, or mile-a-minute, is a rapidly growing vine, native to tropical America. Mikania micrantha is present in 20 Pacific island countries and territories, including Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. A CLIMEX model based on native distribution of M. micrantha suggests {{that most of the}} islands in the Pacific, southern Asia, and parts of southern and central Africa are climatically suitable for M. micrantha, leaving these areas vulnerable to new or further incursions. Its rapid spread is a threat to both natural and agricultural environments, where it kills or reduces growth of preferred species, severely impacting on biodiversity and production. Large numbers of wind-dispersed seeds and ability to propagate vegetatively from stem fragments facilitate rapid invasion. Management of M. micrantha is difficult. Several postemergence herbicides exhibit some efficacy, but manual control via hand pulling and slashing is more commonly practiced. However, slashing may result in increased growth from fragments, and plants may regenerate from <b>roots</b> after <b>herbicide</b> application. Cultural techniques such as fallowing or burning may also help limit spread. Competitors that produce ample vegetation such as sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas [L. ] Lam.) may be effective for suppression in some situations. Various studies have shown that Mikania micrantha exhibits some genetic diversity across biotypes encountered in southern Asia. Although little is currently known about its population genetics across the South Pacific, more information will undoubtedly facilitate potential for future biological control. A rust pathogen, Puccinia spegazzinii, introduced from South America was established in Taiwan in 2008, in Papua New Guinea and Fiji in 2009, and in Vanuatu in 2012 for biological control. The dodder Cuscuta campestris Yuncker has also shown some efficacy against M. micrantha, but its status as a known pest limits its use as a biological control agent. Recent research into the mikania wilt virus as a biocontrol agent is in its infancy, and {{it is too early to}} recommend it to assist with the management of M. micrantha. Given the difficulty of controlling M. micrantha once established and the early stages of research into biological control, high priority must be given to preventing colonization of Pacific islands where M. micrantha is not yet present, through early detection and rapid response to new incursions...|$|R
40|$|The soil carbon (C) pool {{is one of}} {{the largest}} pools of C in the {{terrestrial}} environment. Soil management strategies to increase soil C are of interest globally to reduce atmospheric CO₂ concentrations which are contributing to climate change. Changes in land use and land management can result in gains, or losses of soil C, and consequently change in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Increasing the C inputs to soil by either increasing plant root mass has been suggested as one method to increase soil C. In New Zealand, pastoral agriculture is dominated by the use of perennial ryegrass and white clover pastures which are typically shallow rooting species. The use of more diverse pastures including additional species such as lucerne, chicory and plantain, may increase root mass or rooting depth. However, there is limited data on root mass and C inputs from roots to soil under ryegrass-clover pasture systems and no data on more diverse pasture swards in New Zealand pasture systems. The objective of this research was to investigate whether more diverse pasture swards had greater root mass and C inputs to soil compared to ryegrassclover and whether diverse pastures offered scope to increase soil C. Root mass was measured under a moderately diverse and a ryegrass-clover pasture in an existing plant diversity trial at a research dairy farm (Scott Farm, DairyNZ) containing 6 replicate paddocks of each pasture type. Soil cores were collected seasonally over one year to 300 mm depth and divided into three 100 mm depth sections (0 – 100, 100 – 200, 200 – 300 mm) and root mass measured after soil was washed off. There was greater root mass (0 – 300 mm) under the moderately diverse pasture (5320 - 9350 kg ha⁻¹) compared to the ryegrass-clover pasture (3810 - 5700 kg ha⁻¹) for all seasons. Additionally, there was greater root mass lower in the soil profile (100 – 200, 200 – 300 mm) in the moderately diverse pasture. The increased root mass in the moderately diverse pasture resulted in an estimated additional C input to soil of about 1203 kg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (0 – 300 mm) but this estimate did not include contributions from root exudates. Root trait measurements of individual plant species also demonstrated a greater diversity of root traits (specific root length, surface area, and diameter) in the moderately diverse pasture, which may be important for the C input and C stabilisation processes in soil. Root turnover and C input to soil was measured on three replicate paddocks each of moderately diverse and ryegrass-clover pastures, also at Scott Farm. An isotope (¹³CO₂) pulse labelling method was used whereby clear chambers (1 m²) were placed over pasture and ¹³CO₂ taken up following photosynthesis. Labelling was carried out once weekly for a period of five weeks, giving a total of 5 labelling events. Soil cores were collected at regular intervals following isotope labelling for up to 138 days and δ 13 C measured in the roots (0 – 100, 100 – 200 mm depth) and soil (0 – 100 mm depth) to calculate root turnover and C input. There was no difference in root turnover rates between the moderately diverse (298 days) and ryegrass-clover (260 days) pastures, with a combined root turnover rate of 276 days for both pastures. However, large variability in data meant that the ability to detect differences between pasture swards was low. The average C input to soil for both pastures was 58 kg C ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ over an 88 day period which was greater than other reported studies in New Zealand. A likely cause of this high C input from roots to soil was the severe drought conditions during the study that may have increased root death and C inputs from roots to soil. While previous work determined similar root turnover and C inputs under both conventional and moderately diverse pastures, a final experiment focussed on whether pasture renewal of a ryegrass-clover pasture could result in increased root turnover, and therefore, greater C input to soil. Root turnover and C input to soil under ryegrass-clover pasture with and without pasture renewal was measured using an isotope pulse labelling method. Pastures (paired plots in 3 replicate paddocks) were labelled with ¹³CO₂ daily for five days within clear chambers (1 m²) before one replicate in each pair was sprayed with herbicide and seed direct drilled. Soil cores were collected (0 – 100, 100 – 200 mm depths) at regular intervals over a 89 day period following isotope labelling and root turnover and C input measured by following the decline in ¹³C in extracted <b>roots.</b> Following <b>herbicide</b> application, there was an initial rapid increase in root turnover (17 days) followed by a more similar turnover (524 days) compared to the unsprayed treatment (585 days). The increased root turnover following the use of herbicide resulted in increased C input to the soil in the sprayed treatment (3238 kg C ha⁻¹) compared to the unsprayed ryegrass-clover treatment (1726 kg C ha⁻¹). This suggested that during pasture renewal there is a large input of C. However, the proportion of this C that is stabilised in soil requires further investigation. This research demonstrated there is potential to increase soil C by using more diverse pastures through increased root mass and rooting depth. This work also provided the first measurements of root mass and C input to soil under moderately diverse pastures in New Zealand and adds to the limited information on the root mass, root turnover and C input under ryegrass-clover pasture systems. Furthermore, this work provided the first measurements of root turnover and C input to soil during a pasture renewal event involving herbicide. The data from this research will contribute better information for use in modelling and increase the knowledge and understanding of soil C under grazed pasture systems in New Zealand. Further research on investigating the root dynamics under more diverse pastures with respect to root traits such as diameter, surface area and specific root length within these pastures and how these traits influence the root turnover and C input to soil would be beneficial. Improving the understanding on the quantity of C that is stabilised and the C stabilisation processes in these pasture systems is also important in order to achieve meaningful reductions in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Previous {{research}} has indicated several soil-applied herbicides are more effective by exposure to emerging shoots than from root uptake. Studies were conducted in the greenhouse and growth chamber to investigate effects of herbicide placement in soil on toxicity to emerging seedlings. In these studies, an inch of treated soil was placed above the seed, below the seed, or both {{above and below the}} seed. The seed was placed {{in the middle of a}} 1 -inch layer of untreated soil. Each soil layer was brought to field capacity separately and the entire container was covered with a plastic bag. The use of this plastic bag avoided the need for irrigation and subsequent herbicide movement. By this method, numerous herbicides were active on oats (Avena sativa) primarily through shoot exposure, with root exposure having little or no effect on foliage growth. These herbicides included EPTC (ethyl N, N-dipropylthiocarbamate), dichlobenil (2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile), trifluralin (α, α, α-trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine), nitralin (2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl- 4 -[methylsulphonyl] aniline), propachlor (2 -chloro-N-iso-propylacetanilide), DCPA (dimethyl 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorotereph-thalate), and CDEC (2 -chloroallyl diethyl dithiocarbamate). Sindone (isomers of 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4, 6 -diisopropylindanyl ethyl ketone) was more effective on sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) and annual rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum) through shoot exposure than <b>root</b> exposure. Some <b>herbicides</b> are more effective on oats through root exposure. These included bromacil (5 -bromo- 3 -sec-butyl- 6 -methyluracil), R 11913,¹ Nia 11092 (1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(3 -[N-tert-butylcarbamyloxy] phenyl) urea), pyrazon (5 -amino- 4 -chloro- 2 -phenyl- 3 [2 H]-pyridazinone), diuron (3 -[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethylurea), and atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropyl-amino-s-triazine). Dicamba (2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid) and 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) were more effective on cucumber through root exposure than through shoot exposure. Some herbicides appear to be taken up differently by different plant species. R 11913 was more effective through shoot exposure on sugar beets and more effective through root exposure on oats. Atrazine proved more effective on oats through root exposure; however, with green foxtail (Setaria viridis) and annual ryegrass, shoot exposure was more important when an untreated buffer layer was present between the seed and the treated zone. The possibility existed that a reduction in transpiration, caused by the plastic bag could affect the mode of uptake. In studies without the use of the plastic bag, atrazine was still more effective on oats through root exposure and more effective on green foxtail through shoot exposure. Irrigation in this study was accomplished through straws extended into each layer to minimize herbicide movement. We noticed that green foxtail produced secondary roots as early as five days after planting or two days after emergence. This indicated that these newly-formed secondary roots, as well as the emerging shoot, could absorb atrazine placed in the shoot region. When the buffer layer was removed and atrazine-treated soil was placed adjacent to the seed, placement immediately below the seed showed the greatest toxicity to both oats and green foxtail. This indicates the variation in sensitivity of plants by exposure to different parts of the seedling. Studies were conducted on varying placement positions of the herbicide as well as concentrations. From these studies, proximity to the seed was a major factor in increasing toxicity to oat seedlings by atrazine and EPTC, and to annual ryegrass seedlings by diuron. Atrazine was also more effective to green foxtail and annual ryegrass seedlings with increased proximity to the seed. A narrow concentrated layer was more effective than a wider dilute layer with diuron, atrazine, and EPTC when placed either above or below the seed. With atrazine and diuron, placement of the dilute wider layer completely around the seed was just as effective as the concentrated layer adjacent to the seed. With EPTC, a concentrated layer adjacent to the seed was more effective than a dilute layer completely around the seed. The effects of a constant temperature regime (24 C) was compared with a temperature regime with a low night temperature (27 C/ 13 C) in relation to uptake of EPTC, expressed by toxic action on oats. The temperature regime with a low night temperature caused a slight increase in toxicity to oats through shoot exposure, as well as through root exposure. However, the increase in uptake of EPTC through root exposure was considerably greater than through shoot exposure. ¹No chemical name available, an experimental herbicide of Stauffer Chemical Company...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this study, two topics causing {{major public}} concern related to {{transgenic}} plants were investigated: The {{possibility of a}} horizontal gene transfer from plant to bacteria {{and the impact of}} transgenic plants after <b>herbicide</b> treatment on <b>root</b> associated bacteria. The transgenic plant chosen for this study was Roundup Ready® (RR) soybean, which is tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate and is the most commonly used genetically modified crop worldwide. Glyphosate, the active ingredient of Roundup Ready®, inhibits the EPSPS enzyme (5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase). EPSPS is an enzyme involved in the shikimic acid pathway leading to the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and its inhibition leads to growth reduction of plants and microorganisms. RR crops are glyphosate tolerant due to the introduction of the CP 4 -EPSPS gene coding for a glyphosate insensitive EPSPS enzyme. The transgenic construct is under expression of a CaMV 35 S promoter a nos transcriptional termination element from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Horizontal gene transfer experiments with the EPSPS gene of the RR soybean were performed under controlled laboratory conditions and were targeted to the nitrogen fixing symbiont of soybean Bradyrhizobium japonicum. This bacterium comprises the requirements of a possible receptor for the glyphosate resistance trait, as it is sensitive to the herbicide and thus the acquirement of glyphosate resistance would signify a positive adaptation to glyphosate accumulated in the <b>roots</b> after <b>herbicide</b> application. Two key conditions for gene transfer from the CP 4 -EPSPS gene from the RR soybean to B. japonicum were evaluated in this study: The required specific conditions for B. japonicum to undergo natural transformation and the expression of the CP 4 -EPSPS gene in B. japonicum. For that purpose, the CP 4 -EPSPS gene was cloned into a B. japonicum chromosomal integration vector and was transferred by biparental mating into the B. japonicum genome. Subsequently, the expression of the CP 4 -EPSPS gene in B. japonicum was tested under increasing glyphosate selection pressure. Results of these experiments indicated that B. japonicum is not naturally transformable under any conditions known from the more than 40 so far reported naturally transformable bacteria. Furthermore, the CP 4 -EPSPS genetic construct, as contained in RR soybean, has been shown in this study to be not active in B. japonicum. Consequently, if there would be a gene transfer of the plant CP 4 -EPSPS to B. japonicum, this genetic construct does not confer glyphosate resistance to B. japonicum and does not constitute any adaptive advantage to the bacterium under glyphosate selection pressure. As the genetic trait of glyphosate resistance has been found in several bacteria, it would be more probable that the common mating exchange between bacterial groups could disperse the glyphosate resistance within an environment. Moreover, in the specific case of B. japonicum, a high spontaneous mutation rate for glyphosate resistance was observed, suggesting that B. japonicum can also adapt to the glyphosate selection pressure by mutation under natural conditions. The impact of transgenic plants with their respective <b>herbicide</b> treatments on <b>root</b> associated bacteria was investigated in a greenhouse experiment. The composition and diversity of bacterial communities of RR soybean rhizospheres were analyzed and compared between glyphosate-treated and untreated plants. Samples from five harvests with two glyphosate applications were analysed by 16 S rRNA gene T-RFLP analysis complemented with the evaluation of three clone libraries. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data was used to visualize changes in the microbial populations in response to glyphosate applications and in order to find groups of organisms responsible for the observed community shifts. A comparison of the rhizosphere communities revealed that a Burkholderia related group was significantly inhibited by glyphosate application, while the abundance of a group of Gemmatimonadetes related sequences increased significantly after the herbicide treatment. The significant increment of Gemmatimonadetes abundance after glyphosate application could indicate that these organisms are able to metabolize the herbicide. Shannon diversity indices were calculated based on the T-RFLP results with the aim to compare bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of glyphosate-treated and non treated RR soybeans. Interestingly, the bacterial community associated to RR soybean roots after glyphosate application not only demonstrated effective resilience after the disturbance but in addition the bacterial diversity also increased in comparison to the untreated control samples. It is possible, that in an environment with organisms which are able to metabolize glyphosate, the key for enhancing diversity could be the succession of metabolites, which can be further utilized by a diverse range of bacteria. Zusammenfassung In dieser Arbeit wurden zwei Fragestellungen bezüglich transgener Pflanzen, die von erheblichem öffentlichen Interesse sind, bearbeitet: Die Möglichkeit eines Gentransfers von diesen Pflanzen zu Bodenbakterien, sowie der Einfluss transgener Pflanzen in Kombination mit Herbizidapplikationen auf die bakterielle Gemeinschaft der Rhizosphäre. Als Versuchspflanze wurde eine transgene Roundup Ready® (RR) Sojabohne verwendet, welche tolerant gegenüber dem Herbizid Glyphosat ist. Diese Pflanze ist die weltweit am häufigsten angebaute genetisch veränderte Pflanze. Glyphosat, der aktive Wirkstoff von Roundup Ready®, inhibiert das Enzym EPSPS (5 -Enolpyruvylshikimat- 3 -phosphate Synthase). EPSPS ist ein Enzym des Shikimatweges, der für die Bildung aromatischer Aminosäuren verantwortlich ist. Die Inhibierung dieses Enzyms führt zu einer Verringerung des Wachstums von Pflanzen und Mikroorganismen. Durch die Anwesenheit eines Glyphosate-toleranten EPSPS-Enzymes sind RR-Pflanzen gegenüber Glyphosat tolerant. RR Pflanzenlinien beinhalten das CP 4 -EPSPS-Gen, welches ursprünglich aus Agrobacterium sp. CP 4 stammt, jedoch den CaMV 35 S Promotor sowie den Nos Terminator enthält. Experimente über die Möglichkeit eines horizontalen Gentransfers des EPSPS Gens von RR Soja wurden unter kontrollierten Laborbedingungen durchgeführt. Das stickstofffixierende, symbiontische Bakterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, erfüllt wichtige Voraussetzungen eines möglichen Empfängers der Glyphosatresistenz, da es sensitiv gegenüber dem Herbizid ist und somit die Erlangung einer Glyphosatresistenz eine positive Anpassung an erhöhte toxische Mengen des Wirkstoffes in den Wurzeln nach Herbizidapplikation darstellt. Zwei wichtige Bedingungen für den Gentransfer des CP 4 -EPSPS Gens von RR Soja zu B. japonicum wurden in dieser Arbeit überprüft: Die von B. japonicum benötigten spezifischen Bedingungen für die Erlangung einer natürlichen Transformierbarkeit und die Expression des CP 4 -EPSPS Gens in B. japonicum. Ergebnisse dieser Experimente belegen, dass unter den bekannten Bedingungen für natürliche Transformation B. japonicum nicht transformierbar ist. Es ist jedoch nicht auszuschließen, dass B. japonicum unter bisher unbekannten Bedingungen mit CP 4 -EPSPS transformiert werden könnte. Des Weiteren wurde untersucht, ob ein CP 4 -EPSPS Gen integriert in das Genom von B. japonicum von diesem Bakterium exprimiert wird und dadurch zu einer Glyphosattoleranz führen kann. Für diesen Zweck wurde CP 4 -EPSPS in einen chromosomalen Integrationsvektor für B. japonicum kloniert und durch biparental mating in das B. japonicum Genom transferiert. Anschließend wurde die Expression des Gens in B. japonicum unter ansteigendem Selektionsdruck durch Glyphosat getestet. Es konnte jedoch keine erhöhte Glyphosate Resistenz bei Anwesenheit dieses Genkonstruktes aus RR Soja in B. japonicum festgestellt werden. Folglich würde ein möglicher Gentransfer des pflanzlichen CP 4 -EPSPS zu B. japonicum zu keiner Glyphosatresistenz führen und somit keinen Anpassungsvorteil für das Bakterium unter Glyphosatselektionsdruck darstellen. Eine Übertragung der genetischen Eigenschaft der Glyphosatresistenz, welche in mehreren Bakterien gefunden wurde, würde sich daher wahrscheinlich eher durch herkömmliches Maiting zwischen den Bakteriengruppen in der Umwelt verbreiten, als durch eine Übertragung von Pflanze zu Bakterium. Die Auswirkung der Anpflanzung von RR Soja mit Glyphosatbehandlung auf die wurzelassoziierten Bakterien wurde in einem Gewächshausversuch untersucht. Die Zusammensetzung und Diversität der bakteriellen Gemeinschaft der Rhizosphäre von RR Soja wurde analysiert und zwischen Glyphosat behandelten und unbehandelten Pflanzen verglichen. Proben von fünf Zeitpunkten und zwei Glyphosatapplikationen wurden mittels 16 S rRNA Gen T-RFLP Methode analysiert und ergänzt durch die Erstellung und Auswertung dreier Klonbanken. Multivariate statistische Datenanalysen wurden verwendet, um Veränderungen der bakteriellen Populationen durch die Glyphosatbehandlung zu visualisieren und um Indikatorgruppen von Organismen zu identifizieren, die von diesen Veränderungen betroffen sind. Die Analysen zeigten, dass eine Burkholderia-ähnliche Gruppe signifikant durch Glyphosatapplikation inhibiert wurde, während die Häufigkeit Gemmatimonadetes verwandter Sequenzen signifikant nach Herbizidanwendung anstieg. Der signifikante Anstieg dieser Gruppe könnte andeuten, dass diese Bakterien fähig sind das Herbizid zu metabolisieren. Shannon Diversitätsindizes wurden anhand der T-RFLP Profile berechnet, mit dem Ziel, die Diversität der bakteriellen Rhizosphärengemeinschaften zwischen Glyphosat behandelten und unbehandelten RR Sojabohnen zu vergleichen. Interessanterweise zeigte die bakterielle Gemeinschaft der RR Sojarhizosphäre nach Glyphosatapplikation nicht nur eine effektive Resilienz nach der Störung, sondern es konnte sogar eine Erhöhung der Diversität im Vergleich zu unbehandelten Proben festgestellt werden. Folglich ist es möglich, dass diverse Bakterien, die fähig sind über eine Suksession von Metaboliten des Glyphosates abzubauen, zur Erhöhung der Diversität der bakteriellen Gemeinschaft beitragen...|$|R
