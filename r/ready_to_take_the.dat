5|$|The Lincoln-Liberty Building, {{completed}} in 1932, {{was intended to}} partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and the ringing of the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building {{was a sign of}} the store's faith that the economy would improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2,000,000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store {{of its kind in the}} world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street.|$|E
25|$|Under Dostum's 5 year rule {{from the}} early 1990s to early 1997, the city was {{relatively}} peaceful. The {{rest of the nation}} disintegrated and was slowly taken over by the Taliban forces, Dostum strengthened political ties with the newly independent Uzbekistan as well as Turkey. He printed his own currency and established his own airline. This peace was shattered in May 1997, when he was betrayed by one of his generals, warlord Abdul Malik Pahlawan, forcing him to flee from Mazar-i-Sharif as the Taliban were getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
25|$|As the Eighth Army was not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive, Ritchie {{planned to}} fight a {{defensive}} battle on the Gazala line. Auchinleck's appreciation of the situation to Ritchie in mid-May anticipated either a frontal attack in {{the centre of the}} Gazala line followed by an advance on Tobruk or a flanking move to the south, looping around the Gazala line towards Tobruk. Auchinleck saw the former as more likely (with a feint on the flank to draw away the Eighth Army tanks) while Ritchie favoured the latter. Auchinleck suggested that British armour be concentrated near El Adem, where it would be well placed to meet either threat.|$|E

25|$|Viki {{surprisingly}} {{manages to}} pass her theater audition, though it's obvious {{the reason for}} the sudden success is jury member Baron being taken with her attractive looks. Though she's ecstatic, Filip is not thrilled with the development and is especially unhappy about the celebrated theater actor and multiple divorcee Baron now wooing his girlfriend, with Viki even welcoming the aging lothario's smooth advances. Frustrated, Filip even contacts Ema hoping to receive some help getting through to Viki whose head is high in the clouds. For the moment at least, Giga and Ema manage to impart some rationality to their daughter, and she seems <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> sensible option and make nice with Filip. In parallel, in order to sweeten his case with Viki, Baron arranges for her, a complete novice, to get the demanding role of Juliet in the theater's latest production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, while Baron plays Romeo. He tells her the big news by showing up unannounced at the apartment just as she's getting ready to go out to meet Filip for a date. The news sends her on cloud nine and she immediately puts Filip and the marriage on the back-burner while Filip's frustration grows. Soon, Baron manages to bed Viki who thus becomes his latest conquest. Though he's not aware of the gory details yet, Filip has seen enough to send him over the edge and, overcome with jealousy, he constantly interrupts their rehearsals. It all culminates in an act of madness as he breaks into Baron's apartment with a gun, threatening to kill him, but the verbose actor talks him out of it using a combination of pointed eloquence and dramatic flair.|$|E
500|$|Koufax was {{the final}} player chosen in the inaugural Israel Baseball League draft in April 2007. Koufax, 71, was picked by the Modi'in Miracle. [...] "His {{selection}} {{is a tribute to}} the esteem with which he is held by everyone associated with this league", said Art Shamsky, who managed the Miracle. [...] "It's been 41 years between starts for him. If he's rested and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> mound again, we want him on our team." [...] Koufax declined to join the Miracle.|$|E
500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E

500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1988–89 season, Frank Layden {{stepped down}} as {{head coach of the}} Jazz after the first 17 games, and was {{replaced}} by Jerry Sloan. The Jazz won 51 games and the Midwest Division championship as they grew better overall. [...] Malone and Stockton, as well as Mark Eaton, were the leaders of the team and also All-Star selections. Eaton won Defensive Player of the Year for the second time, and it appeared the Jazz were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> next step toward contending for an NBA title, after having pushed the Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference semifinals the previous season.

Two hours after leaving Ghoraniyeh, casualties reached the main dressing station, in motor ambulance wagons supplied by the 1st (British) Mounted Division and the XX Corps. Here, three operating teams performed surgery, including 78 major operations, before the wounded were sent on to the casualty clearing station at Jerusalem. [...] The trip from the Corps' main dressing station to Jerusalem took seven hours in 28 heavy and 10 Ford motor ambulance wagons. Army Service Corps motor lorries returning to Jerusalem were also employed.|$|E
2500|$|Montgomery's {{answer was}} {{to point out}} that the Eighth Army was in a process of reformation with the arrival of new, untrained units and was, as a result, not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive.

Montgomery did not want his tanks being wasted on futile attacks against Rommel's anti-tank screen, something that they had frequently done in the past, in the process handing the initiative to the Axis forces. Indeed, as Rommel complained to Kesselring, [...] "The swine isn't attacking!" [...] Montgomery's refusal to exploit his victory allowed him to preserve his forces and accumulate supplies for the decisive offensive in October that came to be known as the Second Battle of El Alamein.|$|E

Later on a party in Stuff Redoubt bombed forward on the right flank, captured the north side of Stuff Redoubt and gained ground further on but this was later abandoned, when the party ran out of ammunition during German counter-attacks. The 33rd Brigade sent patrols forward towards Stuff Trench, which was found to be full of German troops. IR 153 recorded later, that isolated troops were pushed back to Stuff Trench.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> city on {{the morning}} of May 26th, a white flag {{appeared}} on the city walls at 10:00am.

When a Mandarin explained that the Chinese wanted peace, Gough notes in his official report: [...] "I had it explained that, as General commanding the British, I would treat with none but the General commanding the Chinese troops, that we came before Canton much against the wishes of the British nation, but that repeated insults and breaches of faith had compelled us to make the present movement, and that I would cease from hostilities for two hours to enable their General to meet me and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse."

2500|$|The {{course of}} {{instruction}} was individually tailored in three phases.

After four to five hours of this phase, the student was handed off to civilian instructor [...] in a Burgess Model H trainer. After his solo, the candidate had a check ride with the Officer in Charge of Training to determine if his instruction was to continue. He then flew solo until he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> test for his Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) pilot's license, a requirement for advancing to the third phase.
