5|$|During the {{subsequent}} exchange of strikes, Silva landed a direct right hook on Jackson's face, stunning Jackson and sending him backpedaling towards the <b>ropes.</b> Silva closed {{the distance and}} secured a Muay Thai clinch. From here, Silva landed approximately 5 knee strikes to Jackson's head, causing him {{to fall into the}} <b>ropes,</b> unconscious and with blood pouring out of his face.

5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} <b>ropes</b> to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the <b>ropes</b> had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last <b>ropes</b> holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag <b>ropes</b> against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the <b>ropes</b> round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby <b>ropes</b> that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the safety, it is important to examine the wire <b>rope</b> of an elevator. We have developed a <b>rope</b> tester that is a kind of sensor to detect damages of the wire <b>rope</b> for an elevator. The <b>rope</b> tester detects the damages by using leakage flux at the damaged point. The damages of the wire <b>rope</b> are detected and to quantitatively be recorded by the <b>rope</b> tester. In case of a former <b>rope</b> are excited the wire <b>rope</b> in direct current, remanence magnetic flux at a wire <b>rope</b> is not small and sometimes causes a misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new <b>rope</b> tester by AC excitation is described. The damage at the surface of the wire <b>rope</b> can be detected with this <b>rope</b> tester. The output voltages at damaged point of the <b>rope</b> are from 2. 0 volts to 5. 5 volts.

5|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the WWE Tag Team Championship between René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki and Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio. The match began with Van Dam and Duprée gaining the advantage. Mysterio was tagged in the match and {{performed}} a diving headbutt, a tornado DDT and a seated senton on Kenzo. Mysterio performed the 619 on Kenzo and attempted the West Coast Pop but Duprée pulled Mysterio off the <b>ropes.</b> Kenzo pinned Mysterio using the <b>ropes</b> to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of <b>ropes</b> or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without <b>ropes,</b> bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag <b>ropes,</b> which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the <b>ropes</b> was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag <b>ropes</b> (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
