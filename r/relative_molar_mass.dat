Thin films of this polymer mixed with unfunctionalised hydrogenous polystyrene have been prepared and the blends annealed to equilibrium at 413 K. The distribution of the end functionalised deuteropolymer was obtained by neutron reflectometry {{and a range of}} molecular weights of the hydrogenous polystyrene matrix has been used. In all cases the deutero polystyrene was preferentially located at the air-polymer interface to an extent which was far greater than that for unfunctionalised deutero polystyrene in the same hydrogenous matrices. From the near surface depth profiles obtained, the surface excess, surface volume fraction and thickness of the end functionalised deuteropolystyrene rich layer have been obtained {{as a function of the}} equilibrium concentration of end functionalised deuteropolystyrene. These parameters have been compared with the predictions of scaling theory for brush like layers of polymers attached to a surface. The surface layer thickness and average volume fraction of the surface layer display stretched wet brush behaviour which is not expected for end functionalised polymers on the basis of the molecular weights explored. The possibility that local grafting densities are significantly higher than the average value is discussed. The shape of the near surface depth profile has been fitted using a self consistent field theory using the “sticking energy” of the fluorosilane groups as the only adjustable parameter. Fits of reasonable quality were obtained and using this sticking energy the surface volume fractions and normalised surface excess parameters have been calculated and compared with those obtained experimentally.

The colloidal polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) were obtained by charge neutralization of the polyanion and polycation at a charge ratio (n(+) /n(-)) of 2 (CHDS). The conditions of assembly were tuned to maintain the colloidal properties of the carrier in high salt environment. The <b>relative</b> <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> of the two polyions {{and the degree of}} acetylation (DA) of chitosan were essential parameters to achieve this goal, and this could be related to the nanometric scale organization of the colloids observed by Small Angle X-rays Scattering experiments. The binding of p 24 to the colloidal carrier was achieved and the release of the antigen was investigated. Antigen presenting cells [dendritic cells (DCs) ], obtained from monocytes, could internalize the colloids. Immature DCs (iDCs) were not matured by the colloidal PECs either loaded or not loaded with p 24, as proved by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis. Despite this lack of in vitro interaction, a specific immune response was observed in mice with a high production of antibodies, after subcutaneous injection.

In this study, different extrapolation procedures used in MALS were investigated with regard to accuracy and robustness in the obtained <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> and rms radius. Three different mathematical transformations of the {{light scattering}} function referred to as the Debye, Zimm, and Berry methods for constructing the Debye plot were investigated for two idealized polymer shapes, homogeneous spheres and random coils, with radii from 25 to 250 nm. The effect of the angular interval used for the extrapolation was investigated, as was the robustness of the different transformations toward errors in the measured light scattering intensity at low angles. For an rms radius less than 50 nm, the <b>relative</b> error in <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> due to extrapolation was less than 1 % independent of the method used. For larger radii, the error increased and the extrapolation procedure became more critical. For random coil polymers, the Berry method was superior in terms of accuracy and robustness.

The different extrapolation methods were evaluated and compared on experimental data from a size exclusion chromatography-MALS analysis of an ultrahigh <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements on}} the absolute viscosity (eta) and density (rho) of trisubstituted phosphoric esters which {{are useful in}} understanding their now mechanism necessary for accessing their role as plasticizers. The effect of chain length and branching has been examined on the eta and rho trends. From eta data, by using the Vogel-Tammann-Fulchur (VTF) equation, the VTF temperature (T-o) has been obtained which also represents the ideal glass transition temperature. T-o {{is related to the}} flexibility of the molecules. It is observed that T-o initially decreases with molecular weight, reaches ii minimum, and increases thereafter. The initial decrease in T-o has been attributed to the enhanced flexibility of the phosphate esters. Reversal of flexibility with <b>relative</b> <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> beyond 400 is due to the gentle collision of the arms of the trisubstituted phosphoric esters. This has been further corroborated from the molar mass exponent as exhibited in the eta-molar mass plot. The isomeric effect on eta has also been investigated in tricresyl phosphates, hitherto for the first time. The ortho isomer has highest eta among the isomers. The para isomer was found to have lowest T-o and hence highest flexibility compared to the ortho and meta isomers...|$|E
40|$|For {{the precise}} {{characterization}} of block copolymers of 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate (2 EHA) and methyl acrylate (MA) produced via RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) -mediated dispersion polymerization, novel liquid chromatographic separations have been developed. SEC showed multimodal molar mass distributions (MMD) and HPLC showed multimodal chemical composition distributions (CCD). The analyses of MMD and CCD {{of the reaction}} products indicated {{the formation of the}} expected block copolymer along with remaining P 2 EHA and PMA homopolymer fractions. Online coupling of SEC and gradient HPLC in a two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2 D-LC) setup proved to be an efficient method to fractionate all polymer species present in the samples. Different kinds of copolymer molecules were identified in addition to the two homopolymers. The quantification of P 2 EHA using liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LC-CC) showed that the unreacted macro(RAFT agent) amount remained unchanged during at least the first 4 h of polymerization. LC-CC experiments also allowed the <b>relative</b> <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> of the PMA blocks contained in the copolymers to be determined. The implementation of 2 D-LC combining SEC and LC-CC allowed a more precise characterization of the different copolymer structures in particular in terms of block size. Finally, the results obtained by SEC/HPLC were confirmed by LC- 1 H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) experiments. It was concluded that the dispersed state of the polymerization system was the important factor for the formation of broadly distributed, complex copolymers when using a dithiobenzoate-based reactive macromolecular stabilizer.

It is hard to learn the dynamic behavior of this fluid system at all atom models. The present study aims at constructing a mesoscale platform to explore aggregate behavior of asphaltenes in heavy crude oil. The aggregate structure in heavy crude oils was investigated by introducing rigid body fragments, which represents the significant presence of structures of fused aromatic rings in fractions such as asphaltenes and resins into dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). Another pressing task about how to determine the structure of the average model molecules and conservative force parameters was discussed in detail. With some regularity concerning the number of rings, the distribution of side chains and heteroatoms in average model molecules are revealed. Finally, we integrated the modified DPD program, model molecules, and the parameters selected for the preliminarily simulation of the heavy crude oil and emulsion system. The interlayer distance and the number of layers of the well-ordered structure in heavy crude oil are similar to some molecular dynamics works and supported by X-ray and transmission electron microscopy (TEN) experimental data. The relationship between the stability and the mass ratio among components of heavy crude oil is explored, and the result of our simulations fits the regularity Shell once published.

40|$|An {{increase}} in temperature induces allregation of Pluronics. The dehydration of POP segments enhances the hydrophobic interaction and drives {{the formation of}} aggregates. The POP/POE mass ratio and <b>relative</b> <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> of the Pluronics are factors that affect the onset of aggregation. Pluronics appear to aggregate {{in the order of}} clusters (without hydrophobic core), larger aggregates and well defined micelles as the temperature is increased. The length of the POE segments was found to be important in determining the temperature dependence of the size of aggregates. The core of the micelles contains some water and the amount decreases with increasing hydrophobicity of the Pluronics. An addition of small amounts (several mM) of the anesthetics induces the aggregation of Pluronics at 25 °C. The addition of 1 mM of anesthetic is estimated to be equivalent to ca. a 1 - 2 °C {{increase in}} temperature. It is deduced that, whereas an increase in temperature removes water of hydration from around the POP segments, the anesthetic molecules tend to replace water of hydration around these segments. The hydrogen bonding (between acidic hydrogen of anesthetic molecules and oxygen of POP segments) and the hydrophobic Interaction (between anesthetic molecules and POP segments) we considered to be the chemical and physical driving force, respectively, for the aggregation. The anesthetic molecules are found to distribute in both the hydrophobic core and hydrophilic corona but with a preference for the interfacial region either between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments or. between the hydrophilic segment and bulk water. This study of triblock copolymer aggregates as a solvation model for membranes has shown that inhalation anesthetics may affect the hydration water, the so called "biological water", of a membrane.
