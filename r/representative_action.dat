40|$|The {{protection}} of minority shareholders {{has become one}} of the key features of company law reform in many countries in recent years. Various mechanisms have been created to achieve this objective. Australia has introduced the statutory derivative action procedure mainly based on models drawn from Canada and New Zealand; this provision was inserted into the Corporations Act in March 2000. China has also adopted a similar mechanism – known as the shareholder representative action; this scheme was based upon China’s understanding of statutory derivative actions in Western countries. China’s derivative action mechanism is reflected in amendments to the 2005 PRC Company Law and 2005 Securities Law that both were passed on 27 October 2005 and came into effective on 1 January 2006. The development of statutory derivative actions in different countries demonstrates the interaction between forces of convergence and divergence in company law reforms. This article reviews different mechanisms adopted in the Chinese law for the {{protection of}} minority shareholders. It especially focuses on an analysis of the nature of the shareholder <b>representative</b> <b>action</b> and the procedures for its utilisation in China – the equivalent to Western countries’ derivative actions. In comparison with statutory derivative actions in Australia, this article argues that the concept of the shareholder <b>representative</b> <b>action</b> in China rests upon a misunderstanding of Western derivative actions; this has involved a compromise between the dire need to protect shareholders and the ambiguities of a weak court system. As a consequence, China’s reforms in this area are largely a tentative gesture and are therefore unlikely to be very effective. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>representative</b> {{environmental}} <b>action</b> in international, European Union, and German {{environmental law}} {{as an example}} of 2 ̆ 77 egal translation. 2 ̆ 2 The Aarhus Convention, dating from 1998, requests signatory parties to provide environmental NGOs with wide access to justice so that the protection of the environment can be controlled by the judiciary. Both the European Union and Germany have implemented the provisions of the Aarhus Convention into their respective legal orders. This process of implementation can be considered as 2 ̆ 2 legal translations. 2 ̆ 2 The argument of this paper is that a perspective of 2 ̆ 77 egal translation 2 ̆ 2 provides new vistas on the various intertwined layers of law constituting transnational environmental law. First, the example of <b>representative</b> environmental <b>action</b> shows how important context is for legal translations: the traditional German 2 ̆ 2 impairment of rights doctrine 2 ̆ 2 (Schutznormtheorie), historically developed in the nineteenth century, has still major importance in German administrative law and has {{to be taken into account}} when translating the Aarhus Convention. Secondly, legal translations take place in judicial hierarchies: both the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Compliance Committee of the Aarhus Convention have ruled upon Germany 2 ̆ 7 s translation of <b>representative</b> environmental <b>action</b> and found it wanting; yet, the picture is much more complex and nuanced than the usage of 2 ̆ 2 hierarchy 2 ̆ 2 suggests, as a closer look reveals. Thirdly, literal translations are the basis of legal translations: in transnational law, multiple languages have to be literally translated, both on a European and an international level. Fourthly, the example of <b>representative</b> environmental <b>action</b> demonstrates the persistence of national peculiarities: after all, national peculiarities cannot too easily be overcome or abandoned; rather, they continue to play a significant role in transnational law.
