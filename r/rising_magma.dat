5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when <b>rising</b> <b>magma</b> encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of <b>rising</b> <b>magma</b> with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, {{and some}} andesites) is mostly {{dependent on the}} shape of vesicles in the <b>rising</b> <b>magma</b> before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the magma has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces {{are the result of}} broken vesicle walls. Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular, vesicular pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by spalling or explosive expansion of gases in the magma as it reaches the surface.|$|E

25|$|At least 54eruptions have {{occurred}} at Mount Meager {{in the last}} 2,600,000years, ranging in character from effusive to explosive. Four primary eruptive periods {{in the history of}} Mount Meager have been identified, with individual eruptions separated by thousands of years.

25|$|The geology of Duluth {{demonstrates}} the Midcontinent Rift, formed as the North American continent (Laurentia) began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. Continental rifting is a recurring {{process in the}} history of the earth that leads to break-up of continents and the formation of ocean basins. In the Lake Superior region, the upwelling of molten rock may have been the result of a hot spot that produced a dome over the Lake Superior area. As the earth's crust thinned, magma rose toward the surface. When insulated by overlying roof rock, the upwelling magma cooled slowly, and is therefore coarse-grained. These intrusions formed a sill some 16km thick, primarily of gabbro, which is known as the Duluth Complex. In the areas where the <b>rising</b> <b>magma</b> erupted to the surface and cooled rapidly, basalt, the extrusive equivalent of gabbro, was formed.|$|E

25|$|Widespread basalt {{volcanism}} {{occurred between}} 60.9 and 61.3 {{million years ago}} in the northern Labrador Sea, Davis Strait and in southern Baffin Bay on the eastern coast of Nunavut during the Paleocene period when North America and Greenland were being separated from tectonic movements. This resulted from seafloor spreading where new ocean seafloor was being created from <b>rising</b> <b>magma.</b> Scientific studies have indicated nearly 80% of the magma was erupted in one million years or less. The source for this volcanic activity was the Iceland plume along with its surface expression, the Iceland hotspot. This volcanic activity formed part of a large igneous province that is sunken beneath the northern Labrador Sea. Another period of volcanic activity began in the same region about 55million years ago during the Eocene period when the north-south trending Mid-Atlantic Ridge began to form under the northern Atlantic Ocean east of Greenland. The cause of this volcanism might be related to partial melting from movement of a transform fault system extending from Labrador Sea to the south and Baffin Bay to the north. Although the region was carried away from the Iceland plume by going plate motion over millions of years, the source of the partial melting for the final period of volcanic activity may have been remnants of still anomalously hot Iceland plume magma which were left stranded beneath the North American lithosphere in the Paleocene period. Most diatremes in the Northwest Territories were formed by volcanic eruptions between 45and 75million years ago during the Eocene and Late Cretaceous periods.|$|E
500|$|Some {{time before}} , masses of magma intruded under {{and within the}} igneous and {{sedimentary}} rocks, heating and pressing the rocks to metamorphose them into hard greenish greenstones.

25|$|Also a {{major portion}} of almost all magma is silica, which is a {{compound}} of silicon and oxygen. Magma also contains gases, which expand as the <b>magma</b> <b>rises.</b> <b>Magma</b> that is high in silica resists flowing, so expanding gases are trapped in it.

500|$|On April 17, a bulge (or [...] "cryptodome") was {{discovered}} on the mountain's north flank, suggesting that Mount St. Helens {{could produce a}} lateral blast. Johnston was one of few people who believed this, along with a professor of geology at a Tacoma community college, Jack Hyde. Observing that Mount St. Helens did not possess visible vents, Hyde suggested that pressure would increase until the mountain exploded. Because Hyde was {{not a part of}} the USGS or in a position of responsibility, his opinion was generally dismissed.

500|$|Most of Cleopatra Hill, {{the rock}} {{formation}} upon which Jerome was built, is 1.75billion (1,750million) years old. Created {{by a massive}} caldera eruption in Precambrian—elsewhere more narrowly identified as Proterozoic—seas south of what later became northern Arizona, the Cleopatra tuff was then part of a small tectonic plate that was moving toward the proto-North American continent. After the eruption, cold sea water entered Earth's crust through cracks caused by the eruption.

500|$|As {{recently}} as 165million years ago, most of western North America was {{still part of}} the Pacific Ocean. The nearly complete subduction of the Farallon Plate underneath the westward-moving North American Plate created the Rocky Mountains, which were pushed up by <b>rising</b> <b>magma</b> trapped between the sinking Farallon plate and the North American plate. As the North American Plate moved westwards over a stationary hotspot beneath the crust, a series of tremendous lava flows and volcanic eruptions carved out the Snake River Plain beginning about 12million years ago, west of the Continental Divide. [...] Even larger lava flows of Columbia River basalts issued over eastern Washington, forming the Columbia Plateau southeast of the Columbia River and the Palouse Hills in the lower Snake.

500|$|A Surtseyan {{eruption}} (or hydrovolcanic) {{is a type}} {{of volcanic}} eruption caused by shallow-water interactions between water and lava, named so after its most famous example, the eruption and formation of the island of Surtsey off the coast of Iceland in 1963. Surtseyan eruptions are the [...] "wet" [...] equivalent of ground-based Strombolian eruptions, but because of where they are taking place they are much more explosive. This is because as water is heated by lava, it flashes in steam and expands violently, fragmenting the magma it is in contact with into fine-grained ash. Surtseyan eruptions are the hallmark of shallow-water volcanic oceanic islands, however they are not specifically confined to them. Surtseyan eruptions can happen on land as well, and are caused by <b>rising</b> <b>magma</b> that comes into contact with an aquifer (water-bearing rock formation) at shallow levels under the volcano.
