Poor Amy buried her face and her grief in the bed-curtain. Dame Webber resumed her {{knitting}} to hide her distress, which betrayed itself, however, in a pellucid tear, that trickled silently down and hung {{at the end of her}} peaked nose; while the cat, the only unconcerned member of the family, played with the good dame's ball of worsted, as it rolled about the floor.|$|E
