5|$|Brewing at home {{is subject}} to {{regulation}} and prohibition in many countries. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>on</b> homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the US in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.|$|E
30|$|For EC, the {{threshold}} limit of 3  dS/m is selected because according to Table  1, for EC above 3  dS/m, there is severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use {{of water for}} irrigation while for EC values below 3  dS/m, there is no (where EC is below 0.7  dS/m) and a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. SAR of irrigation water {{except for a few}} locations is below 6, so under this situation according to Ayers and Westcot (1994) if EC is below 0.3  dS/m, there is a severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. As EC of groundwater is above 0.5  dS/m, there is no severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. Also for SAR between 0 and 3, in about 90  % of study area, EC of groundwater is above 0.7  dS/m and therefore there is no <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. For SAR between 3 and 6, where EC is above 1.2  dS/m, there is no restriction and where EC is between 0.3 and 1.2  dS/m, there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use (Ayers and Westcot 1994). Therefore, we used a threshold limit of 3 for SAR. For both Na+ and Cl−, a critical limit of 3  meq/L is considered for producing probability maps. According to Ayers and Westcot (1994) there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use of irrigation water with Na+ and Cl− above 3  meq/L for sprinkler irrigation. So the probability maps of exceeding 3 dS/m, 3, 3  meq/L and 3 are produced for EC, Cl−, Na + and SAR, respectively.|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{regardless}} of whether §1466A(a)(1) requires an actual minor, it is nonetheless a valid <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> obscene speech under Miller, not a <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> non-obscene pornography of the type permitted by Ferber. We thus find Whorley's as-applied constitutional challenge to §1466A(a)(1) to be without merit.|$|R
