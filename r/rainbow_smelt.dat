5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
25|$|Fauna of {{the park}} include white-tailed deer, moose, black bear, red fox, porcupine, pine marten, river otter, beaver, snowshoe hare, skunk, and red {{squirrel}} with the occasional coyote and timber wolf. Waterfowl and raptors such as osprey frequent the Pigeon River, which also attracts walleye, northern pike, and <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> for their spring spawning.|$|E
25|$|Lake Erie has {{a complex}} {{ecosystem}} with many species in constant interaction. Human activity, such as pollution and maritime ship traffic, can affect this environment in numerous ways. The {{interactions between the}} new species can sometimes have beneficial effects, as well as harmful effects. Some introductions {{have been seen as}} beneficial such as the introduction of Pacific salmon. Occasionally there have been mass die-offs of certain species of fish, sometimes for reasons unknown, such as many numbers of <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> in May 2010.|$|E
50|$|Schoodic Lake {{is managed}} by the Maine Department of Inland Fish and Wildlife as both a warm water and cold-water fishery. Oxygen levels below 5 parts per million stress certain cold water fish, and a {{persistent}} loss of oxygen may eliminate or reduce habitat for sensitive cold water species. The outlet of Schoodic Brook hosts a run of <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelts</b> that are dipped by locals and provide forage for landlocked salmon.|$|R

50|$|It is a narrow, rocky, {{and scenic}} river that {{supports}} brook, steelhead and <b>rainbow</b> trout, <b>smelt,</b> {{and white and}} longnose suckers in the spring. The river runs south to its mouth on Little Bay De Noc on Lake Michigan at , near Masonville Township. There is a low-head dam by Gladstone Golf Course installed in 1978 to prevent upstream migration of invasive sea lamprey.|$|R
25|$|Over 80 {{species of}} fish {{have been found in}} Lake Superior. Species native to the lake include: banded killifish, bloater, brook trout, burbot, cisco, lake sturgeon, lake trout, lake whitefish, longnose sucker, muskellunge, {{northern}} pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, round whitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch. In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, freshwater drum, pink salmon, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.|$|E
500|$|Fish {{account for}} about 80% of the diet of the common loon. It forages on fish of up to [...] in length, {{including}} minnows, suckers, gizzard shad, rock bass, alewife, northern pike, whitefish, sauger, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, burbot, walleye, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> and killifish. The young typically eat small minnows, and sometimes insects and fragments of green vegetation. The freshwater diet primarily consists of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; the saltwater diet primarily consists of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, Atlantic croaker, haddock, and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or they are difficult to catch, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, molluscs, frogs, annelids, and occasionally aquatic plant matter such as pondweed, roots, moss, willow shoots, seeds, and algae. It has also been known to eat ducklings.|$|E
2500|$|Blue walleye became {{extinct in}} the Great Lakes in the 1980s. [...] Until {{the middle of}} the 20th century, it was a commercially {{valuable}} fish, with about a half million tonnes being landed during the period from about 1880 to the late 1950s, when the populations collapsed, apparently through a combination of overfishing, anthropogenic eutrophication, and competition with the introduced <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ekityki River {{flows through}} the sparsely {{populated}} areas of the Eastern Siberian tundra. Salmon, whitefish, vendace, grayling, pike, <b>rainbow</b> herring (northwestern <b>smelt),</b> burbot, bull trout and loach are common in its waters.|$|R
40|$|The Boyer River (Qu√©bec, Canada) drains a 217 km 2 {{watershed}} that {{is under}} cultivation at 60 %. The last 2 km {{of the river}} bed has always {{been used as a}} spawning ground by <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Smelts</b> (Osmerus mordax). This fish population, which plays an important ecological role in the St. Lawrence River estuary, has dramatically declined over the last decades. Siltation and excessive algal growth in the spawning area were identified as the most probable causes of the fish population decline; suggesting that soil erosion, nutrient and sediment transport are major factors underlying the environmental problem. In this context, 137 Cs provides an effective tool for investigating the magnitude and spatial distribution of long-term soil redistribution taking place in the watershed. Sampling of cultivated fields, riverbanks, bottom sediments and forested sites were thus undertaken to help understand the erosive behaviour of the watershed. Results obtained so far suggest in-field erosion rates of up to 13 t ha- 1 yr- 1 with net outputs reaching 11 t ha- 1 yr- 1. These results agree well with estimates obtained from the USLE. The 137 Cs data indicate that fields located in the upstream half of the basin produce smaller sediment loadings than those in the downstream portion, despite higher soil erodibilities and more frequent ose for annual crops. They also suggest that more than 75 % of the sediment deposited in the spawning area originates from cultivated fields, and less than 25 % from streambanks...|$|R
50|$|Eighth Lake {{is located}} by Inlet, New York. It {{is part of}} the Fulton Chain Lakes. The outlet is {{connected}} to Seventh Lake by a creek. Fish species present in the lake are brown trout, lake trout, lake whitefish, <b>smelt,</b> <b>rainbow</b> trout, black bullhead, landlocked salmon, and pumpkinseed sunfish. There is a state owned fee hard surface ramp at Eighth Lake Campground on NY-28.|$|R
2500|$|Smelt or <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> Osmerus mordax subsp. dentex (qusuuq, iqalluaq, cimigliq, cimerliq, cimerliaq, cimirliq, cemerliq, elquarniq, uqtaqngaq, qimaruaq in Yup'ik, quyuuq, cemerliq in Cup'ik, quss'ur in Cup'ig) were cooked by frying and {{roasting}} when eaten fresh. Some {{fishermen who}} harvested smelt consider these fish as [...] "emergency food," [...] {{to be kept}} in the smokehouse or cache and used if supplies of dried salmon ran out or if food shortages occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Lake Erie {{is home to}} one of the world's largest {{freshwater}} commercial fisheries. Lake Erie's {{fish populations}} are the most abundant of the Great Lakes, partially because of the lake's relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of plankton, which is the basic building block of the food chain. The lake's fish population accounts for an estimated 50% of all fish inhabiting the Great Lakes. The lake is [...] "loaded with superstars" [...] such as steelhead, walleye (American usage) or pickerel (Canadian usage), smallmouth bass, perch, as well as bass, trout, salmon, whitefesh, smelt, and many others. The lake consists of a long list of well established introduced species. Common non-indigenous fish species include the <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> alewife, white perch and common carp. Non-native sport fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked specifically for anglers to catch. Attempts failed to stock coho salmon and its numbers are once again dwindling. Commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and walleye, with substantial quantities of <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and white bass also taken. Anglers target walleye and yellow perch, with some effort directed at rainbow trout. A variety of other species are taken in smaller quantities by both commercial and sport fleets.|$|E

50|$|The {{body of the}} <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> is {{slender and}} cylindrical. It has a silvery, pale green back and is {{iridescent}} purple, blue, and pink on the sides, with a light underside. When full grown, the <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> is between 7 and 9 in long and weighs about 3 oz. Individuals over 12 in long are known.|$|E
5000|$|Genetic {{data suggest}} that the pygmy smelt occurrences in each lake have evolved {{independently}} from the <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> lineage, which calls the identity of the pygmy smelt as a species into question. [...] Another, intermediate form of smelt has been identified in Lake Utopia, New Brunswick, which is genetically distinct from local <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> but is able to hybridize with it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> {{invaded the}} Great Lakes {{watershed}} through an intentional introduction of eggs to Crystal Lake in 1912. This lake drains into Lake Michigan, from which fish escaped into Lake Michigan and spread quickly throughout the Great Lakes and their tributaries. Early records documenting the smelt's range {{expansion in the}} Great Lakes include Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> were first reported from Lake Ontario in 1929, and probably reached it by dispersal along natural waterways from the Finger Lakes, New York, where they were intentionally introduced in 1917. The ability of <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> to disperse {{is determined by the}} connectivity of lakes, the ability of smelt to move through connecting streams, and the suitability of connected lakes as habitat. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> are weak swimmers so they cannot make it over fish ladders. This has helped to prevent an even wider spread of their range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> is {{widespread}} across North American watersheds. The North American native {{range of the}} <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> extends through the Atlantic drainages between New Jersey and Labrador to Arctic drainages, and the Pacific drainages {{as far south as}} Vancouver Island. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> has been introduced into water bodies in the U.S. states of Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Landlocked populations were historically known in Maine, and fish from one of these populations were introduced to Crystal Lake, Michigan and then spread to the Great Lakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline of}} the species has been largely caused by {{overfishing}} and predation from the invading sea lamprey. The introduced alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax) are also aggressive predators of juveniles. Blackfin ciscoes were commercially fished until the early 1900s when declining stocks made the fishery uneconomic. Current threats to the only remaining population include commercial fishing, predation by <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and interbreeding with lake herring (Coregonus artedi).|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{classified}} as a warmwater fishery, with observed species including smallmouth and largemouth bass, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> chain pickerel, brown bullhead, sunfish, and yellow perch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> are anadromous, {{ascending}} from saltwater to freshwater to spawn. Smelt {{are also}} capable of completing their life history exclusively in freshwater. Landlocked adult <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> spawn shortly after ice-off {{at night in}} the lower reaches of streams. Shaw found in his research that no shoreline spawning had ever occurred. McKenzie states that the number of eggs extruded by a female is positively related to its size and Nellbring stated in his 1989 research that the eggs are adhesive and attach to substrates such as gravel, sand, mud, or submerged vegetation. Eggs are left unattended and hatch in 1-4 weeks, depending on water temperature. The time to sexual maturity is dependent on food supply and water temperature and abundant food and warmer temperatures encourage faster growth. Crossman and Scott state that in optimal conditions and large lakes, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> may reach 35.6 cm and can live for over seven years.|$|E
50|$|Native fish include Bluegill, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Lake Trout, Lake Whitefish, Northern Pike, <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Smelt,</b> Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Sucker and Yellow Perch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> are fished both commercially and for sport. Commercial harvests {{are down}} from {{historic}} levels; for example around 1880 an annual harvest from the Charles River alone was around 9 million fish, while today few smelt {{are found in}} the Charles River. They are commonly processed into animal feed, but are also eaten by humans. They are a popular winter game fish and the spring smelt run is a tradition in many parts of their distribution. Fishing for <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> using a gill net is a popular activity along the city of Chicago's lakefront.|$|E
50|$|Rose Lake {{contains}} Walleye, Lake Trout, Smallmouth Bass, Cisco, Lake Whitefish, <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Smelt,</b> Burbot, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker. It sits in {{a forest}} dominated by white pines and cedars.|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{classified}} as a warm- and coldwater fishery, with observed species including rainbow trout, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, chain pickerel, brown bullhead, yellow perch, and sunfish.|$|E
50|$|The pygmy smelt coexists {{with the}} <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> Osmerus mordax, and is {{distinguished}} from it by slower growth, earlier maturation, shorter life span, later spawning time, {{and use of}} smaller food items.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax) is {{a species}} of fish of the family Osmeridae. Its {{distribution}} is circumpolar, {{and it has been}} introduced to the Great Lakes, and from there has made its way to various other places. Walleye, trout, and other larger fish prey on these smelt. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> prefer juvenile ciscoes, zooplankton such as calanoid copepods (Leptodiaptomus ashlandi, L. minutus, L. sicilis), and other small organisms, but are aggressive and will eat almost any fish they find. They are anadromous spring spawners and prefer clean streams with light flow and light siltation. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> face several barriers. They are weak swimmers and cannot overcome most fish ladders. This prevents them from making it past the dams to the headwater streams where they spawn. The rise in erosion and dams helped to decimate the smelt population in the 1980s. There are currently plans to try to reduce damming and to help control erosion. With current efforts to reduce the human impact on this and many other affected species the population is back on the rise.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Smelt</b> {{are another}} {{introduced}} species {{and they were}} first observed in the early 1960s. They were believed to compete with native Lake Whitefish and be somewhat responsible for a decline in their populations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1883 Stedman and Argyle {{found that}} the <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> {{consumed}} bloaters (Coregonus hoyi) and alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus). However, they also stated that this predator had not affected the population of bloaters but that impact could be a possibility. A 2003 study by Horppila et al. shows that smelt densities can exceed 40,000 individuals per hectare and may create a large predation pressure on the lake. Horppila et al. also states that a single smelt can consume between [...]12 grams and [...]14 grams. Another study showed that in Lake Ontario the primary food sources for <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> were slimy sculpins (Cottus cognatus) and opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta), but nothing was said on whether this predation had {{significant impact on the}} populations. In 1973 Havey reported that there was increased growth in landlocked Atlantic salmon populations after the introduction of the smelt. It was also shown by Brandt and Madon in 1986 that adult lake trout (Salvalinus namaycush) could be a keystone predator species for the smelt. Hrabik et al. (1998) found evidence of competition for food between introduced <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and native yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Wisconsin lake habitats, and smelt may be partially responsible for the decline of Great Lakes whitefish (Coregonus spp.). The U.S. EPA stated in 2008 that they believe the smelt contributed to the extinction of the blue pike (Stizostedion vitreum glaucum) by outcompeting for food. Acidity may alter smelt distributions because they were not found in small lakes with pH less than 6.0 in several surveys. Because of snowmelt, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> eggs might be exposed to lethal pH decreases in poorly buffered lakes.|$|E
50|$|Native {{populations of}} togue and land-locked Atlantic salmon use the cold-water habitat of this deep lake. These large fish prey on <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt</b> and {{squaretail}} spawning in tributaries Atkins Brook, Bluffer Brook, Cedar Brook, Chase Brook, Currier Brook, Munsungan Brook, Norway Brook, and Reed Brook.|$|E
50|$|Kezar Lake {{has good}} habitat for smallmouth bass, white perch, chain pickerel, <b>rainbow</b> <b>smelt,</b> lake trout, and land-locked Atlantic salmon. There {{is a public}} boat launch area {{at the north end}} of the lake in North Lovell, and another at the narrows south of Center Lovell.|$|E
50|$|Although the Gaspereau {{is a short}} river, the {{riverbed}} habitat and connecting lakes form an important and productive breeding ground for several species of migratory fish including Gaspereau (Alewife), <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Smelt</b> and Atlantic Salmon. Atlantic Tomcod, Atlantic Sturgeon and Striped Bass spawn in the tidal portion of the river.|$|E
50|$|The Kennebago River {{passes by}} {{the western end of}} Kennebago Lake 11 mi {{upstream}} of Cupsuptic Lake. The lake extends southeasterly from the river in Stetsontown township into the northeast corner of Davis township.
