40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} {{the design of a}} passive Bi-band Fresnel reflectarray (20 – 30 GHz). It is focused on the design of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>panel</b> of the reflectarray. Two different primary feeds will be used at 20 and 30 GHz, respectively for demonstrating the proposed concept. Nevertheless, in the final design a switched primary feed will have to be used. The dual operation band is obtained with multiple resonant elementary cells. Although the paper deals with linearly polarized primary feed, an interesting property of these cells is that they also work with circular polarization. Moreover, a phase correction based on Fresnel zones is used in order to ensure the best tradeoff between simplicity and radiating performance. Finally, the <b>reflecting</b> <b>panel</b> is made and radiation pattern and gain measurements are shown. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 58 : 1025 – 1028, 201...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analytical}} evaluation of energy advantages that could be obtained by inserting a panel made of reflecting material between the wall and radiators used for central heating. As {{a consequence of the}} panel installation, a higher percentage of the heat emitted by the radiator remains inside the room to be warmed, diminishing the heat loss through the external wall, thus improving the global efficiency of the entire heating system. The analysis is based on equations that describe the heat exchange by irradiation between the three surfaces: radiator, <b>reflecting</b> <b>panel</b> and inner surface of the external wall; the natural convection with interior room air flow is also taken into account. The study covers three different wall types, with the aim of investigating the influence of the enclosure on the panel performance, and three different climatic zones in Italy (North, Centre and South), {{to take into account the}} variation with the external temperature. Results show how the performance of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>panel</b> depends strictly on the insulation level of the external wall facing the radiator; more specifically, efficiency increases when the thermal resistance decreases, reaching energy savings of up to 8. 8 % in worst insulation conditions. The variability with external temperature conditions is negligible, showing similar values for all the investigated zones...|$|E
40|$|Reflecting {{structures}} {{placed over}} the stage in auditoria and concert halls should provide sound reflection {{in a way that}} enhances sound emission from the stage without causing acoustic defects in the interior. Model studies conducted by the authors were used to determine the relative level of sound reflection by reflecting structures as a function of frequency for a number of geometric configurations and materials. Analysis of the results allowed drawing conclusions about the effect of modifications of the ceiling over the <b>reflecting</b> <b>panels</b> {{on the quality of the}} sound reflected from them. It was shown that modification of the ceiling over the <b>reflecting</b> <b>panels</b> by employing highly sound absorbing materials significantly improved the characteristics of the reflected sound. Also, certain configurations of elements located in the space under the ceiling should be avoided, as the experiments indicated the occurrence of adverse acoustic effects...|$|R

Despite the state of conservation of the stage, the scenery is often designed with little care about its acoustical efficiency. To clarify the acoustical impact of these elements in ancient theatres, different stage settings were investigated by means of scale model measurements. The scale model is a 1 : 20 scale reproduction of the ancient theatre of Siracusa (Italy). It is conceived as modular structure so that different configurations of the cavea and of the stage can be reproduced.

40|$|The design, construction, and {{installation}} of the Parabolic Dish Concentrator, Type 1 (PDC- 1) {{has been one of}} the most significant JPL concentrator projects because of the knowledge gained about this type of concentrator and the development of design, testing, and analysis procedures which are applicable to all solar concentrator projects. The need for these procedures was more clearly understood during the testing period which started with the prototype panel evaluation and ended with the performance characterization of the completed concentrator. For each phase of the test program, practical test procedures were required and these procedures defined the mathematical analysis which was essential for successful concentrator development.

40|$|ReS is a {{sustainable}} hand-built temporary acoustic shell, developed since 2011 and built during the architectural workshop at Villa Pennisi in Musica in Acireale, Sicily, {{every year since}} 2012. It {{is the product of}} a research program started at the Department of Architecture (Diarc) of the University of Naples Federico II, Italy, which involves a team of Italian experts in architectural design, product design, computational analysis and acoustics, together with the invaluable help from the soloists of the Santa Cecilia Orchestra of Rome. The design concept aims to provide a portable structure by reducing the on-site construction problems and the skills required by the builders, together with maximizing the acoustic performance for the audience and the musicians. The shell is built using only wood, mostly recycled. It can be built and dismantled by non-specialized workers, even students, in just 3 days, thanks to the use of mechanical reversible joints between the parts of the structure and to the lack of any kind of glue. A bespoke digital tool has been designed to calculate the optimal inclination of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>panels</b> for different orchestra configurations and music programs.

We also investigate out-of-sample forecasting performances of the suggested model and demonstrate improvements produced by allowing temporal and macroeconomic dependencies.
