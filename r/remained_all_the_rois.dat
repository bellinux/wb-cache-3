50|$|Another tragedy he {{experienced}} {{was that in}} addition to his brother's murder, his father murdered his mother. Mehmet Akbaş remarried after he was released from the prison.

60|$|Meanwhile, Dinah, {{instead of}} quitting the place after {{delivering}} her basket, hid {{herself in the}} shrubbery.

40|$|The {{low energy}} quantal {{spectrum}} is {{considered as a}} function of the total angular momentum for a system of weakly interacting bosonic atoms held together by an external isotropic harmonic potential. It is found that besides the usual condensation into the lowest state of the oscillator, the system exhibits two additional kinds of condensate and associated thermodynamic phase transitions. These new phenomena are derived from the degrees of freedom of "partition space" which describes the multitude of different ways in which the angular momentum can be distributed among <b>the</b> atoms while <b>remaining</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time in the lowest state of the oscillator...|$|R
