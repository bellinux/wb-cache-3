5|$|With these defections, Massino was slapped with a {{superseding}} indictment charging {{him with}} seven additional murders: the three capos (this time {{for participation in}} the murder itself rather than conspiracy), Mirra, Bonventre, Infanti and Sciascia. Of particular interest was the Sciascia hit, which took place after a 1994 amendment to <b>racketeering</b> laws that allowed the death penalty for murder in aid of <b>racketeering.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a {{short time}} in Flint, Michigan, he moved to New York City's Harlem {{neighborhood}} in 1943, where he engaged in drug dealing, gambling, <b>racketeering,</b> robbery, and pimping.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, under Meany's leadership, the International Longshoremen's Association, {{accused of}} <b>racketeering,</b> was {{expelled}} from the AFL, an early example of Meany's efforts against corruption {{and the influence of}} organized crime in the labor movement. After bitter internal reform, the union was readmitted to the now-merged AFL-CIO, in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Massino {{was indicted}} twice more, {{first as a}} {{co-conspirator}} with Rastelli in a labor <b>racketeering</b> case for controlling the Teamsters Local 814, then with a conspiracy charge for the Pastore murder that {{was added to the}} original three capos indictment. The second indictment also charged Vitale as a co-conspirator in the hijacking cases.|$|E
5|$|In January 1993, {{a federal}} {{conviction}} followed, on 73 counts of fraud, <b>racketeering</b> and conspiracy. In July 1993, Keating {{was given a}} 12½ year sentence. The judge ordered Keating to pay restitution of $122 million to the government, but Keating said he was $10 million in debt and had no assets to sell.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{prosecutors}} began {{claiming the}} building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar <b>racketeering</b> operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal <b>racketeering</b> statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E

A third case was filed in New York State court.|$|E
5|$|Broderick's {{exploits}} {{were widely}} {{reported in the}} New York media, gaining him celebrity status. His tenth anniversary on the police department was commemorated by a dinner in his honor in January 1933 at the Della Robbia room of the Vanderbilt Hotel, attended by politicians and civic leaders including Tammany Hall district leader James J. Hines. Entertainment was provided, gratis, by Bill Robinson, Bert Lahr and Harry Richman. Hines was subsequently convicted of <b>racketeering</b> for protecting Harlem numbers rackets run by Dutch Schultz.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{returned}} to Israel after a California court had approved a plea agreement setting him free. In May 2012, Itzhak Abergil was sentenced by a Los Angeles {{federal court to}} 10 years in prison with credit for time served, after pleading guilty to {{being part of a}} <b>racketeering</b> enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed a man for stealing a large drug shipment. He is to serve the remaining eight and a half years time in Israel.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2003, Massino {{was arrested}} and indicted, {{alongside}} Vitale, Frank Lino and capo Daniel Mongelli, in a comprehensive <b>racketeering</b> indictment. The charges against Massino himself included ordering the 1981 murder of Napolitano. Massino was denied bail, and Vincent Basciano took over as acting boss in his absence. Massino hired David Breitbart, an attorney he had originally wanted to represent him in his 1987 trial, for his defense.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his capture}} Noriega was {{transferred}} to a cell in the Miami federal courthouse, where he was arraigned on the ten charges which the Miami grand jury had returned 2 years earlier. The start of the trial was delayed until September 1991 due to complex legal maneuvering over whether Noriega could be tried after his detention as a prisoner of war, the admissibility of evidence and witnesses, and {{how to pay for}} Noriega's legal defense. The trial ended in April 1992, when Noriega was convicted on eight of the ten charges of drug trafficking, <b>racketeering,</b> and money laundering.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted along with former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on October 28, 2005, by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, <b>racketeering,</b> and bribery. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorneys accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy pleaded not guilty to all charges, but was convicted along with Siegelman in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's {{tenure at}} Davis Polk {{is best known}} for her work as a defense {{attorney}} for Philip Morris during major litigation, including both civil lawsuits and U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil <b>racketeering</b> probes. She became a senior associate while working on Philip Morris litigation. While this time in her career has proven controversial, Gillibrand indicates her work for Philip Morris allowed her to take on multiple pro bono cases defending abused women and their children, as well as other cases defending tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Reagan {{commuted}} the 18-year {{sentence of}} former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, a Democrat from Baton Rouge, {{to the time}} served for violations of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts. On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and <b>racketeering</b> when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. Reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004 Massino {{was convicted}} in a murder and <b>racketeering</b> {{indictment}} based on the testimony of several cooperating made men, including Massino's disgruntled underboss and brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale. He was also facing the death penalty if convicted in a separate murder trial due to be held later that year, but after agreeing to testify against his former associates {{he was sentenced to}} life imprisonment for both indictments in 2005. Massino testified twice for the government, helping win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011, and was resentenced to time served in 2013, though he will be on supervised release {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Moshe Malul {{pleaded guilty}} to a charge of <b>racketeering</b> {{conspiracy}}, admitting to conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to import the drug Ecstasy to the U.S. In his plea agreement, he acknowledged {{that as part of}} the Abergil crime family, he hired members of the Vineland Boyz street gang based in North Hollywood, to kill Sami Atias in retaliation for stealing Ecstasy that belonged to the Abergil organization. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, <b>racketeering,</b> and unionization.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{failed in}} 1989 it cost the federal {{government}} over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, <b>racketeering</b> and conspiracy. He served {{four and a half}} years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set of wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already served. Keating spent his final years in low-profile real estate activities until his death in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Before Massino became boss, John Gotti {{was one of}} {{his closest}} allies. Massino had backed Gotti in his plot to take over the Gambino family, and as Gambino boss, Gotti tried to get Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos' acting boss. Gotti was {{reportedly}} infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted, and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him. Gotti, however, was marginalized by his 1992 <b>racketeering</b> and murder conviction and consequent life imprisonment. Massino, for his own part, was angered at Gotti's high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing his predecessor Paul Castellano. Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante, who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti's attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission.|$|E
5|$|By May 2015, {{the games}} were under a {{particularly}} dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of <b>racketeering,</b> wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on May 29 and December 3. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of <b>racketeering,</b> conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges. By that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, <b>racketeering</b> and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 2005, {{four months}} after his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, <b>racketeering,</b> and bribery of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Prosecutors claimed that Scrushy had agreed to pay over $500,000 of Siegelman's debt, which he accumulated during a failed attempt to bring a state lottery to Alabama, in exchange for a seat on the Certificates of Need Review Board. The board serves the state by reviewing hospitals and approving their construction. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorney's accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy and Siegleman pleaded not guilty to all charges, but they were both convicted following a trial that lasted approximately six weeks. Scrushy was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, while Siegelman was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice.|$|E
5|$|Using {{economic}} sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted {{a campaign to}} drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor. In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties. Although the mission was controversial, U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on <b>racketeering</b> and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} six Serbian nationalists, among them Boško Radonjić, placed a home-made bomb {{in the home of}} the Yugoslav {{consulate}} in Chicago in 1975. Radonjić later became the leader of the Westies gang in New York City, where he participated in organized crime and <b>racketeering.</b> He eventually {{became one of the most}} feared gangsters in the New York City underworld, and developed extensive friendships with Vojislav Stanimirović, John Gotti and the Gambino family. After Sammy Gravano turned John Gotti in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1990, Radonjić was highly suspected to have attempted to fix the trial on John Gotti's behalf. As a result of this, Radonjić was arrested on December 1999 during a spectacular rerouted plane going to Cuba to a lockdown at Miami International Airport when he was tracked down by the FBI. He was arrested in the United States again in January 2000 for further investigation of the 1992 Gotti trial. Upon release in 2001, he left the United States and moved back to Serbia where he lived until his death in 2011. He was also an admirer and long-time friend of Radovan Karadžić until the latter went into hiding in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on <b>racketeering</b> charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of <b>racketeering,</b> wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and <b>racketeering.</b> This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

25|$|Ciro Perrone – {{a former}} capo. In 1998, Perrone was {{promoted}} to captain taking over Matthew Ianniello's old crew. In July 2005, Perrone along with Ianniello {{and other members of}} his crew were indicted on extortion, loansharking, labor <b>racketeering</b> and illegal gambling. In 2008, Perrone was sentenced to five years for <b>racketeering</b> and loan sharking. Perrone ran his crew from a social club and Don Peppe's restaurant in Ozone Park, Queens. In 2009, Perrone lost his retrial and was sentenced to five years for <b>racketeering</b> and loan sharking. Perrone was released from prison on October 14, 2011. Perrone died in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Merola– Former acting capo of the Mitarotonda crew. Merola is {{connected}} to Lucchese crime family Jersey faction leader Martin Taccetta.

25|$|In 1988, Palast {{directed}} a U.S. civil <b>racketeering</b> {{investigation into the}} Shoreham Nuclear Power Station project, under construction by Stone & Webster and Long Island Lighting Company. A jury awarded the plaintiffs US$4.8 billion; however, New York's chief federal judge(which district?)reversed the verdict. The <b>racketeering</b> charges stemmed from an accusation that LILCO filed false documents {{in order to secure}} rate increases. LILCO sought a dismissal of these charges on the grounds that Suffolk County lacked authority under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and that the allegations of a history of <b>racketeering</b> did not qualify as a continuing criminal enterprise.|$|E
