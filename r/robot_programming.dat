A software application has been developed using Microsoft Visual Studio using C#. The application is designed in windows for different types of data. It enables the user to compare two <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> (two different backup programs from the tests) from one robot and see the result between them graphically.

While {{this is not}} unusual in other automated control systems, the lack of standardization of programming methods for robots does pose certain challenges.

40|$|Robustness is {{essential}} for programs generated by Genetic Programming (GP). This paper presents a method to improve the robustness. The method employs non-determinism in two ways: one is to evolve <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> in noisy environments and another is to use probabilistic branch in the function set. The experiment is carried out on robot navigation problems. The result of the experiment shows that the robustness of <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> has been improved.

40|$|An {{evolutionary}} method such as Genetic Programming (GP) {{can be used}} {{to solve}} a large number of complex problems in various application domains. However, one obvious shortcoming of GP is that it usually uses a substantial amount of processing time to arrive at a solution. In this paper, we present the parallel implementations that can reduce the processing time by using a coarse-grained model for parallelization and an asynchronous migration. The problem chosen to examine the parallel GP is a mobile robot navigation problem. The experimental results show that superlinear speedup of GP can be achieved. 1 Introduction Genetic Programming was successfully used to perform automatic generation of mobile <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> [1]. The use of the perturbation to improve robustness of the <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> was proposed.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the fitness of a <b>program</b> {{controlling}} a <b>robot,</b> many experiments have to be performed. Unfortunately the execution of an experiment and the analysis of its result are very time-consuming. In this paper we name the key factors for fast assessment of <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> and illustrate briefly how our suite of development tools supports them. 1 Introduction The development of a robot typically consists of continuously repeating the following design cycle: edit the program which should control the robot (called "robot program" for brevity), then simulate it, test it on a robot, and modify the program again. It may take {{a few seconds to}} change a <b>robot</b> <b>program,</b> but it may take many experiments lasting hours or even days to evaluate such a change. Therefore, we need to shorten the time to set up experiments and to assess their output. Today many projects in academia insert test statements into their <b>robot</b> <b>programs.</b> These statements write data about robot execution into a file w [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Research in PbD also {{progressively}} {{departed from}} its original purely engineering perspective to adopt an interdisciplinary approach, taking insights from neuroscience and social sciences to emulate the process of imitation in humans and animals.

50|$|It {{was soon}} {{realised}} in the Freddy project that the 'move here, do this, move there' style of robot behavior programming (actuator or joint level programming) is tedious and {{also did not}} allow for the robot to cope with variations in part position, part shape and sensor noise. Consequently, the RAPT <b>robot</b> <b>programming</b> language was developed by Pat Ambler and Robin Popplestone, in which robot behavior was specified at the object level.|$|E

40|$|Autonomous robots {{offer the}} {{potential}} to conduct Counter- Weapons of Mass Destruction (C-WMD) missions in an efficient and robust manner. However, to leverage this potential, a mission designer {{needs to be able}} to determine how well a robot system will operate in the noisy and uncertain environments that a C-WMD mission may require. We are developing a software framework for verification of performance guarantees for C-WMD missions based on the MissionLab software system and a novel process algebra approach to representing <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> and operating environments. In this paper, we report on our initial research for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in understanding what is required from a performance guarantee to give a mission designer the information necessary to understand how well a <b>robot</b> <b>program</b> will perform in a specific environment. We link this to prior work on metrics for robot performance. Using a simple mission scenario, we explore the implications of uncertainty in the four components of the problem: the <b>robot</b> <b>program,</b> and the sensors, actuators and environment with which the program is executed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to improve {{robustness}} of the <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> generated by genetic programming. The main idea is to perturb the simulated environment during evolution of the solutions. The resulting <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> are more robust {{because they have been}} evolved to tolerate the changes in their environment. We set out to test this idea using the problem of navigating a mobile robot from a starting point to a target point in an unknown cluttered environment where obstacles can be moved dynamically. The result shows the effectiveness of this scheme. 1. Introduction The solutions of robot learning problems generated by genetic programming method (GP) are said to be "fragile". That is, they fail to work when there is even a small change in the operational environment such as robots working in the real world. An example can be drawn from our previous work [3], in a visual reaching task, GP is used to generate <b>robot</b> <b>programs</b> that control an arm to reach a target.
