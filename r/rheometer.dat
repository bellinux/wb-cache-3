25|$|Volume {{viscosity}} can {{be measured}} with an acoustic <b>rheometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Viscosity is {{measured}} with {{various types of}} viscometers and rheometers. A <b>rheometer</b> is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than {{is the case for}} a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5°C.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>rheometer</b> {{works at}} much higher {{frequencies}} than others. It {{is suitable for}} studying effects with much shorter relaxation times than any other <b>rheometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are two distinctively {{different}} types of <b>rheometers.</b> <b>Rheometers</b> that control the applied shear stress or shear strain are called rotational or shear <b>rheometers,</b> whereas <b>rheometers</b> that apply extensional stress or extensional strain are extensional rheometers.Rotational or shear type <b>rheometers</b> are usually designed as either a native strain-controlled instrument (control and apply a user-defined shear strain which can then measure the resulting shear stress) or a native stress-controlled instrument (control and apply a user-defined shear stress and measure the resulting shear strain).|$|R
50|$|Commercially {{available}} extensional <b>rheometers</b> {{have been}} segregated {{according to their}} applicability to viscosity ranges. Materials with a viscosity range from approximately 0.01 to 1 Pa.s. (most polymer solutions)are best characterized with capillary breakup <b>rheometers,</b> opposed jet devices, or contraction flow systems. Materials with a viscosity range from approximately 1 to 1000 Pa.s. are used in filament stretching <b>rheometers.</b> Materials with a high viscosity >1000 Pa.s., such as polymer melts, are best characterized by constant-length devices.|$|R

50|$|A simpler {{version of}} the {{filament}} stretching <b>rheometer,</b> the falling plate <b>rheometer</b> sandwiches liquid between two solid surfaces. The top plate is fixed, and bottom plate falls {{under the influence of}} gravity, drawing out a string of the liquid.|$|E
50|$|Volume {{viscosity}} can {{be measured}} with an acoustic <b>rheometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{viscometer}} (also called viscosimeter) is {{an instrument}} {{used to measure}} the viscosity of a fluid. For liquids with viscosities which vary with flow conditions, an instrument called a <b>rheometer</b> is used. Thus, a viscometer can be considered as a special type of <b>rheometer.</b> Viscometers only measure under one flow condition.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{acoustic}} <b>rheometers</b> {{are able}} to measure this parameter.|$|R
25|$|Extensional {{viscosity}} can {{be measured}} with various <b>rheometers</b> that apply extensional stress.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from its}} {{rotating}} bob viscometers, Brookfield now also produces defined-geometry <b>rheometers</b> which allow complete rheological analysis of fluids.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, the {{rheological}} behaviour of fresh self-compacting concrete {{is described by}} the Bingham model, being the basic model to perform comparative tests with different <b>rheometers.</b> On the other hand, several test results in Belgium and the surrounding countries indicate that shear thickening is occurring. As a result, the Bingham model is not applicable anymore and comparison must be done in another way. In this paper, two <b>rheometers</b> (ConTec Visco 5 and Tattersall Mk-II) are compared for non-linear behaviour. After transformation of the data into fundamental rheological units, {{the results indicate that}} the Tattersall Mk-II shows very similar curves as for the ConTec Visco 5, but higher shear stresses at a certain shear rate are occurring. When the SCC is too fluid, the results of the two <b>rheometers</b> are deviating from each other. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Surface {{rheology}} can {{be characterized}} by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface <b>rheometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a linear shear <b>rheometer</b> is the Goodyer Linear Skin <b>Rheometer,</b> {{which is used to}} test {{cosmetic}} cream formulations, and for medical research purposes to quantify the elastic properties of tissue.The device works by attaching a linear probe {{to the surface of the}} tissue under test, a controlled cyclical force is applied, and the resultant shear force measured using a load cell. Displacement is measured using an LVDT. Thus the basic stress/strain parameters are captured and analysed to derive the Dynamic Spring Rate of the tissue under test.|$|E
5000|$|Acoustic <b>rheometer</b> {{measures}} sound {{speed and}} attenuation of ultrasound {{for a set}} of frequencies in the megahertz range. These measurable parameters can be converted into real and imaginary components of longitudinal modulus.|$|E

40|$|Currently, rheologists {{working in}} the field of oscillatory squeeze flow use extensional strain to {{characterize}} the deformations. Due to the shear-dominated flow observed in low Trouton ratio fluids undergoing squeeze flow, it is proposed that an alternate geometry-dependent definition for shear strain in squeeze flow be used instead. Through the use of finite element modelling, {{it has been shown that}} this geometry-dependent strain definition allows for better comparison of measurements between both squeeze flow <b>rheometers</b> of different geometric configurations and rotational <b>rheometers.</b> This idea was then explored through laboratory experiments, further supporting this hypothesis. While this definition of strain will only hold true within the bounds of a material’s linear viscoelastic regime, it will help to determine where this boundary is, and thus allow for more accurate material characterization. This type of relationship will become increasingly important with the growing use of squeeze flow <b>rheometers</b> for large-amplitude oscillatory squeezing trials...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of extensional <b>rheometers</b> has proceeded {{more slowly than}} shear <b>rheometers,</b> due to the challenges associated with generating a homogeneous extensional flow. Firstly, interactions of the test fluid or melt with solid interfaces {{will result in a}} component of shear flow, which will compromise the results. Secondly, the strain history of all the material elements must be controlled and known. Thirdly, the strain rates and strain levels must be high enough to stretch the polymeric chains beyond their normal radius of gyration, requiring instrumentation with a large range of deformation rates and a large travel distance.|$|R

50|$|While {{the most}} common use is for {{drilling}} muds, which are non-Newtonian fluids, the Marsh funnel is not a <b>rheometer,</b> because it only provides one measurement under one flow condition. However the effective viscosity can be determined from following simple formula.|$|E

Two different <b>rheometers</b> {{were used for the}} measurements for determination of the rennet coagulation time and the curd firming rate. The results from the two <b>rheometers</b> showed the same trends; the rennet coagulation time increased and the curd firming rate decreased as the temperature of instant infusion pasteurization was increased. This was expected, however, the magnitude of the changes was smaller than expected. Instant infusion pasteurization could thus be a more gentle method than other high temperature heat treatments regarding the rennet coagulation properties of the milk...|$|R

This non-contact method applies an oscillating extensional stress. Acoustic rheometers measure the sound speed and attenuation of ultrasound {{for a set of}} frequencies in the megahertz range. Sound speed is a measure of system elasticity. It can be converted into fluid compressibility. Attenuation is a measure of viscous properties. It can be converted into viscous longitudinal modulus. In the case of a Newtonian liquid, attenuation yields information on the volume viscosity. This type of <b>rheometer</b> works at much higher frequencies than others. It is suitable for studying effects with much shorter relaxation times than any other <b>rheometer.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Rheometers</b> are {{instruments}} used {{to characterize}} the rheological properties of materials, typically fluids that are melts or solution.
