30|$|High removal rates can be {{achieved}} for most elements in this coal preparation procedure due to their low organic affinities, except for Sb, Se, Co, Cd and Ni, so it is viable to lower the concentrations of trace elements in coal preparation.

Then the float-sink experiments were conducted. The modes of occurrence of trace elements were discussed by correlation analysis and the inferred concentrations of trace elements in organic matters and minerals were then calculated based on linear regression. The organic affinities and <b>removabilities</b> of trace elements were evaluated to provide a comprehensive scene of trace elements behavior in coal preparation.|$|R

Some advancements are 1) <b>Removability</b> 2) Infinite thickness adjustment and 3) Color matching to OEM Colors. A rugged, textured finish is the result, with capabilities to match any factory color. In the off-road industry, popularity of rugged bed liner coatings on body panels has been taking off. PaintArmorDIY is similar to textured surfaces like Line-X or Rhino Liner without as much roughness and easier to care for surface that remains removable.|$|E

5000|$|Stipulated removal is {{a summary}} {{deportation}} procedure used in immigration enforcement in the United States. Stipulated removal {{occurs when a}} noncitizen who is facing removal proceedings and is scheduled for a hearing with an immigration judge signs a document stipulating that he/she is waiving the right to trial and to appeal, and is prepared to be removed immediately. The stipulation of removal must still be signed off by the judge before whom the hearing is to take place, but the noncitizen need not be physically presented to the judge. It is authorized under Section 240(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 According to the United States Code of Federal Regulations: [...] "A stipulated order shall constitute a conclusive determination of the alien’s <b>removability</b> from the United States." [...] Stipulated removal applies {{only to those who}} are scheduled for regular removal proceedings, and does not apply to people who are being removed through other summary procedures such as expedited removal, reinstatement of removal, or administrative removal for aggravated felons.|$|E
5000|$|One chief {{questions}} recurs {{under the}} [...] "by Law" [...] language: Who are [...] "inferior Officers," [...] {{not subject to}} the requirement of advice and consent; and (2) what constitutes a [...] "Department," [...] when Congress seeks to place the appointment power away from the President? As an initial matter, most government employees are not officers and thus are {{not subject to the}} Appointments Clause. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that only those appointees [...] "exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States" [...] are [...] "Officers of the United States," [...] and hence it is only those who exercise such [...] "significant authority" [...] who must be appointed by a mechanism set forth in the Appointments Clause. The Framers of the U.S. constitution did not define the line between principal officers and inferior officers, and the Supreme Court has been content to approach the analysis on a case-by-case basis rather than through a definitive test. The Court listed in Morrison v. Olson (1988) certain factors as hallmarks of [...] "inferior Officer" [...] status, such as <b>removability</b> by a higher executive branch official other than the President, and limitations on the officer's duties, jurisdiction, and tenure. In Edmond v. United States (1997) the Court stated that [...] "‘inferior Officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate." [...] Among those officers recognized as [...] "inferior" [...] are district court clerks, federal supervisors of elections, the Watergate Special Prosecutor, and an Independent Counsel appointed under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.|$|E
40|$|<b>Removability,</b> in {{the context}} of {{immigration}} law, refers to the government’s legal authority to seek deportation for violations of the federal immigration statute. <b>Removability</b> matters now more than ever before, both for individuals facing possible deportation {{as well as for the}} many governmental institutions charged with assessing <b>removability.</b> Using four areas of emerging law—claims to U. S. citizenship, the categorical approach to determining the immigration consequences of crime, the application of the exclusionary rule in removal proceedings, and the exercise of administrative discretion—this Article places <b>removability</b> at the center of its analysis and presents a framework for better understanding <b>removability.</b> Under what this Article calls a narrative of “complex removability,” <b>removability</b> is both legally and factually complex, as well as subject to change, notwithstanding the temptation in legal and popular discourse to treat <b>removability</b> as simple and settled. This Article identifies several common themes that characterize complex <b>removability</b> today. First, obstacles to obtaining substantive, discretionary relief have caused <b>removability</b> to become more complex. Second, challenges to <b>removability</b> tend to be limited across the legal system due to barriers associated with immigration detention, such as the absence of counsel and the pressures of time. Third, complex <b>removability</b> leads to a deeper appreciation of the fluidity and uncertainty associated with immigration status. Fourth, complex <b>removability</b> is not static, but is produced through dynamic interactions between the government and the individual. Fifth, this Article explores the relationship between tensions in the horizontal separation of powers and complex <b>removability.</b> This Article concludes by suggesting several areas in which taking complex <b>removability</b> seriously might bear upon immigration policy, practice, and discourse...|$|E

To improve removal of persistent chloramines by activated carbon filtration, a comparative evaluation of 3 different activated carbon types was conducted.
