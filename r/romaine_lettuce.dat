5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce,</b> different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E

500|$|Lettuce {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in ancient Egypt {{for the production}} of oil from its seeds. This plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves, with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as 2680 BC. Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min, and it was carried during his festivals and placed near his images. The plant was thought to help the god [...] "perform the sexual act untiringly." [...] Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings. The cultivated variety appears to have been about [...] tall and resembled a large version of the modern <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce.</b> These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans. Circa 50 AD, Roman agriculturalist Columella described several lettuce varieties– some of which may have been ancestors of today's lettuces.|$|E

40|$|Introduction - Lettuce is {{a widely}} {{consumed}} vegetable and {{a good source of}} phenolic compounds. Several factors (genetic, agronomical and environmental) can influence the lettuce composition; their effects are not completely defined and more studies are needed on this topic. Objective - To develop an improved ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method to quantify the main target intact phenolic compounds in lettuce. Methodology - UHPLC identification of the compounds was supported by PAD spectra and MSn analyses. Quantification was carried out by PAD, by creating matrix-matched calibration curves at the specific wavelength for each compound. Results - Sample pretreatment was simplified, with neither purification nor hydrolysis steps. Chromatographic conditions were chosen to minimise matrix interferences and to give a suitable separation of the major phenolic compounds within 27 min. The method allowed the quantification of 11 intact phenolic compounds in <b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuces,</b> including phenolic acids (caffeoyl and [i]p[/i]-coumaroyl esters) and flavonoids (quercetin glycosides). Four [i]p[/i]-coumaroyl esters were tentatively identified and quantified {{for the first time in}} lettuce. Conclusion - The main intact phenolic compounds, including four novel [i]p[/i]-coumaroyl esters, were simultaneously quantified in lettuce with optimal performances and a reduced total time of analysis. These findings make headway in the understanding of the lettuce phytochemicals with potential nutritional relevance...|$|R
40|$|Several small plot {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{during the spring of}} 1999 to examine the population growth, distribution and control of the <b>lettuce</b> aphid on <b>romaine.</b> The <b>lettuce</b> aphid population developed to greater numbers more quickly and spread among plants more rapidly when compared with other aphids species under late spring growing conditions. Most of the lettuce aphids sampled were found on the hearts of the plants rather than the frame and wrapper leaves. Our preliminary efficacy studies suggest that foliar sprays, when timed properly and with proper coverage, can provide adequate control of the lettuce aphid for up to 14 days. Furthermore, significant suppression of apterous lettuce aphid populations was observed in plots where pyrethoid treatment were sprayed for thrips control. The implications of these results for future research and management of lettuce aphids in desert lettuce is discussed...|$|R
500|$|As {{described}} around 50 AD, {{lettuce leaves}} were often cooked and {{served by the}} Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw. During the 81–96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, {{as well as the}} method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves. Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil. Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses. <b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> is often used for Caesar salads, with a dressing that includes anchovies and eggs. Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked. The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves. In that country, [...] "salads" [...] were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold. Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables. Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys. Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteSara E. GraggLeafy greens {{have been}} {{recognized}} as vehicles for transmission of foodborne pathogens and an effective pre-harvest intervention to control them is currently lacking. After harvest, lettuce is often subjected to chlorinated water to reduce the microbial load {{in the water and}} on the lettuce tissue. While moderately effective, there is also a need for improved postharvest interventions. 	The purpose of Objective I was to 1) determine potassium bisulfate efficacy at reducing populations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Listeria innocua (L. innocua) when applied pre-harvest to lettuce, and 2) assess the impact on product quality at harvest. Potassium bisulfate reduced E. coli populations on inoculated lettuce by 1. 32 log₁₀ CFU/g (P= 0. 0002) and L. innocua by 1. 18 log₁₀ CFU/g (P= 0. 0017). No detectable differences were observed in color (P> 0. 05); however, brown spots were observed on various leaves sprayed with potassium bisulfate. 	The purpose of Objective II was to employ a blend of benzalkonium chloride, acetic acid, and methyl paraben (BAM) as a postharvest wash on <b>romaine</b> and iceberg <b>lettuce</b> and to 1) determine efficacy at reducing populations of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella, 2) measure changes in aerobic bacteria throughout the shelf life, and 3) quantify benzalkonium chloride and methyl paraben residues post-washing. To quantify efficacy of BAM reducing pathogenic bacterial populations, fresh-cut <b>romaine</b> and iceberg <b>lettuce</b> were inoculated with L. monocytogenes, E. coli O 157 :H 7, or Salmonella and washed in BAM at concentrations of 0 %, 1 %, 2 % or 3 % for one or five minutes. When plated on recovery media, contact time and wash concentration was not significant (P> 0. 05) for Salmonella on either product. Concentration was significant (P= 0. 0189) for L. monocytogenes on romaine; however, the greatest reduction observed was 2. 0 log₁₀ CFU/g in the wash water. To quantify benzalkonium chloride and methyl paraben residues, as well as changes in aerobic bacteria and product quality, fresh-cut <b>romaine</b> and iceberg <b>lettuce</b> were subjected to a 1 minute wash in BAM at concentrations of 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, or 3 % and immediately sampled to determine aerobic populations and product quality. Concentrations 0 % and 2 % were also packaged into retail storage bags and sampled on days 0, 3, 5, and 7. Residues were quantified on these days as well. On day 0, aerobic populations did not vary according to wash concentration (P> 0. 05). With regards to shelf-life data, the 2 % wash significantly reduced (P= 0. 0203) aerobic bacteria on romaine lettuce; however, no significant difference was observed on iceberg lettuce (P= 0. 0819). With regards to overall visual appearance of <b>romaine</b> or iceberg <b>lettuce,</b> no significant difference was detected between 0 % and 2 % BAM washes for each day throughout the shelf-life study (P> 0. 05). Methyl paraben and benzalkonium chloride residues were < 5. 0 and < 10. 0 ppm, respectively, on both products on each sampling day...|$|R

Three rates of urea, ammonium nitrate were applied to each cultivar to provide deficient (N 1), adequate (N 2) and supraoptimal real (N 3) levels of N. All cultivars responded dramatically to the application of N. Fresh weight yields in the N 1 and N 2 treatments averaged 45 and 53 % of the N 3 treatment The average N 3 yields recorded in these trials were 23. 1, 12. 8 and 21. 8 tons of marketable produce per acre for greens, spinach and leaf lettuce/romaine crops, respectively. Preliminary plant tissue test results indicated that for all five crops, whole plant total N (TN) levels and midrib + petiole NO₃-N and leaf blade TN concentrations in the youngest mature leaf were responsive to differences in soil N supply and show promise as diagnostic N tissue test procedures.

40|$|To better {{characterize}} the bacterial community members capable of biosurfactant production on leaves, we distinguished culturable biosurfactant-producing bacteria from nonproducers and used community sequencing {{to compare the}} composition of these distinct cultured populations with that from DNA directly recovered from leaves. Communities on spinach, <b>romaine,</b> and head <b>lettuce</b> leaves were compared with communities from adjacent samples of soil and irrigation source water. Soil communities were poorly described by culturing, with recovery of cultured representatives from only 21 % of the prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (> 0. 2 % reads) identified. The dominant biosurfactant producers cultured from soil included bacilli and pseudomonads. In contrast, the cultured communities from leaves are highly representative of the culture-independent communities, with over 85 % of the prevalent OTUs recovered. The dominant taxa of surfactant producers from leaves were pseudomonads as well {{as members of the}} infrequently studied genus Chryseobacterium. The proportions of bacteria cultured from head <b>lettuce</b> and <b>romaine</b> leaves that produce biosurfactants were directly correlated with the culture-independent proportion of pseudomonads in a given sample, whereas spinach harbored a wider diversity of biosurfactant producers. A subset of the culturable bacteria in irrigation water also became enriched on romaine leaves that were irrigated overhead. Although our study was designed to identify surfactant producers on plants, we also provide evidence that most bacteria in some habitats, such as agronomic plant surfaces, are culturable, and these communities can be readily investigated and described by more classical culturing methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lettuce (Lactuca saliva L.) is {{susceptible}} to dieback, a soilborne disease caused by two viruses from the family Tombusviridae. Susceptibility to dieback is widespread in <b>romaine</b> and leaf-type <b>lettuce,</b> while modern iceberg cultivars are resistant to this disease. Resistance in iceberg cultivars is conferred by Tvr 1 - a single, dominant gene that provides durable resistance. This study describes fine mapping of the resistance gene, analysis of nucleotide polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium in the Tvr 1 region, and development of molecular markers for marker-assisted selection. Results A combination of classical linkage mapping and association mapping allowed us to pinpoint {{the location of the}} Tvr 1 resistance gene on chromosomal linkage group 2. Nine molecular markers, based on expressed sequence tags (EST), were closely linked to Tvr 1 in the mapping population, developed from crosses between resistant (Salinas and Salinas 88) and susceptible (Valmaine) cultivars. Sequencing of these markers from a set of 68 cultivars revealed a relatively high level of nucleotide polymorphism (&# 952; = 6. 7 &# 215; 10 - 3) and extensive linkage disequilibrium (r 2 = 0. 124 at 8 cM) in this region. However, the extent of linkage disequilibrium was affected by population structure and the values were substantially larger when the analysis was performed only for romaine (r 2 = 0. 247) and crisphead (r 2 = 0. 345) accessions. The association mapping approach revealed that one of the nine markers (Cntg 10192) in the Tvr 1 region matched exactly with resistant and susceptible phenotypes when tested on a set of 200 L. sativa accessions from all horticultural types of lettuce. The marker-trait association was also confirmed on two accessions of Lactuca serriola - a wild relative of cultivated lettuce. The combination of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the Cntg 10192 marker identified four haplotypes. Three of the haplotypes were associated with resistance {{and one of them was}} always associated with susceptibility to the disease. Conclusion We have successfully applied high-resolution DNA melting (HRM) analysis to distinguish all four haplotypes of the Cntg 10192 marker in a single analysis. Marker-assisted selection for dieback resistance with HRM is now an integral part of our breeding program that is focused on the development of improved lettuce cultivars. </p...|$|R
