40|$|Openness {{and trade}} {{liberalisation}} variables are consistently {{estimated to have}} significant positive coefficients in panel growth regressions. Many arguments have been advanced as to why and how more open or liberalised economies might grow faster, but the specific channels this process uses have begun to be investigated only <b>recently.</b> <b>We</b> <b>continue</b> these efforts by including a variable identifying the date of trade liberalisation {{in a system of}} equations that captures the determinants of growth in per capita income. Four ‘channels’ are considered: capital formation, the share of government, the economy’s openness to trade and its price distortions. We include the liberalisation variable in the equation explaining each channel, and allow for thresholds on its coefficient depending on the ‘years since liberalisation’. These estimated coefficients can also differ by region. In this way, we can identify the channels through which trade liberalisation affects growth and uncover the timing of the adjustments involved...|$|E
30|$|Contractive maps have nice {{properties}} concerning fixed points; a big {{amount of}} literature {{has been devoted}} to fixed points of nonexpansive maps. The class of shrinking (or strictly contractive) maps is slightly less popular: few specific results on them (not applicable to all nonexpansive maps) appear in the literature and some interesting problems remain open. As an attempt to fill this gap, a condition half way between shrinking and contractive maps has been studied <b>recently.</b> Here <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> the study of the latter notion, solving some open problems concerning these maps.|$|R

40|$|Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern) : It {{has long}} been an aim of the National Drugs Strategy to {{convince}} communities of the benefits to the drug misuser, his/her family and the whole community of placing drug treatment and rehabilitation services in local communities to meet local demand. Indeed local provision of these services greatly helps to avoid the kind of problems that those who oppose such developments tend to fear. The Local Drugs Task Forces, and the more recently established Regional Drugs Task Forces, provide the key mechanism for the co-ordination of mainstream treatment and rehabilitation services in their areas, while also facilitating the participation of local communities and voluntary organisations in the planning, design and delivery of some services. Drugs Task Forces are made up of nominees from Departments and agencies working in the region, involved, as well as community and voluntary representatives. Rehabilitation of problem drug users is a key element of all Local Drug Task Force and Regional Drug Task Force plans, and gaining acceptance of local service provision has been a central part of the activities of the Task Forces. This has been achieved in many Drugs Task Force areas and where local opposition was encountered this was dealt with at a local level. Indeed there is an increasing acceptance within most communities of the need for local treatment and rehabilitation services, with a few unfortunate exceptions, some of which have got extensive media coverage <b>recently.</b> <b>We</b> will <b>continue</b> to facilitate local endeavours and work to convince reluctant communities through the success of facilities in other areas. The need for a wider information campaign will be kept under review...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recently</b> <b>we</b> {{proposed}} {{a framework for}} explaining the observed evidence for neutrino oscillations without enlarging the neutrino sector, by introducing CPT violating Dirac masses for the neutrinos. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> {{the exploration of the}} phenomenology of CPT violation in the neutrino sector. We show that our CPT violating model fits the existing SuperKamiokande data at least as well as the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillation models. We discuss the challenge of measuring CP violation in a neutrino sector that also violates CPT. We point out that the proposed off-axis extension of MINOS looks especially promising in this regard. Finally, we describe a method to compute CPT violating neutrino effects by mocking them up with analog matter effects. Comment: 17 pages, 3 eps figure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recently,</b> <b>we</b> {{proposed}} a fast {{feature extraction approach}} denoted FSOM utilizes Self Organizing Map (SOM).

In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> FSOM investigation but using an RGB face recognition database across different poses and different lighting conditions. We believe that such data sets require multi-dimensional feature space to extract the information included in the original data in an effective way especially if you have a big number of classes.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Recently,</b> <b>we</b> {{proposed}} {{to transform the}} outputs of each hidden neu-ron in a multi-layer perceptron network to have zero output and zero slope on average, and use separate shortcut connections to model the linear dependencies instead. <b>We</b> <b>continue</b> the work by firstly introducing a third transformation to normalize {{the scale of the}} outputs of each hidden neuron, and secondly by ana-lyzing the connections to second order optimization methods. We show that the transformations make a simple stochastic gradient behave closer to second-order optimization methods and thus speed up learning. This is shown both in theory and with experiments. The experiments on the third transformation show that while it further increases the speed of learning, it can also hurt performance by converging to a worse local optimum, where both the inputs and outputs of many hidden neurons are close to zero...|$|R
40|$|Summary. <b>Recently</b> <b>we</b> have {{considered}} {{the possibility of using}} spiking neural P systems for solving computationally hard problems, under the assumption that some (possibly exponentially large) pre-computed resources are given in advance. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> this research line, and we investigate the possibility of solving numerical NP-complete problems such as Subset Sum. In particular, we first propose a semi–uniform family of spiking neural P systems in which every system solves a specified instance of Subset Sum. Then, we exploit a technique used to calculate Iterated Addition with boolean circuits to obtain a uniform family of spiking neural P systems in which every system is able to solve all the instances of Subset Sum of a fixed size. All the systems here considered are deterministic, but their size generally grows exponentially with respect to the instance size. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recently,</b> <b>we</b> {{presented}} the first non-Abelian flat directions that produce from a heterotic string model solely the three-generation MSSM {{states as the}} massless spectrum in the observable sector of the low energy effective field theory. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to develop the systematic techniques {{for the analysis of}} nonrenormalizable superpotential terms and non-Abelian flat direction in realistic string models. Some of our non-Abelian directions were F-flat to all finite orders in the superpotential. We study for the same string model the varying phenomenologies resulting from a large set of such all-order flat directions. We focus on the quark, charged lepton, and Higgs doublet mass matrices resulting for our phenomenologically superior non-Abelian flat direction. We review and apply a string-related method for generating large mass hierarchies between MSSM generations, first discussed in string-derived flipped SU(5) models, when all generational mass terms are of renormalizable or very low non-renormalizable order...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recently</b> <b>we</b> {{discussed}} new {{aspects of}} degenerate brane configurations, which can {{appear in the}} context of heterotic strings, perturbative type II, or M/F-theory. Here <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> our study of degenerate brane configurations, focussing on two applications. First we show how the notion of gluing {{can be viewed as a}} tool to engineer flavour structures in F-theory and type IIb, such as models with bulk matter and with Yukawa textures arising from the holomorphic zero mechanism. We find that there is in principle enough structure to solve some of the major flavour problems without generating exotics. In particular, we show how this addresses the mu-problem, doublet/triplet splitting and proton decay. Secondly, we describe the Fourier-Mukai transform of heterotic monad constructions, which occur in the large volume limit of heterotic linear sigma model vacua. Degenerate structures again often appear. One may use this to explore strong coupling phenomena using heterotic/F-theory duality. Comment: V 2 : 61 pp, 2 figs, LaTex. Published versio...|$|R
