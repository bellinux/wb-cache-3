40|$|Background: Sterilization of {{a growth}} medium before being {{utilized}} {{is a very}} important step in a microbiology laboratory. The common method for this purpose is by using the autoclave. However, autoclaving takes more time. To overcome this limitation, we tried to use the microwave oven. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the ability of microwave oven in preparing the growth media. Methods: This was a laboratory experimental study conducted at Microbiology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, from October to November 2014. The growth media used were: MacConkey agar, in petri dishes, inoculated with Escherichia coli; Sabouraud agar, in petri dishes, inoculated with Candida albicans; Kligler iron agar (KIA), in <b>reaction</b> <b>tubes,</b> inoculated with Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhi; Simmons citrate agar, in <b>reaction</b> <b>tubes,</b> inoculated with Klebsiella pneumoniae; Mueller-Hinton (M-H) broth, in <b>reaction</b> <b>tubes,</b> inoculated with Escherichia coli; and Motility Indole Urea (MIU) semisolid agar, in <b>reaction</b> <b>tubes,</b> inoculated with Proteus sp. The media would be heated by microwave for 1, 2, and 3 minutes. Results: From the total 54 dishes/tubes of various microwave-sterilized media, contaminations were only seen at 5 dishes/tubes. Most of the media, except the one-minute-heated Mueller-Hinton broth, were sterilized more than half dishes/tubes. The identification function of all media in this study was performed well.

5000|$|Stanley Miller {{was born}} in Oakland, California. He was the second child (after a brother, Donald) of Nathan and Edith Miller, {{descendants}} of Jewish immigrants from Belarus and Latvia. His father was an attorney and held {{the office of the}} Oakland Deputy District Attorney in 1927. His mother was a school teacher so that education was quite a natural environment in the family. In fact, while in Oakland High School he was nicknamed [...] "a chem whiz". He followed his brother to the University of California at Berkeley to study chemistry mainly because he felt that Donald would be able to help him on the subject. He completed BSc in June 1951. For graduation course, he faced financial problems, as his father died in 1946 leaving the family with a money shortage. Fortunately with the help from Berkeley faculty (UC Berkeley did not then have assistantships), he was offered teaching an assistantship at the University of Chicago in February 1951, which could provide the basic funds for graduate work. He joined this post and got registered for a PhD program in September. He frantically searched for a thesis topic to work on, meeting one professor after another, and he was inclined toward theoretical problems as experiments tended to be laborious. He was initially convinced to work with the theoretical physicist Edward Teller on synthesis of elements. Following the customs of the university, where a graduate student is obliged to attend seminars, he attended a chemistry seminar in which the Nobel laureate Harold Urey gave a lecture on the origin of solar system and how organic synthesis could be possible under reducing environment such as the primitive Earth's atmosphere. Miller was immensely inspired. After a year of fruitless work with Teller, and the prospect of Teller leaving Chicago to work on the Hydrogen bomb, Miller was prompted to approach Urey in September 1952 for a fresh research project. Urey was not immediately enthusiastic on Miller's interest in pre-biotic synthesis, as no successful works had been done, and he even suggested working on thallium in meteorites. With persistence Miller persuaded Urey to pursue electric discharges in gases. He found clear evidence for the production of amino acids in the reaction vessel. He was always afraid that some specks of fly excrement might be the source of the amino acids he discovered in the <b>reaction</b> <b>tube</b> (or was so chided by his classmates). This was not the case and the result was a clear demonstration that a host of [...] "organic" [...] chemical compounds could be produced by purely inorganic processes. Miller eventually earned his doctorate degree in 1954, and a long-lasting reputation. From spectroscopic observations on stars, it is now well known that complex organic compounds are formed in the gases blown off of carbon rich stars as a result of chemical reactions. The fundamental issue of what the connection was between the [...] "pre-biotic organic" [...] compounds and the origin of life has remained.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} thermal cyclers {{were designed}} for use with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Since this enzyme is destroyed during each heating step of the amplification process, new enzyme had to be added every cycle. This led to a cumbersome machine based on an automated pipettor, with open <b>reaction</b> <b>tubes.</b> Later, the PCR process was adapted {{to the use of}} thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, which greatly simplified the design of the thermal cycler. While in some old machines the block is submerged in an oil bath to control temperature, in modern PCR machines a Peltier element is commonly used. Quality thermal cyclers often contain silver blocks to achieve fast temperature changes and uniform temperature throughout the block. Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the <b>reaction</b> <b>tubes</b> are moved between them by means of an automated process. Miniaturized thermal cyclers have been created in which the reaction mixture moves via channel through hot and cold zones on a microfluidic chip. Thermal cyclers designed for quantitative PCR have optical systems which enable fluorescence to be monitored during reaction cycling.|$|R

The technical characteristics of the home-made experimental set-up are given. The synthesis involves the spray-pyrolysis of ferrocene (Fe(C 5 H 5) 2) in benzene (C 6 H 6) solution in Ar atmosphere. The effects of the following characteristic parameters of the spray-pyrolysis process were studied: {{the temperature in the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>tube,</b> the ferrocene concentration, and the flow-rate of the ferrocene-benzene solution.
