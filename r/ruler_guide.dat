Machiavelli shows how the ruler manipulates the commonplace to embrace his private interests as the social needs. This study investigates rhetoric of Machiavellian politics {{in the attempt to}} reveal ways in which the <b>ruler</b> <b>guides</b> people to identify with his private interests. The study firstly investigates the relationship between politics and rhetoric to examine how Machiavelli locates these two arts. Then, this inquiry discusses Machiavelli's political theory by focusing on his notions of republic, people, and appearance. Thirdly, focusing on the rhetorical theories of Aristotle and Burke, this inquiry explains how the commonplace plays a critical role. This section also examines their notions of commonplace, deductive reasoning based on opinion, and identification will reveal techniques of the ruler to use the commonplace to guide people to accept his private aims. Lastly, this study discusses Machiavellian politics and the current politics in order to call for the need of healthy commonplace for our engagements in politics...|$|R

The approach {{was applied to}} a <b>guide</b> <b>ruler</b> installed in machinery to produce steel rod frames. The <b>guide</b> <b>ruler</b> part, which is produced by the original manufacturer of the equipment, acts as an alignment guide of the steel wires. It ensures that the steel wires can be welded in the correct position so that the steel rod frames can be properly constructed. The <b>guide</b> <b>ruler</b> was selected due to its paramount importance for the proper functions of the equipment, the intensity of service loads, its high costs and poor availability. The methodology adopted for the homemade procedure was based on obtaining comparable chemical composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of the imported part. The main goal was to reduce the costs and delivery time for the acquisition of each spare part. The homemade procedure here used, however, is considered complete only after {{a comparison of the}} parts service performance and after an evaluation of the cost/benefit ratio. The results show that the studied part exhibited an increased economic efficiency in the equipment of about 83. 0 percent, therefore its manufacturing in Brazil is viable...|$|R

40|$|As satirists, both Christoph Martin Wieland and Johann Karl Wezel {{hoped that}} by {{focusing}} on the discrepancies between the real and the ideal, their works would contribute to the betterment of mankind. Possessing different temperaments and world views, they diverged in their representation of reality, and their brief friendship was destined to end. This dissertation examines their ideological and aesthetic differences as well as their place in the pedagogical tradition of eighteenth-century German prose satire. The relationship between Wieland and Wezel is traced as it is documented in their correspondence and reviews. Wieland 2 ̆ 7 s criticism of Swift, Voltaire and Rousseau is examined as a key to his concept of satire and a foreshadowing of his rejection of Wezel 2 ̆ 7 s extreme caricatures and so-called misanthropy. Wieland 2 ̆ 7 s Sokrates Mainomenos and Wezel 2 ̆ 7 s Belphegor are analyzed as representative examples of their author 2 ̆ 7 s satiric practices. The sharp social criticism in Sokrates Mainomenos anticipates his later works on the French Revolution. The bitter social satire Belphegor and its underlying materialistic philosophy are examined as neglected trends of the period. ^ These novels and the relationship between their authors shed some light on the different intellectual movements within eighteenth-century German Literature. With his optimism, faith in the Enlightenment 2 ̆ 7 s progress and belief in the sympathetic bond of humanity, Wieland emerges as an idealist, whereas Wezel, with his rejection of the dominant Leibnizean world view, possesses a more realistic outlook. In their political criticism, both Wieland and Wezel attack the aristocracy 2 ̆ 7 s luxury and capriciousness but reject revolutions and retreats into Rousseauistic idylls as answers to social and political problems. They hope that absolute <b>rulers,</b> <b>guided</b> by reason and wise advisers, would initiate reforms. Wieland 2 ̆ 7 s gentle irony is more in the tradition of Horace, and Wezel 2 ̆ 7 s aggressive criticism is that of Juvenal. Whereas Wieland 2 ̆ 7 s moderate, conciliatory and playful satires exhibit the golden mean of German Classicism, the more pessimistic Wezel resorted to black humor and caricature because he saw more flaws and vices in mankind than Wieland did. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{philosophy}} of Niccolò Machiavelli is sometimes {{presented as a}} model of moral nihilism, but this is at best ambiguous.

Machiavelli does say that the Prince must override traditional moral rules in favor of power-maintaining reasons of State, but he also says, particularly in his other works, that the successful <b>ruler</b> should be <b>guided</b> by Pagan rather than Christian virtues.

60|$|It {{may have}} been foolish of him: it {{may have been}} wrong: {{it may have been}} madness almost; but at that instant he felt dazzled and stunned by the {{crushing}} weight of the blow thus unexpectedly dealt at his whole preconceived theory of things, and at his entire mental scheme of science and theology. The universe seemed to swim aimlessly before him: he felt the solid ground knocked at once from beneath his feet, and found himself in one moment suspended alone above an awful abyss, a seething and tossing abyss of murky chaos. He had pinned all his tottering faith absolutely on that single frail support; and now the support had given way irretrievably beneath him, and blank atheism, nihilism, utter nothingness, stared him desperately in the face. In one minute, while he held his head tight between his two palms to keep it from bursting, and looked with a dull, glazed, vacant eye at the ghastly thing before him--only a few indistinct fossil bones, but to him the horridest sight he had ever beheld--a whole world of ideas crowded itself on the instant into his teeming, swimming brain. If we could compress an infinity of thought into a single second, said Shelley once, that second would be eternity; and on the brink of such a compressed eternity Cyril Milliter was then idly sitting. It seemed to him, as he clasped his forehead tighter and tighter, that the Truth which he had been seeking, and for which he had been working and fighting so long, revealed itself to him now and there, at last, in concrete form, as a visible and tangible Lie. It was no mere petrified lizard that he saw beneath his eyes, but a whole ruined and shattered system of philosophic theology. His cosmogony was gone; his cosmos itself was dispersed and disjointed; creation, nay, the Creator Himself, seemed to fade away slowly into nonentity before him. He beheld dimly an awful vision of a great nebulous mist, drifting idly before the angry storm-cyclones of the masterless universe--drifting without a God or a <b>ruler</b> to <b>guide</b> it; bringing forth shapeless monstrosities one after another on its wrinkled surface; pregnant with ravine, and rapine, and cruelty; vast, powerful, illimitable, awful; but without one ray of light, one gleam of love, one hope of mercy, one hint of divine purpose anywhere to redeem it. It was the pessimistic nightmare of a Lucretian system, translated hastily into terms of Cyril Milliter's own tottering and fading theosophy.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{follows the}} {{literary}} receptions of one work from Xenophon of Athens (430 - 352 BC.) Throughout various cultural periods his mirror-for-princes Cyropaedia played {{a political and}} educative role. Xenophon {{is a prime example}} of a classical writer who specialized in exemplum texts like Cynegeticus (On Hunting), Peri hippikēs (On horsemanship) and Hipparchicus (Cavalry Commander). More than practical manuals, they should be understood as instructions in aristocratic morals and manners. The political idea of <b>guiding</b> <b>rulers</b> in the best forms of government trough literature was groundbreaking when appearing in some late-bronze age inscriptions in Mesopotamia (1700 BC). Generations later Greek city-states would adopt the literary subject of how to rule, and here we know for certain that writers developed a politically oriented literature, the mirrors- for-princes genre. More specifically developing the genre of poetic instruction. Cyrus the great as ideal of a good ruler fitted in a dawning political debate where oral traditions already had established the first Persian king as an example of good rule. A ruler who gathers all the pre-classical nations and creates a empire of happy and willing subjects. It is likely that Xenophon perceived the historical description of Cyrus life as already documented by Herodotus account established half a century earlier. Most of the story fits Herodotus History but lacks dates and support an unclear borderline between reality and fiction. The work is politically speculative in a literary sense and without negative connotations. The Socratic writers started to address reality by making ideal and fictitious stories with political intentions of influencing their own times (for instance Cyropaedia and Plato s image of the ideal society Atlantis in Kritias). Other contemporary writers soon followed suit and became vessels of a range of fictious ideas about government and governmentality (Isocrates and later Cicero). Historian Christopher Nadon interprets Xenophon s imperial government philosophy as the first complete literary answer to the consitutional discussions that evolved in the Greek city-state systems, while Christopher Whidden calls Cyropaedia ideology for enlightened hedonism. Xenophon made some literary innovations. The first being to portray historical characters biographically, but presented in a fictitous frame. A method that allowed presentations of historical figures with ideal abilities. Abilities that no longer had direct linkage to the Gods but rather were based in the developing philosophical ethics of the Socratic writers. In this way, Cyropaedia could be seen as literature adapted to the new historical reality the Greeks were creating in this period, intended or not. Xenophon also wrote for addressees in the present form. A fact that made Mikhail Bakthin (1895 - 1975) claim that Cyropaedia ought to be considered as the first complete novel since it embodies what is perceived to consitute novels, namely history and fiction at the same time. Regarding its literary reception, one should first name the period in classical Greece (ca. 380 - 325 BC) where it was popular and then certainly became latinized by Cicero (106 - 46 BC) and other Greek-learned Romans that continued its use until the fall of the Roman Empire (476. AD). The work re-emerged during the Italian city-states in the 1350 s and was further adapted by city republics and Christian monarchies in the 14 th century. New research on political literature indicates that texts written with royal themes and with royal addressees dominated literary reception in the early-modern period in Europe. This applied in particular to Cyropaedia that was translated and mentioned in a significant number of mirrors-for-princes texts appearing across Europe, being one of few works maintaining frequent popularity through these periods. Almost every educated person under the Reformation would have been acquainted with Xenophon s work, and notable aristocrats and statesmen in France and England used it in promotion of their own political grounds. Cyropaedia peaked as a published work around the year 1600. Finally it became popular in the absolutist regimes of the 16 th and 17 th century which in the end saw monarchy-oriented literature becoming unpopular. In contrast, parliamentary ideals slowly secured new grounds, especially in England from the 14 th century. Over time monarchical literature notably ceased to attain influence in the Enlightenment due to changing political realities in European states. Cyropaedia certainly became controversial after James I and VI s application of it in claiming his absolutistic regime from 1603. Abolishment of absolutism also came a few decades later in England. After the Reformation the Cyropaedia represented a part of l'ancien regime since the aristocratic and the monarchical literature of instruction both represented old established governmental cultures and became an overt topic of discussion. Political writers were increasingly discarding monarchical texts since monarchical ideals where declining in most European states. Plato would now reprecented a political alternative to Xenophon, ironically since Xenophon s works had done the same with Plato and his more political role in the middelages. Plato appeared as a more neutral choice of classical reference into modernity, leading Cyropaedia into a phase of non-reception after the Enlightenment. Some scholars documented its previous value in reception studies in the 19 th century but it was not after the 1990 s a field of research started looking anew upon the mirror-for-princes and their literary impact in European thinking. My first claim is that Cyropaedia played a role between two major political movements in European thinking that where in ideological conflict from the Renaissance onwards. A classical republican literature represented by Cicero (106 - 43 BC) and later a new republican tradition evolving from writers such as Machiavelli (1469 - 1527) and continued with Voltaire, Rousseau and Hume, amongst others. This stood in political opposition to another tradition, the new monarchical literature that evolved from the fragmented middle-age kingdoms (800 -) and was later transfigured in the Renaissance by writers such as Baldassare Castiglione (1478 - 1529) and Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466 - 1536) who revived the ancient monarchical texts from Greece and Rome. Monarchical ideals moved forward in France and England through famous writers such as Philip Sidney (1554 - 1586), François de Saligiac de la Mothe-Fénelon (1651 - 1715) and Andrew Michael Ramsay (1686 - 1743) until the 16 th century. My second claim is that there are some secular strands in Cyropaedia, especially when Xenophon emphasizes some form of free will in order to educate oneself in the right moral codes. This results in a utility for how to realize ideal behaviour in a continuous development. The secular element is clearly present since Xenophon nowhere implies that the prince needs anything other than correct education and favourable skills to utilize the ideals of virtue (even though some reverence is to be recommended especially in conflicts). In this respect Xenophon s political philosophy was perhaps more secular than Plato s that would maintain the divinity s abstract role in the ruling of the state (in The Republic and others). In modern times Xenophons secular innovation has been taken somewhat for granted, especially after writers such as Machiavelli s and Castiglione s secular claims in their respective mirrors-for- princes, being that nature and nurture are both necessary components of the ruler s capacity, an idea that both where acquainted with in Xenophon s political account and referred to it...|$|R
40|$|The {{workshops}} {{taken at}} the SFU Summer School were all very good and, for the most part, very applicable to my job at AU as a communication officer/writer. Six of the seven courses were equally useful for writing as they were for editing. Each successive course built on the previous ones. There was usually some useful review {{at the beginning of}} each course. The first course was Copyediting and Proofreading. The instructor was Ruth Wilson. Copyediting comes after the substantive edit (re-writing and organizing major parts of a document) and, as such, deals primarily with correcting grammar and usage. Much of the class covered elements of grammar such as spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, number styles, punctuation, wordiness, common writing errors (and non-errors), usage, and also samples of style sheets and how to develop them. Much of this information would be repeated in subsequent courses and this served as an excellent introduction. We learned proper editing and proofreading symbols as well as a useful list of frequently misspelled words. In this course there was a great deal of discussion of the role and responsibility of the editor and how much (and how) the editor might change the writer’s work. The proofreading section dealt with the nuts and bolts required for proofreading (style sheet, quiet, concentration, good light, printed copy of document, <b>ruler,</b> dictionary, style <b>guide)</b> and the kinds of elements to look for in the first, second and third edits. We were also introduced to “Professional Editorials Standards” (2009) from the Editors’ Association of Canada (EAC). The next five courses were of the greatest use to me as a writer and as an editor. The courses included grammar, punctuation and mechanics, usage, style and syntax, all of which are related. This provided more review of grammar and application. The instructor for the grammar course was Vlad Konieczny. In any grammar course there is always something new and some review, as was the case here. My general difficulty with grammar is that while I (usually) know when something is correct or incorrect, I often don’t know the grammatical basis for it; I cannot analyze the sentence. While that is fine as a writer, as an editor, if I’m going to change someone else’s material, I should be able to justify or explain why I’m doing it. This was a very helpful course. The instructor for the next four courses, Frances Peck, is a very knowledgeable and experienced editor and writer. She has an excellent idea of how to apply the material for professional writers and editors. She stressed the importance of consistency. A number of uses, spellings, and style issues were covered which can be correctly handled in a number of different ways. She said the important thing is to choose a style and use it consistently. It is important for an institution, writer, or editor to develop a style sheet (either for the institution or for the particular project) which outlines what style and spellings have been used and the reference material that has been used. I also learned the importance of referring to good style and usage guides such as Fowler’s Modern English Usage and the Chicago Style Guide (Communication and Creative Services at AU uses the Canadian Press Style Guide but the Chicago Style Guide is much more comprehensive.) Usage is the correct application of grammar, how to use the elements of language, and how usage changes over time, such as; -Do not use “action” as a verb as in; It is imperative that you action these items as soon as possible. -You can possibly use (i. e. acceptance is in transition) “access” as a verb as in; You can access the full range of services here. -You can now use “liaise” as a verb (meaning to interact or communicate with) as in; Diane will liaise with the department on this project. The grammar course reviewed accurate usage, commonly misused and confused words and phrases (such as full and fulsome, historic and historical, intense and intensive) and myths, such as never starting a sentence with because and as being more correct than like. As with all of Peck’s classes, exercises were used as the basis for teaching and discussion. Punctuation and mechanics deals with interpretation (punctuation) and esthetics (mechanics). The course started with grammar: parts of speech; clauses and phrases; commas (when superfluous and when needed); comma splices; semicolons; colons; lists; italics; quotation marks; hyphens and dashes (em dashes and en dashes); and apostrophes. Style started with a quick grammar review and defining the steps in the writing process. The course covered consistency (in verb tense, in voice, in person and number, in style or tone), parallelism, flow, transitions, verbs, sentence length and structure, coordination and subordination, passive and active voice, and conciseness. Syntax is the word order within a sentence and the meaning that resides in the way the subject and verb are combined with other words and phrases. Some aspects covered were; the inverted sentence; passive and active voice; rhythm and sentence length, sentence openings, sentence type; flow and content; echo words; emphasis; and special techniques such as isolation and ellipses. Breaking down the various aspects of writing this way was very helpful to isolate and concentrate on one subject at a time. By the end of these five courses, a good review had taken place and a solid foundation had been developed. The last course, Developmental Editing, was the least useful only because it is not something I will ever do. I thought developmental editing was the same things as substantive editing but it is not. In developmental editing, the editor works with a subject matter expert who is not a strong writer and guides them through the writing process. Nonetheless, the instructor, Joy Gugeler, was very knowledgeable and experienced. The discussion of structure, style and organization was helpful to some extent in terms of writing. The discussion of particular books and elements such as plot, character, narrative, genre, etc., was very interesting from a reader’s point of view. In all of the courses, there were a number of good resources (print and online) recommended which will provide excellent reference material. Follow up for me will include the following: -Develop a style sheet which I will use consistently for my writing and which could be used as the basis of a style sheet for the department and/or university; -Organize the material from these courses into some format for easy reference (perhaps alphabetical list or subject matter list); -Purchase some of the resource material for the office; -Find ways to continue to improve my familiarity and knowledge of grammar and my knowledge of available grammar resources. Copy Editing and Proofreading: (2 days) This two-day workshop is ideal for anyone wanting an introduction to the world of publishing or communications, or for anyone currently called upon to improve the writing of others in their organization. The class incorporates group discussion and hands-on exercises while covering the following topics: editing marks; copyeditor’s responsibilities; finding and noting mistakes in spelling, punctuation, and grammar; striving for consistency; preparing style sheets; proofreading marks; the proofreader’s responsibilities; the proofreading process; technology and proofreading. Fundamentals of Grammar: (1 day) One of the best ways to increase confidence as a writer or editor is to gain a good command of grammar. If you find yourself occasionally confused by participles and gerunds, puzzled by dangling and squinting modifiers, and confounded by which and that or who and whom, this one-day workshop is for you. You will spend the morning reviewing the parts of speech, as well as phrases and clauses, punctuation, and sentence structure. The afternoon will be devoted to analyzing and correcting common errors. Punctuation and Mechanics: (1 day) Anyone who has agonized over a comma or a hyphen knows how tricky the details of punctuation and mechanics can be. We’ll take a systematic approach to the troublesome areas of punctuation and mechanics, focusing on commas (always the source of debate), semicolons, colons, bullet points, quotation marks, italics, apostrophes, and dashes (em and en). We’ll cover the most recent rules, discuss when more than one approach might be correct, and examine the leading style guides. Be prepared to practice, and bring along your most challenging questions. Punctuation and Mechanics will benefit editors and writers who need a refresher on the tricky areas of punctuation and mechanics. Usage Woes and Myths: (1 day) Word usage is an ever-changing area. First it’s wrong to use impact as a verb; then it’s okay. The distinction between fewer and less seems clear, but specific examples make you hesitate. You wonder about debated words such as hopefully and presently, and confusing words such as may and might. You’ve heard that you should never start a sentence with however, but, or because, but you’re not sure. If you are intent on preventing (not avoiding) word errors and avoiding (not preventing) usage myths, this workshop will help. Through discussion, examples, and exercises, we will review some of the most contentious points of English usage. Come prepared with your own usage questions and examples to share with the group. Usage Woes and Myths will benefit editors and writers who need an intensive review of recent changes and errors in word usage. Clear and Concise - Guidelines for Style: (1 day) Clear, concise writing may seem like the product of magic, instinct, or luck, but the pros know that it’s the result of learned techniques. This workshop covers tried-and-true revision techniques that improve consistency, clarity, flow, and conciseness. We’ll identify and eliminate shifts, link ideas using parallelism and subordination, trim wordy structures, and unearth the power of verbs. Through discussion, examples, and exercises, you’ll amass an arsenal of methods for making every word count. Clear and Concise will benefit writers and editors who want to know the best practical techniques for streamlining prose. The Secrets of Syntax: (1 day) This workshop looks at syntax from various angles, including how to shape it for different documents and audiences. Topics include subordination and coordination, periodic versus cumulative sentences, proximity of subject and verb, echo words, and special techniques such as ellipsis and isolation.  The Secrets of Syntax will benefit writers and editors who want a more systematic understanding of how reshaping language can make it clearer and more powerful. Developmental Editing for Fiction and Non-fiction: (2 days) This two-day workshop will demonstrate how assessment criteria, a survey of alternative options, market research, and some astute analysis can turn a half-baked idea into a fully cooked work that reaches readers. Using examples taken from students’ own works and before-and-after demos of real books and edits, you will be able to see how to apply judgment and new skills to the work at hand...|$|R
