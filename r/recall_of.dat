5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Sexual Preference {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} the psychologist Clarence Tripp in the Journal of Sex Research and the sociologist Ira Reiss in Contemporary Sociology, mixed reviews from the sociologist John DeLamater in Science and the sex researcher James D.

Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample of homosexuals, and that their reliance on path analysis and adult <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> early childhood feeling was problematic.|$|E

Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E

5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{calls for a}} public competition, William Wyon's son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen {{interest}} in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in the <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the selection panel. The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E

5|$|In 723, al-Harashi was {{replaced}} as governor by Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, who resolved late {{the next year}} to launch an expedition {{with the goal of}} seizing Ferghana. The campaign faced difficulties already in its early stages, when the news arrived of the accession of a new Caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, and the appointment of a new governor of Iraq, Khalid al-Qasri. This brought the long-simmering tribal rivalries of the Arabs of Khurasan came to the fore: the Yemeni (southern Arab) troops in Balkh initially refused to join the campaign, as they expected the imminent <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> al-Kilabi (who was of northern Arab stock) by the new regime. Only after Nasr ibn Sayyar led a force of Mudaris (northern Arabs) against them and defeated them at Baruqan did the Yemenis join al-Kilabi's army. The campaign eventually went ahead as Khalid al-Qasri wrote to al-Kilabi, urging him to proceed with it until his replacement, Khalid's brother Asad, arrived in Khurasan. Nevertheless, 4,000 troops from the Yemeni Azd tribe withdrew from the army.|$|E
5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{returned}} to Parliament with the <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the Rump and Long Parliaments by General Monck, but following the Restoration in 1660, he was {{excluded from the}} Indemnity and Oblivion Act, because of {{his role in the}} trial and execution of Charles I. He was captured in Warwickshire while trying to travel to Ireland, under his first wife's maiden name of Busbridge. He was held in the Tower of London before being tried as a regicide. He tried to avoid the death penalty by saying that he had only acted as a judge in Charles I's trial in order to give information to the Royalists. He went on to claim that he had tried to prevent the King's execution, begging Oliver Cromwell to spare him. He did avoid execution and was sentenced to life imprisonment. As a result of security concerns, a number of regicides, including Temple were sent to Jersey in the Channel Islands. Initially he was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil, and subsequently in Elizabeth Castle, where he is reported to have died on 17 February 1680.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hebbian hetero-associative {{learning}} is inherently asymmetric. Storing a forward association from pattern A to pattern B enables the <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern B given pattern A. This, in general, {{does not allow}} the <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern A given pattern B. The forward association between A and B will tend to be stronger than the backward association between B and A. In this paper it is described how the dynamical associative model proposed in [10] can be extended to create a bi-directional associative memory where forward association between A and B is equal to backward association between B and A. This implies that storing a forward association, from pattern A to pattern B, would enable the <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern B given pattern A and the <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern A given pattern B. We give some formal results that support {{the functioning of the}} proposal, and provide some examples were the proposal finds application. ...|$|R
