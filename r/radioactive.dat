5|$|This element was {{the first}} one {{discovered}} by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity. Pitchblende, after removal of the <b>radioactive</b> elements uranium and thorium, was more <b>radioactive</b> than the uranium and thorium combined. This spurred the Curies to search for additional <b>radioactive</b> elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated radium.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{atmospheric}} {{release of}} <b>radioactive</b> gas followed the Soviet Chagan test of 15 January 1965 in present-day Kazakhstan. Roughly 20% of the <b>radioactive</b> debris {{produced by the}} 140-kiloton detonation was released into the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan. The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent action was taken. On 25 April 1966, the Pin Stripe underground test in Nevada (part of Operation Flintlock) experienced a venting malfunction and produced a <b>radioactive</b> plume headed towards the Midwestern US; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are <b>radioactive</b> {{and release}} energy upon <b>radioactive</b> decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium {{are the most}} abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium {{is used in the}} ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are <b>radioactive.</b> Caesium was also thought to be <b>radioactive</b> in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly <b>radioactive.</b> This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly <b>radioactive,</b> with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{lanthanum}} oxide (or lanthana) {{has a similar}} effect as cerium, and is also not <b>radioactive.</b>|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of <b>radioactive</b> isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the <b>radioactive</b> phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of <b>radioactive</b> isotopes as <b>radioactive</b> tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{are thrilled}} {{to hear that}} a film version of their {{favorite}} comic book series, <b>Radioactive</b> Man, is in production. Rainier Wolfcastle, {{the star of the}} McBain films, is chosen to play <b>Radioactive</b> Man, and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children, the production moves to their town. A search is launched for a young actor to play <b>Radioactive</b> Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected for being an inch too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} levels of <b>radioactive</b> contamination, her papers from the 1890s are {{considered}} too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly <b>radioactive.</b> Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and {{those who wish to}} consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus {{have a high}} {{capacity}} to accumulate <b>radioactive</b> caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium. In contrast, the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the <b>radioactive</b> isotope 210Po.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists {{occupied}} the Lucas Heights facility {{to protest the}} construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level <b>radioactive</b> waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of <b>radioactive</b> waste from the facility.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the <b>radioactive</b> elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various <b>radioactive</b> elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} <b>radioactive</b> element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the <b>radioactive</b> element was incorporated into the rock. <b>Radioactive</b> elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radioactive</b> {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of <b>radioactive</b> isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous <b>radioactive</b> poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes <b>radioactive</b> decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E

5|$|Technetium, with {{atomic number}} (denoted Z) 43, is the lowest-numbered {{element in the}} {{periodic}} table of which all isotopes are <b>radioactive.</b> The second-lightest exclusively <b>radioactive</b> element, promethium, has an atomic number of 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when {{the total number of}} nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} types of {{brachytherapy}} treatment {{in terms of}} the placement of the <b>radioactive</b> source are interstitial and contact.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level <b>radioactive</b> waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent <b>radioactive</b> waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing <b>radioactive</b> wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. <b>Radioactive</b> waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
5|$|Titanium becomes <b>radioactive</b> upon {{bombardment}} with deuterons, emitting mainly positrons {{and hard}} gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Twenty <b>radioactive</b> {{isotopes}} {{of plutonium}} have been characterized. The longest-lived are plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8million years, plutonium-242, with a half-life of 373,300years, and plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,110years. All {{of the remaining}} <b>radioactive</b> isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000years. This element also has eight metastable states, though all have half-lives less than one second.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-eight {{artificial}} isotopes of zirconium {{have been}} synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 78 to 110. 93Zr is the longest-lived artificial isotope, with a half-life of 1.53×106years. 110Zr, the heaviest isotope of zirconium, {{is the most}} <b>radioactive,</b> with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. <b>Radioactive</b> isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by electron emission, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission. The only exception is 88Zr, which decays by electron capture.|$|E
5|$|A Maralinga cleanup {{operation}} codenamed Operation Brumby {{was conducted}} in 1967. Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of <b>radioactive</b> material by turning over and mixing the surface soil. Additionally, {{the remains of the}} firings, including plutonium-contaminated fragments, were buried in 22 concrete-capped pits.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} <b>radioactive</b> leak {{was reported}} in 2013; the clean up was estimated to have cost $40billion with $115billion more required.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing <b>radioactive</b> yttrium-90. The <b>radioactive</b> microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{contaminated}} and <b>radioactive</b> materials stored {{at the former}} LOOW siteincluding thorium, uranium, and the world’s largest concentration of radium-226were placed into the structure.|$|E
5|$|All other cerium {{isotopes}} are synthetic and <b>radioactive.</b> The {{most stable}} {{of them are}} 144Ce with a half-life of 284.9days, 139Ce with a half-life of 137.6days, 143Ce with a half-life of 33.04days, and 141Ce with a half-life of 32.5days. All other <b>radioactive</b> cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with <b>radioactive</b> contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so <b>radioactive</b> that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|As noted, the <b>radioactive</b> {{nature of}} {{technetium}} (3MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical {{in almost all}} situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.|$|E
5|$|As {{of early}} April 2010, more than 200 environmentalists and {{indigenous}} people gathered in Tennant Creek to oppose a <b>radioactive</b> waste dump being built on Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Because denser {{materials}} absorb more <b>radioactive</b> emissions than lighter ones, {{heavy metals}} {{are useful for}} radiation shielding and to focus radiation beams in linear accelerators and radiotherapy applications.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various <b>radioactive</b> isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of <b>radioactive</b> iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
