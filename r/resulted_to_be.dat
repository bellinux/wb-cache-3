2500|$|Haplogroup E-V68 (E1b1b1a) is {{presented}} at levels 19.6% per 880 samples. The ultimate origin of E-V68 points to northeastern Africa, specifically near the Nile and Lake Alexandria. Thus this haplogroup represents {{a more recent}} Bronze Age [...] "out of Africa" [...] movement into Europe via the Balkans. The macro-haplogroup E still prevails {{in most of the}} African continent, but through the long-term migrations the sub-Saharian maternal lineage Hg L was lost lacking completely in the Balkans. Holocene movement into the Near East is proposed, then several thousand years ago, a movement into the Balkans. [...] All V68-positive Bulgarians belong to its M78 subclade, which is the prevailing haplogroup in most of northeast Africa and around the Balkans. [...] The presently mostly European V13 (E1b1b1a1b1a) originated in western Asia according to the most plausible scenario and {{is presented}} at ~18% among Bulgarian males. [...] According to deeply traced data its internal structure is divided among Z5016, Z5017 and S7461. Recent findings of V13 in a Neolithic context in Iberia (dated to ~ 7 kya) give a terminus ante quem. However, it might have really begun to expand in the Balkans somewhat later, perhaps during the population growth of the Bronze Age. It <b>resulted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the dominant haplogroup in the former Burgas, Lovech, Montana and Razgrad province, from 20% to 38%. Like I-P37 above, it is rather limited to Europe but peaks in the Balkans, only for the Albanians, Greeks, Macedonians, various Romani, Montenegrins, Serbs and Romanians are recorded higher levels than Bulgarians. It has been detected on ancient Thracian remain from Bulgaria. An odd low frequency of Haplogroup E of 10% is recorded in the capital Sofia, which is the lowest on the Balkan peninsula after Croatia and the same level is observed as far as Berlin.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that because open rescue {{virtually}} guarantees that the activists will be found and convicted due to the publication of their identities, open rescue can be construed as a more resource-demanding method compared to clandestine methods. According to this, open rescue would allegedly require more money, as the resulting convictions following the actions means that fines have to be paid and damages have to be compensated. In addition, more manpower could be needed as the activists could be imprisoned. This is seen as a waste of resources and people which could be used to rescue even more animals. However, all these claims have <b>resulted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wrong in practice. In part because of the sympathies that open rescuers gain from the public, legal actions against them are uncommon, even if the identities of the rescuers is known.|$|E

This eventually segued into building houses, as Villar took out a seven-year loan from a rural bank offering low interest rates.

A notable innovation of Villar's companies was to sell house and lot packages, when the common practice at the time was to sell lots for future homeowners to build upon. He initiated mass housing projects through economies of scale, utilizing the cost advantages of developing a large-scale project in order to bring down housing prices. The number of homes built by Villar's companies totaled to over 200,000 units.|$|E

5000|$|Saccharomyces boulardii is a {{tropical}} species of yeast first isolated from lychee and mangosteen fruit in 1923 by French scientist Henri Boulard. Although early reports described distinct taxonomic, metabolic, and genetic properties, S. boulardii (synonym: S. cerevisiae var boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen CBS 5926) is {{a strain of}} S. cerevisiae, sharing >99% genomic relatedness. S. boulardii is sometimes used as a probiotic {{with the purpose of}} introducing beneficial active cultures into the large and small intestine, as well as conferring protection against pathogenic microorganisms in the host. [...] However, in immunocompromised individuals, S. boulardii has been associated with fungemia or localized infection, which may be fatal. Overall, S. boulardii is safe for use in otherwise healthy populations and fungemia with S. boulardii has not been reported, to the best of the recent evidences in immunocompetent patients. In HIV-1-infected patients the therapy with Sb <b>resulted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> safe.Boulard first isolated this yeast after he observed natives of Southeast Asia chewing on the skin of lychee and mangosteen in an attempt to control the symptoms of cholera. In healthy patients, S. boulardii {{has been shown to be}} nonpathogenic and nonsystemic (it remains in the gastrointestinal tract rather than spreading elsewhere in the body). It grows at 37 °C (98.6 °F). In addition, the popular genome editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 was proven to be effective in S. boulardii.|$|E
