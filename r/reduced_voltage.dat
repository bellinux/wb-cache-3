Adding on-chip decoupling capacitors (decaps) is {{an effective way to}} <b>reduce</b> <b>voltage</b> noise in a on-chip power delivery system. In this paper, we propose an efficient and novel algorithm to allocate decaps in an area efficient way. The new algorithm applies the sequence of linear programming based approach to searching the minimum decap area to <b>reduce</b> <b>voltage</b> drop below user specified threshold. We show existing sensitivity based decap allocation algorithms tend to over estimate the decap areas due to nonlinear sensitivity dependence on decap values. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm uses significantly less decap area than the existing conjugate gradient based approach but with similar CPU runtimes. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reducing</b> <b>voltage</b> to <b>reduce</b> energy consumption, {{referred}} to as conservation voltage reduction (CVR), can lead to energy savings. Calculating the effects of <b>reducing</b> <b>voltage</b> requires accurate load models. This paper investigates a load-voltage dependency factor that can be measured via field experiments using common existing instrumentation. A relationship between the load-voltage dependency factor {{and the percentage of}} the load that is constant impedance and the percentage that is constant power is presented. A new coordinated control algorithm using the load-voltage dependency factor measured by the field experiments is proposed. Parametric studies are presented which compare CVR with coordinated control versus traditional control. Across the two model comparisons of minimizing energy consumption, the coordinated control for conservation voltage reduction showed significant energy reduction over local control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} (i) {{a resource}} constrained scheduling scheme and (ii) a latency-constrained scheduling scheme that minimize power consumption {{for the case}} when the resources operate at multiple voltages. The resource-constrained scheduling reduces the power consumption by maximally utilizing resources operating at <b>reduced</b> <b>voltages</b> {{and at the same}} time reducing the latency. The latency-constrained scheduling scheme reduces the power consumption by assigning as many nodes (of the data flow graph) as possible to the resources operating at <b>reduced</b> <b>voltages.</b> Two cases have been studied: one in which the possible operating voltages are 5 V and 3. 3 V, and the other in which the operating voltages are 5 V, 3. 3 V and 2. 4 V.
