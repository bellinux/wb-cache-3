5|$|During their {{modernization}} {{under the}} 600-ship Navy program, the Iowa-class battleships' radar systems were again upgraded. The AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system {{was replaced with}} the AN/SPS-49 <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> {{was replaced by the}} AN/SPS-67 search radar.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 <b>radar</b> <b>set,</b> the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set. A second seat was added for the radar operator.|$|E

5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was mounted on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> was emplaced on the rear main battery gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 X band radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Green Pine operates at L band - in the range 500 MHz to 1,000MHz, or 1,000MHz to 2,000MHz.|$|E
5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed that}} a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg <b>radar</b> <b>set.</b> It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> were produced in Australia during the war.|$|R
5|$|Frost {{also met}} RAF Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox, who {{had volunteered to}} {{accompany}} C Company for the operation; as an expert radio mechanic, {{it would be his}} job to locate the Würzburg <b>radar</b> <b>set,</b> photograph it, and to dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain. Derek Garrard of Jones' team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox, as he would be the object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform, but the War Office were obdurate.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, {{but there were}} numerous technical difficulties with this. The <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> {{had to be made}} small enough to fit inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes had to first withstand the 20,000 g force of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Cockcroft became Assistant Director of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Supply, {{working on}} radar. He {{was also a}} member of the {{committee}} formed to handle issues arising from the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which calculated that an atomic bomb could be technically feasible, and of the MAUD Committee which succeeded it. In 1940, as part of the Tizard Mission, he shared British technology with his counterparts in the United States. Later in the war, the fruits of the Tizard Mission came back to Britain in the form of the SCR-584 <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> and the proximity fuze, which were used to defeat the V-1 flying bomb. In May 1944, he became director of the Montreal Laboratory, and oversaw the development of the ZEEP and NRX reactors, and the creation of the Chalk River Laboratories.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>sets</b> {{obtained}} from confiscated Iraqi MiG-21 planes were planted around the SAM sites {{to serve as}} active emitter decoys, which diverted some anti-radiation missiles from the actual targets (dozens of Iraqi MiG-21/23 warplanes, sent to Yugoslavia for industrial overhaul, were seized in 1991, after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.) Retired SAM <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> were used as optical decoys, left at well-known military bases to lure NATO planes to waste munition on worthless targets. Owing to these measures, Dani's unit evaded 23 incoming HARM missiles, all of which impacted off-site with insignificant or zero damages.|$|R

5000|$|AN/MPN-3 {{is similar}} to the MPN-1A except that it had single, rather than dual <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> for each channel, {{improved}} mobility because of decreased weight, fewer communications channels, and reduced number of personnel.|$|R
5|$|Her radar fit now {{included}} a Type 277 <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> {{to replace her}} Type 273 for surface warning. Her Type 281 air warning set {{was replaced by a}} single-antenna Type 281B set, while a Type 293Q was fitted for close-range height-finding and surface warning. A Type 274 set was fitted for main armament fire direction. On 17 June 1945, with the war in Europe at an end, Belfast sailed for the Far East via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo and Sydney. By the time she arrived in Sydney on 7 August Belfast had been made flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet. While in Sydney Belfast underwent another short refit, supplementing her close-range armament with five 40mm Bofors guns. Belfast had been expected to join in Operation Downfall, but this was forestalled by the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{first thing}} {{he had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a <b>radar</b> <b>set.</b> The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E

50|$|In May, Ise had an {{accident}} which flooded her No. 2 engine room. During repair work, Ise was fitted {{with one of the}} first experimental model Type 21 <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> in the Japanese navy.|$|R
25|$|Later in the war, the Bedford Army Air Field {{served as}} a site for testing new <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> {{developed}} by MIT's Radiation Laboratory. It was this secondary wartime activity at Hanscom {{that gave rise to}} the base's postwar role.|$|R
5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a <b>radar</b> <b>set,</b> and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E
