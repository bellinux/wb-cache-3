5|$|There are two {{connected}} Underground stations at Victoria, {{on different}} levels and built {{more than a}} century apart. The older one, {{on the north side of}} the bus station, serves the District and Circle lines, constructed by 'cut and cover' methods just below <b>road</b> <b>level.</b> The newer station, closer to the main line station, serves the Victoria line, a deep-level tube. Each has its own ticket hall, and the two are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the bus station.|$|E
5|$|The Liffey River—then called Pennyroyal Creek—was first bridged at Carrick in 1828 with {{a simple}} log structure. This was {{replaced}} in the 1830s with a more substantial bridge, though still wooden. As of 1834 the areas' roads were poor and vehicles frequently became bogged {{on the road to}} Westbury. A bridge over the South Esk, at what is now Hadspen, was built in 1843. It replaced a frequently impassable ford and more reliably connected Carrick to Launceston. Liffey bridge was repaired and raised in the mid-1860s, keeping the original foundations. In May 1875 water sufficiently eroded these foundations to lead to the bridge's collapse, when one of the two supporting piles (logs) gave way. All of the Liffey bridges, and the connecting parts of the road, were subject to inundation when the river flooded; the 1929 Tasmanian Floods carried the bridge away. In the 1950s the road was reconstructed and the bridge again replaced. To reduce the incidence and impact of flooding both were raised substantially leaving the mill's ground floor far below the <b>road</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hercules was out {{of service}} after the Burmarsh <b>Road</b> <b>level</b> {{crossing}} incident in 2003, and Samson was withdrawn from service for an intermediate overhaul shortly afterwards. Once both locomotives were back in service, the railway {{was faced with a}} tender shortage. Samson was kept from mainline service while Hercules was coupled to the tender from Green Goddess while it was stored prior to overhaul. During the 2007 season, Samson saw service using the tender from Hurricane while it was being overhauled (a situation that had also happened in 1949 when Samson was used for ballast train duties).|$|E
25|$|Construction {{has started}} on the <b>road</b> <b>level</b> part between station K1 and K5 so far. This should be a tram based LRT and {{although}} the official Transportation Department claims that this line is still under planning, work has been ongoing since April 2016. From station K6 to K9 the tracks will be elevated. The initial work between station K6 and K7 have been done and is clearly visible on Google maps. It's passing through a cemetery and will be going across Ankang Road. It's currently unknown when this line is planned to open, but as it connects to station Y7 on the circular line (also known as line 6) which is still under construction, it's unlikely to open until that line is finished.|$|E
25|$|Five windows flank {{either side}} of the portico to create a simple, clean and {{balanced}} façade.

25|$|A railway {{inspector}} authorised by the Office of Rail Regulation {{inspected the}} section between Dereham and Hoe {{prior to the}} first passenger train using the track, the inspector set out rules governing the frequency of use and the necessary inspection regime that should be used on this section {{as well as the}} maximum speed permitted. The inspector limited the use of the line north of Dereham to 12 days per year for passenger trains {{due to the lack of}} operational signalling equipment in the Dereham station area and the absence of a Facing Point Lock on the points immediately north of Norwich <b>Road</b> <b>level</b> crossing, this legally means they must be clipped and locked manually prior to use by passenger trains. The speed limit north of Dereham is 15mph due to the condition of the track, the speed limit could be increased by adding additional ballast.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Panmure had grown substantially. The {{condition}} of the station, however, had deteriorated. The original station building had been replaced by a much smaller one, the northern footbridge had been removed, and the platform itself had begun to deteriorate. In addition, patronage was low (recorded as 83 boardings per day in 2003) and the station was not located close to the town centre. It was therefore decided to close the original Panmure Station and open a new station between Ellerslie-Panmure Highway and Mountain Road. The new station would be more modern, be closer to the town centre, and provide better connections with bus services. The new Panmure Station opened {{in the first half of}} 2007. The station has two side platforms, located below <b>road</b> <b>level.</b> Access is from Ellerslie-Panmure Highway, Mountain Road, and the carpark. A park and ride facility is located adjacent to the eastbound platform. The station's relocation had a significant effect on patronage with recorded daily boardings climbing from 268 in 2006 to 446 in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} station, as {{it remains}} in 2009, was sited above <b>road</b> <b>level.</b> The station office was {{located on the}} platform [...] "island" [...] that forms platforms 2 and 3, which were accessed by {{a flight of stairs}} where the ticket office is now. Passengers accessed the other two platforms by a footbridge, which was removed after the lines were electrified. Cheadle Hulme was also used as a goods depot until 31 October 1964, when goods trains were withdrawn. The goods yard is now a car park.|$|E

500|$|Several {{obstacles}} remain {{before the}} canal restoration can be completed. To join the two navigable sections a new bridge {{would be needed}} where the canal is culverted under Commercial Road, and the infilled section to Abergarwed {{would need to be}} excavated. The original bridge at Commercial Road is buried beneath the new embankment, and so there is sufficient headroom available through the embankment without major alterations to the <b>road</b> <b>level.</b> Rebuilding of the two Abergarwed locks and Resolven lock would then create a single stretch of canal some [...] long. Extension to the south is blocked by a bridge at water level in Neath, but in 2009 Neath Port Talbot Council commissioned the Prince's Foundation and British Petroleum to investigate options for the regeneration of the Canal Green area, between the river and the railway line, and the proposals suggested that it should be replaced by a lifting or bascule bridge.|$|E
500|$|The Chatham Main Line and Sutton Loop railway lines through Herne Hill are {{elevated}} above <b>road</b> <b>level</b> on a brick viaduct {{that runs}} north–south. The station's 1862 Gothic, polychrome brick building {{is on the}} western side of the viaduct, with access the station also from the east via a foot tunnel from Milkwood Road. The building houses a ticket office and newsagent, and was Grade II listed in 1998: the listing notes the station's arched doorways, Welsh slate roof and decorative brickwork. It was described by Cherry and Pevsner as a [...] "handsome group" [...] and featured on the cover of a book about London's railway architecture. The station entrance canopy (which had been shortened and altered in the mid 20th century) was removed in 2015 due to its disrepair and a new one installed in July 2016 with a new timber valance design and cornice based on the original Victorian one.|$|E
500|$|The largest cutting on the {{construction}} was at Horseshoe Bend. It was [...] long and cut [...] into the rock at its deepest point.

It was composed of six 42-foot, 6-inch (12.95 m) arches, with abutments embedded in the rock [...] below. It was supported by three piers at , [...] and [...] below <b>road</b> <b>level.</b> Construction of the viaduct was delayed owing to the tidal flow of the River Avon and the irregularity of the rock. A skew girder bridge was constructed to cross the Severn Beach Railway near Sea Mills station, with foundations up to [...] below the surface.
