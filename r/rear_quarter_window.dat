2500|$|While {{the last}} Bel Air 2-door sedan was {{available}} in the USA in 1969, Chevrolet introduced a Canadian market-only two door hardtop, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, from 1970-75. [...] Based on the Impala Sport Coupe, this new model featured Bel Air trim {{at a lower price}} than the Impala. [...] Each year through 1975, this model's body followed the design of the contemporary Impala Sport Coupe. [...] The 4-door sedan and station wagon continued in production, identical to the U.S. models. [...] For 1976, the Canadian Bel Air Coupe featured the same body as the Impala Custom Coupe, with the large fixed <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> and frameless front door glass.|$|E

2500|$|With the Laguna {{nameplate}} now {{bearing the}} sporty {{model in the}} Chevelle line, the top-line series for 1974 was the new Malibu Classic series (which was marketed as the upscale luxury trim level similar to the Chevrolet Caprice Classic), offered in sedan, coupe and station wagon models. Unlike the 1973 Laguna, the Malibu Classic used the same front end and chrome bumper as the lesser (Malibu) models, but the smaller vertical rear quarter [...] "opera" [...] windows and a spring-loaded hood ornament were featured. Early '74 Classic coupes required the vinyl roof option; apparently inserts were used to cover part of the big <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window.</b> [...] Later '74s were available with a standard painted roof that included the smaller [...] "opera" [...] window. [...] Inside, the Malibu Classic featured luxurious interiors with notchback bench seats upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels and woodgrain instrument panel trim. Optional on Malibu Classic coupes were swivel bucket seats (with console) in cloth or vinyl. [...] The base Deluxe series was dropped for 1974, making the Malibu the base model. Base engines were the 250-cubic-inch six and the 350-cubic-inch V8.|$|E
50|$|Two {{body styles}} were available, a 6-light saloon and 4-light sports saloon. The 6-light saloon had a <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to a 6-window saloon) while the 4-light sports saloon had the lack of the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> (sometimes {{referred to a}} 4-window saloon).|$|E

The hardtop coupes {{got a new}} semi-fastback roofline with a reverse-slanted trailing edge on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three-door van: Sold only in Europe. Uses {{the same}} {{bodyshell}} as the three-door hatchback, modified with solid panels {{in place of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> and a flat load floor replacing the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 MK III had larger <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> light <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{was designed}} to bear family resemblance to the Nissan Rogue, while still maintaining distinctly Murano cues with an aggressive front fascia and <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows.</b> The interior was completely redesigned, {{with the use of}} a more traditional instrument cluster and notably higher-quality materials.|$|R
5000|$|The 870 Aero-Eight was {{technically}} {{much the}} same in 1919 but there were now seven bodies to choose from at prices between $2,595 and $3,795 for the new town car and the [...] "Tourcoupe". Some closed bodies got an octagonal <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> as a [...] "beauty" [...] feature. That year, 6,225 Coles were built.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980, the gas 350 was {{replaced}} with the 368 except in California, where the Oldsmobile 350 was used. In both the 1980 Seville and Eldorado (which shared frames) the 368s came with DEFI (later known as throttle body injection when it was later used with other GM corporate engines), whereas in the larger RWD Cadillacs it came only with a 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor. Independent rear suspension was adopted, helping retain rear-seat and trunk room in the smaller body. The most notable styling touch was an extreme notchback roofline. The Eldorado Biarritz model resurrected the stainless-steel roof concept from the first Brougham. The Eldorado featured frameless door glass, and the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> re-appeared as they did before 1971, without a thick [...] "B" [...] pillar. The cars were not true hardtops, as the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> were fixed. Sales set a new record at 67,436.|$|R

5000|$|... in 1959, seven 250 GT Berlinetta [...] "Interim" [...] LWB coup√©s were made. They {{utilized}} the old long-wheelbase chassis {{and had the}} new Pinin Farina bodywork of the upcoming SWB Berlinettas. The bodies are all-aluminum. Interim vehicles have an additional <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window,</b> absent from the succeeding [...] "Passo Corto" [...] Berlinettas.

5000|$|The 90 was {{launched}} in 1948 along with the smaller-engined Sunbeam-Talbot 80 but many features dated back to the pre war Sunbeam-Talbot 2 Litre. The body, available as a 4-door 4-light sports saloon or 2-door drophead coupe, appeared completely new though it continued some major pressings. The saloon featured the original Aero-Minx [...] "pillarless" [...] join between the glass on the rear door and the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> with its distinctive Sunbeam-Talbot reverse slope.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, the [...] "Premiere Roof" [...] {{option was}} {{available}} giving the standard Brougham a very formal look. Though costly at US$895, it altered the overall appearance greatly. It included a vinyl covering {{of not only}} the entire roof of the car but also the [...] "B-pillar" [...] and the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> surround. This option was available in 1988 and 1989 until Brougham's 1990 restyling wherein a slight variation of it became the standard roof treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Century Specials {{were usually}} powered by Buick's own 231 V6; a V8 (from either Buick, Oldsmobile, or Chevrolet) was rarely optioned. It used the [...] "colonnade" [...] {{roofline}} but was {{fitted with a}} landau roof that covered most of the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows.</b> The opening that was left was the same shape as the windows on the higher series formal-roof cars.|$|R
50|$|The 1971s {{offered a}} new Sport Fury 4-door sedan, and a coupe (similar to the Sport Fury hardtop but with fixed <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows)</b> in the Fury I series. A hardtop coupe was now {{available}} in the Fury II series, and a Formal Hardtop was available for both Sport Fury and Fury III.

50|$|The Elite {{name was}} also used in Mexico. The Ford Fairmont was {{introduced}} in Mexico in late 1977 as a 1978 model, replacing the Ford Maverick that was produced there locally. The Futura coupe with its distinctive Thunderbird-styled roofline was never offered in Mexico. Instead there was an uplevel 2-door sedan called the Fairmont Elite. It was distinguished from other Fairmonts by its higher level of equipment and vinyl roof. It used the four headlight grille from the Fairmont Futura along with Mercury Zephyr taillamps and <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> louvers. For 1981, the Fairmont Elite switched to the Mercury Zephyr grille.|$|E

A Pinto Squire wagon featured faux wood side paneling similar to the full-size Country Squire.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} tie-up {{with the}} Rover Group the European Accord spawned Rover's {{replacement}} for the Austin Montego in 1993.

2500|$|Post war {{cars had}} a rationalized window {{arrangement}}. The windows and pillars were narrower, {{and there were}} small [...] "standee" [...] windows above each window.

Cars were shipped from Sweden in CKD form, then assembled at the facility. Production on average at the Dartmouth Plant was about 15 cars per day. At the new facility, production increased to over 36 cars a day. And, in 1974, production at the plant increased to more than 12,000 vehicles a year.

50|$|The Puma {{had been}} {{imported}} into South Africa after 1986, but after costs became prohibitive the importer bought the molds to the 1973 Puma 1600 GTE and began building them locally. 26 cars were finished by Jack Wijker's Puma Marketing company between 1989 and 1991. Some {{of the later}} cars had <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> replacing the louvres behind the rear door. In 2006, limited production of the Puma was once again started up in South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the XR2i, {{introduced}} a year earlier, it was visually similar. The main differences were 14" [...] alloy wheels (an inch larger {{and of a}} different design than those fitted to the XR2i) with 185/55 VR14 Pirelli P600 tyres, green rather than blue stripe mouldings, colour-coded rear spoiler and door pillars, opening <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>windows,</b> green tinted glass and RS bonnet louvres.
