500|$|Throughout its {{tenure in}} Vermont, Steamtown {{provided}} {{several types of}} excursions, primarily {{in the summer and}} during the peak foliage season of the autumn. [...] Occasionally, these trips would be lengthy, like one that ran from Boston to Montreal, or those that ran between Bellows Falls and Rutland, Vermont. [...] On a daily basis the excursions ran from <b>Riverside</b> <b>station</b> in Bellows Falls to Chester depot. [...] The cost of the trip, which in 1977 was $5.75 for an adult and $2.95 for a child, was combined with entrance into the museum, which was the grounds of <b>Riverside</b> <b>station.</b> The station was located about [...] outside of town and was situated {{on the bank of the}} Connecticut River. [...] One newspaper travel writer, Bill Rice, described the [...] trip from Riverside to Chester: [...] "The trip to Chester affords a beautiful view of unspoiled Vermont countryside-covered bridges, vintage farms with grazing livestock and cornfield and a winding river with a deep gorge and picturesque waterfall." [...] The river that Rice referred to was the Williams River, which crossed the route of the train seven times. [...] The waterfall was at Brockway Mills Gorge and was seen from a bridge [...] above the gorge. [...] Rice also said that at the time he was writing, 1977, Steamtown had the largest collection of steam locomotives in the world.|$|E

500|$|In 1971, the Board of Health of Vermont {{issued a}} waiver to the GMRC for Vermont's air {{pollution}} regulations. [...] The waiver permitted {{the operation of}} steam locomotive excursions between Steamtown's <b>Riverside</b> <b>station</b> at Bellows Falls, and Chester depot. [...] In 1974, as the state of Vermont prepared for its celebration of the country's bicentenary, in which the Steamtown excursion featured prominently, {{the subject of the}} air pollution regulations came up again. [...] The tourist attraction was operating on temporary permits that allowed it to operate excursions in Vermont. [...] By 1976, the relationship between Steamtown and GMRC deteriorated as the two organizations fought over maintenance of the tracks, which were owned by the state of Vermont.|$|E

[...] Until the introduction of weekend service on the 91 Line in July 2014, limited service from San Bernardino to Riverside was provided by some San Bernardino Line trains, and the Metrolink Riverside Line terminates at the <b>Riverside</b> <b>station</b> although it reaches the station via a more southerly route. [...] South of Riverside the track is still in place to Perris, where the Orange Empire Railway Museum has a connection to the mainline.
