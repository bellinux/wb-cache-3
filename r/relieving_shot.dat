40|$|AbstractDuring hard roof rupture or slip {{instability}} {{with the}} sudden release of {{large amount of}} elastic energy, rock burst will be caused by violent shock easily. Based on the geological conditions of 6303 working face in Jisan Colliery, numerical simulation was carried out systematically of <b>relieving</b> <b>shot</b> in roof, then the reasonable parameters of <b>relieving</b> <b>shot</b> was provided. The results of danger-breaking measures of <b>relieving</b> <b>shot</b> in roof on-site shows that the danger of rock burst is reduced with fractured circle connected and values of electromagnetic emission and drillings decreased...|$|E

60|$|The boat {{pulled from}} the shore, and Birch turned on his heel, drawing his breath, like one <b>relieved,</b> and <b>shot</b> up the hills with the strides {{for which he was}} famous. The Skinner followed, and each party pursued the common course, casting {{frequent}} and suspicious glances at the other, and both maintaining a most impenetrable silence.|$|R
40|$|Two {{rectangular}} {{samples of}} ASTM SA 508 Class 2 steel, stress <b>relieved</b> and <b>shot</b> peened to 14 - 16 A intensity, {{were examined in}} detail to determine the principal macroscopic residual stress distribution. The uniformity of the shot peening induced macroscopic residual stresses with orientation in {{the plane of the}} surface and as a function of depth were examined and compared. The microscopic residual stress (plastic deformation) distribution was determined as a function of depth, and compared for the two samples. The calibration technique to determine the single crystal elastic constants in the (211) direction and verification of the values obtained by comparison with mechanically measured applied stress are discussed. The results indicate variation in the magnitude of the subsurface compressive macroscopic residual stress with direction in the plane of measurement for either sample of less than 12 ksi. The mean value of the macroscopic stress distributions for the two samples examined differed by less than the same amount at any depth examined. The microstress distribution was found to vary essentially linearly as a function of depth, reaching a negligible amount immediately beneath the microscopically compressive surface layer. The microstress distributions in the two samples examined were identical within the limits of experimental error...|$|R
