The report found that most of the deaths were due to natural causes like cancer and heart conditions, replacing self-harm as the leading cause of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> AIC director Dr. Adam Tomison also noted that [...] "especially for the last eight years, Indigenous people <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> have been less likely to die <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> than non-Indigenous people." ...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths <b>in</b> <b>Custody</b> (RCIADIC) {{was set up}} in 1987 to {{investigate}} concerns over the number of Aboriginal deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> The 1991 report of the same name found that the death rate <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> was <b>in</b> fact similar for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people—a discovery that surprised many—and that the high number of Indigenous deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> was explained by the disproportionate number of Indigenous people <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> relative to non-Indigenous people—a factor of 29 according to a 1988 report by the commission. The issue resurfaced in 2004 when an Indigenous man, Mulrunji Doomadgee, died <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> Palm Island, Queensland, an incident that caused riots on the island. The police officer who had custody of Doomadgee was charged with manslaughter, and was found not guilty in June 2007.|$|R

40|$|Deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> warrant scrutiny, {{not only}} because they might be due to torture, abuse and {{inadequate}} medical care, but also because they pose challenges for detaining authorities. It is a widely overlooked problem that in many prisons deaths are frequent {{and most of them are}} considered ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ and not necessarily investigated while some of them were preventable. The lack of guidance to health care workers or international personnel in the field as to how to proceed in cases of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> is one of the reasons why investigations into deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> are not conducted or are ineffective. In light of this real and persistent problem, a multidisciplinary research project on the legal, medical and forensic aspects of investigating deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> has been carried out between 2008 and 2013 by the University Centre for Legal Medicine of Geneva and Lausanne, the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, the University of Bern, the International Centre for Prison Studies (King’s College London) and the ICRC. As a result of this collaborative effort, the Guidelines for investigating deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> have been published by the ICRC in 2013. The latter Guidelines fill an important gap by offering practical guidance to detaining authorities, investigating authorities, humanitarian agencies and others on the standards and procedures to be followed when a death occurs <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> This chapter presents the background, content and usefulness of the Guidelines after having discussed some of the key medical and legal issues related to death <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> such as: how to define deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody?</b> What are the most prevalent causes of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody?</b> What is the legal framework pertaining to the prevention and investigation of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody?</b> How to investigate and prevent deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody...</b>|$|R
