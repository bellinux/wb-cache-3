40|$|ABSTRACTFor {{the first}} time the {{electron}} density of the lamellar liquid crystalline {{as well as of the}} inverted hexagonal phase could be retrieved at the transition temperature. A reliable decomposition of the d-spacings into hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure elements could be performed owing to the presence of a sufficient number of reflections. While the hydrocarbon chain length, dC, in the lamellar phase with a value of 14. 5 Å lies within the extreme limits of the estimated chain length of the inverse hexagonal phase 10 Å<dC< 16 Å, the changes in the hydrophilic region vary strongly. During the lamellar-to-inverse hexagonal phase transition the area per lipid molecule reduces by ∼ 25 %, and the number of water molecules per lipid increases from 14 to 18. On the basis of the analysis of the structural components of each phase, the interface between the coexisting mesophases between 66 and 84 °C has been examined in detail, and a model for the formation of the first rods in the matrix of the lamellar phospholipid stack is discussed. Judging from the structural relations between the inverse hexagonal and the lamellar phase, we suggest a cooperative chain <b>reaction</b> of <b>rod</b> formation at the transition midpoint, which is mainly driven by minimizing the interstitial region...|$|R

The dielectric study of these rods reveals that they have higher value of dielectric constant at lower frequencies which was attributed to the interfacial and rotational type polarizations. Similarly, the increase in dielectric constant with temperature was attributed to the thermal activation of such polarizations. Furthermore, the analysis of ln(J) vs. E 1 / 2 characteristics in the temperature range of 300 – 400 K shows that possible operative conduction mechanism was of Poole–Frenkel type.

A 4 -primary photostimulator allowed independent control of rod or cone excitations. This {{is the first}} report of reaction times to isolated rod or cone stimuli at mesopic light levels under the same adaptation conditions.

40|$|Light {{adaptation}} in vertebrate photoreceptors {{is thought}} to be mediated through a number of biochemical feedback reactions that reduce the sensitivity of the photoreceptor and accelerate the kinetics of the photoresponse. Ca 2 + {{plays a major role in}} this process by regulating several components of the phototransduction cascade. Guanylate cyclase and rhodopsin kinase are suggested to be the major sites regulated by Ca 2 +. Recently, it was proposed that cGMP may be another messenger of light adaptation since it is able to regulate the rate of transducin GTPase and thus the lifetime of activated cGMP phosphodiesterase. Here we report measurements of the rates at which the changes in Ca 2 + and cGMP are followed by the changes in the rates of corresponding enzymatic <b>reactions</b> in frog <b>rod</b> outer segments. Our data indicate that there is a temporal hierarchy among reactions that underlie light adaptation. Guanylate cyclase activity and rhodopsin phosphorylation respond to changes in Ca 2 + very rapidly, on a subsecond time scale. This enables them to accelerate the falling phase of the flash response and to modulate flash sensitivity during continuous illumination. To the contrary, the acceleration of transducin GTPase, even after significant reduction in cGMP, occurs over several tens of seconds. It is substantially delayed by the slow dissociation of cGMP from the noncatalytic sites for cGMP binding located on cGMP phosphodiesterase. Therefore, cGMP-dependent regulation of transducin GTPase is likely to occur only during prolonged bright illumination...|$|R

The role of acid and salt as well as the effects of synthesis temperature and reactant mole ratio in the control of morphology and the formation of ordered mesostructure was systematically examined. It was found that the addition of inorganic salt can dramatically expand the range of the synthesis parameters to produce highly ordered PMO structure and improve the quality of PMO materials. The morphology of PMOs was significantly dependent on the induction time for precipitation. The uniform PMO rods can only be synthesized in a narrow range of acid and salt concentrations. The results also show that the optimized salt concentration (I M) and low acidity (0. 167 M) were beneficial to the formation of not only highly ordered mesostructure but also rodlike morphology. Increasing acidity resulted in fast hydrolysis <b>reaction</b> and short <b>rod</b> or plate-like particles.

40|$|Internal Mg {{diffusion}} (IMD) {{process can}} produce MgB 2 superconducting wires with engineering critical current density several {{times higher than}} that of traditional powder in tube processed wires, which makes it an attractive and promising method for mass producing practical MgB 2 wires. However, the MgB 2 layer growth stops shortly after the onset of the heat treatment and unreacted B always remained in the MgB 2 layer within MgB 2 wires, negatively affecting the Je performance. Thus it is of great importance to have an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of <b>reaction</b> between Mg <b>rod</b> and B powder forming the MgB 2 layer within IMD wires during heat treatment, and identify the critical factor that controls the formation rate of MgB 2 layer. In present work, the kinetics mechanism of reaction between Mg and B forming MgB 2 layer in the internal Mg diffusion (IMD) processed MgB 2 wires were systemically studied in present work. It was found that the reaction between Mg and B forming MgB 2 layer during the heating treatment is controlled by varied mechanisms. At initial stage, the formation of MgB 2 layer is mainly determined by the rate of chemical reaction between liquid Mg and B powder. As the reaction processes and the thickness of synthesized MgB 2 layer increases, the slow Mg diffusion-limited mechanism gradually becomes dominant at final stage. On the basis, herein Mg rod with a thin Cu coating is proposed to replace normal Mg rod in IMD procedure to accelerate the formation of MgB 2 layer within wires. As a result, Cu coating can change the kinetics mechanism of MgB 2 layer formation and enable the formation of MgB 2 layer {{to get rid of the}} restriction of slow Mg diffusion. Complete dense MgB 2 layer without B-rich or unreacted B regions was successfully synthesized within Cu coated IMD wires with larger diameter (1. 03 mm) at temperature as low as 600 °C (below Mg melting point). The kinetics mechanism of MgB 2 layer formation determined in our work can provide a valuable guide for optimizing processing parameters of IMD MgB 2 wires. Moreover, the Cu coating technique proposed here opens a promising way to fabricate practical high performance IMD wires at low heating temperature...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{ultimately}} {{reducing the}} burden of violent crime on society, research has {{identified a number of}} areas in which conventional methods of assessment and treatment of violent offenders may be improved. The areas examined in this thesis are gender, mental illness, and intimate partner violence, and they have been integrated with research in the field of case and computer simulation for assessment, training, and teaching. Firstly, paper-andpencil case vignettes were used to investigate possible gender bias in forensic psychiatric assessment (study I). Secondly, interactive computer simulation was applied in two contexts; augmentation of the assessment of mentally disordered violent offenders within forensic psychiatry (study II) and the assessment and treatment of intimate partner violence (IPV) offenders within the Prison and Probation Service (studies III and IV). In study I, the case vignette method did not reveal a significant association between the gender of the simulated offender and the judgement, by forensic psychiatric assessors, that the offender suffered from a severe mental disorder and was in need of compulsory, inpatient forensic psychiatric care. However, a simulated offender depicted as having mental retardation was more likely to be assessed as being at high risk of criminal recidivism if portrayed as female, regardless of the sex, place of work, or level of experience of the assessor. In the studies of the interactive computer simulation program <b>Reactions</b> on Display (<b>RoD),</b> study II revealed significant differences between mentally disordered offenders (MDOs) and controls in the area of interpretation of the simulated characters’ emotions and physical reactions, and the MDOs chose more violent actions on behalf of the main character compared with controls. There were also incongruent or deviant responses made by individual MDOs. This indicates that the Reactions on Display/Forensic Psychiatry (RoD/FP) has the ability to differentiate between MDOs and controls in several ways. In study III, Reactions on Display/Intimate Partner Violence (RoD/IPV) was well received and understood, both by intimate partner violence (IPV) offenders and healthy, non-offender controls. Significant differences between the groups emerged in the area of interpretation of the simulated characters’ emotions. Offenders who had not previously undergone treatment with the Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme (IDAP) showed a trend towards making more violent choices than other IPV offenders and controls. In the healthy, non-offender controls who took part in study IV, the violent film sequences in the RoD/IPV elicited a subjective feeling of increased arousal and decreased valence on the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale. It did not, however, elicit a physiologically detectable stress response, i. e. a negative mood. This may allay fears that the film content is disturbing to a degree that it interferes with assessment/learning or pleasurable to a degree that it will be sought after for entertainment purposes. While largely showing a consensus between Swedish forensic psychiatric assessors, the results provided by study I call for further research into the conformity of Swedish and international forensic psychiatric assessment practices. They also add to the body of research advocating the development of improved methods for risk assessment of offenders, {{which is part of the}} rationale behind the computer simulation systems presented in studies II-IV. The interactive computer simulation tools, studied in a pilot fashion in this thesis work (studies II-IV), have been found to be acceptable to all study groups. Significant differences between the offender and control groups have emerged, particularly with regard to their interpretations of the simulated characters’ emotions and also differences in the level of violence chosen. This indicates that the offenders’ interactions with the RoD program may provide additional information to traditional violence risk assessment methods (e. g. checklists) by showcasing dynamic risk factors (such as difficulties in emotional processing). The above properties may also be seen to support the future use of such programs for offender treatment, in which they can provide an engaging, safe, and controlled environment in which the user can observe and practice interactions and receive feedback from which he/she can learn desirable non-violent behaviours, and, in the specific case of the RoD/IPV, with minimal risk of negative side effects such as being excessively disturbed by its contents or using it as entertainment...|$|R
