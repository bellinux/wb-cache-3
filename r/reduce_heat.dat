5|$|Design of {{the complex}} began in 2002, with {{construction}} beginning in 2003. After completion in 2005, the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability, the second city hall in the United States to earn that distinction. Environmentally friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss, and solar panels to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown {{to a third of}} their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|Contributing factors {{leading to}} this award {{included}} that during construction, 92% of construction waste was recycled, and non-wood wheat board {{was used in}} some of the walls. Additionally, 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building, with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources, funded in part by Portland General Electric and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, while the building is 42% more energy efficient than comparable buildings. Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{coupling}} or {{earth sheltering}} {{occurs when a}} building uses earth as a buffer for the walls. The earth acts as a heat sink and can effectively mitigate temperature extremes. Earth sheltering improves the performance of building envelopes by <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> losses and also <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> gains by limiting infiltration.|$|R

5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E

25|$|Flippers act as heat exchangers, warming or cooling {{the seal}} as needed. On ice, the seal can press its fore-flippers to its body and its hind-flippers {{together}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss.|$|E
25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|E
25|$|A {{ceramic coating}} for the rims is {{available}} which may reduce wear {{and can also}} improve both wet and dry braking. It may also slightly <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer {{to the inside of}} the rims because it is a thermal insulator.|$|E

25|$|The use of countercurrent heat {{exchange}} with blood flow allows for regulated conservation/ elimination of heat of appendages. When ambient temperatures are low, heterotherms will constrict their arterioles to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss along skin surfaces. The reverse occurs at high ambient temperatures, arterioles dilate to increase heat loss.|$|E
25|$|The roof, {{which will}} feature green turf to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> and improve energy efficiency, {{is one of}} the myriad {{sustainable}} features of the building. Its design will maximize natural light and shade for cooling. Occupants will benefit from outdoor views and light, pristine air quality and control of heating, air and lighting in their own spaces.|$|E
25|$|Piling {{foundations}} {{are typically}} preferred for skyscrapers, however Manchester's sandstone substrata meant a raft foundation. The 2.5-metre thick raft foundation sits nine metres below the ground level. Approximately 57,000 tonnes {{of concrete and}} 6,000 glass panes for the curtain wall structure were required. Over 8,000m2 of rigid insulation board by Kingspan was used to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss.|$|E

25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} generally prefer constructing their dens upon large {{tree branches}} {{and within the}} hollow trunks of trees. They also {{have been known to}} take shelter within abandoned bird nests. The dens are usually lined with moss plants, thistledown, dried grass, and feathers. These perhaps provide and assist in the insulation of the den, used to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss. A cover to the den is usually built afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Tower {{is one of}} the world's most {{environmentally}} friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.|$|E
25|$|IGU {{thickness}} is {{a compromise}} between maximizing insulating value {{and the ability of}} the framing system used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes.|$|E

25|$|At {{low ambient}} {{temperatures}} the common ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less heat {{to be lost}} to the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss to the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{environment}}, biofilms can grow in showers very easily since {{they provide a}} moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and sewage pipes and cause clogging and corrosion. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause bioclogging. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry, can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that {{are attached to the}} metal subsurface (i.e., microbially influenced corrosion).|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{disadvantages}} to this process, most {{stemming from}} the workpiece being {{in contact with the}} dies for such an extended period of time. The operation is a time-consuming process due to the amount and length of steps. The workpiece will cool faster because the dies are in contact with workpiece; the dies facilitate drastically more heat transfer than the surrounding atmosphere. As the workpiece cools it becomes stronger and less ductile, which may induce cracking if deformation continues. Therefore, heated dies are usually used to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss, promote surface flow, and enable the production of finer details and closer tolerances. The workpiece may also need to be reheated.|$|E
