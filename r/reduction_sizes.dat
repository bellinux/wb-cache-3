Malvoni, M. G. De Giorgi, P. M. Congedo, 2015) [1]. The quadratic Renyi entropy criteria together with the principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) to predict the PV power in the day-ahead time frame. The data here shared represent the proposed approach results.

Based on our {{study of a}} class <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> program in Wisconsin we explore the following question: How do class <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> and classroom quality interact to produce learning opportunities in early elementary classrooms? To address this question, we analyze data from 3 years of fieldwork in 27 classrooms in 9 schools implementing a class <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> reform.

Program implementation required changes in space allocation. Some classrooms had 15 students and one teacher, some classroom teachers worked within created, cramped quarters and others teamed with a colleague.

40|$|Three plunge {{grinding}} control methods are discussed, {{and it is}} shown in control engineering terms that the process is one of motion control and that {{the differences between the}} various control methods lie in the control algorithms implemented in software using a common hardware system.

An accurate description of the control actions is provided, and the adaptive algorithm used by the proposed method also enables a low-cost computer system to be used. A case study of the grinding process based on a simulation is presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed control method.
