2500|$|For FM {{broadcasting}} (and the {{few remaining}} low-band TV stations), weather is the primary cause for changes in VHF propagation, along with some diurnal changes when the sky is mostly without cloud cover. [...] These changes are most obvious during temperature inversions, {{such as in the}} late-night and early-morning hours when it is clear, allowing the ground and the air near it to cool more rapidly. [...] This not only causes dew, frost, or fog, but also causes a slight [...] "drag" [...] {{on the bottom of the}} radio waves, bending the signals down such that they can follow the Earth's curvature over the normal <b>radio</b> <b>horizon.</b> [...] The result is typically several stations being heard from another media market [...] usually a neighboring one, but sometimes ones from a few hundred kilometers away. [...] Ice storms are also the result of inversions, but these normally cause more scattered omnidirection propagation, resulting mainly in interference, [...] often among weather radio stations. [...] In late spring and early summer, a combination of other atmospheric factors can occasionally cause skips that duct high-power signals to places well over 1000km away.|$|E

In January 1960, the TV DX interest was further promoted via Robert B. Cooper's regular DXing Horizons column.|$|R

50|$|Anomalous {{propagation}} (sometimes shortened to anaprop or anoprop) includes {{different forms}} of radio propagation due to an unusual distribution of temperature and humidity with height in the atmosphere.

50|$|Tamara could {{automatically}} track 23 {{radar and}} 48 IFF targets simultaneously. Its frequency band is 0.8-18 GHz. The nominal {{range of the}} system is 450 km, and it is generally limited by the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon.</b> It provides surveillance over a sector of approximately 100 degrees, with the later KRTP-91 system offering a wider 120 degree sector of surveillance.|$|E
50|$|For analog TV, VHF {{transmission}} range {{is a function}} of transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and distance to the horizon, since VHF signals propagate under normal conditions as a near line-of-sight phenomenon. The distance to the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> is slightly extended over the geometric line of sight to the horizon, as radio waves are weakly bent back toward the Earth by the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to IRAS, no science {{data was}} {{recorded}} on-board ISO for later transmission to the ground. All data, both science data and housekeeping data were {{transmitted to the}} ground in real-time. The perigee point of ISO's orbit was below the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> of the mission control centers at both VILSPA and Goldstone, thus forcing the science instruments to be switched off at perigee.|$|E

The name, <b>Horizon</b> <b>Radio,</b> had no real significance other than being an idea created when the station launched, due to the aerial view and 'horizon' seen from the transmitter location at Bow Brickhill, some 7 miles South East of the city.|$|R

Up to 200 targets can be automatically tracked simultaneously, with an output rate adjustable from 1 to 5 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|The {{observable}} {{characteristics of}} such high-pressure systems are usually clear, cloudless days {{with little or}} no wind. At sunset the upper air cools, as does the surface temperature, but at different rates. This produces a boundary or temperature gradient, which allows an inversion level to form [...] - [...] a similar effect occurs at sunrise. The inversion is capable of allowing very high frequency (VHF) and UHF signal propagation well beyond the normal <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> distance.|$|E

50|$|Earth bulge is a {{term used}} in telecommunications. It refers to the {{circular}} segment of earth profile that blocks off long distance communications. Since the geometric line of sight passes at varying heights over the Earth, the propagating radio wave encounters slightly different propagation conditions over the path. The usual effect of the declining pressure of the atmosphere with height is to bend radio waves down towards {{the surface of the}} Earth, effectively increasing the Earth's radius, and the distance to the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon,</b> by a factor of around 4/3. This k-factor can change from its average value depending on weather.|$|E
