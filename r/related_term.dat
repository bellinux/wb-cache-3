40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} {{high-speed}} method of detecting ontological knowledge from the Web. Ontological knowledge {{in this paper}} means a <b>term</b> <b>related</b> to a given term.

25|$|Pacifism is {{opposition}} to war, militarism, or violence. The word pacifism was coined by the French peace campaigner Émile Arnaud (1864–1921) and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901. A <b>related</b> <b>term</b> is ahimsa (to do no harm), {{which is a}} core philosophy in Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.|$|E
25|$|Gingival enlargement, (also termed gingival overgrowth, hypertrophic gingivitis, gingival hyperplasia, or gingival hypertrophy, and {{sometimes}} abbreviated to GO), {{is an increase}} {{in the size of the}} gingiva (gums). It is a common feature of gingival disease. Gingival enlargement can be caused by a number of factors, including inflammatory conditions and the side effects of certain medications. The treatment is based on the cause. A closely <b>related</b> <b>term</b> is epulis, denoting a localized tumor (i.e. lump) on the gingiva.|$|E
25|$|Onsite {{sanitation}} (or on-site sanitation) {{is defined}} as a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected, stored or treated at the same location (or on the same plot) where they are generated. Examples are pit latrines and septic tanks. On-site sanitation systems are often connected to fecal sludge management systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated as an offsite location. A <b>related</b> <b>term</b> is a decentralized wastewater system which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an onsite sewage facility can treat the wastewater generated locally.|$|E

25|$|Having a {{last name}} of Levi or a <b>related</b> <b>term</b> does not {{necessarily}} mean a person is a Levite, and some Levites do not have such last names. Levitical status is passed down in families from parent to child, as part of a family's genealogical tradition. Tribal status of Levite is determined by patrilineal descent, so a child whose biological father is a Levite (in cases of adoption or artificial insemination, status is determined by the genetic father), is also considered a Levite. Jewish status is determined by matrilineal descent, thus conferring levitical status onto children requires both biological parents to be Israelites and the biological father to be a Levite.|$|E

The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person.

The principal Acts are the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, the Land Compensation Act 1961, the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, the Land Compensation Act 1973, the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, and the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.|$|E
25|$|Because {{multimodality}} {{is continually}} evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, {{the speaker and}} audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation {{is no longer just}} text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important <b>related</b> <b>term</b> to multimodality is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as sound and image. Whether and how a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{indigenous}} designation for {{the language}} is Anishinaabemowin 'speaking the native language' (Anishinaabe 'native person,' verb suffix –mo 'speak a language,' suffix –win 'nominalizer'), with varying spellings and pronunciations depending upon dialect. Some speakers use the term Ojibwemowin. The general term in Oji-Cree (Severn Ojibwe) is Anihshininiimowin, although Anishinaabemowin is widely recognized by Severn speakers. Some speakers of Saulteaux Ojibwe refer to their language as Nakawemowin. The Ottawa dialect is {{sometimes referred to as}} Daawaamwin, although the general designation is Nishnaabemwin, with the latter term also applied to Jibwemwin or Eastern Ojibwe. Other local terms are listed in Ojibwe dialects. English terms include Ojibwe, with variants including Ojibwa and Ojibway. The <b>related</b> <b>term</b> Chippewa is more commonly employed in the United States and in southwestern Ontario among descendants of Ojibwe migrants from the United States.|$|E

500|$|The Bernese German Zytglogge {{translates}} to Zeitglocke in Standard German and to time bell in English; 'Glocke' means 'bell' in German, {{as in the}} <b>related</b> <b>term</b> 'glockenspiel'. A [...] "time bell" [...] {{was one of the}} earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the full hour. Such a device was installed in the Wendelstein in Bern – the tower of the Leutkirche church which the Münster later replaced – in 1383 at the latest; it alerted the bell-ringer to ring the tower bells.|$|E
500|$|Ideasthesia (alternative {{spelling}} ideaesthesia) {{is defined}} as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes [...] The main reason for introducing the notion of ideasthesia was the empirical evidence indicating that the <b>related</b> <b>term</b> synesthesia (i.e. union of senses) suggests incorrect explanation of a set of phenomena traditionally covered by this heading. Syn-aesthesis denoting [...] "co-perceiving", implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level. However, according to others, most phenomena that have inadvertently been linked to synesthesia in fact are induced by the semantic representations i.e., the meaning of the stimulus rather than by its sensory properties, as would be implied by the term synesthesia. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both inducer and concurrent are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the concurrent is of sensory nature while inducer is semantic. Research on ideasthesia bears important implications for solving the mystery of human conscious experience, which according to ideasthesia, is grounded in how we activate concepts.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{around the}} 12th century, some {{scholars}} began {{to doubt the}} historical existence of Sun Tzu, primarily {{on the grounds that}} he is not mentioned in the historical classic Zuo zhuan, which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period. [...] The name [...] "Sun Wu" [...] (...) does not appear in any text prior to the Shiji, and may have been a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning [...] "the fugitive warrior": the surname [...] "Sun" [...] can be glossed as the <b>related</b> <b>term</b> [...] "fugitive" [...] (xùn [...] ), while [...] "Wu" [...] is the ancient Chinese virtue of [...] "martial, valiant" [...] (wǔ [...] ), which corresponds to Sunzi's role as the hero's doppelgänger in the story of Wu Zixu. Skeptics cite possible historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in the text, and that the book was actually a compilation from different authors and military strategists. Attribution of the authorship of The Art of War varies among scholars and has included people and movements including Sun; Chu scholar Wu Zixu; an anonymous author; a school of theorists in Qi or Wu; Sun Bin; and others. Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure [...] "Sunzi" [...] through a form of euhemerism. The name Sun Wu does appear in later sources such as the Shiji and the Wu Yue Chunqiu. The only historical battle attributed to Sun Tzu, the Battle of Boju, has no record of him fighting in that battle.|$|E
