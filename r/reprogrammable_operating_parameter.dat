40|$|In present {{manufacturing}} environment, {{the manufacturing}} flexibility {{has become one}} of the strategic competitive tools. Flexibility refers to the availability of alternative resources. These resources may have varied parameters, particularly related to physical and operating system. These physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of alternative resources may influence the system's performance with the changing levels of flexibility and operational control parameters such as scheduling rules. Is increase in a flexibility level provides desired improved performance output? If yes, than under what conditions of physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> and under which control strategy (CS) ? Is improved performance is present at all increasing levels of flexibility? Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) being consist of numerous physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> and complex in nature, the solution to these questions can provide an understanding of the productive levels of flexibility for a given physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of an FMS. This paper establishes the need of modelling of the physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of flexible manufacturing system along with flexibility and presents a simulation study under Taguchi's method analysis of these parameters. The paper contributes an approach to study the impact of variations in physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of an FMS and to identify the level of these variations that do not restrict the advantages of flexibility. The results show that the expected benefits from increasing the levels of flexibility and a superior CS may not be achieved if the physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of alternative machines have variations. Taguchi's method analysis indicates that relative percentage contribution of variations in physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of alternative resources should be negligible or minimum in the performance of FMS. Their increasing relative contribution may restrict the advantages of flexibility. If these variations are higher than increase in flexibility level may be counter productive. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{abrasive}} {{water jet}} (AWJ) cutting method {{has been used}} widely for the cutting and processing of materials because of its cool, damage-free, and precise cutting technique. Nowadays, the use of AWJ cutting in the natural stone industry is increasing. However, the effectiveness of AWJ cutting of natural stones {{is dependent on the}} rock properties and machine <b>operating</b> <b>parameters.</b> In this study, injection-type AWJ cutting was applied to 42 different types of natural stones to investigate the effects of rock properties and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> on the cutting depth. Shore hardness, Bohme surface abrasion resistance and the density of the rocks were the most significant rock properties affecting the cutting depth. The working pump pressure and traverse velocity were the most significant <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> affecting cutting, as has been shown previously.

40|$|The plasma-sprayed coating {{architecture}} and in-service properties {{are derived from}} an amalgamation of intrinsic and extrinsic spray parameters. These parameters are interrelated; following mostly non-linear relationships. For example, adjusting power parameters (to modify particle temperature and velocity upon impact) also implies an adjustment of the feedstock injection parameters in order to optimize geometric and kinematic parameters. Optimization of the <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> is a first step. Controlling these is a second step and consists of defining unique combinations of parameter sets and maintaining them as constant during the entire spray process. These unique combinations must be defined {{with regard to the}} in-service coating properties. Several groups of <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> control the plasma spray process; namely (i) extrinsic parameters that can be adjusted directly (e. g., the arc current intensity) and (ii) intrinsic parameters, such as the particle velocity or its temperature upon impact, that are indirectly adjusted. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a suitable approach to predict <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> to attain required coating characteristics.
