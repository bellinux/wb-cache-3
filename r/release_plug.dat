5000|$|An 13 million upgrade of Chaffey Dam {{commenced}} during 2010 {{that involved}} {{the construction of a}} 35 m auxiliary spillway with <b>release</b> <b>plug,</b> funded by the Government of New South Wales and was completed in early 2011. A second stage A$43.33 million augmentation commenced in 2013, funded by the Australian Government, the NSW Government and Tamworth Regional Council. This augmentation is expected to be completed during 2014 and involves raising the dam wall by 8 m and subsequent works to raise the morning glory spillway and bridge deck. These works will increase the full supply level of the dam by 6.5 m, the dam's capacity from [...] to [...] and ensure it can withstand the maximum possible flood. The project also involves a realignment of roads on the western foreshore; the Tamworth-Nundle Road, and River Road.|$|E
40|$|Peptide gelators {{are useful}} {{building}} blocks for creating diverse self- assembled nanostructures, including novel drug delivery systems. The aim of this Thesis is to understand better the key contributing factors in the drug-delivery properties of peptide-based self-assembled hydrogels. Using the archetypical peptide gelators Fmoc (9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) - FF (diphenylalanine); Fmoc-FF 1, as a starting point, the effect of gel concentration, temperature {{and the size of}} the (drug) molecule encapsulated on the rate of drug release was investigated. This study was then extended to other gelator including those with different headgroups and di- and tri-peptide analogoues of Fmoc-FF 1 where other hydrophobic amino acids were introduced. The variation in the gel properties such as stiffness correlated well with changes in drug release properties. This study was then extended to longer peptides, containing 4 - 6 amino acids and inspired by the elastin protein. The resulting elastin-like peptide hydrogels also show good drug release properties which when combined with their elastin-like structure, makes these peptide gelators good candidate for biomedical applications. To assist the release of drugs that are poorly-soluble in water, gelation of Fmoc-FF 1 in various PEG:water mixtures was investigated. This resulted in gels with good mechanical properties. Interestingly, the secondary structures in these gels appears different from gels from 1 in water. The gelation of 1 in this system can be explained by a combination of the macromolecular crowding and hydrophobic effects. Poorly soluble drugs are readily encapsulated and then released in this gel system. Finally, gels based on Fmoc-FF 1 in a mixture of PEG 400 and biological media were used to generate a scaffold for distance- and time-depended drug release in vitro drug release studies targeting the cancer cell line HeLa. A clear relationship between distance from the drug <b>release</b> <b>plug</b> and cell viability was observed in these studies. The work presented in this Thesis has broaden the knowledge drug release from self-assembled peptide gels. The results should therefore benefit further development of these materials for clinical application, be it in the treatment of diseases such as cancer or tissue engineering...|$|E

40|$|Automatic transplanters {{have been}} very {{important}} in greenhouses since the popularization of seedling nurseries. End-effector development is a key technology for transplanting plug seedlings. Most existing end-effectors have problems with holding root <b>plugs</b> or <b>releasing</b> <b>plugs.</b> An efficient end-effector driven by a linear pneumatic cylinder was designed in this study, which could hold root <b>plugs</b> firmly and <b>release</b> <b>plugs</b> easily. This end-effector with four needles could clamp the plug simultaneously while the needles penetrate into the substrate. The depth and verticality of the needles could be adjusted conveniently for different seedling trays. The effectiveness of this end-effector was tested by a combinational trial examining three seedling nursery factors (the moisture content of the substrate, substrate bulk density and the volume proportion of substrate ingredients). Results showed that the total transplanting success rate for the end-effector was 100 %, and the root plug harm rate was below 17 %. A force measure system with tension and pressure transducers was installed on the designed end-effector. The adhesive force FL between the root plug and the cell of seedling trays and the extrusion force FK on the root plug were measured and analyzed. The results showed that all three variable factors and their interactions had significant effects on the extrusion force. Each factor {{had a significant effect}} on adhesive force. Additionally, {{it was found that the}} end-effector did not perform very well when the value of FK/FL was beyond the range of 5. 99 ~ 8. 67. This could provide a scientific basis for end-effector application in transplanting...|$|R

40|$|A typical {{completion}} procedure requires {{placement of}} a bridge plug near the liner {{top of a}} producing steam well so the well can be loaded to permit cementing of the tieback casing string by conventional cementing techniques. A drillable bridge plug {{has been used in}} the past so that it could be removed with a conventional toothed, cone-type drill bit. All components could not be drilled out because the bridge plug would separate from the casing when drilling through its top slips. This created a hazardous situation because heavy components remaining in the well could blowout after placing the well into production and damage or destroy surface equipment. A bridge plug and its companion milling-type retrieving tool were developed to perform the bridging operation and accomplish removal in a producing geothermal steam well environment. The bridge plug features an internal briding plug that is designed to permit the release of differential pressure buildup from below before <b>releasing</b> the bridge <b>plug</b> by milling away the top slips. The millinog-type retrieving tool has a catcher mechanism designed to function in the high-velocity steam flow of a producing well to catch the <b>released</b> bridge <b>plug.</b> After the <b>released</b> bridge <b>plug</b> components are caught, they may be returned to the surface in a controlled manner. This removes the massive components so {{that they will not be}} blown out by the steam of a producing well.
