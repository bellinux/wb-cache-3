25|$|From December 2006 to mid-September 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority met 36 times; {{there were}} also lower-level talks. In 2007 Olmert welcomed the Arab League's re-endorsement of the Arab Peace Initiative. In his bid to {{negotiate}} a peace accord and establish a Palestinian state, Olmert proposed a plan to the Palestinians. The centerpiece of Olmert's detailed proposal is the suggested permanent border, which {{would be based on}} an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank. Olmert proposed annexing at least 6.3% of Palestinian territory, in exchange for 5.8% of Israeli land, with Palestinians receiving alternative land in the Negev, adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as well as territorial link, under Israeli sovereignty, for free passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Israel insisted on retaining an armed presence in the future Palestinian state. Under Abbas's offer, more than 60 percent of settlers would stay in place. Olmert, for his part, was presenting a plan in which the most sparsely populated settlements would be evacuated. Olmert and Abbas both acknowledged that <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relations</b> would be necessary, not hermetic separation. They also acknowledged the need to share a single business ecosystem, while cooperating intensively on water, security, bandwidth, banking, tourism and much more. Regarding Jerusalem the leaders agreed that Jewish neighborhoods should remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Arab neighborhoods would revert to Palestinian sovereignty. The Palestinians asked for clarifications of the territorial land swap since they were unable to ascertain what land his percentages affected, since Israeli and Palestinian calculations of the West Bank differ by several hundred square kilometres. For them, in lieu of such clarifications, Olmert's 6.3–6.8% annexation might work out closer to 8.5%, 4 times the 1.9% limit the Palestinians argued a swap should not exceed. The talks ended with both sides claiming the other side dropped follow-up contacts.|$|E

Measuring consistency of preferences {{is very important in}} decision-making. This paper addresses this key issue for interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations.</b> Existing studies implement one of two di erent measures: the "classical" consistency measure, and the "boundary" consistency measure. The classical consistency degree of an interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relation</b> is determined by its associated <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relation</b> with highest consistency degree, while the boundary consistency degree is determined by its two associated boundary <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations.</b> However, the consistency index of an interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relation</b> should be determined by taking into account all its associated <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations.</b> Motivated by this, a new consistency measure for interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations,</b> the average-case consistency measure, is suggested and introduced. The new average-case consistency measure of an interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relation</b> is determined as the average consistency degree of all <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations</b> associated to the interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relation.</b> Furthermore, the analysis and comparison of the di erent consistency measure internal mechanisms is used to justify the validity of the average-case consistency measure. Finally, an average-case consistency improving method which aims to obtain a modi ed interval-valued <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relation</b> with a required average consistency degree is developed...|$|R

2500|$|Anonymity is an {{important}} component of organ gifting and it is thought to foster the social well-being of donors, recipients, and close kin. Anonymity is related to the eradication of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relations</b> between giver and receiver where the origin of the object that is exchanged is erased by eliminating the identity of the giver. According to some authors, this is currently done to promote better coping mechanisms for the recipient and close kin as well as to maintain standardized operating procedures by organ procurers. [...] The idea is that anonymity will protect organ procurers [...] "from close encounters with the animistic, magic-infused thinking about transplanted organs in which the givers and receivers of cadaver organs often engage". [...] However, other authors have argued that the use of the gift-giving metaphor in conjunction with the enforcement of anonymous donations lead to the obscuring of the origins of body parts and the unequal power relations behind their donation and reception.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders situates open theism {{as a form}} of freewill theism {{which goes}} back to the early church fathers and in Protestantism, it is {{prominent}} in the Arminian-Wesleyan traditions. In freewill theism God does not micromanage the creation, {{as is the case in}} theological determinism, but instead exercises “general sovereignty” by which God enacts the overarching structures in which creatures operate. Humans have libertarian free will such that for a free act the individual could have acted differently from reality. God does not determine or tightly control what humans do which means that God takes risks that humans might do things (likebsin) that God does not want them to do. The divine will, for some things, can be thwarted. Freewill theists have emphasized <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relations</b> between humans and God when it comes to salvation and prayer. They believe that God graciously initiates the call to redemption by granting enabling grace but that humans are free to accept it or reject it. When believers petition God in prayer what the believer prays can have an effect on God. Some divine decisions are contingent upon our actions. In other words, God responds to what creatures do, and what happens in history makes a difference to the way God acts in history. When such ideas are applied to the divine attributes, freewill theists reject “strong” divine immutability (God cannot change in any respect) and “strong” impassibility (God cannot be affected by what creatures do). Freewill theists do affirm “weak” impassibility (God is not overcome by emotions as humans are apt to be) and “weak” immutability (the divine nature [...] never changes).|$|E

According to this theory the metrical qualities of the continuum of space-time differ in the environment of different points of space-time, and are partly conditioned by the matter existing outside of the territory under consideration. This space-time variability of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relations</b> of the standards of space and time, or, perhaps, the recognition of the fact that [...] "empty space" [...] in its physical relation is neither homogeneous nor isotropic, compelling us to describe its state by ten functions (the gravitation potentials g(mn)), has, I think, finally disposed of the view that space is physically empty. But therewith the conception of the ether has again acquired an intelligible content, although this content differs widely from that of the ether of the mechanical undulatory theory of light. The ether of the general theory of relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities, but helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events.|$|E
60|$|Though, after occupying {{themselves}} with primitive arts and products, anthropologists have devoted their attention {{mainly to the}} physical characters of the human races; it must, I think, be admitted {{that the study of}} these yields in importance to the study of their psychical characters. The general conclusions to which the first set of inquiries may lead, cannot so much affect our views respecting the highest classes of phenomena as can the general conclusions to which the second set may lead. A true theory of the human mind vitally concerns us; and systematic comparisons of human minds, differing in their kinds and grades, will help us in forming a true theory. Knowledge of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relations</b> between the characters of men and the characters of the societies they form, must influence profoundly our ideas of political arrangements. When the inter-dependence of individual natures and social structures is understood, our conceptions of the changes now taking place, and hereafter to take place, will be rectified. A comprehension of mental development as a process of adaptation to social conditions, which are continually remoulding the mind and are again remoulded by it, will conduce to a salutary consciousness of the remoter effects produced by institutions upon character; and will check the grave mischiefs which ignorant legislation now causes. Lastly, a right theory of mental evolution as exhibited by humanity at large, giving a key, as it does, to the evolution of the individual mind, must help to rationalize our perverse methods of education; and so to raise intellectual power and moral nature.|$|E

Of course, if it came to the case of offering to change lots in life, she would not do it; but very likely she thinks she would, and sighs over and pities herself, and thinks sentimentally how fortunate you are, how snugly and securely you live, and wishes she were as untrammeled and independent as you.

Onsager’s <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relation</b> [2] is utilized {{to reduce the number of}} the diffusivity coefficients of constitutive materials from four to two. The so called cross coupling diffusivities are expressed in terms of the thermal conductivity and the coefficient of diffusion. The representative volume element of the composite is analyzed by applying a two-dimensional finite element model. It is assumed that the composite is undamaged, and there is no resistance in diffusion and heat conduction at the interface of the fiber and the matrix. The method is tested numerically with a set of different cases. The coupling affects most clearly to the heat flux in the tests. The average coupled heat flux is significantly greater than the uncoupled heat flux.

40|$|AbstractIn domains like {{decision}} theory and social choice theory {{it is known}} for a long time that stochastic transitivity properties yield necessary and sufficient conditions for the ranking or utility representability of <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations.</b> In this article we extend these results for <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations</b> originating from the pairwise comparison of random vectors in a machine learning context. More specifically, the expected ranking accuracy (ERA) is such a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>relation</b> that occurs in multi-class classification problems, when ranking or utility functions are fitted to the data in a pairwise manner. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for which these pairwise bipartite ranking functions can be simplified to a single ranking function such that the pairwise expected ranking accuracies of both models coincide. Similarly as for more common <b>reciprocal</b> preference <b>relations,</b> cycle transitivity plays a crucial role in this new setting. We first consider the finite sample case, for which expected ranking accuracy can be estimated by means of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and subsequently, we further generalize these results to the underlying distributions. It turns out that the ranking representability of pairwisely compared random vectors can be expressed elegantly in a distribution-independent way by means of a specific type of cycle transitivity, defined by a conjunctor that is closely related to the algebraic product...|$|R
