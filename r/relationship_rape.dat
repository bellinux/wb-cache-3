5000|$|One common {{misunderstanding}} of SCS's data is that 'in 2015, 70% more sex offences cases were reported compare with year 2014'. The truth is '1.7% of population' in 2015 {{is the total}} number of people between 16-79 years old who claimed to be offended in the past, no matter of when the offends happened. The new sex offend cases was 18,057 in 2015 and 20,326 in 2014. [...] It should be noted that it may be difficult for a layperson to determine whether an incident should be assessed as rape or sexual coercion, which is a similar but lesser offence in the Swedish Penal Code, meaning this number may be exaggerated. On the other hand, <b>relationship</b> <b>rape</b> may also be under-represented, because of how sensitive the issue is. Most of the sexual offences are committed in a public place (50%), and the perpetrator(s) are most often unknown to the victim (63%).|$|E
5000|$|By 1991, {{when the}} {{exemption}} was removed, the Law Commission in its Working Paper of 1990 was already supporting {{the abolition of}} the exemption, a view reiterated in their Final Report that was published in 1992; and international moves in this direction were by now common. Therefore, the result of the R v R case was welcomed. But, while the removal of the exemption itself was not controversial, the way through which this was done was; since the change was not made through usual statutory modification. The cases of SW v UK and CR v UK arose in response to R v R; in which the applicants (convicted of rape and attempted rape of the wives) appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that their convictions were a retrospective application of the law in breach of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They claimed {{that at the time of}} the rape there was a common law exemption in force, therefore their convictions were post facto. Their case was not successful, with their arguments being rejected by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that the criminalization of marital rape had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the criminal law in the light of the evolution of social norms; and that the Article 7 does not prohibit the gradual judicial evolution of the interpretation of an offense, provided the result is consistent with the essence of the offense and that it could be reasonably foreseen. A new definition of the offense of 'rape' was created in 1994 by the section 142 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, providing a broader definition that included anal sex; and an even broader definition was created by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, including oral sex. The law on rape does not—and did not ever since the removal of the marital exemption in 1991—provide for any different punishment based on the relation between parties. However, in 1993, in R v W 1993 14 Cr App R (S) 256, the court ruled: [...] "It should not be thought a different and lower scale automatically attaches to the rape of a wife by her husband. All will depend upon the circumstances of the case. Where the parties are cohabiting and the husband insisted upon intercourse against his wife's will but without violence or threats this may reduce sentence. Where the conduct is gross and involves threats or violence the relationship will be of little significance." [...] At the time of R v R, rape in Northern Ireland was a crime at common law. Northern Ireland common law is similar to that of England and Wales, and partially derives from the same sources; so any (alleged) exemption from its rape law was also removed by R v R. In March 2000, a Belfast man was convicted for raping his wife, in the first case of its kind in Northern Ireland. Until 28 July 2003, rape in Northern Ireland remained solely an offense at common law that could only be committed by a man against a woman only as vaginal intercourse. Between 28 July 2003 and 2 February 2009 rape was defined by the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 as [...] "any act of non-consensual intercourse by a man with a person", but the common law offense continued to exist, and oral sex remained excluded. On 2 February 2009 the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 came into force, abolishing the common law offense of rape, and providing a definition of rape that is similar to that of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 of England and Wales. The Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland has the same policy for marital rape as for other forms of rape; it states in its Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape document that: [...] "The Policy applies to all types of rape, including marital and <b>relationship</b> <b>rape,</b> acquaintance and stranger rape, both against male and female victims".|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} how the courts in various common law jurisdictions sentence the crime of rape. The thesis begins by considering {{the seriousness of the}} offence through a review of the medical literature on the physical and psychological effects of rape. The legal and philosophical literature on the wrongness of rape is then considered, along with the victim’s role in sentencing. The discussion then turns towards sentencing practice in four jurisdictions: Scotland, England and Wales, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland. By employing a legal comparativist approach, the thesis compares rape sentencing across these jurisdictions in order to suggest possible reform of how the offence is sentenced in Scotland. The study thus {{presents a}} historical, philosophical and juridical analysis of rape sentencing. In particular, reliance is placed on analysis of reported case law, appellate sentencing guidance, appellate sentencing guidelines and, where applicable, formal guidelines issued by statutory bodies along with associated academic commentary. Having considered the sentencing methodology of the courts {{in each of the four}} jurisdictions and having proceeded to consider the nature of any general sentencing guidance or particular sentencing guidelines, the thesis argues that reform of Scottish sentencing practice for rape is required. In particular, it is argued that sentencing guidelines are required in Scotland to guide judicial sentencing discretion. It is also argued that such sentencing guidance as does exist in Scotland – especially regarding the sentencing of <b>relationship</b> <b>rape</b> – neither adequately reflects the seriousness of the offence nor reflects modern societal attitudes towards rape. Drawing on the experiences of the courts in the three other jurisdictions examined in the thesis, the study concludes by making suggestions for the reform of Scottish sentencing practice. ...|$|E

40|$|Accumulated {{evidence}} {{over the}} past decade consistently demonstrates a relationship between childhood adversity and psychosis in adulthood. There is some evidence of specific associations between childhood sexual abuse and hallucinations, and between insecure attachment and paranoia. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey were used in assessing whether current attachment styles influenced the association between adverse childhood experiences and psychotic symptoms in adulthood. Hallucinations and paranoid beliefs were differentially associated with sexual abuse (rape and sexual molestation) and neglect, respectively. Sexual abuse and neglect were also associated with depression. The relationship between neglect and paranoid beliefs was fully mediated via anxious and avoidant attachment. The relationship between sexual molestation and hallucinations was independent of attachment style. The <b>relationship</b> between <b>rape</b> and hallucinations was partially mediated via anxious attachment; however this effect was no longer present when depression was included as a mediating variable.
