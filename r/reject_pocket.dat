50|$|The ninth, {{check digit}} {{provides}} a checksum test using a position-weighted sum {{of each of}} the digits. High-speed check-sorting equipment will typically verify the checksum and if it fails, route the item to a <b>reject</b> <b>pocket</b> for manual examination, repair, and re-sorting. Mis-routings to an incorrect bank are thus greatly reduced.|$|E
40|$|The {{illustration}} on {{the cover}} and the header of each chapter depicts a relatively early attempt at classifying ‘documents ’ in different classes based on their content: the IBM Type 82 punched card sorter (mid-Sixties). “The Type 82 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine groups all cards of similar classification {{and at the same}} time arranges such classifications in numerical sequence. “The operator places the cards in the feed hopper, sets the sorting brush on the column to be sorted, and presses the starting key. The sorting operation is accomplished at a speed of 650 cards per minute, per column sorted. The card feeding mechanism allows refilling of the card hopper while the sorter is in operation, eliminating stopping of the machine. “The pockets into which the cards are sorted have a capacity of 800 cards and the machine stops when the limit is reached in any pocket. By means of a selecting feature, all cards punched with any hole or holes in a single column may be sorted out while the remaining cards are passed into the <b>reject</b> <b>pocket</b> without disturbing their sequence. “After the card hopper is empty, the sorter continues to run long enough to allow all cards to be sorted into the correct pockets without the necessity for pressing the start key. “Alphabetical sequence sorting can be accomplished with this model by an extra sort, in which case the machine is equipped with alphabetical switch and pocket designations. “The Type 82 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine can be specified for operation either from alternating or direct current. ...|$|E
5000|$|Bazhenov, {{eager to}} improve his finances, {{accepted}} {{what looked like a}} generous offer from Prokofi Demidov, a wealthy and whimsical patron of arts. Demidov planned to donate a new building to Moscow University; he agreed to refinance Bazhenov's debts in exchange for his design and management services. Relations soon turned sour; Demidov, literally having Bazhenov in his <b>pocket,</b> <b>rejected</b> his design for a downtown campus and ordered Bazhenov to design a new green field campus on the Sparrow Hills. This cat and mouse game (as presented in Bazhenov's own writing) continued for nearly a decade; the architect wasted years on a dead end project and remained bankrupt at the mercy of Demidov. Once again Kazakov picked up the job and completed the [...] "old" [...] downtown core of the University in 1793.|$|R
