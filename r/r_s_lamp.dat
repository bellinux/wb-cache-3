In the present study, we developed a Smart Laboratory system using Raspberry Pi 2, in which the lamps and air-conditioning (AC) are as its object. To control lights is to use relay 12 VDC derived by GPIO of Raspberry Pi 2, while the AC control using a programming library LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control) is installed in the Raspberry Pi 2. To work the system in this study is based on the time delay control is based on two types of connection, i. e., Wi-Fi (1 st scenario) and PLC adapter (2 nd scenario). The results showed that the average time delay is obtained for the 1 st scenario of AC 1 = 1. 09 s, AC 2 = 0. 93 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 1 = 1. 152 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 2 = 1. 402 s, while in the 2 nd scenario of the AC button 1 = 1. 34 s, AC 2 = 1. 81 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 1 = 1. 28 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 2 = 1. 483 s.

Here we show that a more potent stereospecific diastereomer (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 can synergize with an allosteric Akt inhibitor MK- 2206 to suppress the growth of SKOV 3 ovarian cancer cells with constitutively active Akt. (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 induced mitotic arrest and MK- 2206 caused G 0 /G 1 arrest, while the combination of both induced simultaneous G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M cell cycle arrest. (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 induced phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl- 2, and downregulated Mcl- 1, consequently may lead to apoptosis. (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which may stimulate cell proliferation upon activation. (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 also induced DNA damage after long-term treatment. MK- 2206 is known to inhibit phosphorylation and activation of Akt and suppress cancer cell growth. The combination of (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 and MK- 2206 also inhibited the Akt pathway. Interestingly, MK- 2206 upregulated Bcl- 2 and induced activation of MAPKs in SKOV 3 cells; however, when combined with (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65, these prosurvival effects were reversed. The combination also more significantly decreased Mcl- 1 protein, increased PARP cleavage, and induced γ-H 2 AX, a DNA damage marker. Remarkably, MK- 2206 enhanced the microtubule depolymerization effect of (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65. The combination of (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 and MK- 2206 also markedly inhibited cell migration. Thus, MK- 2206 synergizes with (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (S) -BF 65 to inhibit SKOV 3 cell growth via downregulating the Akt signaling pathway, and enhancing the microtubule disruption effect of (<b>R)</b> (<b>S)</b> (<b>S)</b> -BF 65.

40|$|A new {{miniature}} bioreactor with {{a diameter}} {{equal to that}} of a single well of a 24 -well plate is described and its engineering performance as a fermenter assessed. Mixing in the miniature bioreactor is provided by a set of three impellers mechanically driven via a microfabricated electric motor and aeration is achieved with a single tube sparger. Parameter sensitive fluorophors are used with fibre optic probes for continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen tension and an optical based method is employed to monitor cell biomass concentration during fermentation. Experimental measurements are provided on volumetric mass transfer coefficient for air–water and bacterial fermentation data are presented for Escherichia coli. The local and average power input, energy dissipation rate and bubble size are derived from an analysis of the multiphase flow in the miniature bioreactor using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Volumetric mass transfer coefficients are predicted using Higbie's penetration model with the contact time obtained from the CFD simulations of the turbulent flow in the bioreactor. Comparative data are provided from parallel experiments carried out in a 20 l (15 l working volume) conventional fermenter. Predicted and measured volumetric mass transfer coefficients in the miniature bioreactor are in the range 100 – 400 h− 1, typical of those reported for large-scale fermentation. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>Lamping,</b> H.

40|$|Soil {{respiration}} (<b>R</b> <b>S)</b> {{is a major}} flux in {{the global}} carbon (C) cycle and its responses to changing environmental conditions may exert a strong control on the residence time of C in terrestrial ecosystems and in turn influence the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Soil respiration consists of several components returning C of different nature and age to the atmosphere, with root/rhizosphere respiration often assumed to be the dominant and variable one. Rates of <b>R</b> <b>S</b> vary greatly {{in time and space}} and the mechanisms underlying this temporal variability, or the <b>R</b> <b>S</b> components responsible for it, are poorly understood. It is often assumed the <b>R</b> <b>s</b> and its components are under abiotic control at almost all time scales. In this study, we used the ecosystem 13 C tracer at the Duke Forest Free Air CO 2 Enrichment site to separate forest <b>R</b> <b>S</b> into four components: root/rhizosphere respiration (R R), litter decomposition (R L), and decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) of two age classes – up to 8 years old and SOM older than 8 years. We then examined and found that diurnal and seasonal variability in the components of <b>R</b> <b>s</b> occurred at different magnitudes and directions than total <b>R</b> <b>S.</b> Soil respiration was generally dominated by R SOM during the growing season (44 % of daytime <b>R</b> <b>S),</b> especially at night. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration (R SOM and R L) to <b>R</b> <b>S</b> was not constant during the growing season, indicating that the seasonal variability seen in R R alone cannot explain the seasonal variability in <b>R</b> <b>S.</b> Although there was no diurnal variability in <b>R</b> <b>S,</b> there were significant compensatory differences in the contribution of individual <b>R</b> <b>S</b> components to daytime and nighttime rates. The average contribution of R SOM to <b>R</b> <b>S</b> was greater at night (54 %) than during the day (44 %) whereas the average contribution of R R to total <b>R</b> <b>S</b> was ~ 30 % during the day and ~ 34 % during the night. In contrast, R L constituted 26 % of <b>R</b> <b>S</b> during the day and only 12 % at night. Interestingly, the decomposition of C older than 8 years (R pre-tr), which could contain the most recalcitrant C-pools in this forest, showed more pronounced and consistent diurnal variability than any other <b>R</b> <b>S</b> component, with nighttime rates on average 29 % higher than daytime rates. In contrast, the decomposition of more recent, post-treatment C (R pre-tr) did not vary diurnally. None of this diurnal variation in components of <b>R</b> <b>s</b> could be explained by temperature and moisture variations and were likely due to biological controlling mechanisms. On growing season time scales some components of <b>R</b> <b>s</b> varied with temperature moisture variations that also affect plant photosynthetic activity. Our results indicate that the variation observed in this forest on the components of <b>R</b> <b>S</b> is the result of complex interaction between dominant biotic controls (plant activity, mineralization constants, competition for substrates) over abiotic controls (temperature, moisture) in diurnal and seasonal time scales. Because <b>R</b> <b>S</b> integrates biological activity of several types of organisms, utilizing C of different chemistry, accessibility and ages, considering the controls and interaction among soil pools that result in the overall soil CO 2 efflux is important in elucidating the controls on <b>R</b> <b>S</b> on ecosystem and atmospheric C-pools at different time scales...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{respiration}} (<b>R</b> <b>S)</b> {{is known}} to be highly sensitive to different environmental factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and the soil carbon (C) pool. Thus, the scenario of global change expected for the coming decades might imply important consequences for <b>R</b> <b>S</b> dynamics. In addition, all of these factors may have an interactive effect, and the consequences are often confounded. We performed a field experiment to analyze the effect of soil moisture and habitat type on <b>R</b> <b>S</b> in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem by simulating three possible climate scenarios differing in the precipitation amount during summer (drier, wetter, and current precipitation pattern) in the main successional habitats in the area (forest, shrubland, and open habitat). We also considered other factors that would affect <b>R</b> <b>S,</b> such as the soil C pool and microbial biomass. By the use of structural-equation modeling (SEM), we disentangled the interactive effects of the different factors affecting <b>R</b> <b>S.</b> A higher simulated precipitation boosted <b>R</b> <b>S</b> for the different habitats across the sampling period (14. 6 % higher respect to control), whereas the more severe simulated drought reduced it (19. 2 % lower respect to control), a trend that was similar at the daily scale. Temperature had, by contrast, scant effects on <b>R</b> <b>S.</b> The SEM analysis revealed a positive effect of moisture and canopy cover on <b>R</b> <b>S,</b> whereas the effect of temperature was weaker and negative. Soil C pool and microbial biomass did not affect <b>R</b> <b>S.</b> We conclude that the precipitation changes expected for the coming decades would play a more important role in controlling <b>R</b> <b>S</b> than would other factors. Thus, the projected changes in the precipitation pattern may have much more profound direct effects on <b>R</b> <b>S</b> than will the projected temperature increases...|$|R
