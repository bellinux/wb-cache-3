25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating <b>roller</b> screw <b>system.</b> [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating <b>roller</b> screw <b>system,</b> <b>rollers</b> disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|R
50|$|A mill {{was built}} on West Hemlock Creek {{for the purpose of}} {{producing}} boards and timber. It was the first mill for this purpose in Hemlock Township. However, Barton had built a mill on the northern bank of Hemlock Creek 0.5 mi from its mouth, shortly after arriving in the area. The mill was torn down and rebuilt by Isiah Barton in 1842. It was also renamed the Red Mill at this time. In 1885, Isiah McKelvy bought the mill and added a <b>roller</b> <b>system.</b> The mill was still operating as late as the 1910s.|$|E

An experimental setup of a linear CMP polisher is first presented and some polishing processes are then designed for validation of the wafer/pad friction modeling and analysis. The friction torques of both the polisher spindle and <b>roller</b> <b>systems</b> are used to monitor variations of the friction coefficient in situ. Verification of the friction model under various process parameters is presented. Effects of pad conditioning and the wafer film topography on wafer/pad friction are experimen-tally demonstrated.

5000|$|An inkometer is a {{specialized}} measuring instrument {{used by the}} printing industry to measure the [...] "tack" [...] (adhesiveness) of an ink with the <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> on an offset press. The importance of tack {{is that it is}} not so excessive that it doesn't allow effective transfer from the rollers to the plate and then to the blanket and onto the substrate being printed. Inks can also be tack [...] "graded" [...] in descending sequence to allow for better trapping of one color over another. Inks with too much tack can cause the surface of the paper to pick off and interfere with transfer on subsequent printing units and copies.|$|E
5000|$|A tension meter is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} tension in wires, cables, textiles, belts and more. Meters {{commonly}} use a 3 <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> where the material travels through the rollers causing deflection in the center roller that is connected to an analog indicator or load cell on digital models. Single roll tension sensors and sonic tension meters are other types of tension meters. Tension may also be inferred from the frequency of vibration of the material under stress by solving the [...] "Vibrating String Equation". Tension meters are available as handheld devices or as equipment for fixed installations. These are basically necessary {{to build up a}} tension-controlled closed loop.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, the ten Chanoine dams were {{replaced}} with four High Lift German <b>Roller</b> <b>System</b> dams. This decade saw a considerable increase in military ship building. These dam locations begin at Gallipolis Ferry forming the pool {{on the lower}} Kanawha and Ohio rivers, the Winfield Pool, the Marmet Pool and the London Pool to Boomer. During drought, all ensure at least a 12 ft deep navigation over old shoals, contrasting many of nature's other much deeper channels along the way. In 1989, the USACE began construction of larger and longer lock chambers. Today, most tows {{no longer need to}} break-tow to pass through to the next pool. This has allowed much less waiting for a lock through. Some tows can approach 800 ft, and some nautical authors claim 1000 ft long tows have been made. Smaller pleasure craft can navigate to as far as the Kanawha Falls' public access picnic park and fishing boat ramp while watching for submerged boulders as one might fish above the upper London Pool. The Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam at Gallipolis Ferry has a public museum with artifacts on display.|$|E

30|$|Vaccination is {{believed}} to be the most effective method for the prevention of infectious diseases. Thus it is imperative to develop cost effective and scalable process for the production of vaccines so as to make them affordable for mass use. In this study, performance of a novel disposable iCELLis fixed bed bioreactor system was investigated for the production of some viral vaccines like Rabies, Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya vaccines in comparison to conventional systems like the commercially available packed bed <b>system</b> and <b>roller</b> bottle <b>system.</b> Vero and MRC- 5 cell substrates were evaluated for growth parameters in all the three systems maintaining similar seeding density, multiplicity of infection (MOI) and media components. It was observed that Vero cells showed similar growth in all the three bioreactors whereas MRC- 5 cells showed better growth in iCELLis Nano <b>system</b> and <b>roller</b> bottle <b>system.</b> Subsequently, the virus infection and antigen production studies also revealed that for Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya iCELLis Nano bioreactor system was better to the commercial packed bed bioreactor and <b>roller</b> bottle <b>systems.</b> Although for rabies antigen production commercially available packed bed bioreactor system was found to be better. This study shows that different bioreactor platforms may be employed for viral vaccine production and iCELLis Nano is one of such new convenient and a stable platform for production of human viral vaccines.|$|R
50|$|The report {{concluded}} that while externally the FX-05 bears obvious design elements {{there are several}} notable differences. The receiver which was styled after the G36 is in fact coupled with a simple gas piston similar in operation to the AK series which is then attached through a delayed <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> to the weapons recoil delaying system. While the more advanced parts of the rifle {{were found to be}} independently Mexican produced, Heckler & Koch officials still questioned the DGIM (the manufacturer of the FX-05) regarding the issue of the rifles receiver system which is almost identical to the G36's. It is believed that the receiver was made to be as similar to the G36 to maximize commonality between the two weapons as many of Mexico's police forces are issued with the G36. Either way it appears that the newer post lawsuit versions of the FX-05 feature a different newly designed receiver, as the newer FX-05 come with a four position fire selection (safe, single shot, three round burst, full auto) whereas the original FX-05 came with only three firing selections (safe, single shot, full auto). This theory is also reinforced by the fact the new black FX-05 models feature a visible metal protrusion before the magazine ejector and the receiver is noticeably smaller.|$|E

5000|$|The Pilot was {{the first}} large post-war British Ford. It {{was based on the}} pre-war 22 hp Model 62 chassis, and was {{initially}} offered with the 2227 cc side-valve engine from the 1939 model. [...] These initial engines were Canadian-made surplus stock from wartime production of Bren gun carriers.
