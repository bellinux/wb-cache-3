The {{following}} morning, Grace is upset by {{a phone call}} that reveals her father is being released from prison, and <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consoled by Mason. She arrives at Short Term 12 to discover that Jayden has been picked up by her father overnight. She is angry at the decision to send Jayden back to her father, but her boss maintains that Jayden denied that she was abused by him. Later that day, Grace finds that Marcus has attempted to commit suicide {{after the death of}} his fish.|$|E
5|$|Shana formulates a {{countermeasure}} and {{is ultimately}} successful in adding a single law to Xanadu where the Denizens {{are not allowed}} to eat humans anymore. With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left behind. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores all humans in Misaki City whose existence was absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together.|$|E
5|$|Using a wheelchair, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan) {{continues}} to order Bree (Marcia Cross) around at his whim {{and refuses to}} let her give him a bath. When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the waffles on a shelf he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she must be more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

The Congressional-Executive Commission on China writes that the facilities “are used specifically to detain Falun Gong practitioners who have completed terms in reeducation through labor (RTL) camps but whom authorities refuse to release.” Practitioners who are involuntarily detained in the transformation centers must pay tuition fees amounting to hundreds of dollars. The fees are extorted from family members {{as well as from}} practitioners’ work units and employers.|$|E

25|$|Oba captures Kahlan and {{is ordered}} by the Keeper to take her, along with the Sword of Truth, to the Pillars of Creation. Using his link to the sword, Richard pursues Oba to the Pillars, where he {{encounters}} Jennsen, who has also been drawn to the same spot by the Keeper in order to kill Richard. The Keeper's supreme plan, however, was for Richard to kill Jennsen at the Pillars of Creation and thereby open a gate between the Keeper's realm {{and the world of}} the living. Richard discerns the plan and <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> goaded into cooperating. Jennsen recognizes his integrity and the Keeper's plan is foiled. She learns that the men who were sent to kill her mother were actually soldiers of the Imperial Order, and after coming to believe that Richard is truly a loving and caring brother, she joins him and Kahlan in their quest against Jagang.|$|E
25|$|Seemingly {{destined to}} become linked as implied by their names (Doro means “east” and Anyanwu means “sun”), they engage in a clash of wills that lasts over a century. Some critics read their {{struggle}} as that between “masculine” and “feminine” perspectives with Doro as the patriarch who controls and dominates his people and Anyanwu as the matriarch who nurtures and protects her own. Others see their relationship as resembling that of master and slave. Doro’s first assessment of Anyanwu, for example, is as valuable “wild seed,” whose genes will enhance his breeding experiments and so decides to “tame and breed her.” This master/slave dynamic becomes complicated once Anyanwu <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> submissive to Doro’s requests and protects his people against him. Toward {{the end of the}} novel, Doro realizes he cannot bend Anyanwu’s will and, admitting her worth, he relents some of his absolute power in order to reconcile with her.|$|E
25|$|Rose and the Doctor also {{decide to}} {{investigate}} the party and don servant garb to disguise themselves. The Doctor and Rose learn that Pete and Jackie are childless and about to divorce. When Rose attempts {{to discuss it with}} Jackie she is rebuked for overstepping her bounds. Suddenly the party is interrupted by the Cybermen, who smash into the house and surround the guests. Lumic calls the President, who is in attendance, telling him that he is moving forward with his plans and that all of humanity will be upgraded. Lumic tells everyone that upgrading is compulsory and that anyone who refuses will be deleted. The President <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upgraded and is killed by a Cyberman. The partygoers panic, try to flee and the Cybermen begin killing them. The Doctor, Rose, and Pete escape the house and encounter Mickey and the Preachers outside. They try firing upon the advancing Cybermen with automatic rifles, but their bullets do no damage and soon they are surrounded. The Doctor tells everyone to surrender and tells the Cybermen that they are volunteering for the upgrade. The Cybermen tell them that they are incompatible and will be deleted. The episode ends with the Cybermen advancing on them.|$|E

Von Kammacher tries {{to tell her that}} he loves her and wants a life with her in New York but she <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tied down by one man. He gives up on her and they go their separate ways after she turns down his offer to live with him in New York. Von Kammacher is impressed by an art gallery and takes an interest in fine art. Through the artistic community, he is introduced to a kind and pleasant sculptor named Eva Burns, and they develop a friendship. A New York doctor, who is a friend of von Kammacher, offers him the use of a mountain cabin, where it is hoped that Friedrich will find some peace and solace. While he is in the mountains, a telegram from Denmark arrives in New York with information that von Kammacher's wife has died. Upon hearing the news, Friedrich falls critically ill. Eva takes it upon herself to tend to him in the mountain cabin. As she nurses him back to health, their relationship blossoms. Happiness returns to Friedrich's life as he realizes Eva will be a good mother for his children.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} had {{fourteen}} roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven {{were part of}} the first season's main cast. The season sees the promotion of three former guest stars, who begin acting as series regulars from the season's first episode. The series is narrated by Brenda Strong, {{from the point of view}} of the deceased Mary Alice Young, as she observes, from a unique perspective, the lives of the Wisteria Lane residents and her former best friends. Susan Mayer, portrayed by Teri Hatcher, is divorcée and single mother, who, in her continuous search for a romantic commitment, ends up in bed with her former husband. Felicity Huffman portrayed Lynette Scavo, who starts neglecting her responsibilities as a mother, after the realization of her undeniable talent for advertising results in her going back to work after a six-year absence. Marcia Cross portrayed Bree Van de Kamp, whose flawless life is shaken after she starts dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, while trying to overcome her guilt for having dated the man who killed him. Former model Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria, who suffers a miscarriage just as she starts accepting upcoming motherhood. Nicollette Sheridan portrayed Edie Britt, whose commitment issues and numerous one night stands have made her an iconic character. Ricardo Antonio Chavira played Gabrielle's husband, Carlos Solis, who has to cope with the revelation of his wife's affair with their gardener, while trying to get out of jail. Mark Moses continues his role of widower Paul Young, who tries to cover up the murder of his adoptive son's biological mother. Zach Young, portrayed by Cody Kasch, finally learns about his true identity, but <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of his father's life, whereas Julie Mayer, Susan's daughter portrayed by Andrea Bowen, deals with her parents' unexpected reconciliation. James Denton portrayed Mike Delfino, who has to deal with both his break-up with Susan Mayer, and his recently discovered biological son. Previously a recurring character throughout the last episodes of the previous season, Betty Applewhite, portrayed by Alfre Woodard, was conceived as a new resident of Wisteria Lane, whose mysterious arc is the season's main storyline. Also promoted from guest stars to series regulars were Doug Savant and Richard Burgi, who portrayed Tom Scavo and Karl Mayer, respectively.|$|E
500|$|In 1862, a strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, {{arrives in}} Bangkok, Siam (later known as Thailand) {{at the request}} of the King of Siam to tutor his many children. [...] Anna's young son, Louis, fears the severe countenance of the King's prime minister, the Kralahome, but Anna <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intimidated ("I Whistle a Happy Tune"). The Kralahome has come to escort them to the palace, where they are {{expected}} to live – a violation of Anna's contract, which calls for them to live in a separate house.

500|$|Scully's co-option of Mulders' usual role also {{demonstrates}} {{the complexity of}} her character. Although she is strongly influenced by her scientific background, she has religious faith too. Paul C. Peterson notes that although this episode is not directly about religion, it shows {{the first of several}} visions Scully experiences throughout the series; later visions appear in episodes more directly related to religion and Scully's faith, such as [...] "One Breath", [...] "Elegy" [...] and [...] "All Souls". In this episode, her faith in her father ultimately proves stronger than her belief in the paranormal as she <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tempted by Boggs. Rather than take him up on his offer to help her contact her father, Scully visits her partner in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Chrono Trigger DS {{added two}} new {{scenarios}} to the game. In the first, Crono {{and his friends}} can help a [...] "lost sanctum" [...] of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to Triggers sequel, Chrono Cross. In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army {{in the town of}} Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia. The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the Time Devourer—a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in Chrono Cross. A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{second half}} is opened by the two-part [...] "Stem/Long Stem", which recalls genres such as ambient and jungle. DJ Shadow's {{trademark}} drum chopping is juxtaposed {{with several other}} diverse sampled parts, including string movements, comedy routines, film soundtracks, and blues music. Andy Kellman of AllMusic describes it as a [...] "suite of often melancholy music, a piece that consistently <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pigeonholed into any musical style." [...] "Transmission 2" [...] plays before the album proceeds with [...] "Mutual Slump", a [...] "sedate funk" [...] track featuring female spoken narration and prominent samples of Björk's [...] "Possibly Maybe". [...] "Organ Donor" [...] is structured around a chopped-up organ solo from Giorgio Moroder's [...] "Tears", backed by a funk breakbeat. [...] "Why Hip-Hop Sucks in '96" [...] – DJ Shadow's commentary {{on the state of}} hip hop music at the time – is a brief interlude featuring a looping G-funk-esque beat and a lone voice proclaiming: [...] "It's the money!" ...|$|E

500|$|Dave Simpson from The Guardian gave a {{positive}} review for the Birmingham concert, awarding {{the show with}} 4 out of 5 stars. He stated that [...] "Gaga has often {{been accused of being}} all artifice and no heart, but tonight's show is a powerful statement from a star who <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pinned down or written off." [...] Daniel Dylan Wray from The Independent awarded the Birmingham concert with 4 out of 5 stars and described ArtRave as [...] "loud, colourful and frequently emblematic of feel-good, throwaway party times". Katie Fitzpatrick from Manchester Evening News awarded the concert with 5 out of 5 stars. She praised Lady Gaga's voice, her live band, the outfits and the connection of the fans – especially in this show that Gaga helped a fan to propose to his partner on stage. Katie stated that [...] "the ostentatiously named ArtRave may reaffirm that Gaga the show-woman is definitely about her art. But this little lady with the powerful set of lungs is also undoubtedly all heart." [...] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the Financial Times rated the concert three out of five stars. He criticized the songs from Artpop except the title track, but complimented the acoustic and piano sequences.|$|E
500|$|The only named, {{speaking}} female {{character in}} the male-dominated film, Jasmine lacks both female companions and a motherly figure (the male characters account for 90% of the film's dialogue). The character has come to resent the patriarchal society in which she lives. Movies and the Mind: Theories of the Great Psychoanalysts Applied to Film author William Indick observed that Jasmine represents [...] "the rejection of the father-king's domination and control over his daughter's life", resembling [...] "a strong and assertive heroine who rebels against her father's tyranny rather than passively accepting his will." [...] Jasmine's life is almost entirely determined by men, by whom she <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ordered, constantly voicing her disapproval by rejecting arrogant suitors and yelling at men who attempt to make decisions on her behalf, while challenging traditional gender roles and male authority figures. Jasmine's father, the Sultan, responds to his daughter's constant rejection of potential suitors with [...] "I don't know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn't nearly so picky", indicating that Jasmine's mother [...] "belonged to a generation of docile pre-feminist... women." [...] At times Jasmine can seem judgmental; she originally has a thoroughly negative opinion of all princes until she meets a disguised Aladdin. In Ulrich Marzolph's book The Arabian Nights Reader, the author described the character as [...] "the mouthpiece of opposition to a vaguely defined Middle Eastern backwardness and authoritarianism." ...|$|E
500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family. Additionally, when Clair is at work, Cliff willingly assumes traditionally female household responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Both Clair's professional and personal lives operate alongside each other rather smoothly with little conflict. However, despite being a full-time lawyer, she is seldom shown {{at work in the}} courtroom; audiences see the character at home more often than anywhere else. According to Women Watching Television: Gender, Class, and Generation in the American Television Experience author Andrea L. Press, Clair's role demonstrates [...] "the hegemonic view that families need not change to accommodate working wives and mothers", believing that the show mostly depicts Clair at home to avoid exploring the everyday conflicts working women endure in their daily lives. One of the series' more political moments, Clair <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer. When Clair learns that her all-white male co-panelists only want to hear opinions {{from the perspective of a}} black woman, Clair delivers a speech that reads, [...] "I am also a human being, who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable about history ... But when you look at me, this is all you see in me, a black woman?" ...|$|E
