5|$|Audiences {{generally}} {{show their}} appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> {{of failing to}} hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.|$|E
5|$|In coastal regions, {{dolphins}} <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of {{colliding with}} boats. Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving {{behavior in the}} presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E
40|$|Each {{scientist}} who refutes {{a century old}} theory <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being accused of incompetence and of irritating those scientists who absorbed the old theory “with their mother’s milk". And {{if this is a}} {{scientist who}} has achieved a good deal in his area of knowledge, he also <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of losing his hardearned authority. This is borne out by the history of new discoveries in physics. Thus, the great physicis...|$|R

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Live & Kicking was {{conceived}} {{as a replacement for}} Going Live!, a successful Saturday morning programme that had been running for six years. It was first broadcast on 2 October 1993 at 9am on BBC1. The original hosts were Andi Peters, Emma Forbes who had presented a cookery segment in Going Live!, and John Barrowman. For the second series, John was relegated to host the showbiz Electric Circus segment, leaving Andi and Emma to become the main hosts. He left after one series of Electric Circus to concentrate on acting. Comedy duo Trevor and Simon and Peter Simon, in the <b>Run</b> <b>the</b> <b>Risk</b> segment, were also regulars who had featured on Going Live!.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with any}} surgery, {{complications}} may occur. The most common problems a patient <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of {{because of this}} surgery include infections, reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula. The main infection that a patient <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of is pneumonia. [...] Pneumothorax occurs when there is air trapped between the lung and the chest wall. This {{can lead to the}} patients lung collapsing. [...] A bronchopleural fistula is when there is a tube like opening that allows air to escape. Before surgery takes place, all risks should be discussed with a doctor.|$|R

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|Rebellions {{can occur}} if {{the loyalty of}} a {{particular}} province falls too low, with a rebel army appearing in the province to attempt to assume control from the owners. Civil wars may also take place if several generals commanding large armies have sufficiently low loyalty. In {{the event of a}} civil war, the player is given the choice to back either the current rulers or the rebels. It had been planned to allow other factions who had established a prior claim to the throne by marriage to princesses to join in a civil war to claim the throne for themselves; however, this was never implemented. Naval warfare is carried out upon the campaign map, where ships can be built and organised into fleets. These fleets can be used to control the game's sea regions and form sea lanes, allowing trade and troop movement between provinces that have constructed a port. Fleets can engage in sea battles with foreign fleets, although unlike land battles these are resolved by the computer. Religion plays an important aspect in Medieval: Total War, with religious differences between the Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim factions affecting diplomacy and population loyalty. Catholic factions must also respond to the wishes of the Papal States; factions gain favour by refraining from hostilities with other Catholic nations and responding to Crusades, else they <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of excommunication. The option to launch a holy war {{in the form of a}} Crusade or Jihad is open to both Catholic and Muslim factions.|$|E

25|$|Conjunctivitis due to {{chemicals}} {{is treated}} via irrigation with Ringer's lactate or saline solution. Chemical injuries (particularly alkali burns) are medical emergencies, {{as they can}} lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage. People with chemically induced conjunctivitis should not touch their eyes, {{regardless of whether or}} not their hands are clean, as they <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of spreading the condition to another eye.|$|E
25|$|In practice, most mathematicians {{either do}} not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the {{consistency}} of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.|$|E

25|$|Max, Chris, Gertie, Duncan, and Vicki {{wake up in}} the woods. Every 92 minutes, they {{encounter}} a van with two characters from Camp Bloodbath, and realize they have somehow been transported inside the movie. The group awkwardly pass themselves off as new camp counselors, and hitch a ride to camp. They let the first couple of murders happen without interference, but when Duncan is killed by the film's machete-wielding villain Billy Murphy, they realize that they too <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of becoming victims.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans are}} {{controversial}} {{because they would}} mean {{the loss of the}} minimalist appearance of the building, the clarity of the layout and public spaces in the building. The closure of Secklow Gate was even proposed, removing the rooftop loading facility that is such an important feature of the building. Additionally, objectors say that the plans to erect dwellings in the central area <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of hampering movement around and {{in and out of the}} centre as well as spoiling views of the shopping building.|$|E
25|$|Medical devices {{often include}} fan-cooled heat sinks, to cool their {{electronic}} components. While these systems sometimes include HEPA filters to collect microbes, some pathogens do pass through these filters, collect inside the device and are eventually blown out and infect other patients. Devices used in operating rooms rarely include fans, {{so as to}} minimize the chance of transmission. Also, medical equipment, high-end computers, swimming pools, drinking-water systems and other products that utilize liquid lines <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of biofouling as biological growth occurs inside them.|$|E

25|$|Paternity {{confusion}} is proposed {{to be an}} adaptive function for preventing infanticide. Thus, if the female can successfully create paternity confusion, males will {{be less likely to}} kill her offspring, as the lack of paternity certainty means that they <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of killing their own genetic offspring. Additionally, the males, in turn, are likely to protect the same female's offspring from infanticide that may be committed by other adults within the species. Once again, this is because they are uncertain about paternity, and aim to protect infants that are genetically their own.|$|E
25|$|Citizens {{living in}} the West Bank found to be guilty of 'defaming religion' under the old Jordanian law, <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of years of imprisonment, up to for life. This {{happened}} to 26-year-old blogger Waleed Al-Husseini in October 2010, who {{was arrested and charged}} with defaming religion after openly declaring himself an atheist and criticising religion online. He was detained for ten months. After being released, he eventually fled to France, as the PA continued to harass him, and citizens called for him to be lynched. He later found out he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in absentia.|$|E
25|$|Operation Spanner in the UK {{proves that}} BDSM {{practitioners}} still <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being stigmatized as criminals. In 2003, {{the media coverage}} of Jack McGeorge showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one's job, even in countries where no law restricts it. Here a clear difference {{can be seen to}} the situation of homosexuality. The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless, it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.|$|E
