40|$|The present paper aims at {{pointing}} out {{an important aspect}} {{in the implementation of}} the professionals’ activity through the joint venture, more precisely, it raises the problem of the admissibility of the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the associate. Thus, although one can tell that to a certain extent the joint venture can be regarded as a species of the partnership deed, it does not acquire legal personality, reason why we have set as objective to analyse the problem of the exclusion of an associate from the practical perspective, as the legislation does not offer a clear solution in this regard. Consequently, the present study shall have the following structure: 1) Introduction, 2) The concept of joint venture, 3) The relation between the joint venture parties and the third parties, 4) Exclusion of the associate, 5) Conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Investigation of {{pulmonary}} pathology with {{computed tomography}} also allows visualisation {{of the heart}} and major vessels. We sought to explore whether clinically relevant cardiac pathology could be identified on computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> the <b>exclusion</b> of pulmonary embolism (PE). 100 consecutive CT contrast-enhanced pulmonary angiograms carried out <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> of PE at a single centre were assessed retrospectively by two cardiologists. Findings Evidence of PE was reported in 5 % of scans. Incidental cardiac findings included: aortic wall calcification (54 %), coronary calcification (46 %), cardiomegaly (41 %), atrial dilatation (18 %), mitral annulus calcification (15 %), right ventricular dilatation (11 %), aortic dilatation (8 %) and right ventricular thrombus (1 %). Apart from 3 (3 %) reports describing cardiomegaly, no other cardiac findings were described in radiologists' reports. Other reported pulmonary abnormalities included: lung nodules (14 %), lobar collapse/consolidation (8 %), pleural effusion (2 %), lobar collapse/consolidation (8 %), emphysema (6 %) and pleural calcification (4 %). Conclusions CTPAs <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> the <b>exclusion</b> of PE have a high yield of cardiac abnormalities. Although these abnormalities may not have implications for acute clinical management, they may, nevertheless, be important in long-term care. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{into the}} {{development}} of Pinoy Idol, a firestrom grew on online platforms <b>requesting</b> <b>for</b> Ignacios <b>exclusion</b> as its program director primarily because of his frequent use of butterflies (whether live butterflies or having people wear butterfly wings) on every project he has directed with critics finding the idea [...] "tacky and definitely not Idol-material". He commented that he would still stick to his [...] "lucky trademark" [...] and even taunted petitioners to direct the show and put beetles or mosquitoes on the set {{if that is what}} they want - a statement which only added to the collective anger of fans. However, no butterfly-inspired designs were used in the program.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{solutions}} {{have been proposed}} for the problem of mutual exclusion in distributed systems. Some of these approaches have since been extended to a prioritized environment suitable for real-time applications but impose a higher message passing overhead than our approach. We present a new protocol <b>for</b> prioritized mutual <b>exclusion</b> in a distributed environment. Our approach uses a token-based model working on a logical tree structure, which is dynamically modified. In addition, we utilize a set of local queues whose union would resemble a single global queue. The prioritized algorithm has an average overhead of O(log(n)) messages per <b>request</b> <b>for</b> mutual <b>exclusion</b> with a worstcase overhead of O(n), where n represents the number of nodes in the system. Thus, our prioritized algorithm matches the message complexity of the best nonprioritized algorithms while previous prioritized algorithms have a higher message complexity, to our knowledge.

40|$|The Writing Instrument Manufacturers Association (“WIMA”) is the U. S. trade {{association}} of the pen, pencil and eraser industry. Our members account for approximately 75 % of the manufacture and distribution of writing instruments in this country. A list of our members is attached as Exhibit 1. WIMA has regularly participated in rulemakings before the CPSC since the agency’s formation in 1973. We are writing to you about a very serious compliance problem involving lead in ball point pens and roller ball pens. Based upon our analysis, all pen points used in these products, when marketed as children’s products as defined by Section 235 (a) of the CPSIA, will be violative of Section 101 (a) (2) of the CPSIA when the total lead provision goes into effect on February 10, 2009. And {{there is no alternative}} metal {{that can be used for}} pen points that does not contain some violative quantity of lead. Accordingly, WIMA, on behalf of its members, and any other importers, manufacturers or distributors similarly impacted, files this Section 101 <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> Lead Content <b>Exclusion</b> <b>for</b> Pen Point Components. The Request is supported by a toxicological study and report fromWoodhall Stopford, MD, MSPH and Danielle Capellini, B. Sc., MHA, which is attached as Exhibit 2. For your convenience, we are following the outline set forth in proposed 16 CFR Part 1500. 89 (c) (4) <b>for</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> lead content <b>exclusions.</b> To the extent that additional information is required by the final rule, we would be pleased to supplement this request with such information.

Our approach uses a token-based model working on a logical tree structure, which is dynamically modified. In addition, we utilize a set of local queues whose union would resemble a single global queue. Furthermore, our algorithm is designed for out-of-order message delivery, handles messages asynchronously and supports multiple requests from one node for multi-threaded nodes. The prioritized algorithm has an average overhead of messages per <b>request</b> <b>for</b> mutual <b>exclusion</b> with a worst-case overhead of, where represents the number of nodes in the system. Thus, our prioritized algorithm matches the message complexity of the best non-prioritized algorithms while previous prioritized algorithms have a higher message complexity, to our knowledge. Our concept of local queues {{can be incorporated into}} arbitrary token-based protocols with or without priority support {{to reduce the amount of}} messages. Performance results indicate that the additional functionality of our algorithm comes at the cost of 30 % longer response times within our test environment for distributed execution when compared with an unprioritized algorithm. This result suggests that the algorithm should be used when strict priority ordering is required. ...|$|R
