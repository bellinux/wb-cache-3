40|$|Background: Brown rice plant hopper (BRPH) {{is one of}} {{the main}} insect pests for rice plant. To {{strengthen}} the acquisition of BRPH insect pest information has important significance for prevent and cure insect pests of rice plant. As one of the new tools of real-time acquisition of BRPH insect pest information, electronic nose has been preliminary studied in the detection of BRPH. But all of those studies are in the test phase and many questions still unexplored. Methods: This paper used electronic nose (PEN 3) sample the volatile of U 31 N (under the 3 th-instar nymphs) and 031 N (over the 3 th-instar nymphs) and <b>rice</b> <b>stem.</b> Decrease the disturbance of electronic nose response values which caused by environment factors via remove benchmark value. Using principal component analysis (PCA), comparison of sensor response values, Euclidean distance (ED), fuzzy C- means clustering analysis (FCM) and loading analysis (Loadings) for analysis. Results: The results of ED analysis prove the correctness of PCA and the comparison analysis of sensor response values. The classification accuracy of FCM for U 31 N, 031 N and <b>rice</b> <b>stem</b> is 70 %. The misclassifications are existed between <b>rice</b> <b>stem</b> and 031 N, but not existed between <b>rice</b> <b>stem</b> and U 31 N. Discussions: The classification effect of PCA is poor. Compare with 031 N has two-part change trends of sensor value closed to <b>rice</b> <b>stem,</b> U 31 N only have one. We can preliminary infer that the correlations between 031 N and <b>rice</b> <b>stem</b> are stronger than the correlation between U 31 N and <b>rice</b> <b>stem.</b> Conclusion: According to Loadings results, we can speculate that in the young stage of BRPH's growth, BRPHs are less influenced by <b>rice</b> <b>stem.</b> But the influence will be enlarged with the increase of the age. This experiment indicates the correlations are exists between the volatiles of BRPH and <b>rice</b> <b>stem,</b> which supports scientific reference for further BRPH detection via electronic nose...|$|R
