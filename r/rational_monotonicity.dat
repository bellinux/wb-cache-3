40|$|Abstract. The {{deferred}} acceptance {{algorithm is}} often used to allocate indivisible objects when monetary transfers are not allowed. We provide two characterizations of agent-proposing deferred acceptance allocation rules. Two new axioms, individually <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity</b> and weak Maskin monotonicity, are essential to our analysis. An allocation rule is the agent-proposing deferred acceptance rule for some acceptant substitutable priority if and only if it satisfies non-wastefulness and individually <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity.</b> An alternative characterization is in terms of non-wastefulness, population monotonicity and weak Maskin monotonicity. We also offer an axiomatization of the deferred acceptance rule generated by an exogenously specified priority structure. We apply our results to characterize efficient deferred acceptance rules. 1...|$|E
40|$|In [12] Lehmann and Magidor study {{a strong}} nonmonotonic, {{so-called}} rational consequence relation, which extends the preferential consequence relation of [10] by also validating {{the rule of}} <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity.</b> Every rational consequence relation can be semantically represented by a ranked model, and vice versa. To answer for a conditional assertion a→b the question whether it is entailed {{by a set of}} conditional assertions K, it is not sufficient to check if it is derivable by the rules for rational consequence relations, or semantically, to check if it is valid in all ranked models of K, as it can be shown that the intersection of all ranked models does not in general satisfy <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity.</b> The authors therefore define a semantic selection in order to obtain the so-called rational closure. However, a proof theory for rational closure is missing. This paper will fill the syntactical gap for a finite language by defining an adaptive logic ARCs such that an assertion a→b is derivable from a knowledge base K containing conditional assertions and negated conditional assertions iff it is in the rational closure of K...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} based on the default {{integration}} for Description Logics (DL) presented by Quantz and Royer at KR’ 92. We specify the general framework for Preferential Default Description Logics (PDDL), and present various alternative PDDL, addressing issues like implicit objects, priorization between defaults, and maximization of default application. We show that all PDDL satisfy the formal properties of system P (Kraus, Lehman and Magidor) and that D j Σ, which {{is based on}} a priority ordering on multisets of defaults and motivated by an application in Natural Language Processing, even satisfies <b>Rational</b> <b>Monotonicity.</b> Finally, we show paralle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{piecewise}} <b>rational</b> interpolating polynomial <b>monotonicity</b> preserving interpolation, {{adopting the}} numerical quadrature {{to calculate the}} arc length si at everyone of the ordered vector point on the parametric curve, an approximating scheme for the inverse one of arc length function of the parametric curve is constructed, which passes through the n+ 1 points. A C 2 nearly arc-length parameterization is presented by substituting the approximating scheme for the parameter t. The nearly Arc-length Parameterization passes through the n+ 1 vector-valued points, and has its accurate arc length parameters at {{every one of the}} ordered vector points. Moreover, our further study shows that the nearly Arc-length Parameteriz ation carries the exactly same geometric shape because it comes form a kind of parametric transformation of the original curve. Therefore, this process provides a key to the difficult problem of the arc length parameterization of parametric curve. Index Terms — CAD, Monotonicity preservin...|$|R
40|$|Consequence {{relations}} on propositional formulas are binary relations on propositional formulas {{that represent}} {{certain types of}} entailment - formal or semi-formal derivation of conclusion from a certain set of premises. Some of well known examples are classical implication (standard logical entailment), preference relations (i. e. relations that satisfy Reflexivity, Left logical equivalence, Right weakening, And, Or and Cautious monotonicity) rational relations (i. e. preference relations that also satisfy <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity),</b> consequence relations (prime examples are qualitative possibilities and necessities) etc. More than two decades various consequence relations are used in automated decision making, product control, risk assessment and so on.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{systematic}} study of abductive consequence relations. We show that a monotone abductive consequence relation satisfies the properties of a cumulative monotonic system as defined by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor when the disjunction of all abductive explanations is the explanation used to justify the observations. We also show that, in general, for this class of abductive consequence relations the Or rule does not hold. We present an example that shows that when there are preferences between different abductive explanations monotonicity does not hold. We show that nonmonotonic abductive systems preserve a partial version of <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity</b> and in fact {{are very similar to}} rational relations. We also present semantic characterizations of both monotonic and nonmonotonic abductive systems in terms of cumulative models as defined by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor...|$|E
40|$|We {{defend a}} set of {{acceptance}} rules that avoids the lottery paradox, that is closed under classical entailment, and that accepts uncertain propositions without ad hoc restrictions. We show that the rules we recommend provide a semantics that validates exactly Adams ’ conditional logic and are exactly the rules that preserve a natural, logical structure over probabilistic credal states that we call probalogic. To motivate probalogic, we first expand classical logic to geologic, which fills the entire unit cube, and then we project the upper surfaces of the geological cube onto the plane of probabilistic credal states by means of standard, linear perspective, which may be interpreted {{as an extension of}} the classical condition of indifference.

40|$|Towards {{probabilistic}} formalisms {{for resolving}} local inconsistencies under model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, we present probabilistic generalizations of Pearl’s entailment in System Z and Lehmann’s lexicographic entailment.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to reasoning from statistical and subjective knowledge, {{which is based on}} a combination of probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with approaches to default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. More precisely, we introduce the notions of -, lexicographic, and conditional entailment for conditional constraints, which are probabilistic generalizations of Pearl's entailment in system, Lehmann's lexicographic entailment, and Geffner's conditional entailment, respectively. We show that the new formalisms have nice properties. In particular, they show a similar behavior as referenceclass reasoning in a number of uncontroversial examples. The new formalisms, however, also avoid many drawbacks of reference-class reasoning. More precisely, they can handle complex scenarios and even purely probabilistic subjective knowledge as input. Moreover, conclusions are drawn in a global way from all the available knowledge as a whole. We then show that the new formalisms also have nice general nonmonotonic properties. In detail, the new notions of -, lexicographic, and conditional entailment have similar properties as their classical counterparts. In particular, they all satisfy the rationality postulates proposed by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, and they have some general irrelevance and direct inference properties. Moreover, the new notions of - and lexicographic entailment satisfy the property of <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity.</b> Furthermore, the new notions of -, lexicographic, and conditional entailment are proper generalizations of both their classical counterparts and the classical notion of logical entailment for conditional constraints.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} on the {{combination}} of two powerful approaches to uncertain reasoning: logic programming in a probabilistic setting, on the one hand, and the information-theoretical principle of maximum entropy, on the other hand. More precisely, we present two approaches to probabilistic logic programming under maximum entropy. The first one {{is based on the}} usual notion of entailment under maximum entropy, and is defined for the very general case of probabilistic logic programs over Boolean events. The second one is based on a new notion of entailment under maximum entropy, where the principle of maximum entropy is coupled with the closed world assumption (CWA) from classical logic programming. It is only defined for the more restricted case of probabilistic logic programs over conjunctive events. We then analyze the nonmonotonic behavior of both approaches along benchmark examples and along general properties for default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. It turns out that both approaches have very nice nonmonotonic features. In particular, they realize some inheritance of probabilistic knowledge along subclass relationships, without suffering from the problem of inheritance blocking and from the drowning problem. They both also satisfy the property of <b>rational</b> <b>monotonicity</b> and several irrelevance properties. We finally present algorithms for both approaches, which are based on generalizations of recent techniques for probabilistic logic programming under logical entailment.
