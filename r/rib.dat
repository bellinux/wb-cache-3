5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double <b>rib</b> was present, but the <b>rib</b> shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the <b>rib</b> shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a <b>rib</b> pit, which is formed by the <b>rib</b> and the <b>rib</b> shield. The <b>rib</b> shield, and consequently a <b>rib</b> pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a <b>rib,</b> a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E

5|$|Invasion of bone by {{cancer is}} the most common source of cancer pain. It is usually felt as tenderness, with {{constant}} background pain and instances of spontaneous or movement-related exacerbation, and is frequently described as severe. <b>Rib</b> fractures are common in breast, prostate and other cancers with <b>rib</b> metastases.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>ribs.</b> Form-ribs, plate-type <b>ribs,</b> truss <b>ribs,</b> closed-ribs, forged <b>ribs</b> and milled <b>ribs,</b> where form-ribs are used for light to medium loading and milled <b>ribs</b> offer the {{greatest}} strength.|$|R

Bending moment of longitudinal <b>ribs</b> with loading is depend on intervals of longitudinal <b>ribs</b> and of transversal <b>ribs.</b> We obtain maximum bending moments of longitudinal <b>ribs</b> with FEM varing intervals of longitudinal <b>ribs</b> and of transversal <b>ribs</b> and the approximate expressions of the maximum bending moments...|$|R
5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average <b>rib</b> eye area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and the reported possible difference in <b>rib</b> eye area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from heterozygous parents is estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which is unpredictable without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for the <b>rib</b> eye EPD.|$|E
5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his <b>rib,</b> and he {{believed}} that the <b>rib</b> had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked <b>rib</b> had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad <b>rib</b> (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the <b>rib.</b> The <b>rib</b> is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the <b>rib</b> shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E

5|$|When {{one parent}} is {{heterozygous}} for the mutation, {{and the other}} homozygous for the mutation or the normal form of the myostatin gene, the expected average difference in <b>rib</b> eye area of progeny will be about 0.9in2 (12.3in2 x 7.5%), {{depending on whether the}} mutation or normal form of the gene is inherited from the heterozygous parent. In this case, the unpredictable variation in <b>rib</b> eye area represents about twice the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ribbed</b> bog moss reproduces asexually from {{specialized}} gametophyte {{tissues and}} from plant breakage. It reproduces frequently from gemmae. <b>Ribbed</b> bog moss may also regenerate when paraphyses (minute filaments arising from <b>ribbed</b> bog moss's antheridia) detach. In the laboratory, 12.5% of detached <b>ribbed</b> bog moss paraphyses developed into propagules. <b>Ribbed</b> bog moss establishes readily when chunks of <b>ribbed</b> bog moss shoots are {{moved to new}} sites by soil movement or transplanting. <b>Ribbed</b> bog moss is apparently competitive {{in its ability to}} establish from stem chunks. In a laboratory experiment, <b>ribbed</b> bog moss that was collected from an Alberta peatland, shredded, and placed on a peat substrate showed greatest frequency (100%) of 4 moss species so treated. <b>Ribbed</b> bog moss also showed fastest growth relative to the other mosses throughout the 125-day experiment.|$|R

In <b>ribbed</b> vaults, not only are there <b>ribs</b> {{spanning}} the vaulted area transversely, but each vaulted bay has diagonal <b>ribs,</b> following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the structural member, in a <b>ribbed</b> vault, it is the <b>ribs</b> that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.|$|R

30|$|Longitudinal <b>ribs,</b> {{transverse}} <b>ribs</b> and stiffening steel pipes (see Fig.  3) {{are used}} to enforce the composite box girder. There are six longitudinal <b>ribs</b> on the bottom plate and generally two longitudinal <b>ribs</b> {{on each of the}} two webs. Transverse <b>ribs</b> are installed about every 1.67  m along the bridge span, and stiffening steel pipes are installed every 5  m. All of these <b>ribs</b> are modeled by shell elements of actual thickness, and the stiffening steel pipes are modeled by beam elements.|$|R
5000|$|Milled <b>ribs</b> {{are solid}} structures. They are {{manufactured}} by milling away excess material from a solid block of metal (usually using computer-controlled milling machines). The shape of these <b>ribs</b> is always accurately defined. Such <b>ribs</b> are used under similar conditions {{as those for}} forged <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In birds, <b>ribs</b> {{are present}} as {{distinct}} bones {{only on the}} thoracic region, although small fused <b>ribs</b> are present on the cervical vertebrae. The thoracic <b>ribs</b> of birds possess a wide projection to the rear; this uncinate process is an attachment for the shoulder muscles. Usually dogs have 26 ribs.Mammals usually also only have distinct <b>ribs</b> on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical <b>ribs</b> are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar <b>ribs</b> are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they {{are referred to as}} transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true <b>ribs</b> in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal <b>ribs</b> are never found in mammals.|$|R
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a <b>rib</b> from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the <b>rib.</b> The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
5|$|A Megalosaurus <b>rib</b> {{figured in}} 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a {{pathological}} swollen spot {{near the base}} of its capitular process.

5|$|Allen played rugby for the Trinity team before {{resuming}} cricket for the 1923 season. He began well, reaching fifty in {{a first-class}} {{match for the}} first time against Middlesex and taking six for 89 in the same game. Further bowling success followed but before the University Match, he once more injured his <b>rib</b> muscles. Persuaded to play anyway, Allen could only bowl short spells which lacked incisiveness and Cambridge lost heavily. Several critics, including some teammates, believed he did not try. During the match, Allen consulted a specialist over his frequent <b>rib</b> injuries; the specialist's treatment and a period of rest cured the problem for the remainder of his career. Allen's Cambridge season was further marred by differences with his captain, Claude Ashton, over team selections and tactics. The 1923 University Match was his final game for Cambridge as Trinity, unhappy with his lack of academic work, rusticated him in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ribbing</b> has {{a strong}} {{tendency}} to contract laterally, forming small pleats in which the purl stitches recede and the knit stitches come forward. Thus, <b>ribbing</b> is often used for cuffs, sweater hems and, more generally, any edge that should be form-fitting. The elasticity depends {{on the number of}} knit/purl transitions; 1&times;1 <b>ribbing</b> is more elastic than 2&times;2 <b>ribbing,</b> etc.However, some cable patterns may [...] "pull in" [...] more than <b>ribbing</b> (i.e., have a smaller gauge); in such cases, a <b>ribbed</b> border may flare out instead of contracting.|$|R
