40|$|Turning {{restriction}} {{is one of}} the commonest {{traffic management}} techniques and an effective low cost traffic improvement strategy in urban road networks. However, the literature has not paid much attention to the turning restriction design problem (TRDP), which aims to determine a set of intersections where turning restrictions should be implemented. In this paper, a bi-level programming model is proposed to formulate the TRDP. The upper level problem is to minimize the total travel cost from the viewpoint of traffic managers, and the lower level problem is to depict travelers ’ route choice behavior based on stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) theory. We propose a branch and bound method (BBM), based on the sensitivity analysis algorithm (SAA), to find the optimal turning <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy.</b> A branch strategy and a bound strategy are applied to accelerate the solution process of the TRDP. The computational experiments give promising results, showing that the optimal turning <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy</b> can obviously reduce system congestion and are robust to the variations o...|$|E

40|$|Road freight {{transport}} is considered {{as an important}} aspect of the Australian economy. Due to the operational characteristics (e. g. acceleration/deceleration, manoeuvrability) and physical specifications (e. g. length, size) of heavy vehicles, they impose negative impacts on surrounding traffic. These negative impacts include increasing traffic congestion, reducing traffic safety and increasing air and noise pollution. The negative impacts imposed by heavy vehicles would be intensified at arterial roads due to the presence of traffic lights when heavy vehicles have to decelerate at the red light, stop and then accelerate again. Considering the negative impacts of heavy vehicles on their surrounding traffic, suitable management strategies should be implemented to accommodate the increase in number of heavy vehicles. A typical method of managing heavy vehicle movements is through implementing alternative heavy vehicle <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies.</b> The main focus {{of this paper is to}} address the influence of heavy vehicle space <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies</b> for different classes of heavy vehicles on traffic congestion. In this research heavy vehicles have been classified into three classes including Rigid, Heavy Combination and Multi Combination. The road section that is used in this research is a section of Princes Highway in Melbourne, Australia. This section is 8. 8 km long and 13 signalised intersections exist within that distance. To ensure accurate evaluation of the <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies,</b> VISSIM traffic simulation software is used. The study area is modelled in VISSIM.

40|$|Road freight is an {{important}} aspect of the growing Australian economy. Between 2009 and 2014, there has been an increase of approximately 14. 7 % in the number of registered heavy vehicles, including light rigid, heavy rigid and articulated vehicles. Due to the operational (e. g. acceleration/deceleration, manoeuvrability) and physical (e. g. length, size) characteristics of heavy vehicles, they impose negative impacts on surrounding traffic, including increased traffic congestion, reduced traffic safety and environmental impacts, such as increased vehicular emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, NOx and carbon dioxide). The negative impacts imposed by heavy vehicles are intensified at interrupted traffic flows due to the presence of traffic lights. The acceleration/deceleration performance of heavy vehicles at traffic lights is lower than that of light vehicles. Due to the physical and operational characteristics of heavy vehicles, they impose negative impacts on the surrounding traffic. Different strategies have been applied to urban corridors to mitigate these impacts. Signal coordination will be implemented as a heavy vehicle management method. This research will test whether signal coordination may be a viable option to control heavy vehicles on an urban corridor. On the other hand, this research will implement a <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy</b> which restricts heavy vehicles based on their type (rigid, heavy combination and multi combination) as another form of heavy vehicle management. The road section that is used in this research is a section of Princes Highway in Melbourne, Australia. This section is 8. 2 km long with 3 lanes on each direction, and 13 signalised intersections within that distance. This section is selected since {{it is one of the}} main corridor in Melbourne with high percentage of heavy vehicles. In addition, many traffic signals exist in the selected section of highway which forms interrupted traffic flows. The research is initiated by modelling the corridor of study using VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation package. The model is built based on the physical characteristics of Princes Highway including number of lanes, lane widths, entry points and exit points. In this research, signal coordination is examined to assess its validity as an efficient method to reduce congestion caused by heavy vehicles. Three different signal coordination set-ups are used in this research. The first set-up targets passenger cars as the main beneficiary of signal coordination. The second set-up targets heavy vehicles as the main beneficiary of signal coordination. The third and final set-up targets all vehicles on the corridor. The influence of signal coordination was evaluated at existing heavy vehicle compositions, then the heavy vehicle composition is increased at 5 % increments reaching up to a 30 % heavy vehicle composition. Increasing the heavy vehicle compositions tested the ability of signal coordination to cope with the increased number of heavy vehicles in the corridor. The results from this research shows that signal coordination can be used as a heavy vehicle management method on a highway with interrupted traffic flows and during congestion. In addition, this research also shows that signal coordination is capable of handling high heavy vehicle compositions. On the other hand, three restriction strategies are evaluated in this thesis. Each <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy</b> restricts a certain type of heavy vehicle. The heavy vehicle types are categorised based on the guidelines used in the State of Victoria, Australia. The first management strategy restricts multi combination vehicles from using the corridor. The second strategy restricts multi and heavy combination vehicles from using the corridor. The third strategy restricts all heavy vehicles from using the corridor. This research has provided insight on the influence of a vehicle type <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy.</b> The main reason for proposing such a <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy</b> is to differentiate between the types of heavy vehicles and provide a clear picture of the influence that each heavy vehicle type poses on the surrounding traffic...|$|E

Large numbers of heavy vehicle lane changing manoeuvres {{can contribute to}} increase the number of traffic accidents and hence to reduce the freeway safety. The increase in the number of heavy vehicles on freeways has been the motivation to establish strategies to reduce the interaction between heavy vehicles and passenger cars. Previous studies have examined different lane <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies</b> for heavy vehicles using microscopic traffic simulation packages. Those packages mostly use a general lane changing model to estimate the lane changing behavior of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers. The general lane changing models ignore the fundamental differences in the lane changing behavior of passenger cars and heavy vehicles. However, an exclusive lane changing model for heavy vehicles can increase the accuracy of simulation models. The application of such a model can result in more reliable evaluation of lane <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies.</b> In this paper, different lane <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies</b> are defined for heavy vehicles. For each strategy, the macroscopic and microscopic traffic measurements of the two freeway sections in California are analyzed, using the VISSIM default lane changing model and an exclusive heavy vehicle lane changing model. The results show that the VISSIM default model unrealistically overestimates the observed number of heavy vehicle lane changing maneuvers and potentially overestimates the number of traffic accidents. Using the exclusive lane changing model for heavy vehicles enhances the accuracy of the VISSIM traffic simulation model in microscopically estimating the lane changing maneuvers of heavy vehicles...|$|R

During the same period, numerous nonventilatory therapies have been evaluated. Among them, modulation of fluid status and plasmatic oncotic pressure in patients have been the objects of studies--some promising, others disappointing in their physiological effects and outcome. ARDS is particularly characterized by pulmonary edema caused {{by an increase in}} pulmonary capillary permeability. In the early phase of ARDS, an associated septic state is usually responsible for hypovolemia. At this stage, hemodynamic optimization by early and adapted fluid loading has proven its prognostic value [1] and a fluid <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy</b> can result in hemodynamic aggravation and dysfunctions of associated organs, determining the mortality of patients with ARDS [2]. Subsequently, hemodynamic stabilization is generally associated with a resumption of diuresis and a decrease in body weight.

In this paper we propose a strategy for heuristically restricting the set of methods to be applied in proof search.

The paradox has been considered a problem for every theory assuming the Knowability Principle, according to which all truths are knowable and, in particular, for semantic anti-realist theories. A well-known criticism of the Knowability Paradox is the so-called <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy.</b> This bounds {{the scope of the}} universal quantification in (KP) to a set of formulae, whose logical form avoids the paradoxical conclusion.

Tennant distinguished Anti-Cartesian propositions in three kinds. In this paper, we will not be concerned with the soundness of the restriction proposal. Rather, we are interested in analyzing the proposed distinction. We argue that Tennant’s distinction is problematic because it is not grounded on an adequate, logical analysis, and because it is incomplete.

Methods Data on age-, sex- and method-specific suicide rates for 1971 - 1993 in Taiwan were obtained. Changes in solids/liquids poisoning suicide rates were compared with suicide rates by hanging and other methods between 1983 and 1993.

The phenomenon of method substitution was also not found by sex and age groups. Conclusion In general, no method substitution was found along with the reduction in solids/liquids suicide rates in Taiwan.

Results suggested that a feed restriction reduces the coefficient of variation of BWat first departure for slaughter (BW 1) by 34 %. Growth performance obtained from an in silico simulation using ad libitum and restricted feeding plans was compared with results obtained in an in vivo experiment on a batch of 168 pigs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{deterioration}} of track geometry depends on several factors {{of which the}} speed of the train is one. Imposing a speed restriction can slow down the track deterioration and allows a longer survival time before a serious condition is achieved. Preventive maintenance delays can be authorized during the survival time. However, speed restrictions also reduce the system throughput. On the other hand, a longer interval between preventive maintenance activities has a lower maintenance action cost and it also enables grouping the maintenance activities to save set-up costs as well as sys- tem downtime. If the repair delay is too long, it may cause unacceptable conditions on the track and lead to higher main- tenance costs and accidents. Therefore, it is interesting to assess the effect of a speed restriction on the delayed maintenance strategies for a railway track section. We want to solve a maintenance optimization problem to find the optimal tuning of the maintenance delay time and imposition of a speed restriction. To this aim, a delayed maintenance model is developed, in which track deterioration depends on the train speed and the number of passing trains. The model is used to determine an optimal speed <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy</b> and a preventive repair delay for the optimization of the system benefit and unavailability. Coloured Petri Nets are adopted to model the maintenance and operation of the railway track section. The Coloured Petri Net model describes the gradual track deterioration as a stochastic process.

Therefore, the time spent constructing those clauses is wasted. In this thesis we present a stalling strategy, called delayed clause-construction (DCC), that reduces this wasted time by delaying the construction of intermediate conclusions until they are needed. Top-down depth-first search algorithms have the disadvantage of deriving the same clauses over and over again. Bottom-up best-first search approaches solve this problem by redundancy elimination, but their disadvantages are the lack of goal-orientation and the large memory requirements. In this thesis we introduce semi-linear resolution (SLR), a top-down bottom-up search procedure that combines advantageous characteristics found in best-first search and depth-first search algorithms. It requires a modest amount of memory and includes redundancy control. SLR relies on DCC for speed. DCC also provides SLR with ability to perform large inference steps through the use of a mega-inference rule. In order to improve the efficiency of SLR, we developed a <b>restriction</b> <b>strategy,</b> called attribute sequences (ATS), that uses sequences of clause characteristics as a guide to limit the participation of clauses in a linear derivation, thereby reducing the explorable search space. ATS does not compromise completeness. The performance enhancements ensuing from the use of DCC and ATS in SLR are shown in this thesis to be quite significant in theory, through mathematical analysis, and in practice, through the results obtained from CARINE; an implementation of SLR...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{develop a}} game {{semantics}} for process algebra with two interacting agents. The {{purpose of our}} semantics is to make manifest the role of knowledge and information flow in the interactions between agents and to control the information available to interacting agents. We define games and strategies on process algebras, so that two agents interacting according to their strategies determine {{the execution of the}} process, replacing the traditional scheduler. We show that different <b>restrictions</b> on <b>strategies</b> represent different amounts of information being available to a scheduler. We also show that a certain class of strategies corresponds to the syntactic schedulers of Chatzikokolakis and Palamidessi, which were developed to overcome problems with traditional schedulers modelling interaction. The <b>restrictions</b> on these <b>strategies</b> have an explicit epistemic flavor...|$|R
30|$|Chloride, as {{the major}} anion of the {{extracellular}} fluid, constitutes {{an important element in}} the homeostasis of the human organism. Hyperchloraemia, whether a result of the sepsis process or a consequence of its treatment with supraphysiologic chloride fluids, appears to {{have a negative impact on}} the clinical outcome of septic patients. The detrimental effect of hyperchloraemic acidosis on the inflammatory response, on haemodynamics and also upon the homeostasis of organs or systems, demonstrated by studies in humans and some experimental models of sepsis, should keep clinicians alert. Close monitoring of chloride levels and acid–base homeostasis pertains to all levels of hospitalization, starting with the early resuscitation treatment in the emergency room. Balanced crystalloids appear to improve the sepsis outcome, when compared to saline. Large-scale randomized trials analysing more than one endpoint (mortality, haemodynamics, AKI, haemostatic disorders, other organ damage, length of ICU and hospital stay) are urgently needed in order to confirm the possible beneficial effect of chloride <b>restriction</b> <b>strategies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Trial-based cost-utility {{analyses}} require health-related {{quality of}} life data that generate utility values in order to express health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Assessments of baseline health-related {{quality of life}} are problematic where trial participants are incapacitated or critically ill {{at the time of}} randomisation. This review aims to identify and critique methods for handling non-availability of baseline health-related quality of life data in trial-based cost-utility analyses within emergency and critical illness settings. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines, to identify trial-based cost-utility analyses of interventions within emergency and critical care settings. Databases searched included the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Journals Library (1991 –July 2016), Cochrane Library (all years); National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (all years) and Ovid MEDLINE/Embase (without time <b>restriction).</b> <b>Strategies</b> employed to handle non-availability of baseline health-related quality of life data in final QALY estimations were identified and critiqued. Results: A total of 4224 published reports were screened, 19 of which met the study inclusion criteria (mean trial size 1670) : 14 (74...|$|R
