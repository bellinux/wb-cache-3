60|$|In the meanwhile, late as it was, Colonel Barrington and {{his chief}} lieutenant, Gordon Dane, {{sat in his}} log-walled smoking-room talking with a man he sold his wheat through in Winnipeg. The room was big and bare. There were a few fine heads of {{antelope}} upon the walls, and beneath them an armory of English-made shotguns and rifles, while a row of silver-mounted <b>riding</b> <b>crops,</b> and some handled with ivory, stood in a corner. All these represented amusement, while two or three treatises on veterinary surgery and agriculture, lying amidst English stud-books and racing records, presumably stood for industry. The comparison was significant, and Graham, the Winnipeg wheat-broker, noticed it as he listened patiently to the views of Colonel Barrington, who nevertheless worked hard enough in his own fashion. Unfortunately {{it was rather the}} fashion of the English gentleman than that common on the prairie.|$|E

5000|$|At the right, burly peasants carry a {{platform}} holding the icon inside an elaborate neo-classical case; only gleams of light reflecting off the gold riza icon-cover {{can be made}} out. Lines of peasants joining hands hold back the crowd, the foremost at the left {{trying to stop the}} crippled boy breaking through the cordon with his stick. Alongside ride peasant or priest stewards and officials and police in uniform, some of the latter beating back the crowd with their <b>riding</b> <b>crops.</b> Behind the icon follow priests and better-dressed people, carrying icons in front of their chest, and an [...] "effete, dandified and bored priest" [...] in vestments carefully straightens his hair. [...] There is a comic effect with a stout middle-aged woman in a yellow dress and bonnet carrying an icon behind him, who looks very like a priest in his vestments. An empty icon-case, presumably that of the icon carried by the wealthy woman behind, is carried with as much reverence as the icon itself. The hillside at right appears to have been recently cleared of timber, with fresh tree stumps. Further back another platform, holding {{what appears to be a}} circular icon, is preceded by two large banners, and behind that a large processional cross can be made out through the cloud of dust.|$|E
