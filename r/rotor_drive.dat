2500|$|The {{helicopters}} {{designed by}} Jean Cantinieau were distinguished by having an engine positioned {{in front and}} immediately below the main <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, above the cockpit. The first of the series was the Cantinieau C-100, which had an open tube frame structure with a braced single tube tail boom, four wheel undercarriage and a [...] Minié engine. It first flew in September 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a fan cooled [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the <b>rotor</b> <b>drive.</b> The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers. The control column alters cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and pedals make torque corrections and control yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors. A mechanical inertial governor limited rotor accelerations; the pilot could increase the collective pitch over that set by the governor but not below it, emergencies apart.|$|E
50|$|For takeoff, landing, and {{low-speed}} flight, {{the rotor}} {{was driven by}} air delivered by the superchargers and burnt with fuel in blade-tip mounted pressure-jets. This zero-torque <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> did not require a compensating anti-torque system, though the collective pitch of the wingtip-mounted propellers was controlled by the rudder pedals to provide yaw control. As airspeed was gained, the <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> system was shut down, allowing the rotor to autorotate while the propellers provided the necessary thrust. For low-speed flight and landing, the <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> system was restarted to provide hovering capability.|$|E

50|$|The Boeing X-50 Dragonfly had a two-bladed <b>rotor</b> <b>driven</b> by {{the engine}} for takeoff. In {{horizontal}} flight the rotor stopped {{to act like}} a wing.

5000|$|The A85 has a 4-speed {{hydrostatic}} <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train. The {{engine is}} a 763 cubic inch inline 6-cylinder turbocharged diesel. Production of the A85 has been from 2006 to the present.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> {{train in}} {{helicopters}} uses a freewheeling clutch to disengage the rotors {{from the engine}} {{in the event of}} engine failure, allowing the craft to safely descend by autorotation.|$|E
5000|$|For {{vertical}} take-off, hovering, low-speed flight, {{and vertical}} landing, the main <b>rotor</b> wing was <b>driven</b> by tip jets, by directing the exhaust from a jet engine through thrust nozzles in the rotor tips. Because the <b>rotor</b> is <b>driven</b> directly by jet thrust, {{there is no}} need for a tail rotor to control torque as in a conventional helicopter.|$|R
50|$|The B-5 was an {{improved}} and larger design {{based on the}} bureau's earlier G-4, a twin-rotor helicopter, with each <b>rotor</b> <b>driven</b> by an Ivchenko AI-26 radial engine. Each engine was housed in a pod on an outrigger with the related rotor above. The programme was delayed waiting for appropriate engines and the B-5 was not completed until 1947, it only made a few short hops before the programme was abandoned due to vibration and structural flexing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{numerical}} analysis and calculation of magnetic field {{is one of}} the key issues for designing the magnetic drive mechanisms. This paper discusses the method of finite element analysis of the magnetic field based on ANSYS software, analyzes and simulates the magnetic field in the axial magnetic drive mechanism of the latest textile twisting spindles by means of ANSYS, analyzes and calculates the magnetic induction intensity, magnetic field intensity distribution with the different thickness of the air gap between the <b>drive</b> <b>rotor</b> and <b>driven</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the different quantity of magnets. The analysis method and results can provide reference for the design of magnetic drive mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|The TSB {{issued an}} update on the {{investigation}} on 18 June 2009, indicating that the pilot may have been trying to perform a controlled landing {{at the time of the}} accident. The main blades were apparently rotating at the time of impact; however, the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> gears were severely damaged, which would result in a loss of thrust. An engine shutdown was initiated at an altitude of 500 ft, consistent with a tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> failure. The TSB was continuing to investigate the failure of the flotation system, which reportedly had been activated but did not operate correctly.|$|E
50|$|The Jet Gyrodyne was a {{modification}} of the second prototype FB-1 Gyrodyne aircraft registered G-AJJP. The Jet Gyrodyne was built specifically to develop the pressure-jet <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> system and operational procedures used on the later Rotodyne.|$|E

50|$|The aircraft's 6.84 m {{diameter}} three-bladed Starflex rotor has a chord of 15 cm and {{employs a}} unique torsion bar blade mounting that allows blade movement to produce pitch angle changes, flapping, {{as well as}} lead and lag. The main transmission consists of belt drives, with the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>driven</b> by a solid shaft. The aircraft has an empty weight of 380 kg and a gross weight of 650 kg, giving a useful load of 270 kg. With full fuel of 75 L the payload is 216 kg.|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of the electrorheological clutch is simulated by a nonlinear parabolic equation which describes the motion of electrorheological fluid in {{the gap between the}} driving and <b>driven</b> <b>rotors.</b> In this case, the velocity of the driving rotor is prescribed on one part of the boundary. Nonlocal nonlinear boundary condition is given on a part of the boundary, which corresponds to the <b>driven</b> <b>rotor.</b> A problem on optimal control of acceleration or braking of the <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> is formulated and studied. Functions of time of the angular velocity of the driving rotor and of the voltages are considered to be controls. In the case that the clutch acts as an accelerator, the energy consumed in the acceleration of the <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> is minimized under the restriction that at some instant, the angular velocity and the acceleration of the <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> are localized within given regions. In the case of braking, the energy production is maximized. The existence of a solution of optimal control problem is proved and necessary optimality conditions are established...|$|R

50|$|First, {{there is}} no tail rotor, and the main rotors are contra-rotating. Yaw is {{controlled}} by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> transmission. When one rotor is adjusted to spin slightly faster than the other, it induces yaw (turning motion).|$|E

25|$|The B-11 {{was similar}} to the design bureau's earlier B-5, a twin-rotor helicopter, with each <b>rotor</b> <b>driven</b> by an Ivchenko AI-26 radial engine. Each engine was housed in a pod on an {{outrigger}} with the related rotor above. Designed for a 1947 air force design competition for a general-purpose helicopter. Two prototypes were built and flown in June 1948, test flights showed a problem with rotor-blade stall at high speed and high resonant vibrations in the whole helicopter. In August 1948 the first prototype was grounded for investigation, but limited testing carried on with the second to find the causes of the problems.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{molecular}} motors have {{a number}} of unique advantages over artificial motors, including efficient conversion of chemical energy into mechanical work and the potential for self-assembly into larger structures, as is seen in muscle sarcomeres and bacterial and eukaryotic flagella. The development of an appropriate interface between such biological materials and synthetic devices should enable us to realize useful hybrid micromachines. Here we describe a microrotary motor composed of a 20 -μm-diameter silicon dioxide <b>rotor</b> <b>driven</b> on a silicon track by the gliding bacterium Mycoplasma mobile. This motor is fueled by glucose and inherits some of the properties normally attributed to living systems...|$|R
