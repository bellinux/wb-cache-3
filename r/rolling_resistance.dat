5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b> In <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance,</b> a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. <b>Rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> is {{also the}} reason at least one {{historical}} human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance,</b> are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E

30|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of copper (Cu) film under grinding process were accomplished by molecular dynamics simulation. A numerical calculation {{was carried out}} to understand the distributions of atomic and slip vector inside the Cu films. In this study, the roller rotation velocity, temperature, and roller rotation direction change are investigated to clarify their effect on the deformation mechanism. The simulation {{results showed that the}} destruction of materials was increased proportionally to the roller rotation velocity. The machining process at higher temperature results in larger kinetic energy of atoms than lower temperature during the grinding process of the Cu films. The result also shows that the roller rotation in the counterclockwise direction had the better stability than the roller rotation in the clockwise direction due to significantly increased backfill atoms in the groove of the Cu film surface. Additionally, the effects of the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistances</b> on the Cu film surfaces during the grinding process are studied by the molecular dynamics simulation method.|$|R

40|$|Revue IRBM : [URL] audienceThe {{object of}} this study was to compute the {{mechanical}} power of the resultant braking force during an actual propulsion cycle with a manual wheelchair on the field. The resultant braking force was calculated from a mechanical model taking into account the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistances</b> of the front and rear wheels. Both the resultant braking force and the wheelchair velocity were not constant during the propulsion cycle and varied according to the subject's fore-and-aft and vertical movements in the wheelchair. These variations had logical repercussions on the braking force mechanical power, which ranged from 20. 6 to 34. 5 W (mean = 29. 6 W) during the propulsion cycle. The mechanical power was also calculated from the conditions of a classical drag-test, by the product of the cycle mean velocity and a constant braking force corresponding to a 60 % rear wheels distribution of the subject-and- wheelchair's weight. This second mechanical power (32. 4 W) was 10 % higher than the average of the instantaneous power. Beyond the need of a clear definition of the two phases of the propulsion cycle, this study showed that the assumption on wheelchair locomotion usually admitted on laboratory ergometers cannot be applied in field studies, and that the kinetic energy variations during the cycle propulsive phase should be considered for evaluating the subject's mechanical work and power...|$|R

The <b>rolling</b> mechanical <b>resistance</b> increases linearly {{with the increase of}} this speed and weight of the HS train. Some experiments carried out for Shinkansen Series 100 HS trains estimated the total resistance depending on the cruising/operating speed as follows: R(V) =  8.202  +  0.10656  V +  0.00116232  V [...] 2 [...] (R(V) in kN and v in m/s) [40, 48].

Findings also indicated considerable implicit use of MI by participants, including taking an athlete-centred approach, supporting athlete autonomy, reflective listening, demonstrating accurate empathy, and taking a non-prescriptive, guiding role.

Steels used for high performing bearing applications are high alloy steels, heat treated in order to obtain a martensitic structure which supplies high hardness which is needed in order to obtain a high <b>rolling</b> fatigue <b>resistance.</b> The title of this master thesis is mechanical characterization of bearing steels because the work included several different methods of characterizing for steels meant for real life bearing applications. The work was divided into two different main tasks:The first task about microyield will not be presented at all in this report due to confidentiality reasons. In the second task are different heat treatments analyzed for a bearing steel because after the heat treatment is retained austenite present in the alloy. This can both be an advantage such as life improvement or a drawback such as dimensional instability. Depending on the wanted application for the bearing in order to properly size the bearings, it is necessary to know what the material contains in its design phase. Heat treatments in terms of retained austenite now days are engineered and analyzed due to today’s more demanding conditions for bearing applications.

25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b> Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area.

This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by <b>rolling</b> friction (air <b>resistance</b> is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|R
