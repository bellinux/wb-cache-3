The objectives of the inversion are {{the elements of the}} moment tensor and the source-time history. An optimum source depth of 3 km is determined, but because of source complexity the point source assumption fails and the moment tensor obtained at that depth has a large nondouble-couple term, compensated linear vector dipole = 34 per cent. The source {{parameters of}} the major double-couple are: strike = 341 °; dip = 37 °; rake = 61 °; and seismic moment = 8. 2 x 10 =s dyne-cm. The source-time function is of approximately 4 sec duration, with a long rise time and a sharp fall-off. The fault length is constrained on the surface by the observed surface break, and results from vertical displacement modeling suggest a width of approximately 10 km in the middle, assuming a dip of 37 °. That restricts the entire faulted area to lie above 6 km depth. Two finite fault models for the earthquake are presented, with <b>rupture</b> <b>initiating</b> at a <b>point</b> (1) {{near the top of the}} fault and (2) at the bottom of the fault. Both models produce similar long-period synthetics, but based on the short-period waveforms, model 1 is favored.

We then make tsunami simulation of nonlinear long wave theory for the worst case scenario, to examine the amplification of tsunami heights relative to the simultaneous rupture on the coasts from Sagami Bay through Kyushu.|$|R
30|$|Descriptions of {{individual}} fault segments are also important: Although the Coulomb stress on faults is released by earthquakes, the stress at segment boundaries increases both interseismically and coseismically, and fault <b>ruptures</b> tend to <b>initiate</b> there (Nakano et al. 2010). Detailed investigations of coseismic rupture during the 1999 İzmit earthquake revealed that <b>rupture</b> <b>initiated</b> at {{the boundary between}} the Sapanca and Gölcük segments of the NAF (Yagi and Kikuchi 2000; Delouis et al. 2002; Sekiguchi and Iwata 2002). It then propagated along both fault segments, resulting in a single large event. The epicenters of historical ruptures along the NAF are also located mainly at segment boundaries (Dewey 1976; Barka 1996). Initiation of earthquake ruptures at segment boundaries is also supported by numerical simulations (e.g., Duan and Oglesby 2006; Nakano et al. 2010). Therefore, the development of scenarios of future disastrous earthquakes requires detailed descriptions of fault segment boundaries along the NAF.|$|R

30|$|In {{scenario}} SC 01 (Mw 8.56), the rupture area {{included the}} Hyuga-nada {{area and the}} region off Shikoku Island, and rupture started at {{the western edge of}} the Nankai area. Despite the high slip-deficit rate observed in this region, the amount of slip was lower than other models. This is because a large slip-weakening distance was assumed in Hok et al. (2011) to simulate slow slip in the Hyuga-nada segment. A large slip-weakening distance makes it difficult for coseismic slip to occur during dynamic simulations following the slip-weakening friction law. SC 02 had the smallest moment magnitude (Mw 8.5) among the four models, whereas the maximum slip was much larger than for SC 01. The <b>rupture</b> <b>initiated</b> at the tip of the Kii Peninsula, which is the same hypocenter as that of the 1946 Nankai earthquake. SC 03 (Mw 8.61) ruptured the entire Nankai-Tonankai area as a single event with the <b>rupture</b> <b>initiating</b> at {{the western edge of the}} Nankai segment. However, in this model the rupture did not propagate to the Tokai area, which is commonly thought to be the initial rupture point of the Hoei earthquake. Hok et al. (2011) reported that they did not include the Tokai area in their study, but they considered the eastern edge of the Tonankai region as one of the initial points in their dynamic simulation. In SC 04 (Mw 8.65), the rupture started from Ise Bay and propagated to the western side of the Nankai region. The dimensions of the rupture area were similar to those of SC 03, but the initial rupture started at Ise Bay. In terms of the estimated rupture area and moment magnitude, we believe SC 04 is the closest model to an anticipated Hoei earthquake among the four scenarios.|$|R

Other studies of the same event, however, reported a bilateral rupture (Delouis et al. 2002; Sekiguchi and Iwata 2002). If the model of two unilateral ruptures is applicable to other recent earthquakes along the NAF, it would imply that the stress level along the faults had been high and close to their shear strength. Detailed investigation of the state of stress in this region is therefore a matter of great urgency, and earthquake rupture simulation scenarios for future disastrous events (e.g., Hori et al. 2015) should include a model that can reproduce two unilateral <b>ruptures</b> <b>initiating</b> at a segment boundary.|$|R

We also used body waveform modelling inversion to confirm the focal mechanism of the mainshock as a pure thrust mechanism and rule out the existence of considerable strike slip component in the motion. The mainshock occurred along a shallow (depth 7 km), low angle (14 °) thrust fault, parallel to the coastline and dipping to the NE. Our preferred slip distribution model for the mainshock indicates that <b>rupture</b> <b>initiated</b> from SE and propagated towards NW, with a speed of 2. 0 km/s. Moment was released in a main slip patch, confined {{in an area of}} L ∼ 50 km × W ∼ 23 km. The maximum slip (∼ 2. 7 m) occurred ∼ 30 km to the NW of the hypocenter (location of rupture initiation). The average slip is 49 cm and the total moment release over the fault is 4. 38 e 19 Nm. The slip model adequately fits the distribution of the Mw ≥ 4. 3 aftershocks, as most of them are located in the regions of the fault plane that did not slip during the mainshock. The 24 May 1979 (Mw 6. 2) strongest aftershock occurred ∼ 40 km NW of the mainshock. Our preferred slip model for this event showed a characteristic two-lobe pattern, where each lobe is ∼ 7. 5 × 7. 5 km 2. <b>Rupture</b> <b>initiated</b> in the NW lobe, where the slip obtained its maximum value of 45 cm, very close to the hypocenter, and propagated towards the south-eastern lobe where it reached another maximum value — for this lobe — of 30 cm, approximately 10 km away from the hypocenter. To indirectly validate our slip models we produced synthetic PGV maps (Shake maps) and we compared our predictions with observations of ground shaking from strong motion records. All comparisons were made for rock soil conditions and in general our slip models adequately fit the observations especially at the closest stations where the shaking was considerably stronger.
