5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began squandering in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation among this crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that they <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won and kept his fortune, but reportedly still failed to pay the £10,000.|$|E
25|$|Once in control, a {{contestant}} {{could either}} <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> himself/herself or pass {{them to the}} opponent. After rolling, the contestant had to remove one or more digits from the board that added up to the total on the dice. For example, if a 10 was rolled, the contestant could remove any available combination that added up to that number: 1-9, 2–8, 3–7, 4–6, 1–2–7, 1–3–6, 1–4–5, 2–3–5, or 1–2–3–4, providing {{that none of the}} digits within the combination had already been removed. Contestants banked prizes by removing individual numbers or combinations of them, depending on the rules.|$|E
500|$|When {{they are}} ready, players <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> in turn, {{the one who}} rolls highest {{becoming}} the [...] "Chosen One" [...] who assembles the game board by connecting the Provinces to the central hub, creating a hexagon shape. The players write down their greatest fear on {{a slip of paper}} which is placed in the [...] "well of fears" [...] by the Chosen One. The Gatekeeper then starts the game, and the players, using their Numb Skulls, race to become a Harbinger by landing on the Harbinger's headstone located in each province. If a player fails to make it to a headstone within ten minutes, they become Soul Rangers {{for the rest of the}} game. They must remain in the sewers until either they are released by the Gatekeeper, or collect the Keystone which allows them to release themselves.|$|E
50|$|The game {{requires}} six pieces dice {{and wide}} mouthed bowl. The first player is assigned and <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice.</b> <b>The</b> player will be then awarded a specific prize depending on <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> combination. <b>The</b> <b>dice</b> is then {{passed to the}} next person who <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> again. <b>The</b> process is repeated until there are no prizes left. The results are declared invalid if {{at least one of}} <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> lands outside <b>the</b> bowl.|$|R

500|$|Shortly after Leslie {{successfully}} relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, {{she struggles}} {{to find any}} new ideas for future parks project.

She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice,</b> its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E

50|$|The lead {{player can}} <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> {{up to three}} times, {{and the amount of}} rolls he or she takes will {{determine}} how many rolls subsequent players may take in that round.
