50|$|The {{radioactive}} decay of {{elements in the}} Earth's mantle and crust results in production of daughter isotopes and release of particles and heat energy, or <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat.</b> Four radioactive isotopes {{are responsible for the}} majority of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat,</b> uranium-238 (238U), uranium-235 (235U), thorium-232 (232Th), and potassium-40 (40K). Due to a lack of rock samples from below 200 km depth, {{it is not possible to}} do a simple <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> estimate of known radioactive isotope concentrations in rock throughout the whole mantle. For the Earth's core, geochemical studies indicate that it unlikely to be a significant source of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> due to an expected low concentration of radioactive elements. <b>Radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> production in the mantle is linked to the structure of mantle convection, a topic of much debate, and it is thought that the mantle may either have a layered structure with a higher concentration of radioactive heat-producing elements in the lower mantle, or small reservoirs enriched in radioactive elements dispersed throughout the whole mantle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of the energy balance and thermal evolution of the Earth. It contributes to mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanoes, and mountain building. Geo-neutrino observations estimate the present radiogenic power of our planet. This estimate depends on the quantity and distribution of heat-producing elements in various Earth reservoirs. Of particular geological importance is <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in the mantle. This quantity informs the origin and thermal evolution of our planet. Here we present: currently reported geo-neutrino observations; estimates of the mantle geo-neutrino signal, mantle <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating,</b> and mantle cooling; a comparison of chemical Earth model predictions of the mantle geo-neutrino signal and mantle radiogenic heating; a brief discussion of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in the core, including calculations of geo-neutrino signals per pW/kg; and finally a discussion of observational strategy.

40|$|Chemical and {{physical}} Earth models agree little {{as to the}} radioactive power of the planet. Each predicts a range of radioactive powers, overlapping slightly with the other at about 24 TW, and together spanning 14 - 46 TW. Approximately 20 % of this radioactive power (3 - 8 TW) escapes to space {{in the form of}} geo-neutrinos. The remaining 11 - 38 TW heats the planet with significant geo-dynamical consequences, appearing as the radiogenic component of the 43 - 49 TW surface heat flow. The non-radiogenic component of the surface heat flow (5 - 38 TW) is presumably primordial, a legacy of the formation and early evolution of the planet. A constraining measurement of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> provides insights to the thermal history of the Earth and potentially discriminates chemical {{and physical}} Earth models. <b>Radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in the planet primarily springs from unstable nuclides of uranium, thorium, and potassium. The paths to their stable daughter nuclides include nuclear beta decays, producing geo-neutrinos. Large sub-surface detectors efficiently record the energy but not the direction of the infrequent interactions of the highest energy geo-neutrinos, originating only from uranium and thorium. The measured energy spectrum of the interactions estimates the relative amounts of these heat-producing elements, while the intensity estimates planetary radiogenic power. Recent geo-neutrino observations in Japan and Italy find consistent values of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating.</b> The combined result mildly excludes the lowest model values of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> and, assuming whole mantle convection, identifies primordial heat loss. Future observations have the potential to measure <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> with better precision, further constraining geological models and the thermal evolution of the Earth.

50|$|The {{geothermal}} gradient is steeper in the lithosphere {{than in the}} mantle because (a) crustal minerals have lower thermal conductivity than mantle minerals, (b) the crust produces more <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> than the mantle and (c) the crust contains numerous fractures.|$|E
5|$|The {{significantly}} higher density of Enceladus relative to Mimas (1.61 vs. 1.15 g/cm3), implying a larger content {{of rock and}} more <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in its early history, has also been cited as {{an important factor in}} resolving the Mimas paradox.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "hot start" [...] {{model of}} heating {{suggests}} Enceladus began as ice and rock that contained rapidly decaying short-lived radioactive isotopes of aluminium, iron and manganese. Enormous amounts of heat were then produced as these isotopes decayed for about 7 million years, {{resulting in the}} consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. Although the heat from radioactivity would decrease over time, the combination of radioactivity and tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug could prevent the subsurface ocean from freezing. The present-day <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> rate is 3.2 ergs/s (or 0.32 gigawatts), assuming Enceladus has a composition of ice, iron and silicate materials. Heating from long-lived radioactive isotopes uranium-238, uranium-235, thorium-232 and potassium-40 inside Enceladus would add 0.3 gigawatts to the observed heat flux. The presence of Enceladus's regionally thick subsurface ocean suggests a heat flux ~10 times higher than that from <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in the silicate core.|$|R
40|$|Crustal {{thickness}} variations induce {{lateral pressure}} gradients which can drive {{flow in the}} lower crust if temperatures there are sufficiently high. The absence of large scale crustal relaxation at the Argyre impact basin therefore constrains the temperatures {{at the base of}} the crust and we have computed thermal evolution models to study the influence of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> and hydrothermal crustal cooling on lower crustal temperatures. In the presence and absence of hydrothermal crustal cooling and for an average crustal thickness of 45 km, <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> after core formation cannot have exceeded 58 and 43 pW kg − 1, respectively. Furthermore, if the average crustal thickness is closer to 50 km, heating cannot have exceeded 49 and 36 pW kg − 1. A better knowledge of the planet's average crustal thickness, which may be obtained from seismological experiments, could help to further constrain the planets bulk composition and even rule out some of the compositional models for Mars that have been proposed so far...|$|R

50|$|In April 2011, {{scientists}} from the University of Arizona discovered evidence {{for the presence of}} liquid water. They have found iron and copper sulfide minerals that must have formed in the presence of water. The discovery is in conflict with the existing paradigm that comets never get warm enough to melt their icy bulk. Either collisions or <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> might have provided the necessary energy source.|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} viable sources for {{powering}} dynamos. The first is heat from cooling {{of the core}} or a thermal dynamo. This may be accretion heat (essentially released gravitational potential energy) or <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> of the core itself. Most radiogenic elements with long lifetimes (U, Th, K) are lithophile (McDonough and Sun 1995) and do not significantly concentrate themselves in the core. Thus radioactivity is probably not {{a significant factor in}} powering thermal dynamos.|$|R
50|$|The {{radioactive}} decay of 40K in the Earth's mantle ranks third, after 232Th and 238U, {{as the source}} of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat.</b> The core also likely contains radiogenic sources, although how much is uncertain. It has been proposed that significant core radioactivity (1-2 TW) may be caused by high levels of U, Th, and K.|$|E
50|$|While {{the total}} {{internal}} Earth heat {{flow to the}} surface is well constrained, the relative contribution of the two main sources of Earth's heat, radiogenic and primordial heat, are highly uncertain because their direct measurement is difficult. Chemical and physical models give estimated ranges of 15-41 TW and 12-30 TW for <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> and primordial heat, respectively, and recent results indicate their contributions may be roughly equal.|$|E
50|$|Primordial heat is {{the heat}} lost by the Earth as it {{continues}} to cool from its original formation, and this {{is in contrast to}} its still actively-produced <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat.</b> The Earth core's heat flow—heat leaving the core and flowing into the overlying mantle—is thought to be due to primordial heat, and is estimated at 5-15 TW. Estimates of mantle primordial heat loss range between 7 and 15 TW.|$|E
40|$|Thermal history models which assume {{formation}} as homogeneous ice-silicate mixtures {{are constructed}} for the small, icy Saturnian satellites Mimas, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus, including {{the effects of}} <b>radiogenic</b> and accretional <b>heating,</b> conductive and subsolidus convective heat transfer, and lithosphgeric growth. Accretional heating {{is not likely to}} have melted the water ice in the interiors of these bodies, and solid state creep of the ice-dominated material precludes melting by <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating.</b> The four largest satellites are sufficiently large and rich in heat-producing silicates to possess a solid state convection system beneath a rigid lithosphere, irrespective of initial conditions. The model thermal histories are qualitatively consistent with the present appearances of these satellites...|$|R
40|$|Crustal {{thickness}} variations induce {{lateral pressure}} gradients which can drive {{flow in the}} lower crust if the temperatures there are sufficiently high. Gravity and topography data imply that {{the thickness of the}} Martian crust is not constant and that large lateral thickness variations are associated with ancient structures such as the Hellas impact basin. The abundance of radioactive isotopes in the Martian interior has a significant influence on the thermal structure of the crust and their concentration can therefore be constrained from the bounds on lower crustal temperatures placed by topographic relaxation considerations. We have used parametrized thermal evolution models which include contributions from secular cooling to determine the thermal structure of the crust underneath Hellas. We have calculated relaxation times for isostatically supported topography and the influence of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> and hydrothermal crustal cooling on lower crustal temperatures have been investigated. Our results indicate that hydrothermal cooling of the crust is not necessary to explain the absence of lower crustal flow. Even a brecciated upper crust would be sufficiently conductive if the pore spaces were filled with ice or water. If global scale hydrothermal cooling did occur, <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> after core formation could have been larger than 60 pW kg - 1 without initiating lower crustal flow, but the question of the presence and/or extent of hydrothermal crustal cooling remains unresolved. If no additional crustal cooling occurred, the absence of lower crustal flow at the Hellas impact basin implies that <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> after core formation cannot have exceeded 45 pW kg - 1 and that a thin crust or low initial temperatures are required if heating exceeded 30 pW kg - 1, which corresponds to the chondritic heat production rate. In this case, compositional models for Mars with greater than chondritic abundances of K, U, and Th, e. g., the model by Lodders and Fegley (1997), are difficult to reconcile with the observations...|$|R

In {{the proposed}} model, both high- and low-Ti mare basalts {{are produced by}} partial melting and hybridization at depth accompanied by equilibrium between the hybrid liquids and the local olivine-pyroxenite residuum. The energy source for mare basalt formation is ultimately provided by <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in the primordial lunar interior. The proposed dynamic model explains similarities in the Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios and Cr 2 O 3 contents of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts and avoids thermal problems inherent in previous models...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for Earth warming by <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> {{is not the}} direct heating (which contribute less than 0.1% to the total heat input even of early Earth) but rather {{the establishment of the}} high geothermal gradient of the crust, resulting in greater out-gassing rate and therefore the higher concentration of greenhouse gases in early Earth atmosphere. Additionally, a hotter deep crust would limit the water absorption by crustal minerals, resulting in a smaller amount of high-albedo land protruding from the early oceans, causing more solar energy to be absorbed.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{additional}} constraints {{have been}} recently proposed. Numerical simulations {{of the material}} properties of high pressure-temperature iron [...] claim an upper limit of 105 W/m/K to the thermal conductivity. This downward revision to the conductivity partially alleviates {{the issues of the}} New Core Paradox by lowering the adiabatic core heat flow required to keep the core thermally convective. Also, recent geochemical experiments [...] have led to the proposal that <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat</b> in the core is larger than previously thought. This revision, if true, would also alleviate issues with the core heat budget by providing an additional energy source back in time.|$|E
50|$|The total geoneutrino flux {{is the sum}} of {{contributions}} from all antineutrino-producing radionuclides. The geological inputs—the density and particularly the elemental abundances—carry a large uncertainty. The uncertainty of the remaining nuclear and particle physics parameters is negligible compared to the geological inputs. At present it is presumed that uranium-238 and thorium-232 each produce about the same amount of heat in the earth's mantle, and these are presently the main contributors to <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heat.</b> However, neutrino flux does not perfectly track heat from radioactive decay of primordial nuclides, because neutrinos do not carry off a constant fraction of the energy from the radiogenic decay chains of these primordial radionuclides.|$|E

40|$|The Bohemian Massif was {{consolidated}} {{during the}} Variscan orogeny (~ 400 - 300 Ma), which involved several oceanic subductions and collisions of continental micro-plates. The {{central part of}} the Bohemian Massif, the Moldanubian domain, shows a large accumulation of felsic high-pressure metamorphs. We present a numerical model of exhumation of these rocks due to continental collision and underthrusting. The key feature of the model is a felsic (light, rheologically weak and rich in radioactive elements) material in the lower crust of one of the colliding blocks. We examine the influence of the rate of convergence of the two blocks, <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> in the felsic lower crust and efficiency of erosion, on the model evolution and pressure-temperature conditions in the lower-crustal material. The models where the material is sufficiently weakened due to <b>radiogenic</b> <b>heating</b> show formation of an orogenic plateau, sedimentation in a foreland basin, and crustal thickening accompanied by gravity-driven exhumation of the lower crust and subsequent sub-horizontal flow in the middle crust. In colder and/or faster models, the thickening is dominated by folding.
