50|$|Uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) is {{an enzyme}} {{utilized}} {{in a powerful}} method to eliminate carryover PCR products in Real-Time PCR. This method modifies PCR products such that in a new reaction, any <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> from previous PCR amplifications will be digested and prevented from amplifying, but the true DNA templates will be unaffected. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) synthesizes abundant amplification products. Contamination of new PCRs with trace amounts of these products, called carry-over contamination, yields false positive results. Carry-over contamination from some previous PCR can be a significant problem, due both to the abundance of PCR products, and to the ideal structure of the contaminant material for re-amplification. However carry-over contamination can be controlled by the following two steps: (i) incorporating dUTP in all PCR products (by substituting dUTP for dTTP, or by incorporating uracil during synthesis of primers; and (ii) treating all subsequent fully preassembled starting reactions with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), followed by thermal inactivation of UDG. UDG cleaves the uracil base from the phosphodiester backbone of uracil-containing DNA, but {{has no effect on}} natural (i.e., thymine-containing) DNA. The resulting apyrimidinic sites block replication by DNA polymerases, and are very labile to acid/base hydrolysis. Because UDG does not react with dUTP, and is also inactivated by heat denaturation prior to the actual PCR, carry-over contamination of PCRs can be controlled effectively if the contaminants contain uracils in place of thymines.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{seroprevalence}} {{of hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) among high-risk groups overseas is high, but studies in {{these groups are}} rare in South Korea. We conducted the present study from April to November 2012 to obtain data on the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for HEV among slaughterhouse workers in South Korea. Methods: Slaughterhouse workers from 80 workplaces nationwide were surveyed in South Korea in 2012. The subjects comprised 1848 cases: 1434 slaughter workers and 414 <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handlers. By visiting 80 slaughterhouses, which were mixed with 75 of which also performed <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handling, we conducted a questionnaire survey for risk factors and obtained blood samples {{in order to determine}} the seropositivity and seroprevalence of HEV. Anti-HEV IgG and IgM were measured using HEV IgG and IgM en-zyme-linked immunospecific assay kits and HEV antigen was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The seropositivity of anti-HEV IgG was 33. 5 % (slaughter workers 32. 8 % and <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handlers 36. 2 %), and among the seropositive individuals the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgM was 0. 5 % (slaughter workers 0. 5 %, <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handlers 0. 7 %). The response rate of HEV-antigen as measured by RT-PCR was 0. 2 %. Risk factors significantly related to anti-HEV IgG seropositivity were age, sex, and working duration (slaughter workers only). Conclusions: There were significant risk factors (sex, age, and working duration) for HEV identified in our study. All three positive cas-es for HEV-antigen by RT-PCR were related to pig slaughter but without statistical significance. To prevent HEV, an educational pro...|$|E

Gasification of pure sewage sludge with a high Fe and Al content practically eliminated its P fertilizer value, while co-gasification of sludge lower in Fe and Al together with wheat straw resulted in a biochar product with only somewhat reduced P availability and improved P/K ratio for fertilization purposes.
