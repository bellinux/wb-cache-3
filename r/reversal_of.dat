5|$|Generally, {{exposure}} to ambient Mn air concentrations {{in excess of}} 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage.|$|E

5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs.

5|$|As {{it became}} clear that there was to be no <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive {{international}} recognition.

50|$|But {{the last}} word {{had not yet been}} spoken, and during the 1920s there was a series <b>of</b> <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> policy and <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>reversals.</b> In 1920 the War Department {{reversed}} the 1896 policy, issuing a ruling that forbade existing regiments from claiming credit for campaigns earned by earlier units on the basis numerical designation and denying any historical linkage between units based upon numerical designation. Needless to say, this announcement caused great anguish among the soldiers in the regiments. The official edict is reproduced below in full.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} {{techniques}} of nonlinear dynamics to compare a special {{model for the}} <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's magnetic field with the observational data. Although this model is rather simple, there is no essential difference to the data by means of well-known characteristics, such as correlation function and probability distribution.

These significant differences are expressed by algorithmic complexity and Renyi information. Keywords: <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> Earth's magnetic field, nonlinear models, symbolic dynamics, data analysis 1 Introduction The series <b>of</b> <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's magnetic field has often been discussed as an outstanding example of complex processes.

The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E
5|$|Central to the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the Ninth Circuit was {{the fact}} that the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and {{experience}} with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E

Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the blocks of ashlar in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} review of the {{different}} models that have been proposed to explain <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic field generated by a turbulent flow of an electrically conducting fluid (fluid dynamos). We then describe a simple mechanism that explains several features observed in palaeomagnetic records of the Earth’s magnetic field, in numerical simulations and in a recent dynamo experiment. A similar model {{can also be used to}} understand <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> large-scale flows that often develop on a turbulent background...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe discuss {{when two}} tournaments defined {{on the same}} set of n {{vertices}} are equivalent under a sequence <b>of</b> arc <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> directed paths or cycles of a fixed length. The results are complete except for directed cycles of length n or n- 1 in which case we obtain a general sufficient condition. In particular, any two regular tournaments on the same set with at least 21 vertices are equivalent under a sequence <b>of</b> <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> directed Hamiltonian cycles...|$|R
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> {{warfarin}} such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{mechanism}} for oscillatory or random <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> {{the magnetic field}} that occur from a stationary dynamo state. The basic ingredient is the existence of two nearly critical dynamo eigenmodes, a stable and an unstable one, that collide during a saddle-node bifurcation. Above this bifurcation, a finite amplitude limit cycle is generated. In the neighbourhood of the bifurcation, even {{a small amount of}} turbulent fluctuations is enough to generate random <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic field. When the two competing eigenmodes have different symmetries, this scenario requires a broken symmetry of the flow that generates the dynamo. This is in good agreement with the observations of the VKS experiment. It can also explain the dynamics of planetary or stellar magnetic fields and can be used to understand <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> large scale flows that often develop on a turbulent background...|$|R
