40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} {{to check for}} consistency between the IMF''s standard country surveillance tool, namely medium-term projections of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> (including the real, fiscal, external, and monetary sectors), and the financial sector. Consistency here entails that the financial sector remain solvent in the medium term under the assumptions of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> and that the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> is fine-tuned should threats to financial sector solvency arise {{as a result of}} assumptions underlying the medium-term <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> projections. The proposed framework {{can also be used to}} conduct sensitivity analysis of the aggregated financial sector to various types of risks, including foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit risk. For surveillance purposes, this framework can easily be integrated into one of the standard sectoral files so that any update to the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> automatically feeds into the financial sector medium-term projections. We anticipate the proposed framework to be of interest to IMF economists as well as outside analysts.

40|$|A chapter {{report issued}} by the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The effectiveness and appropriateness of the International Monetary Fund's lending programs to poor countries have been widely debated, generally centering on whether the program has improved these countries' economies. In response {{to some of these}} concerns and as part of a concerted international effort to reduce poverty, the Fund expanded the goals of its lending program to its poorest members in 1999 to include an explicit focus on poverty reduction. To underscore this focus, the Fund renamed its concessional lending program the Poverty Reduction and Frowth Facility. GAO found that although the design of the facility does not differ significantly from the Fund's previous program, some elements of the new program are emphasized more now than in the past. The one major design change [...] getting countries to take ownership of their <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> [...] is difficult to achieve for three reasons. First, many recipient governments have limited capacity to independently analyze and effectively negotiate the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework,</b> which reduces the opportunity for country-specific elements to be addressed. Second, it is difficult to effectively engage nongovernmental organizations in a dialogue on these very complex matters. Finally, a national dialogue on the choice of effective policies is hampered by the limited knowledge of all parties about how different policies actually effect elements of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework.</b> GAO found few changes in the Fund programs of the three countries reviewed that can be clearly attributed to the changes announced in 1999. Nonetheless, the three countries faced several difficulties in developing a nationally owned <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework.</b> First, each government has limited capacity to independently analyze macroeconomic issues. Second, while all three governments have begun a dialogue with nongovernmental organizations, many people that GAO spoke with were unsure how to use this dialogue to address the countries' complex macroeconomic policies and targets, other than the composition and level of spending. Finally, GAO did not see evidence of the changes in the three countries' Fund documents that were called for under the new program. If the changes announced by the Fund actually improve the overall effectiveness of a country's development program, the likelihood of earlier graduation from the Fund's program could increase. However, the impact of these changes on economic growth is unknown at this time. ...|$|R

40|$|Macroeconomic {{policy should}} be evaluated, he says, and devised {{according}} to sustainability criteria alongside economic and social criteria. Economic goals whether growth of GDP productivity or competitiveness, should not trump equity/justice or sustainability. But nor should environmental goals trump social goals. The urgent challenge addressed in this PRIME e-publication {{is to develop a}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> that supports ‘eco-social’ policies to pursue both goals simultaneously. Just and sustainable macroeconomic planning should take into account two policy dimensions: the emissions intensity of different items of consumption, and the necessitousness of these items. Ways of measuring both of these are proposed. When personal consumption in the UK is analysed in this way, an awkward policy dilemma immediately appears: almost all necessities are high carbon, while most ‘luxuries’ emit lower than average GHGs. Transport is also high carbon and comprises both necessary spending given current infrastructure and luxury spending. Thus a radical <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> needs to endorse and devise new ‘eco-social’ policies to serve both justice and sustainability goals, alongside income redistribution and public social consumption. Three approaches are suggested: taxing high-carbon luxury consumption, variable pricing of high-carbon necessities, and rationing carbon...|$|R
