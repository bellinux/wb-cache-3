25|$|Bismarck {{spent his}} final years {{composing}} his memoirs (Gedanken und Erinnerungen, or Thoughts and Memories), a work lauded by historians. In the memoirs Bismarck continued his feud with Wilhelm II by attacking him here, and {{by increasing the}} drama around every event and by often presenting himself in a favorable light. He also published {{the text of the}} <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> with Russia, a major breach of national security, for which an individual of lesser status would have been heavily prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck had {{especially}} {{worked to}} hold Russia at Germany's side {{in an effort}} to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor (Kaiser), Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, Bismarck {{formed a}} Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, {{with the aim}} of mutual {{military}} assistance {{in the case of an}} attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the Dual Alliance to form a Triple Alliance. Italy wanted to defend its interests in North Africa against France's colonial policy. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French military attack.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} reinsurance or risk sharing from a macroeconomic point of view. Our {{aim is to}} find socially optimal <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> In our setting we assume that there are $n$ insurance companies each bearing a certain risk and one representative reinsurer. The optimization problem is to minimize {{the sum of all}} capital requirements of the insurers where we assume that all insurance companies use a form of Range-Value-at-Risk. We show that in case all insurers use Value-at-Risk and the reinsurer's premium principle satisfies monotonicity, then layer <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> are socially optimal. For this result we do not need any dependence structure between the risks. In the general setting with Range-Value-at-Risk we obtain again the optimality of layer <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> under further assumptions, in particular under the assumption that the individual risks are positively dependent through the stochastic ordering. At the end, we discuss the difference between socially optimal <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> and individually optimal ones by looking at a number of special cases...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> {{can either}} be written on a [...] "{{continuous}}" [...] or [...] "term" [...] basis. A continuous contract has no predetermined end date, but generally either party can give 90 days notice to cancel or amend the treaty. A term agreement has a built-in expiration date. It is common for insurers and reinsurers to have long term relationships that span many years. <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> are typically longer documents than facultative certificates, containing many of their own terms that are distinct from {{the terms of the}} direct insurance policies that they reinsure. However, even most <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> are relatively short documents considering the number and variety of risks and lines of business that the treaties reinsure and the dollars involved in the transactions. There are not [...] "standard" [...] reinsurance contracts. However, many reinsurance contracts do include some commonly used provisions and provisions imbued with considerable industry common and practice.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "elaborate {{alliance}} systems" [...] among European powers, [...] "each {{secured by}} {{a network of}} secret treaties, financial arrangements, and 'military understandings'" [...] are commonly cited {{as one of the}} causes of World War I. For example, the <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> of June 1887 between the German Empire and the Russian Empire (negotiated by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in order for Germany to avoid a two-front war), was a [...] "highly secret treaty" [...] in which the two powers pledged a three-year period to remain neutral should the other become involved in a war with a third country, unless Germany attacked Russia's longstanding ally France or Russia attacked Germany's longstanding ally Austria-Hungary.|$|E
2500|$|The League of the Three Emperors having fallen apart, Bismarck {{negotiated}} the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary, {{in which each}} guaranteed the other against Russian attack. He also {{negotiated the}} Triple Alliance in 1882 with Austria-Hungary and Italy, and Italy and Austria-Hungary soon reached the [...] "Mediterranean Agreement" [...] with Britain. Attempts to reconcile Germany and Russia {{did not have a}} lasting effect: the Three Emperors' League was re-established in 1881 but quickly fell apart, ending Russian-Austrian-Prussian solidarity, which had existed in various forms since 1813. Bismarck therefore negotiated the secret <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1887 with Russia, in order to prevent Franco-Russian encirclement of Germany. Both powers promised to remain neutral towards one another unless Russia attacked Austria-Hungary. However, after Bismarck's departure from office in 1890, the Treaty was not renewed, thus creating a critical problem for Germany {{in the event of a}} war.|$|E
50|$|The treaty {{potentially}} {{conflicted with}} the <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1888, between Germany and Russia. In the secret protocol to the <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty,</b> Bismarck lent support to Russia's expansion efforts. Thus the Mediterranean Agreement, while not a de jure contradiction of the <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{was at least}} contrary to its spirit.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on three {{articles}} concerning to experimental softwarefor evaluation of reinsurance contracts. In paper A we describe and usethe reinsurance analyser (ReAn), an open-source software for analysis ofreinsurance contacts. Moreover, we discuss experimental results, especiallythe risk comparison of excess-of-loss and largest claims <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> In paper B we expand the software including a new excess-of-loss treaty withupper limit. We perform experimental studies comparing extreme value andexcess-of-loss <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> In paper C, we perform a more in depthpresentation of the software. We introduce new treaties as combinations ofstandard treaties. Experimental comparisons are made between these treatiesand other extreme value treaties...|$|R
5000|$|Facultative Reinsurance, {{which is}} {{negotiated}} separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties,</b> for amounts {{in excess of}} the monetary limits of their <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy.|$|R
40|$|Many {{criteria}} for choosing <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> have the common property that a treaty is considered preferable to another {{if it is}} lower in stop-loss order, meaning that it produces uniformily lower stop-loss premiums. Such criteria include maximizing utility of wealth and minimizing ruin probability. If the set of feasible <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> contains a minimum element in stop-loss order, this element is {{the solution to the}} optimization problem. The retained loss under a stop-loss treaty is such a minimum in the set of all treaties with equal mean, suggesting that stop-loss reinsurance is optimal with respect to many criteria. This result extends the result of Borch (1960) and Kahn (1961) on maximizing the utility of wealthstatus: publishe...|$|R
50|$|After the <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> was not renewed in 1890, Russia's leaders grew {{alarmed at}} the country's {{diplomatic}} isolation and {{entered into the}} Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.|$|E

50|$|In Germany, {{the treaty}} was {{compared}} with Bismarck's famous <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> with Russia in 1887. Votes endorsing the treaty in the Foreign Committee of the Reichstag had been unanimous, {{a first for}} the Weimar Republic.|$|E
40|$|In many {{branches}} of the insurance business the insurance company is not willing (or not able) to hold the entire risk on its own. There are several types of treaties which an insurance company can use to cede an amount of its claims to another insurance company. A substantial amount of research has been performed to find individually optimal structures {{for each of these}} types of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> However only few results exist when the goal is to find optimal combinations of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> because of computational complexity or non-convexity of the objective functions. In our paper we introduce a novel approach to solve this task. For the first time this problem will be treated like a true multiobjective optimization problem. We apply two state-of-theart MOEAs, the NSGA-II and the ɛ-MOEA and compare their results in our problem setting. The presented approach is flexible with respect to real world modifications concerning risk measurement, cost calculation principles and different combinations of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> Finally, we do not only solve open mathematical problems on complex reinsurance combinations but we consequently give new heuristic interpretations to supplement existing theoretic results...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the above}} {{examples}} concern reinsurance contracts that cover more than one policy (<b>treaty).</b> <b>Reinsurance</b> can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a quota share or excess of loss basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas <b>treaty</b> <b>reinsurance</b> is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.|$|R

50|$|In 1887 German and Russian {{alignment}} {{was secured}} {{by means of}} a secret <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Treaty</b> arranged by Otto von Bismarck.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present results}} {{allowing}} one {{to evaluate the}} cost and the variance reduction of the cedant {{in the framework of}} <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> based on order statistics. We compare the efficiency of such treaties with excess of loss covers. Numerical examples show that the best choice may depend on the distribution of the individual claim size, especially on the heaviness of the tail. It may also depend on the premium principles applied by both companies...|$|R
50|$|The first {{contracts}} of {{this type}} were traded in the 1980s. This market remained fairly small (though influential in price setting for reinsurance as these contracts are more consistent than most <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties)</b> through Hurricane Katrina.

40|$|In this {{technical}} report we explore the motivation, structuring and detailed mechanics of a variance swap contract adapted for a property insurance portfolio. We structure, price and test sensitivities of the swap contract using real event historical and modeled natural catastrophe loss data.

5000|$|Germany and Russia {{agreed to}} observe benevolent neutrality, should the other be {{involved}} in a war with a third country.

50|$|The 1878 Treaty of Berlin left Russia feeling cheated of her gains {{made in the}} Russo-Turkish War. Her {{key role}} in European {{diplomacy}} was not, however, forgotten by Bismarck. A more formal, officially documented The Three Emperors' Alliance was concluded on 18 June 1881.It lasted for three years; it was renewed in 1884 but lapsed in 1887. Both alliances ended because of conflicts of interest between Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans.

5000|$|In {{setting up}} a {{financial}} <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaty,</b> the reinsurer will provide capital (there {{are a number of}} ways of doing this, discussed below). In return, the insurer will pay the capital back over time. The key here is to ensure that repayments only come out of surplus emerging from the reinsured block of business. The benefit of this surplus-limitation {{comes from the fact that}} in the regulatory accounts there is no value ascribed to future profits - which means the liability to repay the reinsurer is made from a series of payments which are deemed to be zero.|$|E
