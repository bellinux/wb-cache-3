40|$|Most {{studies of}} social {{polygyny}} in birds have examined male provisioning {{on the basis}} of the number <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> visits. This may be misleading if males compensate for infrequent visits by bringing larger prey at each visit. We investigated nestling provisioning in the socially polygynous great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, in south Central Sweden in 1996 - 1997. We collected data on rare <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> visits, prey size and the amount of biomass delivered by males and females. Males had lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> visits and provided smaller prey to nestlings in secondary than in monogamous and primary nests. Secondary females had higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> visits and brought larger prey than monogamous and primary females. These results confirm that secondary females face a potential cost of polygyny through a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> male <b>feeding,</b> and that this cost was reinforced by the significantly lower male provisioning rate (biomass h(- 1)) at secondary nests. Secondary females compensated for the lack of male assistance by increasing their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> and bringing larger prey. As a result, offspring in nests of secondary females received as much food as did those in nests of primary females. Prey load size increased with the parent's proportion <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> visits, suggesting that parents use different feeding strategies depending on their amount of responsibility for nestling provisioning. We suggest that parents which take the main responsibility for nestling feeding have to forage further away from the nest, and based on optimal-foraging theory, they should then on average bring larger prey to their nest...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> {{behavioural}} innovation, such as opportunistic feeding innovation, {{may facilitate}} adaptation to novel environments. Because parasites may affect how their hosts adopt novel means of resource acquisition, or because opportunistic behaviours may involve {{the risk of}} being exposed to a large parasite fauna, we hypothesize an evolutionary link between the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> innovations and parasitism. We investigated the phylogenetic relationship between relative frequency <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> innovations (adjusted for research effort and population size) and relative size of immune defense organs (as a relative measure of parasite-mediated selection) and the prevalence of blood parasites in birds. Using generalized least squares models, we found that species with relatively large bursa of Fabricius, thymus, and spleen had higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> innovations than species with small immune defense organs. Similarly, there was a positive interspecific association between feeding innovation and haematozoa prevalence. These relationships were not confounded by migration, relative brain size, geographical distribution, and male plumage brightness. Analyses of causality relying on evolutionary modelling of discrete variables and path analysis suggest that increasing <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> innovation may place species under intense selection due to parasitism. Therefore, behavioural adaptation by feeding innovation seems to have consequences for the coevolutionary arm race between parasites and hosts. (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R
40|$|Sows {{are often}} {{selected}} by their body size and gestation groups are formed from this initial selection. However, size <b>of</b> sow and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> speed {{have not been}} determined, and instead of body size as the selection criteria, would <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> be a better determinant for sows being grouped? Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to (1) estimate the range of speeds that a sow consumes a pre determined ration, (2) determine how sow parity affects the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> and (3) ascertain if feeding rate differs when feed is presented on the floor versus a raised ledge. To avoid aggression, 11 clinically normal, mixed-parity, crossbred sows were purchased from a commercial producer in Iowa and housed in individual pens at Iowa State University. Sows were all feed by hand and the ration was formulated to meet the NRC (1998) requirements for that sow at her stage of production. Data was collected on the afternoon feeding (1600 h) and each sow received 0. 90 kg (2 lb). Treatment One; Floor; defined as food being placed centrally 1 m in distance on the rubber mat from the back of the home pen. Treatment Two; Ledge; the ledge was defined as a raised concrete step. Scoring <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> was conducted by live observation (one person to one sow). Data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS and a repeated measure statement of date nested within sow was used. A P 3 ̆c 0. 05 was considered significant and PDIFF was used to separate the means. The feeding rate (sec) range for sows within parity will be presented descriptively. No differences were found for parity (P = 0. 59) of sow, although parity one sows ate quicker (14 mins) compared to parities two (20 mins) and three (19 mins). There was a difference (P = 0. 02) for <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> when sows were presented with feed on the floor of their home pen or on the raised feeder. In conclusion there was no difference between <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> by parity when sows were housed individually in a home pen.
