5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
40|$|Slepian, Masicampo, Toosi, and Ambady (2012, Experiment 1) {{reported}} that participants who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> big secret estimated a hill as steeper than participants who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> small secret. This finding was interpreted {{as evidence that}} secrets are experienced as physical burdens. In 2 experiments, we tried to replicate this finding, but, despite larger power, did not find a difference in slant estimates between participants who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> big secret and those who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> small secret. This finding was further corroborated by a meta-analysis that included 8 published data sets of exact replications, which indicates that thinking of a big secret does not affect hill slant estimation. In a third experiment, we also failed to replicate the effect of <b>recalling</b> <b>a</b> secret on throwing a beanbag at a target (Slepian et al., 2012, Experiment 2). Together, our findings question the robustness of the original empirical findings...|$|R

5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E
25|$|Generativity {{refers to}} {{nurturing}} {{and caring for}} those things, products, and people that {{have the potential to}} outlast the self. Individuals who were judged high in generativity, (i.e. who had a commitment story) were found to <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> higher proportion of events related to aspects of generativity. In contrast, those participants without a prominent disposition towards generativity showed no such bias.|$|E

25|$|The first {{empirical}} research {{about the social}} sharing of emotions was conducted in 1991. These were retrospective studies where participants filled out a questionnaire which asked them to <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> specific personal experience that provoked an emotion.

In all of these studies, 88–96% of emotional experiences were followed by social sharing of those experiences at least one time.|$|E

25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as EM, facial palsy, or arthritis), or {{a history of}} possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as serological blood tests. The EM rash {{is not always a}} bull's eye, i.e., it can be solid red. When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illnesses. Not all individuals infected with Lyme disease develop the characteristic bull's-eye rash, and many may not <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> tick bite.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{memory is}} a form of memory that {{involves}} remembering to perform a planned action or <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> planned intention at some future point in time. Prospective memory tasks are common in daily life and range from the relatively simple to extreme life-or-death situations. Examples of simple tasks include remembering to put the toothpaste cap back on, remembering to reply to an email, or remembering to return a rented movie. Examples of highly important situations include a patient remembering to take medication or a pilot remembering to perform specific safety procedures during a flight.|$|E
25|$|Neglect {{not only}} affects present {{sensation}} but memory and recall perception as well. A patient suffering from neglect may also, {{when asked to}} <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> memory of a certain object and then draw said object, draw {{only half of the}} object. It is unclear, however, if this is due to a perceptive deficit of the memory (to the patient having lost pieces of spatial information of the memory) or whether the information within the memory is whole and intact but simply being ignored, the same way portions of a physical object in the patient's presence would be ignored.|$|E

25|$|Pattern {{completion}} is {{the ability}} to recall an entire memory from a partial or degraded sensory cue. Place cells are able to maintain a stable firing field even after significant signals are removed from a location, suggesting that they can <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> pattern from only some of the original input. Furthermore, pattern completion can be symmetric in that an entire memory can be retrieved from any part of it. For example, in an object-place association memory, spatial context can be used to recall an object and the object can be used to recall the spatial context.|$|E
25|$|Call features: The {{ability of}} the issuer (on some bonds) to call a bond early for redemption. This should not {{be mistaken for a}} call option. A Softcall would refer to a call feature where the issuer can only call under certain circumstances, {{typically}} based on the underlying stock price performance (e.g. current stock price is above 130% of the conversion price for 20 days out of 30 days). A Hardcall feature would not need any specific conditions beyond a date: that case the issuer would be able to <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting {{that in order to}} successfully use a mnemonic device an individual should be aware that the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> set of items. Participants were made aware of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who were made aware of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic than those who were not made aware of the mnemonic before recall.|$|E

25|$|Head once {{stated that}} he could not <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> time in his life when he had not wished to pursue a career in medicine. He often thought that the dream of {{becoming}} a doctor could have first been formed at the age of eight when his family was involved in an epidemic of scarlet fever. He remembered being taken to spend a few days with the family doctor, Mr. Brett, and one morning at breakfast he startled his family by repeating a procedure that the doctor had used during his illness. Pouring a little tea onto a teaspoon, he had heated it over an oil lamp and carefully inspected the result, checking the tea for albumin as Mr. Brett had done with his urine.|$|E
25|$|Adolescence {{and early}} {{adulthood}} {{have been described}} as special times in memory encoding because individuals typically <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> disproportionate number of autobiographical memories from those periods. The reminiscence bump accounts for this disproportionate number of memories. The reminiscence bump typically occurs between 10 years of age and 30 years of age and is the period that individuals produce the most memories during free recall tasks. Research suggests that memories are easily accessible from the reminiscence bump because they are linked to self-identity. The memories found within the reminiscence bump significantly contribute to an individual's life goals, self-theories, attitudes, and beliefs. Additionally, life events that occur during the period of the reminiscence bump, such as graduation, marriage, or the birth of a child, are often very novel, thus, making them more memorable.|$|E
