Nazareth House itself was demolished to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> purpose-built halls of residence, James Mellon Hall (shown right) and David Paterson House. The two new halls were opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 November 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Marischal College {{merged with}} the {{neighbouring}} King's College to form the University of Aberdeen. There was no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to Tait. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at King's College, London, instead. After recovering from a near-fatal bout of smallpox in 1860, Maxwell moved to London with his wife.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1934, Hessen was {{withdrawn}} from fleet service {{and placed in}} reserve. On 31 March 1935, Hessen was stricken from the reserve list and converted into a target ship. Her armament was removed, the hull was lengthened, and new machinery was installed. The longer hull allowed <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> additional watertight compartments, which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13. The ship's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely; Hessen retained only a single funnel, a tower foremast, and the two armored barbettes for the main battery turrets. The ship had a crew of 80, but could be operated by remote control when {{being used as a}} target.|$|E

5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{aviation}} in Trøndelag {{started in}} 1937, when Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) started seaplane services from Ilsvika and Jonsvannet in Trondheim. These were terminated during World War II, but taken up {{again by the}} Royal Air Force and the Royal Norwegian Air Force {{during the summer of}} 1945. They were terminated in November due to the weather and RAF's withdrawal. The following year, DNL started services again, this time from Hommelvik. During winter, the route was not operated. The service was operated with a Short Sandringham flying boat to Oslo and Northern Norway, and a Junkers Ju-52 to Western Norway. The southbound and northbound Sandringhams and the Junkers all met at Hummelvik to exchange passengers. There was only <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> planes at the quay, so the third aircraft had to be anchored in the fjord. In 1947, the airport had 3,500 passengers. On 2 October 1948, the Bukkene Bruse Accident occurred, where a Sandringham aircraft crashed during landing, killing 19 people. In 1949, a reserve airport was built at Skogn, and people were transported from Hommelvik to Skogn along the Nordland Line in case the reserve airport was used. DNL became part of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 1951—the last year it used Hommelvik. Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap continued to use Hommelvik for some more year. Braathens SAFE started their route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu via Hamar Airport, Stafsberg and Røros Airport on 18 August 1953. However, they chose to operate their de Havilland Herons from Trondheim Airport, Lade, just a few kilometers outside of the city center, in days with clear weather. Braathens SAFE moved all services to Værnes in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Compartments and Double Bedrooms {{are private}} <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> passengers, with {{upper and lower}} berths, washbasins, and private toilets, placed {{on one side of}} the car, with the {{corridor}} running down the other side (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car).

A total of 14 were built in 1989 and 1990.|$|E
25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added {{either side of the}} rear door facing inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single front seat of the van and pickup, this gave enough <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> children and two adults. The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon of}} the knight changed a little: swords were longer, some with long {{cruciform}} hilts with grips over 15cm in length (providing <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> hands), straight double-edged blades often over 90cm in length, and weigh typically between 1.2 and 1.4kg (so called greatswords or bastards). On the contrary armour transformed significantly. Mail was gradually enriched with iron plates, which covered {{the most of}} endangered parts of the body, and {{in the beginning of}} 15th century was replaced with full plate armour. Worth to know that the armour was covered with outer garment of tunic form, open at the sides and so usually belted, usually emblazoned with coats of arms, known as tabard. Uncomfortable great helms went out of use, replaced with first visored bascinets, typically fitted with an aventail and hinged visor.|$|E

Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium centre console with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E

500|$|The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five {{was adapted}} for the opera in 1997 by {{composer}} Philip Glass with story-libretto by Lessing. It {{was commissioned by}} the state of Baden-Württemberg and HeidelbergCement in Germany. The two-act opera for orchestra, chorus and soloists had its world premier in Heidelberg, Germany in May 1997 under the direction of Thomas Kalb (music) and Birgitta Trommler (stage), with libretto translated into German by Saskia M. Wesnigk. Lessing said that for the opera she expanded her allegory about gender relations: [...] "There was <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> festivals: a woman's festival and a marriage festival. There are a lot of lyrics not in the novel." [...] A new production of the opera, directed by Harry Silverstein with music conducted by Robert Kaminskas, premiered {{for the first time in}} English in the United States in June 2001 at the Merle Reskin Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
500|$|On 23 August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated. Charles {{was deeply}} distressed. According to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, he [...] "threw himself upon his bed, lamenting with much passion and with {{abundance}} of tears". He remained grieving in his <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> days. In contrast, the public rejoiced at Buckingham's death, which accentuated {{the gulf between}} the court and the nation, and between the Crown and the Commons. Although the death of Buckingham effectively ended the war with Spain and eliminated his leadership as an issue, it did not end the conflicts between Charles and Parliament. It did, however, coincide with an improvement in Charles's relationship with his wife, and by November 1628 their old quarrels were at an end. Perhaps Charles's emotional ties were transferred from Buckingham to Henrietta Maria. She became pregnant for the first time, and the bond between them grew ever stronger. Together, they embodied an image of virtue and family life, and their court became a model of formality and morality.|$|E
500|$|In May 1914, the General Board reissued the {{previous}} year's request, albeit for a vessel armed with six 4in guns, hoping to secure funding to build four vessels. Tensions in Central America increased {{the need for}} gunboats, which the Navy lacked in sufficient numbers. In October 1915, the design was finalized for {{what would be the}} gunboat of 1917; suggestions were solicited from Sacramentos commander now that he had experience with the vessel in service.

The Bureau of Steam Engineering argued that four boilers would take up too much room, but three boilers that were slightly larger than those used in Sacramento would be possible. The first vessel, Asheville was authorized under the 1917 program, and a second, Tulsa, followed in 1918.|$|E
