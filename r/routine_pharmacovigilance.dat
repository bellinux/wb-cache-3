40|$|Adequate {{sedation}} {{is crucial}} to the management of children requiring assisted ventilation on Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU). The evidence-base of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this area is small and a trial was planned to compare midazolam and clonidine, two sedatives widely used within PICUs neither of which being licensed for that use. The application to obtain a Clinical Trials Authorisation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) required a dossier summarising the safety profiles of each drug and the pharmacovigilance plan for the trial needed to be determined by this information. A systematic review was undertaken to identify reports relating to the safety of each drug. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were obtained for each sedative. The MHRA were requested to provide reports relating to the use of each drug as a sedative in {{children under the age of}} 16. Medline was searched to identify RCTs, controlled clinical trials, observational studies, case reports and series. 288 abstracts were identified for midazolam and 16 for clonidine with full texts obtained for 80 and 6 articles respectively. Thirty-three studies provided data for midazolam and two for clonidine. The majority of data has come from observational studies and case reports. The MHRA provided details of 10 and 3 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. No adverse reactions were identified in addition to those specified within the SmPC for the licensed use of the drugs. Based on this information and the wide spread use of both sedatives in <b>routine</b> practice the <b>pharmacovigilance</b> plan was restricted to adverse reactions. The Clinical Trials Authorisation was granted based on the data presented in the SmPC and the pharmacovigilance plan within the clinical trial protocol restricting collection and reporting to adverse reactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Adverse {{reactions}} and medication errors are complications of drug use. Spontaneous reporting systems and pharmacoepidemiological studies incompletely detect {{the occurrence of}} these events in daily hospital care. In this study, the frequency and type of drug-related admissions and hospital-acquired adverse drug events (ADE) in Germany were assessed using routinely collected hospital data. Methods The study was based on aggregated hospital routine data covering the period 2003 to 2007 and annually recorded {{as part of the}} further development of the German Diagnosis-Related Groups. The 505 ICD- 10 -codes indicating an ADE were categorized in seven groups according to their certainty. Primary diagnoses were considered as a proxy for drug-related admissions, and secondary diagnoses as a proxy for hospital-acquired ADE. Results Among all hospital admissions, 5 % were found to be at least possibly drug-induced and 0. 7 % very likely drug-induced. There was {{a significant increase in the}} overall rate of drug-related admissions over time (p Clostridium difficile infection was the most frequent cause of a drug-related admission. About 4. 5 % of in-patients had experienced a hospital-acquired ADE. In addition, over the course of the study period, the overall frequency of hospital-acquired ADEs significantly increased (p Conclusions In Germany, more than 5 % of hospital episodes are either caused or complicated by an ADE. Between 2003 and 2007, there was a statistically significant increase in the overall rate and in some of the subcategories defined by the list of ICD- 10 -codes suspected to be indicative of an ADE. Before the use of <b>routine</b> data in <b>pharmacovigilance</b> and patient safety can be fully exploited, a further tailoring of both the ICD and the available variable set is needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 5 years, {{regulatory}} agencies and drug monitoring centres have beenAbstract developing computerised data-mining methods to better identify reporting rela-tionships in spontaneous reporting databases that could signal possible adverse drug reactions.

30|$|Compared {{to common}} adverse events (for review see McKnight et al. 2012), cancer {{has long been}} {{considered}} a secondary problem in patients treated with lithium. However, the interest in the potential association between lithium therapy and tumors has recently been revived by a document issued by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) (2015), which adopted the following recommendation: “in light of the data available, the PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) has agreed that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that long-term use of lithium may induce microcysts, oncocytomas and collecting duct renal carcinomas. Therefore, the Marketing Authorisation Holders of lithium containing medicinal products should submit a variation within 2  months, to amend the product information. The document also recommends that <b>routine</b> <b>pharmacovigilance</b> should be performed {{in order to better}} characterize the risk ([URL] The present study was prompted by a series of circumstances: (a) our group serves as the Sardinian Pharmacovigilance Center; (b) our group has been running a lithium clinic since the 1970 s and is in possession of detailed clinical data regarding patients on maintenance treatment with lithium; (c) in 2015, {{a few months after the}} publication of the aforementioned EMA document, we observed the case of a woman treated with lithium for 18  years who was diagnosed with both thyroid and renal tumors.|$|E
40|$|To {{restrict}} {{postmarketing surveillance}} to a ‘‘Potential risk: to be quantified in large-scale studies’ ’ [1] is unusual as it excludes <b>routine</b> <b>pharmacovigilance,</b> {{no matter how}} limited that may be perceived. My study [2] showed that a less-dismissive attitude to Sub-Saharan pharmacovigilance is warranted. It appears that until late 2011, Sanofi did not give weight to the published Anglophone (from 1976) and Francophone (2004) case reports referenced in my paper associating extrapyramidal reactions with amodiaquine and the repe-ated advice (2010 and 2011) of the WHO’s Advisory Committee on Safety of Medicinal Products (ACSoMP) that reporting to the Uppsala Monitoring Centre supported a clear association with artesunate amodiaquine combina-tion products [3, 4]. These followed progress reports to ACSoMP of my ongoing analysis. ACSoMP recommended that the details be published and shared with the manu-facturer for a possible update of the Summary of Product Characteristics [3]. It is unclear whether any of the notifications mentioned by Dr Bompart [5] that led to Sanofi’s acceptance of the association came from the large-scale studies. If some did, details should be published and an estimate of incidence disclosed. Acknowledgments The views in this reply are strictly the personal views of the author. His conflicts of interest disclosed in the published paper [2] remain unchanged. References 1. Sanofi aventis.

40|$|Because {{pregnant}} women are routinely excluded from prelicensure clinical trials {{for fear of}} harming the mother or the developing foetus [1], most drugs are marketed with limited information on their safety during pregnancy and therefore are not recommended for use by {{pregnant women}}. Yet drugs are widely used by pregnant women, and medication often cannot be avoided in chronic diseases such as epilepsy and HIV or other acute illness that harm {{the mother and the}} unborn child if left untreated. Passive mechanisms of spontaneous reporting of adverse drug effects are inadequate for detecting druginduced foetal risks or lack of such risks [2]. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency recommend active surveillance, {{such as the use of}} pregnancy exposure registries (PERs), for products that are likely to be used during pregnancy or by women of childbearing age (WOCBAs), particularly if there have been case reports of adverse pregnancy outcome following exposure, if drugs in the same pharmacological class are known to pose risk during pregnancy, or if pre-clinical animal data suggest potential teratogenic risk [3, 4]. In industrialised countries, this information can be derived from medical records and automated databases, including medical or pharmacy insurance claims. Such approaches are challenging in developing countries where resources for <b>routine</b> <b>pharmacovigilance</b> are rare and automated data sources generally do not exist [5 – 8]. Thus, nearly all developing countries rely on The Health in Action section is a forum for individuals or organizations to highlight their innovative approaches to a particular health problem...|$|E

Such rare events are often only detected from spontaneous reports, which present their own limitations, particularly during a prolonged global launch schedule. GlaxoSmithKline’s <b>routine</b> <b>pharmacovigilance</b> includes regular reviews of global adverse event (AE) reports and aggregate {{data from a}} central safety database. Lamotrigine {{is one of the}} several antiepileptic drugs associated with SCARs. After identification of increased rates of fatal SCAR cases with lamotrigine in Japan between September and December 2014, this analysis investigated the global incidence of fatal SCARs with lamotrigine and explored whether known risk factors may have contributed to these cases. Global fatal SCAR cases reported with lamotrigine administration from launch until January 2015 were reviewed for evidence of temporal association with dosing and the presence of risk factors, including comorbidities, concomitant medications, and noncompliance with the prescribing information (PI). Worldwide, the estimated cumulative exposure to lamotrigine was > 8. 4 million patient-years. Globally, there were 54, 513 AE reports for lamotrigine, of which 3, 454 (6. 3 %) concerned SCARs. Of these, 122 (3. 5 %) had a fatal outcome (attributable and nonattributable to lamotrigine), equating to 0. 01 fatal SCARs per 1, 000 patient-years. In Japan (estimated cumulative exposure 141, 000 patient-years), 17 fatal SCARs were reported (attributable and nonattributable), equating to 0. 12 per 1, 000 patient-years. Seventy-one percent of fatal SCAR cases in Japan showed evidence of noncompliance with the recommended dosing regimen; in 65 % of the cases, a delay in discontinuation of lamotrigine after early signs of hypersensitivity was reported. Despite a number of limitations inherent in comparing spontaneous report data, this analysis highlights the need for adherence to the lamotrigine PI and emphasizes the importance of collaboration between global and local pharmacovigilance departments, to promptly identify and reduce the risk of rare and serious events, such as SCARs.

40|$|Safety {{surveillance}} {{is important}} {{during the entire}} life cycle of a drug. Pre-marketing trials {{have been shown to}} be ineffective in establishing the full safety profile of the drug, mainly due to their relatively small sample size and characteristics of the patients, which are usually younger and healthier than the average patient using the drug in general practice. Hence, the safety profile of a drug will be incomplete at market entry. Regulations have been implemented to ensure drug safety and market authorization holders are at present required to provide updated safety information as evidence accumulates. During the post-marketing phase additional safety information is mainly gathered by signal detection, observational studies, and meta-analysis of trials. The thesis is divided into three subtopics: perspectives and concepts in post-marketing safety research, utilizing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in safety research and finally future steps in risk monitoring. First we focused on available safety information and what we can learn by taking a different approach to this data. We discuss comparability of data from RCTs of same class drugs, where one has been withdrawn from the market due to safety concern and the second one still remains on the market. Further, we discuss learning during the post-marketing phase. We aimed to investigate whether same class drugs had similar adverse drug reaction profiles and whether learning occurs between the drug pair and at which time point. Finally, we categorize different types of off-label use and discuss the potential shift in risk associated with moving out of the licensed domain. We hypothesize that, only when the off-label population is more vulnerable to pharmacologically expected (Type A) events than the domain will we expect higher risk. Type B (unpredictable) adverse drug reactions occur randomly, also in the off-label population. The second topic focuses on utilizing data from RCTs to estimate drug safety in situations where potential safety issues rise during the post-marketing phase. We used data from the ADVANCE trial to first assess whether the intensity of glucose control influences cancer risk in patients with type II diabetes and second to discuss methodological challenges of post-hoc analysis of RCTs that explore drug associated cancer outcomes. We found that intensity of treatment did not influence cancer risk in these patients. For the last topic we propose a new strategy that could aid safety evaluation during the post-marketing phase. We structured a Bayesian meta-analysis model that combines information from phase III and phase IV and thereby, combines both trial and observational data. For this we used the example of rosiglitazone which was withdrawn from the European market due to cardiovascular risk. We conclude with a discussion on benefits of new strategies for pharmacovigilance such as the Bayesian meta-analysis which is currently not a part of <b>routine</b> <b>pharmacovigilance</b> activities and the importance of seeking the most efficient ways to use available information. We identified several areas where data may be used more efficiently; these include information about same class drugs and dosages, trial databases for post-hoc analysis and limiting uncertainties regarding off-label use...|$|E
