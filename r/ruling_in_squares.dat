Publications and activities classified as [...] "extremist" [...] included protests against the court <b>rulings</b> <b>in</b> Bolotnaya <b>Square</b> case ("calling for illegal action") and criticism of overspending of local governor ("insult of the authorities") or publishing a poem in support of Ukraine ("inciting hatred") In 2015, the fines for [...] "extremist" [...] content were raised to a maximum of 1 million rubles ($16,069).|$|R

5000|$|First countywide {{judicial}} censorship {{measures were}} taken {{by the government in}} the wake of the 2011-13 Russian protests. This included the Internet blacklist law, implemented in November 2012. The criteria for inclusion in the blacklist initially included child pornography, advocating suicide and illegal drugs. In 2013, the blacklist law was amended with content [...] "suspected in extremism", [...] "calling for illegal meetings", [...] "inciting hatred" [...] and [...] "violating the established order". The law allowed for flexible interpretation and inclusion of a wide array of content. Popular opposition websites encouraging protests against the court <b>rulings</b> <b>in</b> Bolotnaya <b>Square</b> case were for example blocked for [...] "calling for illegal action"; Dumb Ways to Die, a public transport safety video, was blocked as [...] "suicide propaganda"; websites discussing federalization of Siberia — as [...] "attack on the foundations of the constitution"; an article on a gay activist being fired from job as well as LGBT support communities — as [...] "propaganda of non-traditional sex relations"; publishing Pussy Riot logo — as [...] "insult of the feelings of believers"; criticism of overspending of local governor — [...] "insult of the authorities"; publishing a poem in support of Ukraine — [...] "inciting hatred" [...] etc. A separate class of materials blocked due to [...] "extremism" [...] are several religious publications, mostly Muslim and Jehovah's Witnesses. Bans can be challenged in courts, and in some cases these appeals are successful.|$|R
