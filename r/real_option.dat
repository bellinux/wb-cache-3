5|$|In February 1770, Pulaski moved near Nowy Targ, and in March, {{helped to}} subdue the mutiny of Józef Bierzyński. Based in Izby, he {{subsequently}} operated in southern Lesser Poland and on May 13 his force was defeated at the Battle of Dęborzyn. Around June 9–10 in Prešov, {{in a conference}} with other Confederate leaders, he met Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who complimented Pulaski on his actions. On July 3–4, Pulaski's camp was captured by Johann von Drewitz, and {{he was forced to}} retreat into Austria. Early in August he met with the French emissary, Charles François Dumouriez. He disregarded an order to take Lanckoronna and instead cooperated with Michał Walewski in a raid on Kraków on the night of August 31. He then departed for Częstochowa. On September 10, along with Walewski, he used subterfuge {{to take control of the}} Jasna Góra monastery. On September 18 he met Franciszka z Krasińskich, an aristocrat from the Krasiński family and the wife of Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland; he impressed her and she would become one of his protectors. Around September 22–24 Walewski was made the commandant of Jasna Góra, which slighted Pulaski. Nonetheless he continued as the de facto commander of Confederate troops stationed in and around Jasna Góra. Between September 10, 1770, and January 14, 1771, Pulaski, Walewski and Józef Zaremba commanded the Polish forces during the siege of Jasna Góra monastery. They successfully defended against Drewitz in a series of engagements, the largest one on November 11, followed by a siege from December 31 to January 14. The defense of Jasna Góra further enhanced his reputation among the Confederates and abroad. A popular Confederate song taunting Drewitz included lyrics about Pulaski and Jasna Góra. Pulaski intended to pursue Drewitz, but a growing discord between him and Zaremba prevented this from becoming a <b>real</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the theme of}} <b>real</b> <b>options</b> decision-making in multinational corporations (MNCs) and stresses the role of <b>real</b> <b>options</b> attention and managerial learning in company performance. Using a sample of 278 large MNCs with categorised degrees of managerial <b>real</b> <b>options</b> awareness, we examine the risk implications of switching options in multinational operations, and explore {{the extent to which}} the <b>real</b> <b>options</b> logic can be classified as "best practice" in decision-making and risk management. Our results reveal that MNCs which have high managerial awareness about their <b>real</b> <b>options</b> are able to reduce their downside risk through multinationality, organisational slack and other firm characteristics. This finding does not apply fully to MNCs without evidence of such an awareness. Also, although <b>real</b> <b>options</b> awareness does not systematically guarantee lower downside risk from operations, supplementary results indicate that MNCs with evidence of significant investment in the acquisition of <b>real</b> <b>options</b> knowledge tend to outperform competitors that are unaware of their <b>real</b> <b>options.</b> This suggests that if <b>real</b> <b>options</b> are explored and exploited appropriately, <b>real</b> <b>options</b> decision-making can result into superior performance for MNCs in the long-term.

It {{was not until the}} late 1980s and early 1990s that fuel cells became a <b>real</b> <b>option</b> for wider application base. Several pivotal innovations, such as low platinum catalyst loading and thin film electrodes, drove the cost of fuel cells down, making development of PEMFC systems more realistic. However, there is significant debate as to whether hydrogen fuel cells will be a realistic technology for use in automobiles or other vehicles. (See hydrogen economy.)

25|$|Some {{argue that}} the fact that after the triple shock of the Soviet {{intervention}} and two atomic bombs, the Japanese cabinet was still deadlocked and incapable of deciding upon a course of action is telling both {{of the power of the}} Army and naval factions in the cabinet, and of their unwillingness to even consider surrender. Even following the personal intervention of the emperor to break the deadlock in favour of surrender, there were no less than three separate coup attempts by senior Japanese officers to try to prevent the surrender and take the Emperor into 'protective custody'. Once these coup attempts had failed, senior leaders of the air force and Navy ordered bombing and kamikaze raids on the U.S. fleet (in which some Japanese generals personally participated) to try to derail any possibility of peace. It is clear from these accounts that while many in the civilian government knew the war could not be won, the power of the military in the Japanese government kept surrender from even being considered as a <b>real</b> <b>option</b> prior to the two atomic bombs.|$|E

He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom. St. Laurent called the Tory platform [...] "a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance". Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more interested in seeing people than in talking to cameras. Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only <b>real</b> <b>option</b> was to re-elect St. Laurent.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{business}} situations, and {{the parent}} firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [...] "Applications" [...] under the Real options valuation references. Just {{as a financial}} option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the discounted cash flow value) plus any <b>real</b> <b>option</b> value.

2500|$|Continuing {{the above}} example: instead of {{assigning}} three discrete values to revenue growth, {{and to the}} other relevant variables, the analyst would assign an appropriate probability distribution to each variable (commonly triangular or beta), and, where possible, specify the observed or supposed correlation between the variables. These distributions would then be [...] "sampled" [...] repeatedly – incorporating this correlation – so as to generate several thousand random but possible scenarios, with corresponding valuations, which are then used to generate the NPV histogram. The resultant statistics (average NPV and standard deviation of NPV) will be a more accurate mirror of the project's [...] "randomness" [...] than the variance observed under the scenario based approach.

However, survey literature suggests that practitioners are reluctant to adopt this tool, and <b>real</b> <b>options?</b> popularity seems to be growing at a slow rate. To provide explanations for this paradox, we survey the CFOs of Norway, Denmark and Sweden?s 500 largest companies to uncover their use of <b>real</b> <b>options</b> in the capital budgeting process. The study is the first large-scale survey dedicated to <b>real</b> <b>options</b> practice outside North America, {{and one of the}} more extensive works on the topic to date.
