5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, {{and the second}} 45 minutes. The final session lasted 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Johnson was fastest, placing ahead of Newman in second and Montoya in third. Biffle took fourth position and Kurt Busch placed fifth. A. J. Allmendinger, David Reutimann, Kevin Harvick, Martin and David Gilliland rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. During the session, Bowyer broke a <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> and his team changed engines as a consequence.|$|E

50|$|Advanced VTEC has a {{standard}} camshaft and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead, and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> pushing {{down on the}} poppet valves. The camshaft {{is surrounded by a}} partially open drum which has secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> attached to it via a pivoting point. These secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|R

25|$|Nemechek {{moved up}} to the Busch Series in 1990, running the No. 87 with {{sponsorship}} from Master Machine & Tool, posting two top-fives and finishing seventeenth in points, winning Rookie of the Year honors. He had sixteen top-ten finishes and finished sixth in points the following year. In 1992, Nemechek got full-time sponsorship from Texas Pete sauce, and got his first two career wins and defeated Bobby Labonte for the championship by three points. He did not win again in 1993, but he won three poles and finished fifth in points. That season, he made his Cup debut at New Hampshire International Speedway for his NEMCO team, starting 15th before finishing 36th after suffering <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> failure. After running two more races in the 87, he ran a pair of races for Morgan-McClure Motorsports, his best finish 23rd at Rockingham.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by armored compression springs placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter idler wheel suspended from a <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|E

[...] After just five days, Vincent and Hall left the Willard with a completed design for the new engine, which had adopted, almost unchanged, the single overhead camshaft and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> valvetrain design of the later Mercedes D.IIIa engines of 1917-18.|$|E
2500|$|The Viget flew {{well enough}} at Lympne {{in the hands}} of Stan Cockerell, but failed to win prizes. It did win some {{publicity}} after a <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> failure led to a forced landing about six miles from Lympne.

[...] When he returned to the aircraft for the final leg, he found an expectant crowd who had mistaken it for a Punch and Judy booth.|$|E
2500|$|Only one Hurricane was built, {{registered}} G-EBHS. Since the Lympne {{trials were}} in October, the Hurricane {{must have made}} its first light {{in the late summer}} of 1923, probably piloted by Paul Bulman. At the trials, with Bulman at the controls it flew rather tail down, suggesting trim and wing incidence issues had not been sorted. [...] Compared with some other competitors it was overweight; like many others it suffered from an unreliable engine. Worst, it was slow; it had been entered specifically for the Abdullah speed prize and there had been talk of speeds near 100mph, but the best it could do was 58.5mph (94km/h) before retiring with a broken <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> The winner of this £500 prize was the Parnall Pixie II at 76.1mph.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] was {{produced}} from 1971 to 1990. It featured an undersquare [...] bore and [...] stroke; it was otherwise {{similar to the}} 199 and 232. This engine is considered reliable, inexpensive, and torquey. Later 258 models (starting with the 1980 model year for California AMC Concords and Spirits, 1981 for California Jeeps, California Eagles, and 49-state Concord and Spirits, {{as well as in}} 1982 for 49-state Eagles and all other applications) are equipped with AMC Computerized Engine Control (CEC) system. For 1981, as part of a weight reduction program (aluminum intake manifold, plastic <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> cover), the crankshaft was changed from a twelve counterweight design to four, saving approximately 20 pounds. This engine also found some use in farm/industrial applications such as the International Harvester 4000 swather.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} major {{variants}} of the SR20DE {{used in the}} G20. The first, used from July 1990 to December 1993, was the highport, in which the injectors and fuel rail were located above the intake plenum. In January 1994, due to tightening emissions restrictions, Nissan switched to a lowport design, in which the injectors and fuel rail switched places with the intake plenum. This design also featured a milder intake camshaft. (Switching it out for the highport intake cam is a popular upgrade to gain more power.) [...] This design was used from 1994 to 1996 and again in 1998. In 1999 Nissan replaced the valvetrain with a roller-rocker arm lifter design {{in place of the}} hydraulic <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> previously used, but kept the lowport intake design; many performance parts are not interchangeable between roller-rocker and highport/lowport engines, most notably camshafts.|$|E
2500|$|Development {{of the new}} 20 litre {{engine was}} led by Henry Royce {{from his home in}} Kent. Based {{initially}} on the 7.4 litre 40/50 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost engine, and drawing also on the design of a 7.2 litre Daimler DF80 aero engine used in a 1913 Grand Prix Mercedes that had been acquired, the power was increased by doubling the number of cylinders to twelve and increasing their stroke to 6.5inches, although their bore remained at 4.5inches of the 40/50. The engine was also run faster, and an epicyclic reduction gear was designed to keep the propeller speed below 1,100 rpm. To reduce inertia and improve performance the valvetrain design was changed from sidevalves to a SOHC design, closely following the original [...] "side-slot" [...] <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design philosophy used on the contemporary German Mercedes D.I, Mercedes D.II and Mercedes D.III straight-six aviation powerplants.|$|E
50|$|Dating {{back to the}} 19th century, <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> {{have been}} made with and without roller tips that press upon the valve.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their collapsed state, the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the valve <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> resulting in valves that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that are employed for each valve. One rocker follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|R
50|$|In the {{overhead}} camshaft (OHC) design, the cylinder head contains the valves, spark plugs and inlet/exhaust tracts {{just like the}} OHV engine, but the camshaft is now also contained within the cylinder head. The camshaft may be seated centrally between each offset row of inlet and exhaust valves, and still also utilizing <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> (but without any pushrods), or the camshaft may be seated directly above the valves eliminating the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and utilizing 'bucket' tappets.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the smaller engine {{was added to the}} line-up in February 1987, using the world's first needle roller <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> assembly. This generation was badge engineered and was introduced to the Asian luxury car market as the Hyundai Grandeur, giving Hyundai a luxury sedan to shuttle foreign dignitaries during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. As Mitsubishi and Chrysler had a business relationship where automotive technology was being shared and used in both Chrysler and Mitsubishi products, this generation Debonair does have some superficial similarities with the Chrysler New Yorker of the same time period. The Debonair's platform, however, shares nothing with the Chrysler [...] "E", [...] "Y", or [...] "K" [...] platforms. The suspension was upgraded to MacPherson struts for the front suspension, and the rear suspension used a three-link torsion axle. The only transmission available was a four-speed automatic unit.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the design and testing period the absence of a suitable, serially produced light aircraft engine was a concern and the wing was therefore mounted so that it could be moved fore and aft to allow for the varying centre of gravity positions resulting from engines of different weight. [...] A glider version was contemplated though not finally used. [...] Instead, the flight programme began with the L20 powered by the [...] Harley-Davidson motor cycle engine used in the L15. [...] By mid 1925 this had been replaced with a new engine, the [...] air-cooled, flat twin Mercedes F7502a, which Klemm had persuaded Daimler's engine group to design and build for the light aircraft market. The cost of flying the L20 was low as its cruise fuel consumption was only 63 mL/km (45 mpg). From 1926 the uprated [...] Mercedes F7502b was fitted. [...] The F7502 was central {{to the success of the}} L20, though it suffered from repeated <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> failures.|$|E
2500|$|All these engines {{share common}} {{external}} dimensions, light weight - about [...] - forged crankshaft and rods, {{as well as}} most other parts. The stroke for all Gen-1 V8s is [...] Engine displacement was a factor of the bore: the [...] has a [...] bore, [...] , and the [...] a [...] bore. The bore size is cast {{on the top of the}} block near the back of the right bank cylinder head. The block features a deep skirt where the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, forming a very rigid crankcase gallery. The oil system feeds a central gallery to the cam and crankshaft first from front to rear, and then dividing at the front to feed the two lifter galleries from front to rear. From the rear of the two lifter galleries oil is then supplied up to the two <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> shafts which serve as galleries to lubricate the valve train. The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. Juxtaposed with the Rambler V8, the Chevrolet small-block engine feeds both lifter galleries and the central cam and crankshaft galleries simultaneously through a three way split from the rear, having oil proceed to the front of the engine, the lifter galleries feeding oil to the valve train through hollow pushrods.|$|E
50|$|In the {{overhead}} valve (OHV) design, the cylinder head contains the poppet valves and the spark plugs, along with tracts or 'ports' for the inlet and exhaust gases. The {{operation of the}} valves is initiated by the engine's camshaft, which is sited within the cylinder block, and its moment of operation is transmitted to the valves' pushrods, and then <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> mounted on a rocker shaft - the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and shaft also being located within the cylinder head.|$|R
50|$|The sidevalve's poppet valves {{are usually}} sited {{on one side}} of the {{cylinder}}(s). A recess in the cylinder head creates a corridor connecting the valves and the combustion chamber. The valve gear comprises a camshaft which operates the valves via simple tappets, most commonly without any further valvetrain components (such as pushrods, <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> overhead valves or overhead camshafts). Indian, however, employs both <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and pushrods to transmit motion from the cam lobes to the valve stems.|$|R
50|$|In early engines, these covers did not exist. As the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are {{critical}} to having the intake and exhaust valves operate, {{it was necessary to}} keep them constantly oiled. With these early engines, the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> would have to be frequently oiled as the oil was constantly being thrown off or contaminated with dirt from the outside environment. The rocker cover was invented to keep the oil in and the dirt out. This part is now found on virtually every existing internal combustion engine today.|$|R
50|$|The primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the {{oil pressure}} {{flowing from the}} exhaust rocker shaft into the primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> thereby locking both exhaust rocker arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust rocker arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake rocker shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Each exhaust valve on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust rocker arms and twelve secondary exhaust rocker arms. However, each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> corresponds to each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake rocker arms and six secondary intake rocker arms.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves. The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust rocker arms, respectively. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the valve down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the rocker shaft.|$|E
