40|$|<b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> {{dehydration}} and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> uptake when hydrated or dehydrated {{are described}} for {{two species of}} frogs of similar size from different habitats. No detectable differences in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> loss in frogs of both species of comparable size were noted. Considerable differences were seen in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> uptake. These uptake rates were lower in hydrated and dehydrated Le. hochstetteri than in hydrated Li. ewingi. Differences in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> uptake were reflected in measurements of skin permeability and blood plasma osmolality. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> uptake in Li. ewingi were dramatically increased after dehydration, and it was proposed that {{this was due to}} hormonal mediation. The osmotic permeability of different skin regions in frogs of different species may vary in {{the presence or absence of}} oxytocin or vasopressin. This was not observed in Le. hochstetteri where the skin exhibited relatively uniform permeability, but was seen in Li. ewingi and Li. aurea. In these two species, the abdominal skin was more permeable and more readily stimulated by oxytocin or vasopressin than the dorsal skin. Oxytocin and vasopressin also increased the short circuit current (inward Na+transport) through both dorsal and ventral skin in Le. hochstetteri, but most noticeably through the ventral skin in Li. ewingi and Li. aurea. The skin was observed to be thinner in Li. ewingi than in Le. hochstetteri or Li. aurea. Thin areas in the ventral pelvic integument of Li. ewingi and Li. aurea and the presence of epidermal capillaries in these two species are thought to be <b>of</b> importance in <b>water</b> uptake. It has been suggested that water uptake mechanisms are a major factor determining the distribution of the three frog species...|$|R

In modeling eutrophication, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> renewal plays a critical role; stagnant water {{is allowed to}} collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies.

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel {{on the base of}} the {{aquarium}} and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via air displacement. Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel filter plate (also called the plenum). Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material. Greater flow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than air displacement.|$|E
25|$|Water {{regulation}} {{is an important}} aspect of centipede ecology, since they lose water rapidly in dry conditions and are found in moist microhabitats. Water loss is a result of centipedes lacking a waxy covering of their exoskeleton and excreting waste nitrogen as ammonia, which requires extra water. Centipedes deal with water loss through a variety of adaptations. Geophilomorphs lose water less rapidly than lithobiomorphs, though they have a greater surface area to volume ratio. This may be because geophilomorphs have a more heavily sclerotized pleural membrane. Spiracle shape, size, and ability to constrict also have an influence on <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> loss. In addition, the number and size of coxal pores may be variables affecting centipede water balance.|$|E

25|$|When the Soviet Union {{collapsed}} and Georgia became independent in 1991, its {{water supply and}} sanitation infrastructure was in bad shape. Maintenance had been neglected for many years and service quality was poor, with intermittent supply and often poor drinking water quality. After independence there was no clear government commitment to address the deficiencies in {{water supply and sanitation}} and service quality deteriorated even further. For example, operation of the wastewater treatment plant of the capital Tbilisi was stopped because the city was unable to afford to pay for its electricity bill after electricity tariffs had been increased. In 2003 a report by the OECD found that the Georgian urban water and sanitation sector was seriously under-financed, given its long neglect. The report noted that the collection <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> bills was 70% for businesses and only 34% for households. The report recommended increasing collection efficiency and to double the water and sewer tariff in areas outside the capital until they reached the highest affordable level. This was defined as 95% of households spending less than 2.5% of their income on their water and sewer bill. The OECD recommended to leave the tariff in Tbilisi unchanged, because it had already reached the limit of affordability. Furthermore, the government should increase its spending for water supply and sanitation, reform the sector's structure and strengthen human and institutional capacities.|$|E

The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade.

500|$|The outflow clepsydra was a {{timekeeping}} device used in China as {{long ago}} as the Shang Dynasty (c.1600–c.1050BC), and certainly by the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256BC). The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China {{since the beginning of the}} Han Dynasty in 202BC and had replaced the outflow type. The Han Chinese noted the problem with the falling pressure head in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled. Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right. Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours. Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank, so that it could control the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> flow for different lengths of day and night during the year.

The nucleation rate in pure methane is three orders of magnitude higher than literature nucleation <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in low-pressure helium or argon. Addition of carbon dioxide to the carrier gas mixture increases the rates even more. Specifically, rates {{in a mixture of}} methane and 3 % carbon dioxide are a factor of 10 higher than the rates in pure methane.

2500|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{analogy is}} sometimes {{used to describe}} Ohm's law. [...] Water pressure, measured by pascals (or PSI), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow. [...] Water flow rate, as in liters per second, is the analog of current, as in coulombs per second.
