Once he does he <b>remembers</b> <b>how</b> on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
25|$|The chiffon sari {{did what}} years of fashion {{interaction}} {{had not done}} in India. It homogenised fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in gold from Varanasi, delicate zardozi work, gota, makaish and tilla work that embellished the plain fabric, simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur <b>remembers</b> <b>how</b> sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts it was worn with jaali, or net kurtas and embossed silk waist length sadris or jackets. Some of them were so rich that the entire ground was embroidered over with pearls and zardozi.|$|E

To prove his theory, he hits the end of Sideshow Bob's shoe with a mallet, causing Sideshow Bob to scream in pain and exposing him as the robber to the public.
