40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of elective cases on scheduled date of surgery in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: The audit {{was conducted in}} a 216 beds tertiary care pediatric super-specialty hospital. Two operation theatres (OT) provide elective surgical services to pediatric surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology. The audit included all those patients who were posted for elective surgery {{over a period of}} one year. Cancelled cases were identified from predesigned OT utilization formats and the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were evaluated. Results: A total of 2473 cases were posted for the elective surgery in the year 2009 and 189 (7. 64 &#x 0025;) patients had their surgery cancelled. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were upper respiratory infections (30. 68 &#x 0025;) and shortage of time (29 &#x 0025;). Other reasons were medically unfit patients (15. 34 &#x 0025;), precedence of emergency cases (3. 7 &#x 0025;); non-availability of ventilator and intensive care bed (4. 7 &#x 0025;); no-show by patient (4. 76 &#x 0025;); non-availability of blood (4. 2 &#x 0025;); incomplete work up (2. 64 &#x 0025;); administrative reasons (1. 58 &#x 0025;); patient not fasting (1. 58 &#x 0025;) and unspecified reasons (2. 1 &#x 0025;). Overall, 38. 6 &#x 0025; causes were preventable. Conclusions: Elective surgery cancellation is a significant problem with multifactorial etiology. Most common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of planned surgery were sudden onset of respiratory tract infection in the admitted patient and shortage of time.

40|$|Background: This study investigates case {{cancellations}} on {{the intended}} day of surgery (DOS) at a paediatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The hospital in Melbourne treats over 32 000 inpatients annually and handles both elective and emergency cases. Methods: The {{data for this}} paper were collected {{over a period of}} 12 months, from June 2004 to June 2005. The data were extracted retrospectively from the theatre computer system. A nurse researcher reviewed the full written details of all cancellations to clarify their cause and confirm the reasons for cancellation; the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were then sorted into one of 14 groups. Results: There were 16 559 theatre bookings, and of these, 1198 (7. 2 %) were cancelled on the DOS. There was a mean of 3. 28 cancellations of surgery on the intended day. The hospital-initiated postponements accounted for 18. 5 % of DOS cancellations. The top four <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> accounted for 65 % of all cancelled surgeries and were all patient initiated. Conclusions: There was also evidence that some specialties were more susceptible to DOS cancellation than others. The paper ends with proposals to reduce patient-initiated cancellations and directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{characterize}} cancellations of elective surgeries {{according to}} clinical and non-clinical reasons, {{as well as}} to verify seasonal influence and determine the estimated reduction of the index. Method: Quantitative, descriptive and retrospective study with secondary data extracted from the Public Hospital of the State of SÃ£o Paulo database. Results: Out of the 8, 443 (100 %) elective surgeries scheduled, 7, 870 (93. 21 %) were performed and 573 (6. 79 %) were canceled. Out of these 573 (100 %) people, 48. 33 % were canceled for clinical reasons and 46. 40 % were for non-clinical reasons. Among the non-clinical reasons for surgery cancellations, those related to medical reasons stood out: {{at the request of the}} surgeon/change of approach (17. 93 %), followed by non-hospitalized patient (8. 96 %). There was no indication of seasonality regarding the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> in the assessed period. Conclusion: Although the rate of elective surgeries cancellations is lower than that of other hospitals with similar characteristics, it is still possible to reduce it from 6. 79 % to 1. 36 %, considering that 80 % of the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> are avoidable...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cancellation of {{operations}} in hospitals {{is a significant}} problem with far reaching consequences. This study was planned to evaluate <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of elective surgical operation {{on the day of}} surgery in a 500 bedded Government hospital. Materials and Methods: The medical records of all the patients, from December 2009 to November 2010, who had their operations cancelled on the day of surgery in all surgical units of the hospital, were audited prospectively. The number of operation cancelled and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were documented. Results: 7272 patients were scheduled for elective surgical procedures during study period; 1286 (17. 6 %) of these were cancelled on the day of surgery. The highest number of cancellation occurred in the discipline of general surgery (7. 1 %) and the least (0. 35 %) occurred in Ear-Nose-Throat surgery. The most common cause of cancellation was the lack of availability of theater time 809 (63 %) and patients not turning up 244 (19 %) patients. 149 cancellations (11. 6 %) were because of medical reasons; 16 (1. 2 %) were cancelled by the surgeon due to a change in the surgical plan; 28 (2. 1 %) were cancelled as patients were not ready for surgery; and 40 (3. 1 %) were cancelled due to equipment failure. ].

40|$|Background. Day {{of surgery}} {{admission}} (DOSA) is becoming standard {{practice as a}} means of reducing cost in total joint arthroplasty. Aims. The aim of our study was to audit the use of DOSA in a specialty hospital and identify <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation.</b> Methods. A retrospective study of patients presenting for hip or knee arthroplasty between 2008 and 2013 was performed. All patients were assessed at the preoperative assessment clinic (PAC). Results. Of 3195 patients deemed fit for surgery, 114 patients (3. 5 %) had their surgery cancelled. Ninety-two cancellations (80 %) were due to the patient being deemed medically unsuitable for surgery by the anaesthetist. Cardiac disease was the most common reason for cancellation (n= 27), followed by pulmonary disease (n= 22). 77 patients (67. 5 %) had their operation rescheduled and successfully performed in our institution at a later date. Conclusion. DOSA is associated with a low rate of cancellations on the day of surgery. Patients with cardiorespiratory comorbidities are at greatest risk of cancellation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{cancellation}} of surgery {{is a significant}} drain on health resources. However, a persistent problem in most hospitals is short notice {{cancellation of}} scheduled operations, even upto the day of surgery. In some cases, patients have been prepared for surgery, and the staff is assembled and expecting to operate. In UK 8 % of scheduled elective operations are cancelled within 24 hours of surgery. The reasons include cancellation by the patient, cancellation for poorly optimized medical conditions, or cancellations due to poor organization. Many of these are difficult to quantify. However, one relatively easily measured factor {{is the possibility that}} some operating lists were predictably over-booked. An operating list may over-run because of delayed starts, slow turnover, unanticipated surgical/anaesthetic problems or staff shortages. Many of these are difficult to quantify. Background and objectivePrince Sultan Cardiac center {{is one of the largest}} referral center in the Middle East and there is no published data on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of specifically cardiac procedures. However, an audit was performed to assess the reasons for the cancellation of the cases on the day of surgery in cardiac theatres. According to one of the studies published in an Australian journal the percentage of cancelled cardiothoracic cases was determined to be 15. 8 %. ResultsTotal number of cardiac surgical patients including pediatric and adult during a period from June 2008 to May 2009 were 2191. Out of those, 1681 cases were done during the study period, 510 (23. 27 %) cases were cancelled during the study period. The operation theatre was functional for 331 days during the study period. Cancellations done by the surgeons were 34 % while the patientâs related cancellations were 32 %. The administrative issues contributed to 34 % in overall cancellation and anaesthetist-related cancellation were 0 %. ConclusionWe estimated 22 % of the elective operations which were cancelled on the day of surgery were potentially avoidable. There is still a need to do further research to look for the identifiable reasons and strategic measures to eliminate the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> on the day of surgery...|$|E
