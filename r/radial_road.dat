As the total project cost comes to Rs. 2,500 crores as against available funds of only 380 crores loaned by JICA, the works will be executed phasewise with support from other agencies like the Roads and Building Department, Municipal Administration, and urban development departments.|$|R
50|$|The {{roads of}} Metro Manila {{is built around}} the City of Manila. Roads are {{classified}} as local, national or subdivision roads. There are ten <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> branching out from the city. Also there are five circumferential roads forming a series of concentric semi-circular arcs around Manila. The circumferential and <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> are systems of interconnected roads and highways. A problem with the circumferential roads are the missing road links. These are the roads that are not constructed (yet) to give way for development due to Metro Manila's rapid urbanization. The metropolis is resolving this problem through the completion of missing road links or {{through the construction of}} connector roads.|$|R

2500|$|The {{city was}} first settled by Loyalists in the 1780s. The Crown granted them land in {{compensation}} {{for their services}} and for losses in the United States.

They took their Crown Patents where Dick's Creek and 12 Mile Creek merge, now the city centre of St. Catharines. Although never documented, some local St. Catharines historians speculate that Dick's Creek was named after Richard Pierpoint, a Black Loyalist and former American slave. Secondary to water routes, native trails provided transportation networks, resulting in the present-day <b>radial</b> <b>road</b> pattern from the City centre.

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates how {{the extent}} and {{configuration}} of Chinese road and railroad networks has shaped the spatial transformation and degree of compactness of Chinese urban regions in the last 20 years, {{a period in which}} center cities were experiencing strong population inflows but relative losses of industry to the urban periphery. We find strong evidence that the presence of <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> and ring roads outside of the central city reduce central city population density. However <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> have no effect on the spatial distribution of economic activity (GDP) in urban regions, though ring roads outside of center cities may contribute to industrial decentralization. Rather, in a country where inter-city trade relies heavily on rails, rail networks have significant impacts {{on the extent to which}} economic activity decentralizes. Historical transportation infrastructure provides identifying exogenous variation in more recent measures of such infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytical}} urban system equilibrium model for optimizing {{the density of}} <b>radial</b> major <b>roads</b> in a two-dimensional monocentric city. The proposed model involves four types of agents: local authorities, property developers, households and household workers (i. e. commuters). The local authorities aim to maximize the total social welfare of the urban system by determining the optimal density of <b>radial</b> major <b>roads</b> in the city. The property developers seek to determine the intensity of their capital investment in the land market to maximize the net profit generated from the housing supply. The households choose residential locations that maximize their utility within a budget constraint, and the commuters choose the <b>radial</b> major <b>roads</b> that minimize their individual costs of travel between home and workplace. A heuristic solution procedure is developed to find the urban system equilibrium solution. A system optimum model is also proposed to optimize the density of <b>radial</b> major <b>roads</b> that maximizes the social welfare of the urban system. The proposed model can endogenously determine household residential distribution and land values across the city, along with the housing market structure in terms of housing prices and space. Numerical comparative static analyses of congestion pricing and road infrastructure investment (adding a new <b>radial</b> major <b>road)</b> are carried out together with evaluation {{of the effects of}} the service level of <b>radial</b> major <b>roads,</b> urban population size, and household income level on the urban economy.

50|$|The {{main roads}} of Metro Manila are {{organized}} around {{a set of}} radial and circumferential roads that radiate and circle in and around Manila proper. Roxas Boulevard, easily the most well-known of Manila's streets, line the southern shores of Manila with Manila Bay. The boulevard is part of <b>Radial</b> <b>Road</b> 1 that leads south to the province of Cavite. Epifanio de los Santos Avenue or EDSA serves as an important highway in the metropolis. It is also the main thoroughfare linking the different cities of the metropolis. Another well-known <b>radial</b> <b>road</b> is España Boulevard (part of <b>Radial</b> <b>Road</b> 7) that starts in Quiapo and ends at the Welcome Rotonda {{along the border with}} Quezon City. Pres. Sergio Osmeña Sr. Highway, part of the South Luzon Expressway or <b>Radial</b> <b>Road</b> 3 is the most important highway linking Manila with the provinces of southern Luzon. Katipunan Avenue, Quezon Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Ayala Avenue, Aurora Boulevard, Taft Avenue, and the C-5 road are also other important roads in Metro Manila.|$|E
50|$|Some of the radial {{routes that}} were planned {{to connect to}} the Ringway system were built much as planned, {{including}} the M1 and M4. Other <b>radial</b> <b>roads,</b> such as the M3 or M23, were truncated in outer London far from their intended terminal junctions on Ringway 1. Others were simply not built at all in a form recognisable from the Ringway proposal.|$|R
50|$|Bus {{and rail}} public {{transport}} in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of Translink. Bus {{services in the}} city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by Translink Metro, with services focusing on linking residential districts with the City Centre on twelve quality bus corridors running along main <b>radial</b> <b>roads,</b> resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas. More distant suburbs are served by Ulsterbus.|$|R
50|$|Ringway 1 or the London Motorway Box was the {{innermost}} {{of the series}} of four motorway standard roads, known as the London Ringways {{as part of a}} comprehensive scheme developed by the Greater London Council (GLC) to provide high speed motorway-standard roads within the capital linking a series of <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> taking traffic {{into and out of the}} city. The scheme was cancelled in 1973.|$|R
50|$|This {{expressway}} {{will be a}} part of <b>Radial</b> <b>Road</b> 7 {{when its}} construction is finalised.|$|E
50|$|The Line 1 is {{predominantly}} aligned {{to the path}} of Taft Avenue (<b>Radial</b> <b>Road</b> 2), which was chosen largely due to its straight length. Later on, as Taft Avenue ends, it shifts to Rizal Avenue and Rizal Avenue Extension (<b>Radial</b> <b>Road</b> 9) then turning right at EDSA or Circumferential Road 4 (C-4 Road) before ending {{at the corner of}} North and West Avenues and EDSA.|$|E

50|$|Although par force hunting was {{discontinued}} in 1777 by prohibition, {{the road}} system and numbered stone posts remain fully intact. Kongestenen (The King's Stone), a stone featuring Christian V's monogram and a compass rose, {{is located at}} Stjernen (The Star), an 8-way junction in {{the centre of the}} forest. The eight <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> intersect a series of smaller paths called Etkorset (The One-Cross), Tokorset (The Two-Cross), Trekorset (The Three-Cross), etc.|$|R
50|$|To cater for the {{numerous}} proposed developments {{on the outskirts}} of York, such as Clifton Moor, the decision was taken to construct a road to the west and north of York to link to the A64. This came out of evidence given to the 1972 Public Inquiry into the propose new Inner Ring Road. Studies conducted by Professor Smeed indicated an Outer Ring <b>Road</b> with <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> was the best solution.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s {{a number}} of housing estates were {{developed}} in Marzahn that called also for high-performance road links. The Landsberger Allee (Landsberg Avenue) and Frankfurter Allee (Frankfurt Avenue) were expanded to six lanes (four lanes on the outer sections) working as <b>radial</b> <b>roads</b> connecting to the Berlin city center while the Märkische Allee (Northmarch Avenue) was newly constructed as the tangential road running north-south along the new boroughs. This part was finished around 1975.|$|R
