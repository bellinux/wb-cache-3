5|$|The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864– 20 February 1865) {{was fought}} between Uruguay's {{governing}} Blanco Party and an alliance {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil and the Uruguayan Colorado Party, covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and <b>river</b> <b>transport</b> for troops.|$|E
5|$|Zaprešić lies {{along the}} left {{bank of the}} Sava River, {{but it does not}} have any bridges that would connect the town to Samobor, on the other bank, as the nearest bridge is the Podsused bridge, located in the Podsused – Vrapče {{district}} of Zagreb. However, two ferries connect Zaprešić with the roads in Medsave and Samoborski Otok, small villages near Samobor. The widest river in the area, the Sava River, used to be navigable up to Krško, Slovenia in Roman times. However, it is, , navigable only up to Rugvica, leaving Zaprešić with no more possibility of <b>river</b> <b>transport.</b> The city does not have a port on any of its rivers.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1941, {{when the}} World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began, Morava was based at Stara Kanjiža on the Tisza river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division. This force {{was responsible for}} the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the 7th Infantry Division Potiska. The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the river tug R-XXI, the <b>river</b> <b>transport</b> Senta, and a few mobilised customs motorboats, based further south on the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, Morava withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, Poručnik bojnog broda Božidar Aranđelović, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a Luftwaffe Oberstleutnant. On 10 April, Morava was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the 2nd Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from Bačka and Baranja. On the evening of 11 April, Morava anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors Vardar and Sava, and Aranđelović took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.|$|E
5|$|The post {{system was}} the {{cornerstone}} of Abir's commercial activity. Each post was run by one or two European agents to oversee local operations. The salary for an agent was 1,800 fr per year, sometimes increasing to 2,100 fr in the second year, and the standard contract period was three years. Agents also received 60 fr of trade goods each month with which to buy their food. Despite the low wages the 2% commission that each agent received on rubber production made {{up the majority of}} the agents' pay, for example the agent at Bongandanga received 16,800 fr in commission in 1903. As a result, there were many applicants for each post and agents were hired with the expectation that they would increase production by 0.5–3 tons per month. This was implemented by extending the post to include more villages or increasing the quotas expected from the villagers, often indirectly forcing women and children to harvest the rubber as well. If production fell below the quota agents made up the shortfall in lost profits to the company from their pay. Each post consisted of a residence for the agent, barracks for armed sentries and sheds for rubber drying and storage, all built using labour conscripted from the villagers. A typical post employed ten African workmen to sort and dry the rubber, seven servants for the agent and thirty canoemen for local <b>river</b> <b>transport.</b> These were paid around 36.5 fr per year in goods, commonly 5kg of salt, one blanket, five machetes and trade goods to the value of 6.35 fr. The post system was managed by the Director of Congo Operations at the central office in Basankusu. He was assisted in his job of keeping production up and expenses down by the only Free State employee in the concession, the commander of the police. The police commander was in charge of suppressing revolts and punishing villages which dropped below the quota. He had access to a large force of men and river steamers which was stationed at Basankusu and could redeploy quickly to the site of large scale rebellions. Effective police commanders would receive bonuses paid for by Abir.|$|E

40|$|Between July, 1989 and March, 1990, {{bed load}} samples {{were taken from}} ten bridge sites on the Nottawasaga River and three of its tributaries. The Helley-Smith Sampler was used to collect bed load samples, the DH- 48 Suspended Sediment sampler was used to sample the {{suspended}} load, and velocity estimates were obtained with a Marsh-McBirney Model 512 M electromagnetic current meter. Results show that the Pine River, which is {{a tributary of the}} Nottawasaga River, had higher bed load transport rates than the Nottawasaga River. The other tributaries, Willow Creek and Boyne <b>River,</b> <b>transported</b> less. During the summer and fall, bed load <b>transport</b> on the <b>rivers</b> increased in response to precipitation events. After a flood in March of 1990, estimated velocities were capable of transporting most of the available bed material as a ‘traction carpet’ and flushed most of the coarser sediment through the system into Minesing Swamp. On average, the Nottawasaga <b>River</b> <b>transported</b> 17 % of its sediment load as bed load whereas the Pine <b>River</b> <b>transported</b> 40 % as bed load. Mean velocity appeared to be the best parameter to predict bed load on the Nottawasaga River. No parameter best explained the bed load transport of the Pine River because of the opposite behaviours of the two sampling sites. This indicated that caution should be used when using one sampling site on a river to predict its total behaviour...|$|R
