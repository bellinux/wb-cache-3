Records retention is a significant subfield of records management, and legal records retention requirements apply over corporate records regardless of their shape or form.

The Act (which was amended in late 2014 after Clinton left office to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days) requires agencies to retain all official communications, including all work-related emails, and stipulates that government employees cannot destroy or remove relevant records. NARA regulations dictate how records should be created and maintained, require {{that they must be}} maintained [...] "by the agency" [...] and [...] "readily found", and that the records must [...] "make possible a proper scrutiny by the Congress".

5000|$|There is also {{controversy}} surrounding preservation methods. A major controversy {{at the end}} of the twentieth century centered on the practice of discarding items that had been microfilmed. This was the subject of novelist Nicholson Baker's book Double Fold, which chronicled his efforts to save many old runs of American newspapers (formerly owned by the British Library) from being sold to dealers or pulped. A similar concern persists over the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> original <b>documents</b> reformatted by any means, analog or digital. Concerns include scholarly needs and legal requirements for authentic or original records as well as questions about the longevity, quality and completeness of reformatted materials. [...] <b>Retention</b> <b>of</b> originals as a source or fail-safe copy is now a fairly common practice. Another controversy revolving around different preservation methods is that of digitization of original material to maintain the intellectual content of the material while ignoring the physical nature of the book. Further, the Modern Language Association's Committee on the Future of the Print Record structured its [...] "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records" [...] on the inherent theoretical ideology that there is a need to preserve as many copies of a printed edition as is possible as texts and their textual settings are, quite simply, not separable, just as the artifactual characteristics of texts are as relevant and varied as the texts themselves (in the report mentioned herewith, G. Thomas Tanselle suggests that presently existing book stacks need not be abandoned with emerging technologies; rather they serve as vitally important original (primary) sources for future study).|$|R

40|$|Reversible thermochromic paper able {{to resist}} {{counterfeiting}} was prepared by adding reversible thermochromic microcapsules (RTM) to a slurry of cellulosic fibers, {{a process that is}} difficult to imitate. However, the loss of RTM {{is one of the biggest}} problems that inhibits industrial use of this approach. So, the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> RTM in pulp was investigated. The RTM was synthesized by in-situ polymerization, and its properties were characterized. It exhibited strong color contrast between cool and heated conditions, and such behavior could be used to achieve distinctive anticounterfeiting characteristics in the paper. The surface of each microcapsule was smooth, and there was no coherence between particles. The diameters of the microcapsules were mainly in the range 3. 0 μm to 5. 0 μm. <b>Retention</b> <b>of</b> RTM was closely related to beating degree and pulp composition; the higher the beating degree and hardwood pulp content, the higher the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> RTM. On the other hand, the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> RTM was influenced by filler and retention aid.

50|$|The growing {{size of the}} {{archives}} held by the PRO and by government departments led to the Public Records Act 1958, which sought to avoid the indiscriminate <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> huge numbers <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> by establishing standard selection procedures for the identification <b>of</b> those <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> sufficient historical importance to be kept by the PRO. Even so, growing interest in the records produced a need for the Office to expand, and in 1977 a second building was opened at Kew in south-west London. The Kew building was expanded in the 1990s and by 1997 all records had been transferred from Chancery Lane either to Kew or to the Family Records Centre in Islington, North London. The Chancery Lane building was acquired by King's College London in 2001, {{and is now the}} Maughan Library, the University's largest library.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and preacidification of milk on the {{partition}} of specific milk components between retentate and permeate was studied. Percent retention (for any component Y) was determined as: [l - (%Y in soln. permeate/%Y in soln. retentate) ] X 100 where %Y in soln. = [%Y/(%Y + %H 20) ] Simultaneous samples of retentate and permeate were taken at several points during each process. Percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> total solids, fat, total protein, rennet clottable nitrogen, lactose, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin was determined at each sampling point. Percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> β-carotene, vitamin B 12, retinol, and zinc was determined {{at different stages of}} ultrafiltration only. As UF proceeded, percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> total solids, total protein, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin increased. Percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> lactose was not affected and was 0 - 4 %. Percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> fat, rennet clottable nitrogen, zinc, retinal, β-carotene, and vitamin B 12 was 99 - 100 %.

Milks with lower pH values (resulting from preacidification) also had lower percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> total calcium and phosphorous than milks with normal pH values. Percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> sodium was lower during ultrafiltration and diafiltration of acidified milk when compared to ultrafiltration and diafiltration of normal milk. Percent <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> other nutrients was not affected by acidification. Loss of whey proteins into permeate resulted in a lower recovery of total protein after diafiltration than ultrafiltration alone and ultrafiltration of acidified milk.

40|$|Regions with a Mediterranean climate are {{generally}} predicted to become warmer and drier with climate change. Estuaries {{in these regions}} are influenced by {{a broad range of}} climate drivers and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We examine observed and predicted effects of climate change on the estuaries of south-western Australia (SWA), where sustained warming and drying trends have caused dramatic declines in freshwater flows of up to 70 % since the 1970 s, as a case study of the impacts that might be expected in other Mediterranean regions. Current and projected impacts of climate change in SWA include progressive warming and ‘marinisation’ of estuaries; extended closure of periodically open systems; an increased frequency and severity of hypersaline conditions; enhanced water column stratification and hypoxia; and reduced flushing and greater <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> nutrients. We <b>document</b> the effects <b>of</b> these environmental changes on the habitats, biota and ecology of SWA estuaries, including phytoplankton, macrophytes, invertebrates and fish. For example, decreasing river flows will cause periodically open estuaries across SWA to remain closed for longer periods, inhibiting the extent to which marine taxa can access these systems, thus reducing species diversity, whereas marinisation of permanently open systems will increase species diversity. We discuss the broader relevance of our findings, placing them in a global context and highlighting implications for ecosystem services and human populations. Finally, we consider the adaptation options that could be implemented to reduce the impacts of climate change in Mediterranean climate regions...|$|R
