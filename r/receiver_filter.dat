40|$|Abstract-Full-duplex data {{communications}} over a multi-in-put/multi-output linear time-invariant channel is considered. The minimum {{mean square error}} (MMSE) linear equalizer is derived in the presence of both near- and far-end crosstalk and independent additive noise, assuming correlated data, and col-ored noise. The MMSE equalizer is completely specified in terms of the channel and crosstalk transfer functions by using a generalization of previous work due to Salz. Conditions are given under which the equalizer can completely eliminate both near- and far-end crosstalk and intersymbol interference. The MMSE transmitter filter, subject to a transmitted power con-straint, is specified when the channel and crosstalk transfer functions are bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency. Also considered is the design of MMSE transmitter and re-ceiver filters when the data signals are arbitrary wide-sense sta-tionary continuous or discrete-time signals, corresponding to the situation where the crosstalk is not phase-synchronous with the desired signal. For a particular two-input/two-output dis-crete-time channel model, we study the behavior of the MMSE, assuming FIR transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>filters,</b> as a function of how the matrix taps are allocated between these filters, and on timing phase.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the design of}} transmitter-receiver chains for wideband radar systems. The transmitter side employs one, or several, highly flexible signal generators, which are able to generate signals with a large bandwidth. At the receiver side, when we are are able to select <b>receiver</b> <b>filters,</b> we {{have the freedom to}} optimize also the <b>receiver</b> <b>filters.</b> Herein, the transmit waveforms and <b>receiver</b> <b>filters</b> are designed to fulfil user-defined criteria. In general, a high probability of target detection, while maintaining a low false alarm rate, is desired. For a scenario in which interference is present, this means to achieve a high Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio. When advanced transmitter-receiver technology is implemented, the possibility to adapt the system through a feedback loop arises. Information about the the radar operating environment is provided by signal processing techniques. We propose a Kalman filter to follow a time-evolving cluttermap, based on the complex received signal samples. The estimates of the complex clutter reflections are utilized to determine parameters of the clutter distribution. The system should, in addition, experience a robust target detection property. This is important when targets are not confined on a user-specified grid of time-delays and time-scalings. We derive an algorithm where the mainlobe width of the correlation function is adapted according to a desired resolution. The thesis also deals with hardware restrictions. A study on how to synthesize time domain signals from achieved power spectra is performed. We synthesize signals with given spectral properties that experience a low peakto- average-power ratio. A signal with constant envelope is also achievable by allowing the power spectrum to deviate somewhat from its desired shape...|$|R

30|$|As {{can also}} be seen from Equation 5, the average {{interference}} power depends on the impulse response w(t) of the <b>receiver</b> lowpass <b>filter</b> and, for a filter of a given type and order, is proportional to its bandwidth.

This {{can be seen in the}} upper panels of Figure 4, where the increase in the bandwidth of the <b>receiver</b> lowpass <b>filter</b> from 5 to 40 MHz (by 9 dB) results in a 9 -dB increase of both the interference and the thermal noise powers.|$|R
