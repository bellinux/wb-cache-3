40|$|Aims: To review {{research}} {{in the literature on}} nursing shift scheduling/rescheduling, and report key issues identified in a listening exercise with managers in four English NHS trusts to inform the development of mathematical tools for <b>rescheduling</b> decision-making. Background: Shift <b>rescheduling</b> is unrecognised as an everyday time-consuming management task with different imperatives than scheduling. Poor <b>rescheduling</b> decisions can have quality, cost and morale implications. Evaluation: A systematic critical literature review identified <b>rescheduling</b> issues and existing mathematic modelling tools. A listening exercise with nursing managers examined the complex challenges associated with <b>rescheduling.</b> Key issues: Minimal research exists on <b>rescheduling</b> compared to scheduling. Poor <b>rescheduling</b> can result in greater disruption to planned nursing shifts and may impact negatively on the quality and cost of patient care, and nurse morale and retention. Very little research examines management challenges or mathematical modelling for <b>rescheduling.</b> Conclusion: Shift <b>rescheduling</b> is a complex and frequent management activity that is more challenging than scheduling. Mathematical modelling may have potential as a tool to support managers to minimise <b>rescheduling</b> disruption. Implications for Nursing Management: The lack of specific methodological support for <b>rescheduling</b> that takes into account its complexity increases the likelihood of harm for patients and stress for nursing staff and managers...|$|R

40|$|Manymanufacturing {{facilities}} generate {{and update}} production schedules, which are plans that state when certain controllable activities (e. g., processing of jobs byresources) should take place. Production schedules help managers and supervisors coordinate activities to increase productivityand reduce operating costs. Because a manufacturing system is dynamic and unexpected events occur, <b>rescheduling</b> {{is necessary to}} update a production schedule when {{the state of the}} manufacturing system makes it infeasible. <b>Rescheduling</b> updates an existing production schedule in response to disruptions or other changes.

40|$|A supply-chain project {{normally}} {{involves a}} number of independent and autonomous enterprises that share information to varying levels. The initial project schedule (preschedule) established {{at the time of}} forming the supply-chain often requires a series of amendments due to unexpected or abrupt disturbances such as temporary resource outage (e. g. machine break), arrival or cancellation of orders from customers, and change in an operation's processing time (e. g. rework). <b>Rescheduling</b> or adaptive scheduling is a process of updating/repairing the preschedule to adapt to the disturbances. Appropriate <b>rescheduling</b> methods must be chosen and applied depending on the specific protocol of sharing information agreed between the enterprises in the supply chain. This paper is concerned with the impacts of different levels of information sharing on the performance of supply-chain project <b>rescheduling</b> problems. Three <b>rescheduling</b> methods are examined in the research. They are distributed AOR (Affected Operations <b>Rescheduling),</b> negotiation-based <b>rescheduling</b> (NEG), and centralized total <b>rescheduling</b> (TR). These three <b>rescheduling</b> algorithms represent three typical information-sharing scenarios: little information sharing, limited information sharing and complete information sharing, respectively. A comprehensive computational study is conducted under different experimental settings. The results show that NEG and distAOR outperforms the TR <b>rescheduling</b> in terms of total cost minimization and stability of schedule and contractual relationship. NEG is superior in both <b>rescheduling</b> efficiency and effectiveness due to the effect of a moderate level of information sharing. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Beginning with a minimum tasks set to <b>rescheduling,</b> the computing process is oriented by resource share conflict and data transmission dependent of tasks, and limited by the degree of task to optimize the performance of the whole application.

This work addresses the penalty incurred by <b>rescheduling</b> actions and the optimization procedure to preserve schedule stability. To adjust the <b>rescheduling</b> process {{to the needs of}} the decision-maker, <b>rescheduling</b> costs are included to the initial objective function. Namely, unit reallocation and sequencing alterations are the sources of <b>rescheduling</b> costs. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the simultaneous <b>rescheduling</b> of multiple operations that permits local reordering, unit reallocation, and accommodation of new orders, is considered. The need to consider <b>rescheduling</b> penalties in the optimization procedure is highlighted through several case studies. As a result, the production plant stability and efficiency are preserved, whereas the generation of pseudo-optimal schedules is avoided. In addition, the tradeoff between the original objective function optimization and the smooth operation of the plant is thoroughly examinated. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
