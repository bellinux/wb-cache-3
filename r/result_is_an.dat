5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, was totally {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.|$|E
5|$|Reinterpreting {{this last}} bit pattern as a {{floating}} point number gives the approximation , {{which has an}} error of about 3.4%. After the single iteration of Newton's method, the final <b>result</b> <b>is</b> , <b>an</b> error of only 0.17%.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Weaker tornadoes, and {{at times}} even {{stronger}} tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term skipping tornado. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly {{at the time of}} the birth and organization of the tornado. This situation is not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis, thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is a Woody Guthrie tribute album {{performed}} by Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James {{to commemorate the}} 100th anniversary of Guthrie's birth, released through Rounder Records on February 28, 2012. The project was initiated by Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie to have Farrar add music to her father's lyrics—specifically, his earliest songwriting years in Los Angeles. Over {{the course of several}} years, he invited the others to collaborate and recorded at a variety of locations across the United States. Each artist wrote music to lyrics that inspired him and presented it to the collaborators for recording. The <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> album with diverse musical genres that has garnered positive reviews from critics for its varied styles and instrumentation. The quartet promoted the album with a small promotional tour that took them to record stores, radio programs, theaters, and folk festivals. The group has plans for releasing a second volume.|$|E

After most of the steam has been condensed by spout condensers, the non-condensible gas steam mixture is passed through a counter current region which increases the gas-steam reaction {{by a factor of}} five.

If there are no mechanisms allowing compensation to be paid, then it is necessary to assign weights to particular individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} inorganic {{reaction is}} double displacement when in mixing of two salts the ions are swapped without {{a change in}} oxidation state. In redox reactions one reactant, the oxidant, lowers its oxidation state and another reactant, the reductant, has its oxidation state increased.
