40|$|<b>Rights</b> <b>lawyering</b> {{has been}} {{developing}} in China. From spontaneous response to proactive organization, from litigation to civil society networking, from using law as shield to {{using it as a}} sword, and from individual cases to policy change, Chinese <b>rights</b> <b>lawyers,</b> through social-legal activism, have been formidable social force in holding the state accountable to its rhetoric. This article examines the three ways <b>rights</b> <b>lawyers</b> in China use transparency as a tool to pursue legal activism and social campaigns: open government information (OGI) application, on-line mobilization, and off-line action. For <b>rights</b> <b>lawyers,</b> transparency is both as an end and a means to address a wide range of social-political issues. The chapter finds that the formal OGI institutions have created new legal opportunities and resources for <b>rights</b> <b>lawyering,</b> which has proved to be resilient in promoting government accountability and restraining arbitrary exercise of public powers. However, the political vulnerability of legal institutions and their lack of political will and ability in accommodating the demands from the civil society has given rise to extra-institutional, extra-legal mobilization in the form of variety of organized street actions by <b>rights</b> <b>lawyers.</b> The extra-institutional lawyering has invited retaliation from the state, however, leading to further restrictions on lawyers’ right to know and crackdowns on <b>rights</b> <b>lawyering...</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human <b>rights</b> <b>lawyer,</b> who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E

The prize ultimately went to Iranian human <b>rights</b> <b>lawyer</b> Nasrin Sotoudeh and filmmaker Jafar Panahi. The city of Wittenberg, where Martin Luther nailed his Ninety Five Theses to the church door, nominated Pussy Riot for its annual Martin Luther “Fearless Speech” prize. The nomination provoked opposition from many theology experts, including leadership of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). In November the prize was awarded to a group of Regensburg restaurateurs for an anti-Nazi campaign.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil <b>rights</b> <b>lawyer</b> Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human <b>rights</b> <b>lawyer</b> Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken me most is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} after it emerged {{that the three}} IRA members shot in Gibraltar {{were found to be}} unarmed and not in {{possession}} of a bomb. The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human <b>rights</b> <b>lawyer</b> to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.|$|E
