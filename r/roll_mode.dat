50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{possible}} lateral-directional dynamic motion: roll subsidence mode, spiral mode, and Dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>mode</b> can be {{improved}} by dihedral effects coming from design characteristics, such as high wings, dihedral angles or sweep angles.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the spiral}} mode {{has a long}} time constant, the pilot can {{intervene}} to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable Dutch roll {{would be difficult to}} fly.

40|$|The two-temperature {{model of}} local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) is {{employed}} {{to investigate the}} onset of secondary convective flow in a fluid-saturated porous layer inclined to the horizontal and heated from below. The layer {{is assumed to be}} bounded by impermeable plane parallel walls with uniform and unequal temperatures. The linear instability of the stationary pure-conduction single-cell basic flow is studied by employing a normal mode decomposition of the disturbances. A Squire-like transformation is adopted to map all the oblique <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> onto equivalent transverse <b>roll</b> <b>modes.</b> It is shown that the longitudinal rolls are the most unstable modes {{at the onset of the}} instability. The neutral stability condition for the longitudinal modes corresponds to that for a horizontal layer, by scaling the Darcy-Rayleigh number with cosine of the inclination angle to the horizontal. This scaling law, coincident with that well-known for the local thermal equilibrium (LTE) regime, implies a monotonic increment in the stability of the basic flow as the inclination to the horizontal increases...|$|R

40|$|A {{computerized}} {{finite element}} method has been developed to solve a form of the three-dimensional inviscid, irrotational unsteady transonic equation for pointed and rectangular wings and wing-body combinations. The equation is a 'parabolized' version of the full unsteady transonic equation which includes {{the effect of the}} advancing wave and the acceleration in the steady flow field thus including a thickness effect. Automatic mesh generation using conformal mapping has the advantage of allowing relatively arbitrary cross-sections to be closely approximated while taking advantage of the body's similarity to a more simple configuration.

50|$|The Dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode</b> can {{be excited}} by any use of aileron or rudder, but for flight test {{purposes}} {{it is usually}} excited with a rudder singlet (short, sharp motions of the rudder to a specified angle, {{and then back to}} the centered position) or doublet (a pair of such motions in opposite directions). Some larger aircraft are better excited with aileron inputs. Periods can range from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners.|$|E
50|$|A {{yaw damper}} is a device used on many {{aircraft}} (usually jets and turboprops) to damp (reduce) the rolling and yawing oscillations {{known as the}} Dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode.</b> It consists of yaw-rate sensors and a processor that provides a signal to an actuator connected to the rudder. The use of a yaw damper helps provide a better ride for passengers by preventing the uncomfortable yawing and rolling oscillation. On some aircraft it is mandatory for the yaw damper to be operational at all times during flight above a specified altitude.|$|E
50|$|Bryan {{showed that}} the {{stability}} characteristics of airplanes could be separated into longitudinal and lateral groups with the corresponding motions called modes of motion. These modes of motion were either aperiodic, {{which means that the}} airplane steadily approaches or diverges from a trimmed condition, or oscillatory, which means that the airplane oscillates about the trim condition. The longitudinal modes of a statically stable airplane following a disturbance were shown to consist of a long-period oscillation called the phugoid oscillation, usually with a period in seconds about one-quarter of the airspeed in miles per hour and a short-period oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The lateral motion had three modes of motion: an aperiodic mode called the spiral mode that could be a divergence or subsidence, a heavily damped aperiodic mode called the roll subsidence, and a short-period oscillation, usually poorly damped, called the Dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{energy harvesting}} from vehicle suspension systems. The generated power associated with bounce, pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> of vehicle dynamics is determined through analysis. The potential values of power generation from these three modes are calculated. Next, experiments {{are carried out}} using a vehicle with a four jack shaker rig to validate the analytical values of potential power harvest. For the considered vehicle, maximum theoretical power values of 1. 1 kW, 0. 88 kW and 0. 97 kW {{are associated with the}} bounce, pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>modes,</b> respectively, at 20 Hz excitation frequency and peak to peak displacement amplitude of 5 mm at each wheel, as applied by the shaker. The corresponding experimentally power values are 0. 98 kW, 0. 74 kW and 0. 78 kW. An experimental rig is also developed to study the behavior of regenerative actuators in generating electrical power from kinetic energy. This rig represents a quarter-vehicle suspension model where the viscous damper in the shock absorber system is replaced by a regenerative system. The rig is able to demonstrate the actual electrical power that can be harvested using a regenerative system. The concept of self-powered actuation using the harvested energy from suspension is discussed with regard to applications of self-powered vibration control. The effect of suspension energy regeneration on ride comfort and road handling is presented in conjunction with energy harvesting associated with random road excitations...|$|R

To handle the issue the robust input output decoupling technique {{is applied to the}} lateral motion dynamics of the aircraft. The condition under which the problem is solvable via state feedback appears to be generically true. The general form of the robust static decoupling controllers, as well as the general form of the resulting decoupled closed loop system, are derived. The conditions for robust decoupling with simultaneous robust stability are also established in terms of the lateral stability derivatives...|$|R

Although {{the consideration of}} power effects is limited to twin engine airplanes, the propeller-off considerations are applicable to single engine airplanes as well. The procedures are applied to a twin engine, propeller driven, semi-low-wing airplane in the clean configuration through the linear lift range.

The system states are the unit velocity vector and the angular velocity in a body-fixed coordinate system.

The backstepping design is performed on the rigid body dynamics described on vector form. The resulting controller achieves convergence to a desired state from almost all starting points.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to {{evaluate}} the static stability and open loop dynamic stability for unpowered condition of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Ecological Conservation. Forces and moments were obtained by the vortex lattice method. These were computed for different values of angle of attack, sideslip angle, aileron, rudder and elevator deflection, and pitch, yaw and roll rates. Static stability and control derivatives were obtained and used for the analysis of airplane open loop dynamic stability and response. The longitudinal and lateralâdirectional derivates show that the airplane is statically stable. The short period mode and phugoid mode correspond with damped mode. Dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>roll</b> <b>mode</b> of the airplane matches with damped mode and convergent mode, respectively.

40|$|The onset and {{development}} of both dynamically and convectively forced boundary layer rolls are studied with linear and nonlinear analyses of a truncated spectral model of shallow Boussinesq flow. Emphasis is given here on the energetics of the dominant <b>roll</b> <b>modes,</b> on the magnitudes of the roll-induced modifications of the initial basic state wind and temperature profiles, and on {{the sensitivity of the}} linear stability results to the use of modified profiles as basic states. It is demonstrated that the roll circulations can produce substantial changes to the cross-roll component of the initial wind profile and that significant changes in orientation angle estimates can result from use of a roll-modified profile in the stability analysis. These results demonstrate that roll contributions must be removed from observed background wind profiles before using them to investigate the mechanisms underlying actual secondary flows in the boundary layer. The model is developed quite generally to accept arbitrary basic state wind profiles as dynamic forcing. An Ekman profile is chosen here merely to provide a means for easy comparison with other theoretical boundary layer studies; the ultimate application of the model is to study observed boundary layer profiles. Results of the analytic stability analysis are validated by comparing them with results from a larger linear model. For an appropriate Ekman depth, a complete set of transition curves is given in forcing parameter space for <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> driven both thermally and dynamically. Preferred orientation angles, horizontal wavelengths and propagation frequencies, as well as energetics and wind profile modifications, are all shown to agree rather well with results from studies on Ekman layers as well as with studies on near-neutral and convective atmospheric boundary layers...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{large-scale}} streamwise velocity-fluctuating structures (uâ²uâ²) are frequently observed in the log region of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer, and that these motions significantly influence near-wall small-scale uâ²uâ²-structures by modulating the amplitude (Hutchins & Marusic, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 579, 2007, pp. 1 &# 8211; 28; Mathis et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 628, 2009, pp. 311 &# 8211; 337). In the present study, we provide evidence that the spatial organization of large-scale structures in the log region is significantly influenced by the strength of adverse pressure gradients in turbulent boundary layers based on a direct numerical simulation dataset. For a mild adverse pressure gradient boundary layer flow, groups of hairpin vortices are coherently aligned in the streamwise direction to form hairpin vortex packets, and streamwise merging events of the induced large-scale uâ²uâ²-structures create a larger streamwise length scale of structures than that for a zero pressure gradient boundary layer flow. As the pressure gradient strength increases further, however, the formation of hairpin packets is continuously suppressed, and large-scale motions are consequently not concatenated to create a longer motion, resulting in a significant reduction of the streamwise coherence of large-scale structures in the log layer. Although energy spectrum maps for uâ²uâ²-structures show that the large-scale energy is continuously intensified above the log layer {{with an increase in}} the pressure gradient, amplitude modulation of the near-wall small-scale motions is dominantly induced by log region large-scale structures for adverse pressure gradient flows. Conditional averaged flow fields with large-scale Q 2 and Q 4 events indicate that large-scale counter-rotating <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> {{play an important role in}} organizing the flows under the pressure gradients, and the large-scale <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> associated with Q 4 events are more enhanced in the outer layer than those associated with Q 2 events, reducing the streamwise coherence of the vortices in a packet. open...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} modelling {{approach for}} gust and manoeuvre loads analysis is presented. Typically, the unsteady aerodynamics for gust loads are computed by the Doublet Lattice Method. However, this method {{does not account}} for effects, which are important from a flight dynamics and manoeuvre loads perspective. E. g., the roll-yaw coupling, also responsible for the flight mechanical eigenmodes like the dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode,</b> are unaccounted for by the DLM. Since, the dutch <b>roll</b> <b>mode</b> might also be excited by lateral gusts, this might have an influence on the loads response. In this paper, the unsteady aerodynamics are computed by a 3 D panel method, capable of capturing the flight dynamics accurately and provide complex Aerodynamics Influence Coefficients for gust loads analysis as a function of reduced frequency similar to the DLM. The aerodynamics of the panel method are validate by comparison with CFD results. Differences in the flight mechanics between the DLM and the panel methods are assessed for a parametric variation of the wing dihedral of an aircraft model. Finally, results from a frequency domain gust loads analysis of a lateral gust for the DLM and the 3 D panel method are compared...|$|E
40|$|Current {{practice}} of analytical and test methods {{related to the}} analysis, testing and improvement of vehicle vibrations is overviewed. The methods are illustrated on the determination and improvement of powertrain induced steering wheel vibration of a heavy commercial truck. More specifically, the transmissibility of powertrain idle vibration to cabin is investigated with respect to powertrain rigid body modes and modal alignment of the steering column/wheel system is considered. It is found out that <b>roll</b> <b>mode</b> of the powertrain is not separated from idle excitation for effective vibration isolation as well as steering wheel column mode {{is close to the}} 3 rd engine excitation frequency order, which results in high vibration levels. Powertrain <b>roll</b> <b>mode</b> is optimized by tuning the powertrain mount stiffness to improve the performance. Steering column mode is also separated from the 3 rd engine excitation frequency by the application of a mass absorber. It is concluded that the use of analytical and test methods to address the complex relation between design parameters and powertrain idle response is effective to optimize the system performance and evaluate the trade-offs in the vehicle design such as vibration performance and weight.

5000|$|Dutch roll {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of [...] "tail-wagging" [...] and rocking from side to side. This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.|$|R
40|$|Use of {{observed}} wind profiles, such {{as those}} obtained from ascent or descent aircraft soundings, for {{the identification of the}} expected <b>roll</b> <b>modes</b> is hindered by the fact that these modes are able to modify the wind profiles. When such modified wind profiles are utilized to estimate the critical values of the dynamic and thermodynamic forcing rates, large errors in the preferred orientation angles and aspect ratios of the rolls may result. Nonlinear analysis of a 14 coefficient spectral model of roll circulations shows that the primary modification of the background wind is the addition of a linear component. When the linear profile having the correct amount of shear is subtracted from the observed cross-roll winds, then the pre-roll wind profile can be estimated. A preliminary test of this hypothesis is given for a case in which cloud streets were observed during FIRE...|$|R
