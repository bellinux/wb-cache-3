From an anthropological point of view, what we call an atmosphere is to be understood {{in the sense of the}} experienced dimension of the urban space. That means not something just "given" but, on the contrary, "made" through the people's practices and uses, which, in turn, are not necessarily always spontaneous, but also induced, domesticated, forbidden, etc; in sum, they are a cultural construction that must be analysed sectioning all the social forces that compose it. The <b>Raval's</b> case in Barcelona, a slum reconverted in a symbol of the ethnic mix and the cultural fizz, is emblematic of how an atmosphere can be planned and constructed...|$|R

50|$|The most visited temple on {{the hill}} (summit 800 m) is the Kalika Mata temple, the oldest in the area (10th-11th centuries). It has three images of goddesses: the central image is of Kalika Mata, flanked by Kali {{on the right and}} Bahucharamata on the left. The spire of this temple, interestingly, carries a shrine of Sadanandsha Pir, a Muslim ‘pir’ or “saint” held in great reverence in the region. It is the third of the major Shakti Peethas of Gujarat and is known for tantric worship. The temple has large fortifications and an open chowk in front, with two altars for sacrifices and an array of lights for special occasions. The idol of Kalika Mata in the inner sanctum is only the head, the mukhwato, painted in red. Also present are full idols of Mahakali and the yantras of Bahuchara. The temple is open from very early to quite late every day, to {{accommodate}} pilgrims arriving at all hours. The Machi Haveli is a rest house available to pilgrims. To reach the temple at the summit is about a 5 km walk along a jungle footpath {{to the top of the}} hill. However, it is also accessible by a mono-cable ropeway 740 m in length which can carry 1,200 people per hour and is stated to be the country's highest ropeway. On Chaitra sud 8, during navaratri (nine-day festival), a fair is held at the Kalika Mata temple which is attended by thousands of devotees. Hindu pilgrims were coming to visit this temple long before the development of Champaner as a major city and have continued to do so for hundreds of years after its decline, right up to the present day. Another building with columns is also located on the Pavagadh Hill, above the roof of the Mahakali temple. The ruins of Patai <b>Raval's</b> palace can be seen on the way to the temple.|$|R
