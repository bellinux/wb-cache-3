5|$|In 1969, {{after years}} of sharing power with churches, the DIA took sole control of the <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system. The last <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> {{operated}} by the Canadian government, Gordon Indian <b>Residential</b> <b>School</b> in Saskatchewan, was closed in 1996. It is estimated {{that the number of}} residential schools reached its peak in the early 1930s with 80 schools and more than 17,000 enrolled students. About 150,000 children are believed to have attended a <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> {{over the course of the}} system's existence.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledgment of {{the wrongs}} {{done by the}} <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system began in the 1980s. In 1986, at its 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it {{apologize}} to them for its part in colonization and in 1998 apologized expressly for the role it played in the <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{of these}} early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute <b>Residential</b> <b>School,</b> the oldest, {{continuously}} operated <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E

5|$|On October 27, 2011, University of Manitoba {{president}} David Barnard {{apologized to}} the TRC for the institution's role in educating people who operated the <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system.

The Shingwauk <b>Residential</b> <b>Schools</b> Centre is jointly governed by Algoma University and the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association. It is a partner with the Engracia de Jesus Matias Archives and Special Collections which is also located at Algoma University.|$|R
5|$|The <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system harmed Indigenous {{children}} significantly {{by removing}} {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Michael Peers {{apologized to}} <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> survivors, {{on behalf of}} the Anglican Church of Canada, on August 6, 1993, at the National Native Convocation in Minaki, Ontario. The {{following}} year the Presbyterian Church in Canada adopted a confession at its 120th General Assembly in Toronto on June 5, recognizing its role in residential schools and seeking forgiveness. The confession was presented on October 8 during a ceremony in Winnipeg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Residential</b> <b>school</b> {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>residential</b> <b>schools</b> for deaf {{children}} {{provide an}} example for illustration. The <b>residential</b> <b>schools</b> serve as a vital link in the transmission of deaf culture and language and typically provide a rich quality of life. Deaf cultural values find abhorrent occasional proposals to dismantle the <b>residential</b> <b>schools</b> since they are considered the best possible environment, the highest quality of life, in which to acquire and enrich sign language fluency and pass on Deaf cultural values that serve as tools and solutions to challenges in a predominantly hearing world. This view sharply contrasts with the Social Model of Disability, which finds abhorrent segregated schooling of disabled children in special <b>residential</b> <b>schools</b> and prefers the [...] "all-inclusive" [...] environment of neighborhood schools.|$|R

50|$|The {{institution}} made a {{major contribution}} to <b>residential</b> <b>schools</b> by sending brilliant though poor students through National Entrance Examination. From 11 students in 1983 when the scheme started, to 125 in 1991 when the scheme was dropped, the institution contributed more than 600 students to <b>residential</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system relied on the expert advice of several {{prominent}} Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, {{was the best way}} to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as the foundational document for the federal <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E
5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities {{to draw attention to the}} <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the sufferings}} that some Indigenous {{children}} {{experienced in the}} Canadian <b>Residential</b> <b>School</b> system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of {{some members of the}} Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity. His Holiness emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.|$|E

5|$|Preservation of {{documentation}} of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted {{as part of the}} TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{churches have}} also engaged in {{reconciliation}} initiatives {{such as the}} Returning to Spirit: <b>Residential</b> <b>School</b> Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them to communicate and develop mutual understanding. In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health {{organizations such as the}} AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.|$|E
5|$|Few {{other former}} {{residential}} schools have transitioned into independently-operated community schools for Indigenous children. White Calf Collegiate in Lebret, Saskatchewan, {{was run by}} the Star Blanket Cree Nation from 1973 until its closure in 1998, after being run by the Oblates from 1884 to 1969. Old Sun Community College {{is run by the}} Siksika Nation in Alberta in a building designed by architect Roland Guerney Orr. From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun <b>residential</b> <b>school,</b> first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969. It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of Mount Royal College from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations. In 1988, the Old Sun College Act was passed in the Alberta Legislature recognizing Old Sun Community College as a First Nations College.|$|E

5|$|Louis Octave Uzanne {{was born}} on 14 September 1851 in Auxerre, to a bourgeois family {{originating}} from Savoy. His parents were Charles-Auguste Omer Uzanne, a merchant, and Elisabeth Laurence Octavie; his elder brother Joseph, had been born the previous year. His classical studies began in his home town; he moved to Paris after his father's death to study at the Collège Rollin in Paris—a <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> {{for the children of}} the French upper-class. In Paris he became interested in the evolution and history of manuscripts and books. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 he was attached to a school at Richmond in England. Continuing with law studies, he abandoned this line of work when he came into an inheritance in 1872, allowing him to pursue his literary interests.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} formal apology, {{on behalf of}} the sitting Cabinet, in front of an {{audience}} of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC, for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the <b>residential</b> <b>school</b> system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a Committee of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.|$|E
