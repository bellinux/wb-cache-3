5000|$|In wooden shipbuilding, each {{frame is}} {{composed}} of several sections, so that {{the grain of the}} wood can follow the curve of the frame. Starting from the keel, these are the floor (which crosses the keel and joins the frame to the keel), the first futtock, the second futtock, the top timber, and the <b>rail</b> <b>stanchion.</b> [...] In steel shipbuilding, the entire frame can be formed in one piece by rivetting or welding sections; in this case the floor remains a separate piece, joining the frame on each side to the keel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prototype}} GUPPYs, [...] and [...] (both Portsmouth-built Tench boats), {{appeared in}} 1947. Externally, they featured improved streamlining {{of the bridge}} and shears structures, and periscope and radar mast supports. To reduce hydrodynamic drag, one of the periscopes was deleted. No snorkel was fitted, due to difficulties in adapting the snorkel to the fleet boat. Deck guns and their associated containers were removed. An SV radar aerial {{was added to the}} top of the sail, creating a distinctive side bulge. All capstans, cleats, and <b>rail</b> <b>stanchion</b> supports were redesigned so they could be retracted or removed when rigged for dive. Most notably, the sharp V-shaped [...] "fleet boat bow" [...] was replaced with a distinctive rounded [...] "Guppy bow" [...] that improved submerged performance.|$|E
50|$|Hand <b>rails</b> and <b>stanchions</b> are {{available}} to assist safe boarding, seating, standing and alighting assistance, including for persons with disabilities. Other safety features include an emergency door release knob and emergency passenger intercom as well as emergency ventilation windows.|$|R
60|$|She struck it, with a {{crash that}} flung {{two or three of}} the Spaniards staggering, and it {{crumpled}} up before her. Mangrove boughs came streaming down on her grinding forecastle, torn limbs clutched at <b>rail</b> and <b>stanchion,</b> and were smashed by them. Mire was whirled aloft by the thudding screw, and Austin, gripping his telegraph, laughed a harsh laugh as he saw that she was going through. How thick that belt of trees was, or what water flowed among their roots, he did not know, but he remembered that he had found no bottom among them in other places with a boathook, now and then.|$|R
60|$|The bulwarks of the Sofala lying {{alongside}} the bank made a low, black {{wall on the}} undulating contour of the shore. Two masts and a funnel uprose from behind it with a great rake, as if about to fall: a solid, square elevation in the middle bore the ghostly shapes of white boats, the curves of davits, lines of <b>rail</b> and <b>stanchions,</b> all confused and mingling darkly everywhere; but low down, amidships, a single lighted port stared out on the night, perfectly round, like a small, full moon, whose yellow beam caught a patch of wet mud, the edge of trodden grass, two turns of heavy cable wound round {{the foot of a}} thick wooden post in the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{path was}} constructed {{of concrete and}} rested on steel <b>rails</b> supported by <b>stanchions</b> built at approximately 45 degrees into the rock face. It deteriorated over the years, and there were numerous sections where part {{or all of the}} concrete top had collapsed. The result was large open-air gaps bridged only by narrow steel beams or other supports. Few of the original handrails existed, although a safety wire ran the length of the path. Several people lost their lives on the walkway and, after two fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000, the local government closed both entrances. Even so, in the 4 years leading up to 2013, four people died attempting to climb the gorge.|$|R
60|$|Above {{the roof}} of the palace that housed the Jed of Gathol and his entourage, the cruiser Vanator tore at her stout moorings. The groaning tackle bespoke the mad fury of the gale, while the worried faces of those members of the crew whose duties demanded their {{presence}} on the straining craft gave corroborative evidence of the gravity of the situation. Only stout lashings prevented these men from being swept from the deck, while those upon the roof below were constantly compelled to cling to <b>rails</b> and <b>stanchions</b> to save themselves from being carried away by each new burst of meteoric fury. Upon the prow of the Vanator was painted the device of Gathol, but no pennants were displayed in the upper works since the storm had carried away several in rapid succession, just as it seemed to the watching men that it must carry away the ship itself. They could not believe that any tackle could withstand for long this Titanic force. To each of the twelve lashings clung a brawny warrior with drawn short-sword. Had but a single mooring given {{to the power of the}} tempest eleven short-swords would have cut the others; since, partially moored, the ship was doomed, while free in the tempest it stood at least some slight chance for life.|$|R
60|$|It {{proceeded}} {{from a big}} fat fellow (he had an obtrusive, hairy double chin) in a blue woollen {{shirt and}} roomy breeches pulled up very high, even {{to the level of}} his breast-bone, by a pair of braces quite exposed to public view. As where he stood there was no bulwark but only a <b>rail</b> and <b>stanchions</b> I was able to take in at a glance the whole of his voluminous person from his feet to the high crown of his soft black hat, which sat like an absurd flanged cone on his big head. The grotesque and massive space of that deck hand (I suppose he was that--very likely the lamp-trimmer) surprised me very much. My course of reading, of dreaming and longing for the sea had not prepared me for a sea-brother of that sort. I never met again a figure in the least like his except in the illustrations to Mr. W.W. Jacobs' most entertaining tales of barges and coasters; but the inspired talent of Mr. Jacobs for poking endless fun at poor, innocent sailors in a prose which, however extravagant in its felicitous invention, is always artistically adjusted to observed truth, was not yet. Perhaps Mr. Jacobs himself was not yet. I fancy that, at most, if he had made his nurse laugh it was about all he had achieved at that early date.|$|R
5000|$|The Tuncurry was {{involved}} in a collision with a Tug in the early morning of 30 September 1906: Passengers by the coasting, steamer Tuncurry were awakened early this morning whilst on a voyage from Sydney to Cape Hawke by a crash, and on looking out, were surprised to find that their vessel had been in collision with the tug Advance (1884). The Tuncurry returned to Sydney today. An ugly hole in her starboard quarter afforded ample evidence of the early morning smash.The collision occurred shortly after 4 o'clock this morning in the vicinity of North Head. The Tuncurry, which belongs to Messrs. Allen Taylor and Co.'s line, in charge of Captain E. P. O'Bierne, left Pyrmont on Saturday night on her regular week's end trip to Cape Hawke. She carried several passengers and a general cargo. The weather, on clearing the Heads, was somewhat overcast and thick. All, however, went well until about five miles north of North Head, when the tug suddenly loomed up and the collision resulted. The tug had evidently come from Newcastle, and it is stated was [...] "cruising" [...] on the lookout for inward-bound sailing vessels. The two vessels met with considerable force. The Tuncurry received the full strength of the blow on the starboard quarter. Her long counter saved her from being sent to the bottom. Had she been struck a little further forward nothing could have saved her. All the bulward planks in the vicinity were splintered, the damage extending below the covering board. The bulwark <b>rail</b> and <b>stanchions</b> were driven on board by the impact, and passengers who were berthed in the deck house in the vicinity were imprisoned by the wreckage. They were, however quickly rescued from their perilous position by Captain O'Bierne and his officers. The tug meanwhile stood by to render any necessary assistance. A hurried examination was made by Captain O'Bierne. and finding the damage well above water he signalled to the tug that no assistance was needed and immediately headed back to Sydney. The tug put into Newcastle, damaged at the bows.|$|R
