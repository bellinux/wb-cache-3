25|$|Most {{plastics}} contain organic polymers. The {{vast majority}} of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, 'pure' or with the addition of: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The chains comprise many <b>repeat</b> <b>units,</b> formed from monomers. Each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units.|$|E
50|$|Polyethylene may be {{considered}} either as -CH2-CH2-n- with a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of -CH2-CH2-, or as -CH2-n-, with a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of -CH2-. Chemists tend to consider the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> as -CH2-CH2- since this polymer is made from the monomer ethylene (CH2=CH2).|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{polymers}} {{are usually}} consist of one <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> or several <b>repeating</b> <b>units,</b> arranged in random sequences. Sequence-controlled polymers {{are composed of}} different <b>repeating</b> <b>units,</b> which are arranged in an ordered manner. In order to control the sequence, various kinds of synthetic methodologies are developed.|$|R
50|$|For {{polymers}} in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses {{are placed}} around the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit.</b> For example, a hydrocarbon molecule that {{is described as}} CH3(CH2)50CH3, is a molecule with fifty <b>repeating</b> <b>units.</b> If the number of <b>repeating</b> <b>units</b> is unknown or variable, the letter n {{may be used to}} indicate this formula: CH3(CH2)nCH3.|$|R
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent {{more than two or}} three <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely de novo identification or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA) and direct repeat sequences from published genomes as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.|$|E
25|$|Polymer {{oxidation}} {{has caused}} accidents involving medical devices. One {{of the oldest}} known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} DNA {{profiling}} used today {{is based on}} PCR and uses simple sequences or short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, {{but there are other}} lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of <b>repeat</b> <b>units,</b> STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR loci (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using electrophoresis. There are two common methods of separation and detection, capillary electrophoresis (CE) and gel electrophoresis.|$|E
40|$|The <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of cepacian, the {{exopolysaccharide}} {{produced by}} the majority of the Burkholderia cepacia complex microorganisms, was isolated from inner bacterial membranes and investigated by mass spectrometry. The data obtained led to the determination of its structure, thus disclosing the oligosaccharidic sequence synthesised by bacteria, and gave also information on the biosynthetic pathway of cepacian <b>repeating</b> <b>unit,</b> thanks to the presence of saccharidic intermediates shorter than the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, from zero to four acetyl substituents were detected on the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> before the polymerisation process which takes place in the periplasmic space.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} conformational {{analysis of the}} exopolysaccharide of Burkholderia cepacia, which is believed {{to play a role}} in colonization and persistence of B. cepacia in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. The <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of the exopolysaccharide is a heptasaccharide with three branches, which cause significant steric restraints. Conformational searches using glygal, an in-house developed software using genetic algorithm search methods, were performed on fragments as well as on the complete <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> with wrap-over residues. The force field used for the calculations was MM 3 (96). The search showed four favored conformations for an isolated <b>repeating</b> <b>unit.</b> However, for a sequence of several <b>repeating</b> <b>units,</b> the calculations indicate a single, well-defined linear conformation...|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} microstructural {{feature of}} a polymer is its architecture and shape, which {{relates to the}} way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain {{with one or more}} substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.|$|E

40|$|A {{micromechanics}} analysis {{modeling method}} {{was developed to}} analyze the damage progression and fatigue failure of fabric reinforced composite structures, especially for the brittle ceramic matrix material composites. A <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell concept of fabric reinforced composites was used to represent the global composite structure. The thermal and mechanical properties of the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell were considered as {{the same as those}} of the global composite structure. The three-phase micromechanics, the shear-lag, and the continuum fracture mechanics models were integrated with a statistical model in the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell to predict the progressive damages and fatigue life of the composite structures. The global structure failure was defined as the loss of loading capability of the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell, which depends on the stiffness reduction due to material slice failures and nonlinear material properties in the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell. The present methodology is demonstrated with the analysis results evaluated through the experimental test performed with carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix plain weave composite specimens...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{but not all}} uptake systems {{also have}} an extracytoplasmic receptor, a solute binding protein. [...] Some {{homologous}} ATPases function in non-transport-related processes such as translation of RNA and DNA repair. ABC transporters {{are considered to be}} with the ABC superfamily based on the sequence and organization of their ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domains, even though the integral membrane proteins may have evolved independently several times, and thus comprise different protein families. The integral membrane proteins of ABC exporters appear to have evolved independently at least three times. ABC1 exporters evolved by intragenic triplication of a 2 TMS precursor (TMS= transmembrane segment. [...] a [...] "2 TMS" [...] protein has 2 transmembrane segments) to give 6 TMS proteins. [...] ABC2 exporters evolved by intragenic duplication of a 3 TMS precursor, and ABC3 exporters evolved from a 4 TMS precursor which duplicated either extragenicly to give two 4 TMS proteins, both required for transport function, or intragenicly to give 8 or 10 TMS proteins. The 10 TMS proteins appear to have two extra TMSs between the two 4 TMS <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Like the ABC exporters, {{it is possible that the}} integral membrane proteins of ABC uptake systems also evolved at least 3 times independently, based on their high resolution 3-dimensional structures. ABC uptake porters take up a large variety of nutrients, biosynthetic precursors, trace metals and vitamins, while exporters transport lipids, sterols, drugs, and a large variety of primary and secondary metabolites. [...] Some of these exporters in humans are involved in tumor resistance, cystic fibrosis and a range of other inherited human diseases. High level expression of the genes encoding some of these exporters in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (including human) result in the development of resistance to multiple drugs such as antibiotics and anti-cancer agents.|$|E
