5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser <b>running</b> <b>away</b> {{with little more}} than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears.

Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E
