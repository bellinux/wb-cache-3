25|$|On a {{utilitarian}} basis, {{which has}} traditionally been used in welfare economics, an argument {{can be made for}} richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation (Halsnæs et al., 2007). However, another result is possible with a different modeling of impacts. If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting, the result {{is that there is a}} much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action in <b>rich</b> <b>countries.</b> Valuing climate change impacts in poorer countries less than domestic climate change impacts (both in terms of policy and the impacts of climate change) would be consistent with observed spending in <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> on foreign aid (Hepburn, 2005; Helm, 2008:229).|$|E

40|$|We examine immigratuon {{policy and}} its redistributive effects using {{a model of}} a <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> which must spend on border control in order to {{regulate}} immigration from a poor country. There are owners and workers in the <b>rich</b> <b>country,</b> and a public sector which makes redistributive transfers from owners to workers. We first consider the case where illegal immigrants have access to the public sector, a situation currently observed in many countries. We show that as border control becomes more expensive inequality in the <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> increases, redistributive transfers may increase or decrease, some immigration is permitted and foreign aid may be used by the <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> {{in order to reduce the}} migration pressure along its border with the poor country. Because of nonconvexities, we also show a small decrease in the aversion to collapse of the redistributive public sector. We then consider excluding illegal immigrants from the public sector (eg. Califronia Proposition 187). We find that the possibility of collapse vanishes and that the <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> takes the toughest official stance on migration but does not enforce it with border controls. ...|$|R

25|$|While the {{relationship}} between income and life expectancy is log linear on average, any one individual country can lie above or below curve.

40|$|We analyse {{trade in}} {{vertically}} differentiated goods between {{a rich and}} a poor country. In autarky two monopolists, selling a single product, operate in two countries which differ only for their per capita income. If trade opens, the firm operating in the poor country exports to the rich, giving rise to one-way trade. Consumers of the <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> and the firm of the poor country benefit from trade. Liberalization may hurt the consumers in the poor country if their per capita income is quite low vis à vis {{the one of the}} <b>rich</b> <b>country.</b> Trade in vertically differentiated goods brings about an overall gain if countries are quite far apart in terms of standard of living. Real wages increase in both countries as a result of trade, but relatively more in the <b>rich</b> <b>country.</b> As a remedy to the trade deficit, the <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> may set an import reducing tariff that, only under certain conditions, may benefit also the firm of the poor country and increase total welfare. ...|$|R

25|$|Trade {{liberalization}} may shift economic inequality from {{a global}} to a domestic scale. When <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> trade with poor countries, the low-skilled {{workers in the}} <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> may see reduced wages {{as a result of}} the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E

25|$|Radioactive {{material}} is found throughout nature. Detectable amounts occur naturally in soil, rocks, water, air, and vegetation, {{from which it}} is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this internal exposure, humans also receive external exposure from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 millisievert (mSv) per year. This is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in 2008 amounted to about 0.6mSv per year. In some <b>rich</b> <b>countries,</b> like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to medical imaging.
