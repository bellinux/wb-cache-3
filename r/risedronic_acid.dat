40|$|Substituted hydroxymethylenebisphosphonic acid {{derivatives}} [...] {{either as}} dronic acids or their dronate sodium salts, are important pharmaceuticals {{in the treatment}} of diseases arising from excessive bone-resorption. Potential has also been identified in areas ranging from parasite-growth inhibition to immunological and cancer therapeutics. Representative clinically relevant N-heterocyclic derivatives include zoledronic and <b>risedronic</b> <b>acids.</b> The biochemical background and mechanism of action of these drugs are discussed, along with trends in structural development and future prospects. Synthetic routes to dronates are then summarized. The most popular route to valuable dronic acids involves the 3 - component condensation of a substituted acetic acid, phosphorous acid, and phosphorus trichloride. However, the protocols recorded in the literature are very diverse. This review gives a critical account of reported methods, explores the contradictions and suggests a practical synthetic procedure after clarifying the inconsistencies described. Possible mechanisms of the reaction are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN) {{often used}} as its sodium salt risedronate sodium (USAN) is a bisphosphonate used to {{strengthen}} bone, treat or prevent osteoporosis, and treat Paget's disease of bone. It is produced and marketed by Warner Chilcott, Sanofi-Aventis, and in Japan by Takeda under the trade names Actonel, Atelvia, and Benet. It is also available in a preparation that includes a calcium carbonate supplement, as Actonel with Calcium.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of alendronic acid once weekly relative to <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> once weekly on bone mineral density (BMD), markers of bone turnover and tolerability in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Methods: This was a randomised, double-masked, double-dummy multicentre international study (75 centres in 27 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia-Pacific). A total of 1303 women were screened and 936 with low bone density (T-score <=- 2. 0 at the spine, hip trochanter, total hip or femoral neck) were randomised; 91 % (n = 854) completed the study. Patients were randomised to treatment with either active alendronic acid 70 mg weekly (Fosamax((R))) and placebo identical to <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> weekly or active <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> 35 mg weekly (Actonel((R))) and placebo identical to alendronic acid weekly for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in hip trochanter BMD at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included the percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD; biochemical markers of bone turnover (including serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP] and urinary type I collagen N-telopeptides [NTx]); and safety and tolerability as assessed by reporting of adverse experiences. Results: Alendronic acid produced greater increases in BMD than did <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> at 12 months at all sites measured. Mean percentage increases from baseline in hip trochanter BMD at month 12 were 3. 56 % and 2. 71 % in the alendronic acid and <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> groups, respectively (treatment difference [95 % CI]: 0. 83 % [0. 22, 1. 45; p = 0. 0081). Mean percentage increases from baseline were greater with alendronic acid than <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> at the lurnbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD at month 12 (p = 0. 002, p < 0. 001, p = 0. 039, respectively). Increases in BMD with alendronic acid compared with <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> were also significantly greater at 6 months at the trochanter and total kip. There was a greater reduction in bone turnover with alendronic acid compared with risedronic acid: NTx decreased 58 % with alendronic acid compared with 47 % with <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> at 12 months (p < 0. 00 1); and BSAP decreased 45 % with alendronic acid compared with 34 % with <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> at 12 months (p < 0. 001). Overall tolerability and upper gastrointestinal tolerability were similar for both agents. Conclusions: Alendronic acid once weekly produced greater BMD increases at both hip and spine sites and greater reductions in bone turnover relative to <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> once weekly. Both agents were well tolerated with no significant difference in upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences. Clinicians should consider these results when making treatment decisions for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis...|$|E
40|$|Bisphosphonates are {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} drugs in osteoporosis today. They have unequivocally shown their ability to reduce fracture rate at the spine (alendronic acid, <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid,</b> ibandronic acid) and at the hip (alendronic acid and <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid).</b> However, their dosage and administration procedures and the adverse reactions induced by their oral intake are responsible for low adherence. Therefore, intermittent regimens have been developed. Weekly alendronic acid and <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> provide similar benefits, in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) and changes in biochemical markers, as those seen with their daily formulations. Ibandronic acid {{has been shown to}} reduce vertebral fractures when given intermittently. Ibandronic acid given orally monthly and intravenously every 2 or 3 months provides increases in BMD similar to the daily formulation. Yearly intravenous infusions of zoledronic acid are currently being evaluated for their ability to reduce fractures. If the efficacy and safety of bisphosphonates given at administration intervals longer than weekly are confirmed, this might significantly improve patient adherence and long-term outcomes of bisphosphonate treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} aromatase inhibitors on bone mineral density (BMD) and risk of bone fractures in women over- 70 with early breast cancer (EBC), and to verify usefulness of bisphosphonates. Methods. 26 elderly women aged 77. 2 ± 5 ys candidate to adjuvant IAs (anastrazole 1 mg/die) for EBC were enrolled. Femoral and lumbar spine DEXA, and morphometric evaluation of vertebral bodies were performed in all patients and repeated after 1 year. 13 patients with T-score > - 2 and without fractures (group A) received calcium (1000 mg/die) and 25 -OH-D 3 (800 UI/die). 13 patients with T-score ≤ - 2 or T-score > - 2 and vertebral fractures (group B) were given in addition <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> (35 mg/week). Results. In group A, at 1 -year follow-up, no patients showed modification of lumbar and femoral-neck BMD, while throcanter (Δ BMD: - 0. 021 ± 0. 020, p < 0. 01) and total hip (Δ BMD: - 0. 011 ± 0. 018, p < 0. 05) BMD decreased significantly. In group B BMD was stable in all femoral sites, while lumbar BMD significantly increased (Δ BMD L 2 -L 4 : + 0. 029 ± 0. 04, p < 0. 05). No patients developed vertebral or other fractures during the follow-up. Conclusions. Short/medium-term treatment with aromatase inhibitors in elderly women with EBC causes minimal detrimental impact on bone. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates like <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> allows a safe use of aromatase inhibitors also in elderly patients...|$|E
40|$|During {{efforts to}} {{stabilize}} metal oxide bound chromophores for photoelectrochemical applications, a novel photochemical reaction has been discovered.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that 70 % of advanced breast cancer patients will face the complication of bone metastases. Three processes are pivotal during bone metastatic growth of breast cancer, namely, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and osteolysis. During tumor-induced osteolysis, a number of cytokines and growth factors are released from the degraded bone matrix. These factors stimulate further tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor-induced osteolysis. New therapies should target all relevant processes to halt this powerful feedback loop. Here, we characterized the new 2 -methoxyestradiol analogue ENMD- 1198 and showed that it is cytotoxic to tumor cells. Moreover, ENMD- 1198 showed both antiangiogenic and vascular disruptive properties andwas capable of protecting the bone against tumor-induced osteolysis. We confirmed the in vitro data with a series of in vivo experiments showing the beneficial effects of ENMD- 1198 and ENMD- 1198 –based combination treatments of metastatic breast cancer in bone both on tumor progression and on survival with long-term ENMD- 1198 treatment. We confirmed the in vivo relevance of the ENMD- 1198 protective effect on bone both with X-ray radiographs and microcomputed tomography. In addition, we combined ENMD- 1198 treatment with low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide and the bisphosphonate <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid,</b> leading to a mild increase in treatment efficacy.

40|$|Few {{cases of}} hip {{fracture}} in pregnant women affected by transient osteoporosis of the femoral head {{have been reported}} in the literature, but its real incidence seems to be underestimated. During pregnancy, osteoporosis manifests itself with an insidious onset of hip pain and limp without any trauma or infective episode in clinical history. Its clinical course is characterized by spontaneous recovery a few weeks to several months after delivery. This article describes the case of a 35 -year-old woman with a sudden onset of bilateral hip pain during the last trimester of her first pregnancy; she had neither history of steroid therapy nor alcohol abuse; her body temperature and serological parameters were normal. Bilateral transient osteoporosis of the femoral heads was suspected and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Fifteen days postpartum, she was admitted to our clinic with a displaced femoral neck fracture. A cementless total hip arthroplasty was performed to quickly begin a rehabilitative program. She underwent antiresorptive therapy with alendronic acid 70 mg/week and vitamin D for 3 months. Three months after the fracture, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan showed osteopenia (T-score, - 1. 5). <b>Risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> 35 mg/week and vitamin D were then prescribed. The last physical examination at 3 months postoperatively revealed a gradual recovery of the autonomy in activities of daily life...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and etidronate (etidronic acid), a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (etidronic acid), has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (clodronic acid), pamidronate (pamidronic acid), alendronate (alendronic acid) and risedronate (<b>risedronic</b> <b>acid).</b> Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular steal syndromes. The increased potency and longer duration of action of newer bisphosphonates more than compensates for their marginally increased cost compared with older bisphosphonates...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Osteoporosis is a {{major health}} threat nowadays. Aging of the {{population}} and changes in peoples’ lifestyle result in a constant {{increase in the number of}} fractures all over the world. Our study aimed at describing the drug utilization pattern and choice of active substances of antiosteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries. Materials and methods: Sales data of the antiosteoporotic medicines was obtained from the internet. These are available on the website of medicines regulatory agencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) methodology of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and defined daily dose (DDD) was used to compare the data among countries. Results: During the study period the consumption of antiosteoporotic medicines was rather stable in all the countries. The overall choice of active substances used to treat osteoporosis is similar in all the Baltic countries but the market shares of substances were different. Estonia stands out with high use of combination product of alendronic acid and colecalciferol. In Latvia the highest consumption was of <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid.</b> In Lithuania the most used active substance in 2014 was ibandronic acid and second was denosumab with 0. 8 daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) and 25 % of the total share. Conclusions: The differences in consumption of drugs against osteoporosis in the Baltic countries are not very big. The consumption of antiosteoporotic drugs is not to be regarded as sufficient though. The generally low consumption of osteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries can be attributed to the overall less than EU average wealth of the countries and less than optimal expenditure on healthcare out of the GDP...|$|E
40|$|PublishedMeta-AnalysisThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme via the DOI in this record. BACKGROUND: Fragility {{fractures}} are fractures that result from mechanical forces that would not ordinarily result in fracture. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates [alendronic acid (Fosamax(®) and Fosamax(®) Once Weekly, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd), <b>risedronic</b> <b>acid</b> (Actonel(®) and Actonel Once a Week(®), Warner Chilcott UK Ltd), ibandronic acid (Bonviva(®), Roche Products Ltd) and zoledronic acid (Aclasta(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd) ] for the prevention of fragility fracture and to assess their cost-effectiveness at varying levels of fracture risk. DATA SOURCES: For the clinical effectiveness review, six electronic databases and two trial registries were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science and BIOSIS Previews, Clinicaltrials. gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Searches were limited by date from 2008 until September 2014. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of effectiveness studies were conducted. A review of published economic analyses was undertaken and a de novo health economic model was constructed. Discrete event simulation was used to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each bisphosphonate treatment strategy and a strategy of no treatment for a simulated cohort of patients with heterogeneous characteristics. The model was populated with effectiveness evidence from the systematic review and NMA. All other parameters were estimated from published sources. A NHS and Personal Social Services perspective was taken, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3. 5 % per annum. Fracture risk was estimated from patient characteristics using the QFracture(®) (QFracture- 2012 open source revision 38, Clinrisk Ltd, Leeds, UK) and FRAX(®) (web version 3. 9, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) tools. The relationship between fracture risk and incremental net benefit (INB) was estimated using non-parametric regression. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and scenario analyses were used to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: Forty-six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the clinical effectiveness systematic review, with 27 RCTs providing data for the fracture NMA and 35 RCTs providing data for the femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) NMA. All treatments had beneficial effects on fractures versus placebo, with hazard ratios varying from 0. 41 to 0. 92 depending on treatment and fracture type. The effects on vertebral fractures and percentage change in BMD were statistically significant for all treatments. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on fractures between bisphosphonates. A statistically significant difference in the incidence of influenza-like symptoms was identified from the RCTs for zoledronic acid compared with placebo. Reviews of observational studies suggest that upper gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported in the first month of oral bisphosphonate treatment, but pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials found no statistically significant difference. A strategy of no treatment was estimated to have the maximum INB for patients with a 10 -year QFracture risk under 1. 5 %, whereas oral bisphosphonates provided maximum INB at higher levels of risk. However, the PSA suggested that there is considerable uncertainty regarding whether or not no treatment is the optimal strategy until the QFracture score is around 5. 5 %. In the model using FRAX, the mean INBs were positive for all oral bisphosphonate treatments across all risk categories. Intravenous bisphosphonates were estimated to have lower INBs than oral bisphosphonates across all levels of fracture risk when estimated using either QFracture or FRAX. LIMITATIONS: We assumed that all treatment strategies are viable alternatives across the whole population. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates are effective in preventing fragility fractures. However, the benefit-to-risk ratio in the lowest-risk patients may be debatable given the low absolute QALY gains and the potential for adverse events. We plan to extend the analysis to include non-bisphosphonate therapies. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD 42013006883.
