5000|$|The aurora {{produces}} a <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheet</b> (or metric sized columns) {{which tends to}} lie in a vertical plane. The result of this vertical ionospheric [...] "curtain" [...] is reflection of signals well into the upper VHF band. The reflection is very aspect sensitive. Since the <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheet</b> lies towards the poles, it follows that reflected signals will arrive from that general direction. An active region or coronal hole may persist for some 27 days resulting in a second aurora when the Sun has rotated. There is a tendency for auroras to occur around the March/April, September/October equinox periods, when the geomagnetic field is at right angle to Sun for efficient charged particle coupling. Signals propagated by aurora have a characteristic hum effect, which makes video and audio reception difficult. Video carriers, as heard on a communications receiver, no longer can be heard as a pure tone.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of placing a <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheet</b> in an air gap on the thermal {{performance}} of single hollow, double hollow and insulated hollow walls and roofs is studied. One face of the wall or roof is exposed to solar radiation and ambient air {{and the other is}} in contact with room air at constant temperature. These results are also compared with the predictions made in the case when a water film is maintained on the roof or wall. Numerical calculations are for a typical hot day (the 26 th of May, 1979) in New Delhi. It is seen that the use of a <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheet</b> in single hollow and double hollow walls and roofs is more economical [...] and gives a better performance [...] than the water film system. ...|$|E

Based on the aperture admittance expression, an equivalent circuit is developed. It is shown {{that there is a}} 1 :l correspondence between elements of the equivalent circuit and higher order modes which exist in the parallel-plate waveguide formed by the ground plane and the <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheet.</b> For the special case where the configuration is treated as a microwave circuit tee junction, the waveguide widths which give the best impedance match are seen to be 0. 04 wavelength for the feed guide and 0. 03 wavelength for the second guide. Numerical computations of the reflection coefficient, derived from the aperture admittance, are compared with both the experimental and theoretical results of a similar problem which is solved by application of the geometrical theory of diffraction. General agreement between the two theories except for distances in the vicinity of integral multi-ples of one half-wavelength is obtained. It is in these regions that strong interactions between the antenna and the <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheet</b> are exhibited. It is believed that the differ...|$|E

The calculation reveals a strong {{dependence of the}} interaction on {{the orientation of the}} particle's electric dipole moment with respect to the surface. For a dipole moment that is polarized perpendicularly to the surface the interaction potential has two saddle points lying above and below the plane of the surface, on a line through the centre of the aperture. For a dipole moment that is polarized parallel to the surface there is only one saddle point {{right in the middle of}} the aperture. Provided the particles' motion could be confined to a line through the middle of the aperture, this effect could potentially be used for population-sensitive trapping of particles.

It is also inferred that dividing an air gap into a number of gaps reduces the heat flux coming into the room. At most, one may effectively use only four air gaps. The effect of using <b>reflecting</b> <b>sheets</b> in the air spaces has also been investigated.

40|$|Imaging single {{fluorescent}} {{proteins in}} living mammalian cells is challenging due to out-of-focus fluorescence excitation by common microscopy schemes. We report {{the development of}} a novel fluorescence microscopy method, <b>reflected</b> light <b>sheet</b> microscopy (RLSM), which allows selective plane illumination throughout the nucleus of living mammalian cells, for reducing out-of-focus fluorescence signal. Generation of a thin light sheet parallel to the imaging plane and close to the sample surface is achieved by reflecting an elliptical laser beam incident from the top by 45 ° with a small mirror. The thin light sheet allows for an increased signal-to-background ratio superior to previous illumination schemes and enables imaging of single fluorescent proteins with up to 100 Hz time resolution. We demonstrate the sensitivity of RLSM by measuring the DNA-bound fraction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and determine the residence times on DNA of various oligomerization states and mutants of GR and estrogen receptor (ER), enabling us to resolve different modes of DNA binding of GR.

Several kinds of radiation patterns can be obtained using the proposed algorithm. In this work, we focus our attention on flat-topped radiation patterns, suitable as element pattern for phased array antennas covering a limited angular field of view such as those considered for space applications.

40|$|A thin {{conducting}} sheet - graphene, for example - transmits, absorbs, and <b>reflects</b> radiation. A <b>sheet</b> {{that is very}} thin, even vanishingly so, can still produce 50 % absorption at normal incidence if it has conductivity corresponding to half the impedance of free space. We find that, regardless of the sheet conductivity, there exists a combination of polarization and angle of incidence that achieves this impedance half-matching condition. If the conducting medium can be inverted, the conductivity is formally negative and the sheet amplifies the incident radiation. To the extent that a negative half-match in a thin sheet can be maintained, enormous single-pass gain in both transmission and reflection is possible. Known semiconductors (e. g., gallium nitride) have the optical properties necessary to give large amplification in a structure that is, remarkably, both thin and nonresonant.

The early to mid-Miocene (23 - 14 Mya) is a compelling interval to study as global temperatures and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations {{were similar to those}} projected for coming centuries. Importantly, this time interval includes the Miocene Climatic Optimum, a period of global warmth during which average surface temperatures were 3 - 4 °C higher than today. Miocene sediments in the ANDRILL- 2 A drill core from the Western Ross Sea, Antarctica, indicate that the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) was highly variable through this key time interval. A multiproxy dataset derived from the core identifies four distinct environmental motifs based on changes in sedimentary facies, fossil assemblages, geochemistry, and paleotemperature. Four major disconformities in the drill core coincide with regional seismic discontinuities and reflect transient expansion of grounded ice across the Ross Sea.

These two cyclically alternating facies reflect orbitally driven changes (Milankovitch periodicities) recorded in spectral reflectance, bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility data and opal content changes. Superimposed on these short-term variations, significant uphole changes in average sedimentation rates, total clay content, IRD amount, and mineral composition were interpreted {{to represent the}} long-term lower to upper Miocene transition from a temperate climate to a cold-climate glaciation.
