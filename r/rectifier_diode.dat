40|$|A {{full-bridge}} secondary dual-resonant DC–DC converter {{using the}} asymmetrical pulse-width modulated (APWM) strategy is proposed in this paper.

Given the use of the APWM strategy, a circulating current that exists in a traditional phase-shift full-bridge converter is eliminated. The voltage stress of secondary <b>rectifier</b> <b>diodes</b> in the proposed converter is also clamped to the output voltage. Thus, the existing voltage oscillation of diodes in traditional PSFB converters is eliminated.

50|$|For simple single-pole, single-throw {{doorbell}} buttons, the chime device {{employs a}} <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode</b> and ballast capacitor at the voltage input {{stage of the}} circuit. Upon pressing the doorbell button, power is connected through the <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode</b> or series of rectifier diodes called a full wave rectifier, which allows the current to flow in only one direction, into the ballast capacitor. The ballast capacitor charges at a rate far greater {{than the rest of}} the circuit needs to complete a given song. Once the button is released, the capacitor retains the charge and maintains power for a short duration to the rest of the circuit.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the current}} flowing is DC, a simple <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode</b> is often {{employed}} as a snubber. [...] The snubber diode is wired in parallel with an inductive load (such as a relay coil or electric motor). The diode is installed {{so that it does}} not conduct under normal conditions. When the external driving current is interrupted, the inductor current flows instead through the diode. The stored energy of the inductor is then gradually dissipated by the diode voltage drop and the resistance of the inductor itself. One disadvantage of using a simple <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode</b> as a snubber is that the diode allows current to continue flowing for some time, causing the inductor to remain active for slightly longer than desired. Circuit designs must consider this delay in the dropping-out of the actuator.|$|E
50|$|The {{classic example}} of a {{non-linear}} load is a rectifier with a capacitor input filter, where the <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode</b> only allows current to pass to the load {{during the time that}} the applied voltage exceeds the voltage stored in the capacitor, which might be a relatively small portion of the incoming voltage cycle.|$|E

50|$|The filter removes most, {{but not all}} of the AC voltage variations; the {{remaining}} AC voltage is known as ripple. The electric load's tolerance of ripple dictates the minimum amount of filtering that must be provided by a power supply.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interleaved active-clamping zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) forward-flyback converter without an output choke. The presented topology has two active-clamping circuits with two separated transformers. Because of the interleaved {{operation of the}} converter, the output current ripple will be reduced. The proposed converter can approximately share the total load current between the two secondaries. Therefore, the transformer copper loss and the <b>rectifier</b> <b>diodes</b> conduction loss can be decreased. The output capacitor is made of two series capacitors which reduces the peak reverse voltage of the <b>rectifier</b> <b>diodes.</b> The circuit has no output inductor and few semiconductor elements, such that the adopted circuit has a simpler structure, a lower cost and is suitable for high power density applications.

50|$|In some DC circuits, a {{varistor}} or two inverse-series Zener diodes (collectively {{called a}} Transil or Transorb) {{may be used}} instead of the simple diode.

A Zener diode connected to ground will protect against positive transients to the value of the Zener breakdown, and will protect against negative transients greater than a normal forward diode drop.|$|E

Reverse biasing the emitter-base junctions of transistors also is quite effective {{as long as}} the AC amplitude remains small. Maximum reverse bias voltage is usually between 5 to 7 Volts, before the avalanche process starts conducting. Higher-current devices with greater junction area tend to possess higher capacitance.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} said that the Schottky diode is a [...] "majority carrier" [...] {{semiconductor}} device. This means that if the semiconductor body is a doped n-type, only the n-type carriers (mobile electrons) {{play a significant role}} in normal operation of the device. The majority carriers are quickly injected into the conduction band of the metal contact on the other side of the diode to become free moving electrons. Therefore, no slow random recombination of n and p type carriers is involved, so that this diode can cease conduction faster than an ordinary p-n <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode.</b> This property in turn allows a smaller device area, which also makes for a faster transition. This is another reason why Schottky diodes are useful in switch-mode power converters: the high speed of the diode means that the circuit can operate at frequencies in the range 200 kHz to 2 MHz, allowing the use of small inductors and capacitors with greater efficiency than would be possible with other diode types. Small-area Schottky diodes are the heart of RF detectors and mixers, which often operate at frequencies up to 50 GHz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{early work}} {{began as a}} part {{numbering}} system for devices which became popular in the 1960s. The first semiconductor devices, such as the 1N23 silicon point contact diode, were still designated in the old RMA tube designation system, where the [...] "1" [...] stood for [...] "No filament/heater" [...] and the [...] "N" [...] stood for [...] "crystal rectifier". The first RMA digit thus was re-allocated from [...] "heater power" [...] to [...] "p-n junction count" [...] to form the new EIA/JEDEC EIA-370 standard; for example, the 1N4001 <b>rectifier</b> <b>diode</b> and 2N2222 transistor part numbers came from EIA-370. They are still popular today. In February 1982, JEDEC issued JESD370B, superseding the original EIA-370 and introducing a new letter symbol [...] "C" [...] that denotes the die version, as opposed to [...] "N", now meaning the packaged version. The Japanese JIS semiconductor designation system employs a similar pattern. JEDEC later developed a numbering system for integrated circuits, but this did not gain acceptance in the semiconductor industry. The European Pro Electron semiconductor numbering system originated {{in a similar way}} from the older Mullard-Philips tube designation.|$|E
