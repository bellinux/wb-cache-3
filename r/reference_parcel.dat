40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of agriculture parcel area measurement accuracy on Cartosat- 1 imagery, and the determination of the technical tolerance appropriate for measurement using photointerpretation techniques. A further objective was to find out the influence of image type, land cover or parcel size on the area measurement variability. In our experiment, five independent operators measured 185 parcels, 3 times, on each image. Next, the buffer width, calculated as the difference between measured and <b>reference</b> <b>parcel</b> area, was derived and was the subject of statistical analysis. Prior to verifying the normality of the buffer widths, a detection of anomalous measurements is recommended. This detection of outliers within each group of observations (i. e. parcels) was made using the Jacknife distance test on each type of imagery (Cartosat Aft, Cartosat Fore). Then, the General Linear Model procedure to identify major significant effects and interactions was followed by analysis of variance to ease the interpretation of the variability observed of the area measurement. Finally, two different parameters, reproducibility limit and critical difference, were calculated to make comparison with other sensors like digital aerial orthophoto in this study possible. The repeatability limits gave the acceptability difference between two operators when measuring the same parcel. For orthophoto this value reached 2. 86 m, on Cartosat- 1 5. 17 m and 8. 76 m for Aft and Fore image respectively. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims_Calcareous grasslands {{are local}} {{biodiversity}} hotspots in temperate regions that suffered intensive fragmentation. Ecological restoration projects took place all over Europe. Their success {{has traditionally been}} assessed using a plant community approach. However, population ecology can also be useful to assess restoration success and to understand underlying mechanisms. Methods_We took advantage of three calcareous grassland sites in Southern Belgium, where <b>reference</b> <b>parcels</b> coexist with parcels restored {{in the late twentieth}} century and with more recently restored parcels. We evaluated the colonization stage of three specialist species (Sanguisorba minor, Potentilla neumanniana and Hippocrepis comosa) using occurrence data. We also measured the reproductive traits of 120 individuals per species and compared components of fitness between recent restorations, old restorations and reference habitats. Key results_We found that the occurrence of H. comosa was similar in the different restoration classes, whereas both P. neumanniana and S. minor occurrences decreased from reference grasslands to recent restorations. In contrast, these two latter species exhibited a much higher reproductive output in recent restorations, thanks to an increased production of flowers and seeds. Conclusions_Our results suggest that, during colonization of recently restored calcareous grasslands, favourable environmental conditions, low competition and sufficient genetic mixing may lead to an increased fitness of individuals and a faster population growth than in the reference habitat. These results demonstrate how population processes can increase ecological resilience and highlight the interest of a population-based approach to assess the success of ecological restoration.

40|$|The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is {{a spatial}} {{database}} of reference parcels managed by Member States {{in the context}} of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The maximum eligible area is a crucial attribute of <b>reference</b> <b>parcel</b> for the area-based subsidies. An ineligible elements included in the <b>reference</b> <b>parcel</b> creates the non-conformities or anomalies. This database should be up to date with respect to all the elements which are ineligible for subsidies. In order to achieve this objective, Member States renew their entire orthocoverage every 3 to 5 years. In the consequence, the ¿millions¿ of reference parcels boundaries in the LPIS should then be verified by operators through Computer Aided Photo Interpretation. However, fully manual revision (parcel by parcel) is time consuming and expensive, thus an automatic detection of parcels that potentially need to be updated could significantly improve the time efficiency and reduce the cost of the update process. The aim of this thesis was to develop an automated method for detection of nonconformities in the LPIS in order to support a systematic update process. The proposed method uses the data available in the LPIS and considers the actual update needs. In order to understand the essential update needs and to address the challenge correctly, extensive analyses of anomalies in the systems were undertaken. In the survey more than 21 000 parcels in 12 zones located in 11 Member States were examined. In total close to 10 000 anomalies were found. It was stated that, more than 50 % of all the identified anomalies were caused by patches of trees and buildings located in the reference parcels. Therefore the further research work was focused on outline extraction of selected (building and patches of tree) objects. The developed object extraction method in order to detect selected objects takes advantage of fusion of the radiometric image characteristic (NDVI) with the height data (normalised Digital Surface Model). Two approaches were combined: pixel-based - to localise the potential target objects (called object primitives) and object-based - to delineate 5 outlines of buildings and patches of trees. This combination reduced the processing time since the object-based method was applied only on the subsets of the image where the objects are located, instead of applying heavy computation analysis to the entire image scene. On the other hand, the potential candidate localisation gave better class separation due to reduction of class variability between the full image space and small image subsets containing the primitives. In the object-based approach the Mean Shift segmentation algorithm, developed in the field of Computer Vision, was successfully applied to the aerial ortho-imagery in order to partition the image into adjacent regions. To assure the correctness of the segmentation, considered as a key element of object-based analyses, the segmentation parameters were optimized to the characteristic of the target objects. It was demonstrated that using a standard image LPIS dataset as input to the proposed object extraction method, it is possible to automatically detect 96 % of potential nonconformities caused by buildings and 100 % caused by patches of trees. The UltraCamD image data were found suitable for the automated image analyses and capable of serving as a source for the Digital Surface Model generation using the commercial off-the-shelf software in the agricultural environment. In line with the objectives of the thesis, to reach the automated solution for detection of object causing the LPIS non-conformities, the proposed method of object extraction was implemented in the IDL programming environment.

Therefore those regions—such as grasslands within woodlands for which no subsidy claims were launched (examples are those blue regions outlined by the green rectangles) or in non-agricultural regions (a recultivated mining region in Figure 2 and a deforested area in Figure 3, outlined by black rectangles), small fields along the roads (outlined by black dashed rectangles)—are extracted as eligible in the resulting masks. Grassland or vegetation within the urban areas (blue regions within red rectangles) are extracted as eligible due to the same reason and also due to the spectral mixing because of 5 m spatial resolution. However urban regions can be removed easily by additional thematic data. An eligible crop (maize) is incorrectly captured as ineligible due to its spectral resemblance to the woodlands (ineligible) when it is grown.

40|$|To date, the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) {{has often}} been {{proposed}} {{as the foundation for}} effective spatial management of agriculture and the environment and many land managers have suggested incorporating it in most of the instruments for sustainable agriculture. The LPIS is originally used for registration of agricultural <b>reference</b> <b>parcels</b> considered eligible for annual payments of European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies to farmers. Its intrinsic quality depends on the frequency and magnitude of the discrepancies in area, since some parcels can be under- or over-declared by farmers compared with reference registered within the LPIS. General application of the LPIS therefore depends on our capacity to ¿ first identify and explain the causes of these area discrepancies perceived as anomalies by national CAP payment agencies ¿second, to propose future improvements in its overall quality. From a set of images used during the 2005 Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) campaign, using the geographic information system (GIS) and ecological methodologies we assessed the quality of the LPIS by identifying the diversity of the existing anomalies. To that end, the ecological sampling method was adapted to the specific case of image-based detection of anomalies. The observed anomalies assemblages obtained from a set of European Member States representing the four types of LPIS were analysed to establish the spatial pattern of the anomalies. We showed that the twelve zones surveyed can be grouped into four different clusters, each individually correlated with the presence of certain categories of LPIS anomaly. Some clusters were more particularly related to the presence of natural and anthropogenic landscape features, whereas others were typified by anomalies which stemmed from the process for creating and updating the LPIS, which accounted for 20 % of the anomalies detected. Finally, we also showed that, even if useful for establishing procedures to manage the LPIS, the LPIS typology used in the European Union had no effect on the anomalies assemblage or on the spatial pattern; consequently, the type of LPIS no longer needs to be considered and LPIS anomalies assemblages could be pooled across Europe. In the light of the results obtained, different proposals are made to improve LPIS quality by: ¿ identifying the critical points along the LPIS management chain; ¿ using landscape ecological methodologies to explain the causes of the clusters observed; and ¿ extrapolating the whole results in the CwRS risk analysis to perform ex-ante LPIS anomalies risk map.

40|$|Abstract. Spatial data {{analysis}} tools for predicting {{the variability of}} non-point source pollutants minimize the time, effort and cost involved in extensive and exhaustive real field data measurements. In this study, exploratory {{data analysis}}, fitting of semivariogram models, and kriging techniques of geostatistics were used to develop the spatial variability map of soil phosphorous saturation (Psat) percentage over the St-Espirit watershed (2610 ha), located in Quebec, Canada. The Psat measured values for the 281 geo <b>referenced</b> land <b>parcel</b> units (LPU) within the watershed were interpreted and analyzed using the ArcGIS R © tool. The geostatistical extension module of ArcGIS R © was used for exploratory data analysis, semivariogram model fitting, and development of a Psat prediction map using the ordinary kriging technique. Using these geostatistical procedures and adjustment of lag sizes and lag intervals representing the data sets, {{it was estimated that}} the spherical semivariogram model fitted well to represent the Psat variability with residual sum square (RSS) of 0. 0003 and coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 98. Further, the developed model was used to predict the Psat variability over the St. Esprit watershed using the 1605 geo-referenced LPU locations.

40|$|In this paper, {{the concept}} of {{available}} potential energy (APE) density is extended to a multicomponent Boussinesq ﬂuid with a nonlinear equation of state. As shown by previous studies, the APE density is naturally interpreted as the work against buoyancy forces that a parcel needs to perform to move from a notional reference position at which its buoyancy vanishes to its actual position; because buoyancy can be deﬁned relative to an arbitrary reference state, so can APE density. The concept of APE density is therefore best viewed as deﬁning a class of locally deﬁned energy quantities, each tied to a diﬀerent reference state, {{rather than as a}} single energy variable. An important result, for which a new proof is given, is that the volume integrated APE density always exceeds Lorenz’s globally deﬁned APE, except when the reference state coincides with Lorenz’s adiabatically re-arranged reference state of minimum potential energy. A <b>parcel</b> <b>reference</b> position is systematically deﬁned as a level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) : depending {{on the nature of the}} ﬂuid and on how the reference state is deﬁned, a parcel may have one, none, or multiple LNB within the ﬂuid. Multiple LNB are only possible for a multicomponent ﬂuid whose density depends on pressure. When no LNB exists within the ﬂuid, a <b>parcel</b> <b>reference</b> position is assigned at the minimum or maximum geopotential height. The class of APE densities thus deﬁned admits local and global balance equations, which all exhibit a conversion with kinetic energy, a production term by boundary buoyancy ﬂuxes, and a dissipation term by internal diﬀusive eﬀects. Diﬀerent reference states alter the partition between APE production and dissipation, but neither aﬀect the net conversion between kinetic energy and APE, nor the diﬀerence between APE production and dissipation. We argue that the possibility of constructing APE-like budgets based on reference states other than Lorenz’s reference state is more important than has been previously assumed, and we illustrate the feasibility of doing so in the context of an idealised and realistic oceanic example, using as reference states one with constant density and another one deﬁned as the horizontal mean density ﬁeld; in the latter case, the resulting APE density is found to be a reasonable approximation of the APE density constructed from Lorenz’s reference state, while being computationally cheaper...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the Common Agriculture Policy, Member States have to measure parcels claimed for {{subsidies}} with a recommended precision. This is usually done using Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images with ground sampling distance of around 1 m or better. However acquisition of such imagery may fail due to cloud cover. It is therefore worth examining the potential of almost weather independent VHR radar data for replacing VHR optical imagery: during this study, the identification of agricultural parcels and the assessment of the measurement accuracy on VHR SAR images were tested. Airborne VHR X band SAR data were provided over 4 agricultural test sites in France. Three of these sites were covered with 1 m monopolarized (“B&W”) data from 2002 - 2004 whereas the remaining one was covered with 2 m multipolarized (“colour”) data from 2002. Orthophotos (1 m B&W and 50 cm colour ADS 40) acquired over 2001 - 2004 were used as <b>reference.</b> All <b>parcels</b> falling on {{the frame of}} the VHR SAR images were digitized on the orthophotos and examined on the VHR SAR data. Two sets of around 40 parcels each were selected on the two types of VHR SAR images (2 m “colour” and 1 m “B&W”). Each parcel was measured randomly 3 times by 3 operators on both the SAR imagery and the orthophoto. The errors on the parcel area were translated into buffer widths around the parcel perimeter. After the elimination of outlier measurements, the buffer variations were analyzed and a tolerance interval around the buffer estimated. The results indicate that (1) about 30 % of the parcels were not visible on the X-band SAR data; (2) the estimated tolerance intervals of the buffer values were of 4. 14 m and 4. 81 m on 2 m colour composition and 1 m black-and-white SAR data respectively, which is larger than requested by the EU Regulation.
