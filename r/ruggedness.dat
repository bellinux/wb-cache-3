5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary <b>ruggedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Monti della Laga is a {{mountain}} {{range in the}} central Apennines of Italy. Their <b>ruggedness</b> and inaccessibility makes them one of the lesser known areas of the Italian peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHI): a rigid-hulled {{inflatable}} boat, {{powered by}} a gasoline outboard motor or an inboard/outboard diesel engine. The RHI can be easily deployed from a cutter with a four-point bridle for davit lifting and lowering. The RHI's portability and <b>ruggedness</b> {{allow it to be}} used on many kinds of missions.|$|E
25|$|The Pacer was {{essentially}} a four-place version of the two-place PA-17 Vagabond light aircraft. It features a steel tube fuselage and an aluminum frame wing, covered with fabric, much like Piper's most famous aircraft, the Cub and Super Cub. An aircraft prized for its <b>ruggedness,</b> spacious cabin, and, for its time, impressive speed, many Pacers continue to fly today.|$|E
25|$|Sailors {{may have}} played a role in the {{worldwide}} dissemination of trousers as a fashion. In the 17th and 18th centuries, sailors wore baggy trousers known as galligaskins. Sailors also pioneered the wearing of jeans - trousers made of denim. These became more popular in the late 19th century in the American West because of their <b>ruggedness</b> and durability.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the west}} coast is rocky, it is noted for its fine scenery. La Fontaine Bay, named for a small spring located nearby, is {{particularly}} well known for its views. The <b>ruggedness</b> of the coast means there are no excellent anchorages around Little Sark, though Port Gorey, the larger off two inlets in the south coast, was formerly used as a harbour.|$|E
25|$|Nathan Nunn and Diego Puga {{note that}} though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, {{prevents}} travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage. The authors used a terrain <b>ruggedness</b> index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for {{variables such as}} diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, <b>ruggedness</b> is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.|$|E
25|$|The first P-35s were {{delivered}} to the 1st Pursuit Group (27th, 71st and 94th PS) stationed at Selfridge Field in Michigan. The aircraft utilized a wet wing to save weight and ground personnel quickly learned about the persistent fuel leaks. The P-35's performance was poor even by contemporary standards and, although USAAC aviators appreciated the aircraft's <b>ruggedness,</b> it was already obsolete by the time deliveries were finished in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The D-17B weighed {{approximately}} , contained 1,521 transistors, 6,282 diodes, 1,116 capacitors, and 504 resistors. These {{components were}} mounted on double copper-clad, engraved, gold-plated, glass fiber laminate circuit boards. There were 75 of these circuit boards {{and each one}} was coated with a flexible polyurethane compound for moisture and vibration protection. The high degree of reliability and <b>ruggedness</b> of the computer were driven by the strict requirements of the weapons system.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{mobility}} {{is enhanced}} by fins and optionally diver propulsion vehicles. Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and manoeuvring thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide fine control. Several types of fin are available, {{some of which may}} be more suited for maneuvering, alternative kick styles, speed, endurance, reduced effort or <b>ruggedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|France, Luxembourg, {{and most}} of the Eastern Bloc along with their {{overseas}} territories opted for SECAM. SECAM was a popular choice in countries with a lot of hilly terrain, and technologically backward countries with a very large installed base of monochrome equipment, since the greater <b>ruggedness</b> of the SECAM signal could cope much better with poorly maintained equipment. However, for many countries the decision was more down to politics than technical merit.|$|E
25|$|It has {{its origins}} in early NDPs as various mass display items put up by {{community}} groups or schools to add colour to the otherwise military parade. These items revolved around the themes of racial harmony, <b>ruggedness</b> among youths etc., which are represented by ethnic dances and mass gymnastics displays. This section evolved {{over the years to}} become more theatrical, from the massive flashcard displays that complemented the parade in the 1980s to multimedia projections in recent Shows.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1560 the {{population}} of the city had tripled to 2,200, with most people employed in mining in some way. Because of this rapid growth and the <b>ruggedness</b> of the terrain, it was impossible to lay out an orderly set of streets. The first main plaza was placed next to the Asunción Parish, which is now the Garden of the Constitution. Next to the “Cajas Reales” (Royal Safe) was constructed to guard the fifth that belonged to the king.|$|E
25|$|The grass {{landing field}} at Hapupu, at the {{northern}} end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the <b>ruggedness</b> to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve (one of only two in New Zealand) where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).|$|E
25|$|More than 80% of {{the land}} surface is rough, broken, and mountainous, and {{therefore}} is of limited agricultural value (see Agriculture, ch. 3). The terrain's <b>ruggedness</b> is accentuated {{in the eastern part}} of the country, where the two mountain ranges converge into a lofty region with a median elevation of more than 1,500 meters, which reaches its highest point along the borders with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. Turkey's highest peak, Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı) — 5,137 meters high — is situated near the point where the boundaries of the four countries meet.|$|E
25|$|With these {{limitations}} in mind, fitness landscapes {{can still be}} an instructive {{way of thinking about}} evolution. It is fundamentally possible to measure (even if not to visualise) some of the parameters of landscape <b>ruggedness</b> and of peak number, height, separation, and clustering. Simplified 3D landscapes can then be used relative to each other to visually represent the relevant features. Additionally, fitness landscapes of small subsets of evolutionary pathways may be experimentally constructed and visualized, potentially revealing features such as fitness peaks and valleys. Fitness landscapes of evolutionary pathways indicate the probable evolutionary steps and endpoints among sets of individual mutations.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Pilatus Aircraft {{had brought}} to market the Pilatus PC-12, a {{single-engine}} turboprop-powered business aircraft. As the PC-12 quickly {{proved to be a}} commercial success, Pilatus sought to follow up with a complementary aircraft and began gathering feedback from customers of the type. In response to this request, several customers reportedly expressed a desire for an aircraft that would possess both a greater range and top speed than the existing PC-12, while retaining the type's overall <b>ruggedness</b> and ability to make use of very short runways. Based on this feedback, Pilatus elected to pursue development of such an aircraft. In 2007, Pilatus initiated work on the program. Development of the aircraft was conducted using existing company funds.|$|E
25|$|In America {{the firm}} {{soil of the}} Plains allowed direct pulling with steam tractors, such as the big Case, Reeves or Sawyer-Massey {{breaking}} engines. Gang ploughs of up to fourteen bottoms were used. Often these big ploughs were used in regiments of engines, so that in a single field there might be ten steam tractors each drawing a plough. In this way hundreds of acres could be turned over in a day. Only steam engines {{had the power to}} draw the big units. When internal combustion engines appeared, they had neither the strength nor the <b>ruggedness</b> compared to the big steam tractors. Only by reducing the number of shares could the work be completed.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} K {{controls}} {{the degree of}} epistasis in the NK model, or how much other loci affect the fitness contribution of a given locus. With K = 0, the fitness of a given string is a simple sum of individual contributions of loci: for nontrivial fitness functions, a global optimum is present and easy to locate (the genome of all 0s if f(0) > f(1), or all 1s if f(1) > f(0)). For nonzero K, the fitness of a string is a sum of fitnesses of substrings, which may interact to frustrate the system (consider how to achieve optimal fitness in the example above). Increasing K thus increases the <b>ruggedness</b> of the fitness landscape.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{developed}} successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell {{fighters and}} scored {{a surprising number}} of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and <b>ruggedness</b> contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft were used in the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa IJAAS fighter off the coast of North Korea.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of <b>ruggedness,</b> and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal level cable, which has a female connector {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in male connector as an input connector for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|E
25|$|Hudson River School {{paintings}} {{reflect the}} themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the 19th century. The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley {{just as it was}} coming to be appreciated for its qualities of <b>ruggedness</b> and sublimity. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature {{in the form of the}} American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School, while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.|$|E
25|$|Although bark {{paper was}} banned, {{it did not}} {{completely}} disappear. In the early colonial period, there was a shortage of European paper, which made it necessary to use the indigenous version on occasion. During the evangelization process, amate, along with a paste made from corn canes was appropriated by missionaries to create Christian images, mostly in the 16th and 17th century. In addition, among the indigenous, paper continued to be made clandestinely for ritual purposes. In 1569, friar Diego de Mendoza observed several indigenous carrying offerings of paper, copal and woven mats to the lakes inside the Nevado de Toluca volcano as offerings. The most successful at keeping paper making traditions alive were certain indigenous groups living in the La Huasteca, Ixhuatlán and Chicontepec {{in the north of}} Veracruz and some villages in Hidalgo. The only records of bark paper making after the early 1800s refer to these areas. Most of these areas are dominated by the Otomi and the area's <b>ruggedness</b> and isolation from central Spanish authority allowed small villages to keep small quantities of paper in production. In fact, this clandestine nature helped it to survive as a way to defy Spanish culture and reaffirm identity.|$|E
25|$|The Hurricane was {{a steady}} gun platform, and had {{demonstrated}} its <b>ruggedness</b> as several were badly damaged yet returned to base. But the Hurricane's construction made it dangerous if it caught fire; the wood frames and fabric covering {{of the rear}} fuselage allowed fire to spread through the rear fuselage structure easily. In addition, the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat {{right in front of}} the instrument panel, without any form of protection for the pilot. Many Hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel. This became of such concern to Hugh Dowding that he had Hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the Hurricanes with a self-expanding rubber coating called Linatex. If the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet, the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it. Some Hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings, although they were protected with a layer of Linatex, were vulnerable from behind, and it was thought that these, not the fuselage tank, were the main fire risk.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Sierra Gorda, {{economic}} development has lagged behind other parts of Querétaro and Mexico, in part to the end of mining in neighboring municipalities and in part to the <b>ruggedness</b> of the region's terrain. From the last decades of the 20th century to the present, the economic marginalization of the area has given the municipality one of the highest rates of emigration. Most migrants go to the United States, and the money they send back has now become the major income for Landa and {{the rest of}} the Sierra Gorda. However, the migration is dangerous. In March and April 2010, seventeen residents of the municipality disappeared while en route to the United States. Most are believed to have been kidnapped by armed men while their bus was in the state of Tamaulipas, taken to work in fields growing drugs. As of March 2011, the men have yet to be found, although four men were arrested in connection with the incident, for threatening the families of the victims. The incident has provoked the municipal government to advise residents not to go the United States, especially not through routes controlled by drug traffickers.|$|E
500|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{battlefield}} was nothing that Xerxes and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure <b>ruggedness</b> of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching [...] high. With the sea {{on one side and}} steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.|$|E
500|$|The {{head has}} a {{straight}} profile, broad forehead, large eyes and small ears. The chest is deep and wide and the croup long and level. The feet and legs are clean and heavily muscled. The overall {{impression of the}} Percheron is one of power and <b>ruggedness.</b> Enthusiasts describe the temperament as proud and alert, {{and members of the}} breed are considered intelligent, willing workers with good dispositions. They are considered easy keepers and adapt well to many conditions and climates. In the 19th century, they were known to travel up to [...] a day at a trot. Horses in the French registry are branded on the neck with the intertwined letters [...] "SP", the initials of the Société Hippique Percheronne.|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{marriage}} to David {{is central to}} her character. Finch explained that it took Ruth a while {{to see that there}} were good qualities in David, as his initial behaviour towards her was unpleasant. Finch called David [...] "a sexist pig" [...] and said he resented Ruth's presence almost immediately. However, Ruth had noticed his <b>ruggedness</b> and she was attracted to the way he helped the sickly animals. After David noticed his brother flirting with Ruth, he realised that he loved her and told her about his feelings. Despite getting off to a bad start, Ruth and David began dating and were married towards the end of 1988. Finch thought Ruth and David had [...] "a really believable partnership" [...] and were well-suited, saying [...] "They are both very capable of becoming highly emotional if something riles them but thankfully they tend to react to different things. So, often one will be able to calm, soothe and support the other through most crises. Or at least provide some kind of balance to a problem." [...] The actress added that Ruth and David are the best of friends.|$|E
500|$|Krueger {{reported}} that [...] "Michaelmas Task Force {{tried hard to}} block these escape routes. But the torrential rain, the <b>ruggedness</b> of the country with its impenetrable rain forests and jungles and impassable rivers, and the resistance of enemy troops pushed forward from Madang to guard the trails leading eastward, made this effort fall short of success". Australian commanders were critical. In a letter to Blamey, Berryman, who had visited Krueger {{in an attempt to}} ensure that the Japanese would not escape, wrote that [...] "about 8,000 semi-starved, ill-equipped and dispirited Japanese bypassed Saidor. It was disappointing that the fruits of victory were not fully reaped, and that once again the remnants of the 51st Division escaped our clutches." [...] Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead of New Guinea Force reported to Blamey that Michaelmas Task Force appeared not to have made [...] "any appreciable effort" [...] to cut off the retreating Japanese. Sadly for the men of the 32nd Infantry Division, many of these Japanese would later have to be fought again under less advantageous circumstances in the Battle of Driniumor River. Krueger officially terminated Operation Dexterity, of which Michaelmas was a part, on 10 February 1944. All that remained now was the final act of the Huon Peninsula campaign: the capture of Madang.|$|E
500|$|Sports {{promoter}} Harry Glickman {{sought a}} National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise for Portland {{as far back}} as 1955 when he proposed two new expansion teams, the other to be located in Los Angeles. When the Memorial Coliseum was opened in 1960 Glickman saw the potential it could serve as a professional basketball venue {{but it was not until}} February 6, 1970, that the NBA board of governors granted him the rights to a franchise in Portland. To raise the money for the $3.7 million admission tax, Glickman associated himself to real estate magnates Robert Schmertz of New Jersey, Larry Weinberg of Los Angeles and Herman Sarkowsky of Seattle. Two weeks later, on February 24, team management held a contest to select the team's name and received more than 10,000 entries. The most popular choice was [...] "Pioneers", but that name was excluded from consideration as it was already used by sports teams at Portland's Lewis & Clark College. The name [...] "Trail Blazers" [...] received 172 entries, and was ultimately selected by the judging panel, being revealed on March 13 in the halftime of a SuperSonics game at the Memorial Coliseum. Derived from the trail blazing activity by explorers making paths through forests, Glickman considered it a name that could [...] "reflect both the <b>ruggedness</b> of the Pacific Northwest and the start of a major league era in our state." [...] Despite initial mixed response, the Trail Blazers name, often shortened to just [...] "Blazers", became popular in Oregon.|$|E
500|$|Connery's {{interpretation}} of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as [...] "a complete sensualist—senses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict". Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No, Connery's {{interpretation of}} the character, although not complete, showed the actor [...] "should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero {{in the manner of}} an American leading man". In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave [...] "a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery [...] "personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that [...] "Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a [...] "spare, pared-down character... inner bleakness along with the style". Connery played Bond with [...] "the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance... against which all others are judged". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery [...] "embodies a <b>ruggedness</b> and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains [...] "an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that [...] "Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over—he was rough, tough, mean and witty... he was a bloody good 007". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that [...] "in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture".|$|E
2500|$|Chapter I, [...] "Something Hidden; Go and Find It," [...] {{discusses}} the remoteness and <b>ruggedness</b> of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, {{the lack of}} realistic literature regarding its inhabitants, and gives {{a brief history of}} the region.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Allied {{fighters were}} {{designed}} with <b>ruggedness</b> and pilot protection in mind. The Japanese ace Saburō Sakai described how the toughness of early Grumman aircraft {{was a factor}} in preventing the Zero from attaining total domination: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mount Tom Range rises steeply between [...] {{above the}} Connecticut River Valley below; it is roughly 4.5 miles (7km) long by 1.5 miles (2.4km) wide at its widest point, {{although}} the <b>ruggedness</b> {{of the terrain}} makes the actual area much larger.|$|E
2500|$|The Beaver {{has proven}} {{very popular in}} service, both with flight schools and private owners, due to its <b>ruggedness</b> and {{pleasant}} handling characteristics. ASAP owner Brent Holomis says that [...] "The RX-550 is often used as a trainer because it's so easy to fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Bosley Crowther {{called it}} [...] "the best mystery thriller of the year", saying [...] "young Mr. Huston gives promise of {{becoming}} one of the smartest directors in the field"; according to Crowther, [...] "the trick which Mr. Huston has pulled is a combination of American <b>ruggedness</b> with the suavity of the English crime school—a blend of mind and muscle—plus a slight touch of pathos." ...|$|E
