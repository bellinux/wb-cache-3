5|$|Meanwhile, Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon) discovers a {{communication}} burst {{coming from the}} North Sea, believing a Russian submarine is entering British waters unannounced {{to carry out a}} mission. After learning that Alexander Beletsky (Georg Nikoloff), a man with connections to Kachimov, is going to shut down his company's servers, Malcolm confirms his suspicions; the <b>Russians</b> <b>are</b> planning a cyber attack against Britain by breaking into a submarine communications cable and shutting down every computer system in the country. Harry urges Dolby to temporarily shut down the Internet, but is once again denied. Later, Ros breaks into Lucas' flat while he is away, and discovers Lucas is a double agent, feeding the Russians news that MI5 know about their planned attack. Ros tasers Lucas and brings him back to Thames House. Lucas admits he is spying for the Russians because Kachimov promised he would be released from prison sooner if he would, but also reveals he intends to bring Kachimov down by making him trust Lucas.|$|E

25|$|While a {{large portion}} of urban Russians grow some {{vegetables}} in their dacha gardens, the perception in some parts of society that urban <b>Russians</b> <b>are</b> becoming increasingly self-sufficient is a myth, and only some 15 percent of vegetables are grown by urban dwellers.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its wide}} distribution, the <b>Russian</b> {{language}} <b>is</b> homogeneous throughout the country. <b>Russian</b> <b>is</b> the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, {{as well as}} the most widely spoken Slavic language.

25|$|Prior to the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, Angren had a significant Russian population. The population of the city declined in the 1990s because of poor living conditions, unemployment, and mass emigration. In 2005, Angren had a population of 130,000. Uzbeks, Tajiks and <b>Russians</b> <b>are</b> the largest ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{the surveys}} {{indicate}} that <b>Russians</b> <b>are</b> not socially distanced in Ukraine. The {{indicator of the}} willingness of Ukraine's residents to participate in social contacts of varying degrees of closeness with different ethnic groups (the Bogardus Social Distance Scale) calculated based on the yearly sociological surveys has been consistently showing that <b>Russians</b> <b>are,</b> on the average, least socially distanced within Ukraine except the Ukrainians themselves. The same survey has shown that, in fact, that Ukrainian people are slightly more comfortable accepting Russians into their families than they are accepting Ukrainians living abroad. Such social attitude correlates with the political one as the surveys taken yearly between 1997 and 2005 consistently indicated that the attitude {{to the idea of}} Ukraine joining the union of Russia and Belarus is more positive (slightly over 50%) than negative (slightly under 30%).|$|E
50|$|Under the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, which President George H. W.

25|$|Central to {{the opera}} {{is the way the}} <b>Russians</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished}} from the Polovtsians through melodic characterization. While Borodin uses features of Russian folk music to represent his compatriots, he uses chromaticism, melismas and appoggiaturas—among other techniques—represent their 'heathen' opponents. These methods had already been used by Glinka and others to portray Orientalism in Russian music.|$|E
25|$|The Cossacks, {{even more}} than other <b>Russians,</b> <b>are</b> highly {{antagonistic}} towards Circassian nationalism, as it is towards their aims, which include the revival of traditional Cossack paramilitary forces, already underway in Russia (see Cossacks and related pages).
