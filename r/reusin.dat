We also present the strategy we have followed for almost twenty years to develop those appli-cations as the top of an integrated environ-ment of language resources, language foundations, language tools and other ap-plications. When we have faced a difficult task such as Machine Translation to Basque, our strategy has worked well. We have had good results in a short time just reusing previous works for Basque, <b>reusin...</b>|$|E

Please do not cite or quote without permission of the authors. October 2004 DRAFT-CONFIDENTIAL Page 2 In this paper we provide a rationale and approach for articulating a conceptual framework and corresponding development resources to guide the design of science inquiry assessments. Important here is attention to how and why research on cognition and learning, advances in technological capability, and development of sophisticated methods and techniques in measurement can and should be put to use in designing maximally informative assessments. To ensure quality and continuity in the design process the framework advocates an evidence-centered approach in which the components of assessment design (i. e., substantive arguments, design elements, and operational procedures) are described and their relationships elaborated. Further, assessment-design data structures expressed in terms of extensible object models (i. e., reusable parts) and supported by web-based tools, facilitate generating, exchanging, and <b>reusin...</b>|$|E

Environmental terminology and topics in this bookletare addressed without in-depth definition or discussion,under the assumption that students have been exposedto these topics already through a classroom environ-mental science unit. Some kinds of experiments requiremore time than others to yield results. Be sure to dis-cuss your intended time frame when helpingstudents decide on a project.
