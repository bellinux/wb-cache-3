5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced <b>rational</b> <b>expectations</b> to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while <b>rational</b> <b>expectations</b> modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of <b>rational</b> <b>expectations,</b> models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied <b>rational</b> <b>expectations</b> to {{models with}} Phillips curve {{trade-offs}} between inflation and output {{and found that}} monetary policy {{could not be used}} to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied <b>rational</b> <b>expectations</b> to Friedman's {{permanent}} income {{hypothesis that}} people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming <b>rational</b> <b>expectations,</b> such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E

5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under <b>rational</b> <b>expectations.</b> Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with <b>rational</b> <b>expectations.</b> Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted <b>rational</b> <b>expectations</b> and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E

5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form <b>rational</b> <b>expectations,</b> undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} many serious defects {{existing in}} traditional aggregate demand/aggregate supply paradigm based on IS-LM model. Those defects cause {{the situation that}} IS-LM model de-clines gradually, {{but it is still}} not dead, and continuously revives through modification. This paper distinguishes from rounds of modification on traditional aggregate demand/aggregate supply pa-radigm. The first round of modification was just introducing the dynamic ad hoc IS-LM model of <b>rational</b> <b>expectation</b> which started from the end of 1970 s and the beginning of 1980 s. Because the micro-foundation problems are not solved and the <b>rational</b> <b>expectation</b> carries out extreme judg-ment on monetary neutrality and ineffectiveness of macroeconomic policy, the first modification fails to realize big success. The second round of modification is just happening; through introduc-ing <b>rational</b> <b>expectation</b> and New Phillips Curve (NPC), the powerful improvement has been made in micro-foundation, dynamic form, and monetary policy rules, and the model is called IS-LM/ MP-NPC model.
