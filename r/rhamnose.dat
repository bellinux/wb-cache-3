25|$|Another gene {{necessary}} for synthesis of di-rhamnolipids, rhlC, {{has also been}} identified. RhlC catalyses {{the addition of the}} second <b>rhamnose</b> moiety to mono-rhamnolipids forming di-rhamnolipids, hence is often labelled rhamnosyltransferase 2. Like rhlA and rhlB, rhlC is thought to be an ancestral gene controlled by the same quorum sensing system as rhlA and rhlB. The <b>rhamnose</b> moiety for mono- and di-rhamnolipids is derived from AlgC activity and the RmlABCD pathway, encoded on the rmlBCAD operon. AlgC produces sugar precursors directly for alginate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as rhamnolipids. In <b>rhamnose</b> synthesis, AlgC produces glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) which is converted to dTDP-D-glucose by RmlA followed by conversion to dTDP-6-deoxy-D-4-hexulose and then dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose by RmlB and RmlC respectively. Finally, dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose is converted to dTDP-L-rhamnose by RmlD. The <b>rhamnose</b> can then be used in the synthesis of rhamnolipids by RhlB and RhlC.|$|E
25|$|Pelargonidin-3-glucoside is {{the major}} {{anthocyanin}} in strawberries and cyanidin-3-glucoside is found in smaller proportions. Although glucose {{seems to be the}} most common substituting sugar in strawberry anthocyanins, rutinose, arabinose, and <b>rhamnose</b> conjugates have been found in some strawberry cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Specifically {{there are}} two main classes of rhamnolipids: mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids, which consist of one or two <b>rhamnose</b> groups respectively. Rhamnolipids are also {{heterogeneous}} in the length and degree of branching of the HAA moiety, which varies with the growth media used and the environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Rhamnolipids are a {{class of}} {{glycolipid}} produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, amongst other organisms, frequently cited as the best characterised of the bacterial surfactants. They have a glycosyl head group, {{in this case a}} <b>rhamnose</b> moiety, and a 3-(hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acid (HAA) fatty acid tail, such as 3-hydroxydecanoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Surfactants are {{in demand}} {{for a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications as they increase solubility, foaming capacity and lower surface tensions. In particular, rhamnolipids have been used broadly in the cosmetic industry for products such as moisturisers, condom lubricant and shampoo. Rhamnolipids are efficacious in bioremediation of organic and heavy metal polluted sites. They also facilitate degradation of waste hydrocarbons such as crude oil and vegetable oil by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rhamnolipid surfactant itself is valuable in the cosmetic industry, and rhamnolipids are a source of <b>rhamnose,</b> which is an expensive sugar in itself.|$|E
25|$|Pectins, {{also known}} as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several {{distinct}} polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterized {{by the presence of}} saccharide appendant residues (such as D-xylose or D-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the <b>rhamnose</b> residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.|$|E
25|$|The first genes {{discovered}} in a mutagenesis screen for mutants unable to produce rhamnolipids were rhlA and rhlB. They are arranged in an operon, adjacent to rhlRI, a master regulator of quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proteins encoded by rhlA and rhlB; RhlA and RhlB respectively, are expected to form a complex because of the operonic nature of the genes which encode these two proteins and because both proteins are necessary for production of rhamnolipids. Furthermore, it was supposed {{that the role of}} RhlA was to stabilise RhlB in the cell membrane and thus the RhlAB complex was labelled as the enzyme Rhamnosyltransferase 1 and is frequently cited as such although there is no biochemical evidence for this and RhlA {{has been shown to be}} monomeric in solution. RhlA was subsequently shown to be involved in the production of the precursor to RHLs, HAAs. RhlB adds a <b>rhamnose</b> group to the HAA precursor to form mono-rhamnolipid. Therefore, the products of the rhlAB operon; RhlA and RhlB, catalyse the formation of HAAs and mono-rhamnolipids respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Experimental {{fields of}} Salicornia have been planted in Ras al-Zawr (Saudi Arabia), Eritrea (northeast Africa) and Sonora (northwest Mexico) {{aimed at the}} {{production}} of biodiesel. The company responsible for the Sonora trials (...) claims [...] between 225 and 250 gallons of BQ-9000 biodiesel can be produced per hectare (approximately 2.5 acres) of salicornia, and is promoting a $35 million scheme to create a [...] salicornia farm in Bahia de Kino. Stems and roots of Salicornia brachiata plants had high cellulose contents (ca. 30%), whereas tender stem tips contents low cellulose content (9.2%). Salicornia brachiata revealed the dominance of <b>rhamnose,</b> arabinose, mannose, galactose, and glucose, with meager presence of ribose and xylose in their structural polysaccharide.|$|E

50|$|PVM BMCs in Planctomyces limnophilus are {{induced by}} the {{presence}} of fucose or <b>rhamnose</b> under aerobic conditions, but not by glucose.

50|$|<b>Rhamnose</b> (Rha, Rham) is a {{naturally}} occurring deoxy sugar.

50|$|Naringin {{belongs to}} the {{flavonoid}} family. Flavonoids consist of 15 carbon atoms in 3 rings, 2 of which must be benzene rings connected by a 3 carbon chain. Naringin contains the basic flavonoid structure along with two <b>rhamnose</b> units attached to its aglycone portion, called naringenin, at the 7-carbon position. The steric hindrance provided by the two <b>rhamnose</b> units makes naringin less potent than its aglycone counterpart, naringenin.|$|E
