40|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>reduction</b> {{method is}} a {{dimension}} reduction method for weakly driven limit-cycle oscillators, which has {{played an important}} role in the theoretical analysis of synchro- nization phenomena. Recently, we proposed a generalization of the <b>phase</b> <b>reduction</b> method [W. Kurebayashi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 2013]. This generalized <b>phase</b> <b>reduction</b> method can robustly predict the dynamics of strongly driven oscillators, for which the conventional <b>phase</b> <b>reduction</b> method fails. In this generalized method, the external input to the oscillator should be properly decomposed into a slowly varying component and remaining weak fluctua- tions. In this paper, we propose a simple criterion for timescale decomposition of the external input, which gives accurate prediction of the phase dynamics and enables us to systematically apply the generalized <b>phase</b> <b>reduction</b> method to a general class of limit-cycle oscillators. The validity of the criterion is confirmed by numerical simulations. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

Villa et al. (2009:458) conclude that: Blombos was a workshop in the sense that the making of points was a primary - though not exclusive - activity at the site. [...] The manufacture sequence of Still Bay points has been divided into four main production phases. While hard hammer and direct percussion was used in the initial <b>reduction</b> <b>phase</b> (phase 1), followed by soft hammer and marginal percussion (phase 2), pressure flaking was only used during the final retouch phase (3), and a few points were also reworked by hard hammer percussion (phase 4) ( [...] ).

Experimental replication by Mourre et al. 2010 and microscopic study of Still Bay points from Blombos Cave indicates that some silcrete blanks were deliberately heat-treated, before pressure flaking was employed in the final reduction sequence; and thus improving the silcrete’s flaking quality.|$|E

The fact that the reduction in Vt in the third phase was accompanied by a significant decrease in Vdphys and ΔPaw (with a significant increase in compliance) suggests that some degree of overdistension might be present at baseline.|$|R

The continued operations of an organisation depend on management awareness and preparation of potential disasters, their ability to develop a plan to minimise disruptions of critical functions and the capability to recover operations expediently and successfully. However, disaster recovery has often been overlooked and sometimes even ignored. Building owners could have been excused for thinking 'it won't happen here'. However, the series of recent tragic events such as terrorists‟ attacks, tsunami, floods, earthquakes etc have placed a greater emphasis on long-term disaster recovery planning, focusing on creating more resilient communities and structures through capacity building, better disaster preparedness and improvements in coordination to protect their staff, customers and properties, and business. As a key person in an organisation and in-charge of all property management functions, Facilities Managers are often charged with the responsibility of recovering the supporting services that will enable the business to start functioning again.

40|$|New and {{efficient}} BIST methodology and BIST hardware insertion algorithms are presented for RTL data paths obtained from high level synthesis. The methodology {{is based on}} concurrent testing of modules with identical physical information by sharing the test pattern generators in a partial intrusion BIST enviroment. Furthermore, {{to reduce the number}} of signature analysis registers and test application time the same type modules are grouped in test compatibility calsses and n-input k-bit comparators are used to check the results. The test application time is computed using an incremental test scheduling approach. An existing test scheduling algorithm is modified to obtain an efficient trade-off between the algorithm complexity and testable design space exploration. A cost function based on both test application time and area overhead is defined and a tabu search-based heuristic capable of exploring the solution space in a very rapid time is presented. To reduce the computational time testable design space exploration is carried out in 2 phases: test application time <b>reduction</b> <b>phase</b> and BIST area <b>reduction</b> <b>phase.</b> Experimental results are included confirming the efficiency of the proposed methodology...|$|E
