40|$|In Niger Republic, the {{regional}} development of irrigation {{along the river}} Niger is confronted with a large extent of alkali soils. For a sound management of the irrigated area, it appears necessary to understand the present evolution of these alkali soils. The study {{of one of these}} areas, located on the Liptako bedrock, reveals a concentric soil distribution : within a zone of brown soil with abrupt textural change and alkaline in depth (stagnic Solonetz), appears a ring of <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> (cambic Calcisol), around zones of alkali soils (Solonetz). These alkali soils are not saline but their soil solution is more concentrated than in <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soils.</b> The abrupt boundary between the <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> and the alkali soils is related with morphological and geochemical changes, resulting from calcite and fluorite precipitation in the soil solution. The detailed study of this contact demonstrates the current transformation of alkali <b>soils</b> into <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soils.</b> Therefore, it appears that soil alkalization is no longer in process on the terraces of the river Niger. The formation of <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> and alkali soils may be explained by the juxtaposition of two contrasted hydrological regimes in a former pond. This hypothesis is supported by aerial pictures and microscopic observations.

40|$|International audienceSoil {{alkalinisation}} generally {{constitutes a}} major threat to irrigated agriculture in the semi-arid regions of West Africa. The improvement of sodic soils is generally difficult and expensive. However, a recent study in the Niger valley in NIGER, reveals that a natural de-alkalinisation is possible under natural conditions in a semi-arid climate. Transformation of non-saline sodic <b>soil</b> into <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> type was recorded. On the same site, the cultivation of a Sahelian fodder grass, locally known as “Burgu” was used on the sodic soil/brown <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> transition zone to accelerate this natural de-alkalinisation and characterise its mechanisms. The geochemical properties of both soil types were monitored before cultivation and one year after continuous crop cultivation. After cultivation and regular irrigation, the chemical properties of the former sodic soils were close to those of the surrounding <b>brown</b> <b>steppe</b> <b>soils,</b> which are better suited for agriculture. This modification of the sodic soil properties can be attributed to (i) the large amount of water supplied during cultivation that induced salt leaching. This is the main phenomenon responsible for the changes observed; (ii) the root activity that modified the acid-base equilibrium and consumes alkalinity. The Residual Alkalinity (RA) concept was used to select chemical tracers of the concentration/dilution of the soil solution. Here, sodium amount and calcite + fluorite residual alkalinity (RAcalcite+fluorite) were the most adequate ones. These two tracers decreased proportionally under the influence of leaching, but the exchanges between cations and protons changed the RAcalcite+fluorite, without modifying the sodium amount. Their combined use allowed us to separate and quantify the uptake of the plant from the leaching in the de-alkalinisation process. This study highlighted that reclamation of this type of sodic soils is feasible. The use of the RA concept is advisable to design a sustainable management system for irrigated sodic or saline soils...|$|R
