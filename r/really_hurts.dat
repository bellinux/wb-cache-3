And it <b>really</b> <b>hurts</b> when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus {{wrote the}} song in a short span of time {{concerning}} a fictional breakup with a girlfriend. Hoppus described a scenario, detailed in the lyrics, where former lovers meet in public and one is with someone new. [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>hurts</b> when you aren't the person feeling the love, {{but you have to}} act like it's cool to save face," [...] he said in 1998. He felt the song's creation, which was spontaneous, worked to its favor: [...] "If you work on a song for weeks and weeks, you're forcing it." [...] The signature guitar line for [...] "Dammit" [...] was created on an acoustic guitar that was missing two strings. Guitarist Tom DeLonge considered the song a breakthrough in the band's songwriting.|$|E

Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate and he did not like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which <b>really</b> <b>hurts</b> Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E

60|$|April 1.--All Fools' day, {{the only}} Saint that keeps up {{some degree of}} credit in the world; for fools we are with a vengeance. On this memorable festival we played the fool with great decorum at Colonel Ferguson's, going to visit them in a cold morning. In the evening I had a {{distressing}} letter from Mrs. MacBarnet, or some such name, the daughter of Captain Macpherson, smothered in a great snow storm. They are very angry at the Review for telling a raw-head and bloody bones story about him. I have given the right version of the tale willingly, {{but this does not}} satisfy. I almost wish they would turn out a clansman to be free of the cumber. The vexation of having to do with ladies, who on such a point must be unreasonable, is very great. With a man it would be soon ended or mended. It <b>really</b> <b>hurts</b> my sleep.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, sir, it is {{the same}} thing with me. I do dare to say forgery when it is true, and don't dare to say forgery when it is false. Now I will say here to this {{audience}} and to Judge Douglas I have not dared to say he committed a forgery, and I never shall until I know it; but I did dare to say--just to suggest to the Judge--that a forgery had been committed, which by his own showing had been traced to him and two of his friends. I dared to suggest to him that he had expressly promised in one of his public speeches to investigate that matter, and I dared to suggest to him that there was an implied promise that when he investigated it he would make known the result. I dared to suggest to the Judge that he could not expect to be quite clear of suspicion of that fraud, for since the time that promise was made he had been with those friends, and had not kept his promise in regard to the investigation and the report upon it. I am not a very daring man, but I dared that much, Judge, and I am not much scared about it yet. When the Judge says he would n't have believed of Abraham Lincoln that he would have made such an attempt as that he reminds me {{of the fact that he}} entered upon this canvass with the purpose to treat me courteously; that touched me somewhat. It sets me to thinking. I was aware, when it was first agreed that Judge Douglas and I were to have these seven joint discussions, that they were the successive acts of a drama, perhaps I should say, to be enacted, not merely in the face of audiences like this, but in the face of the nation, and to some extent, by my relation to him, and not from anything in myself, in the face of the world; and I am anxious that they should be conducted with dignity and in the good temper which would be befitting the vast audiences before which it was conducted. But when Judge Douglas got home from Washington and made his first speech in Chicago, the evening afterward I made some sort of a reply to it. His second speech was made at Bloomington, in which he commented upon my speech at Chicago and said that I had used language ingeniously contrived to conceal my intentions, or words to that effect. Now, I understand that this is an imputation upon my veracity and my candor. I do not know what the Judge understood by it, but in our first discussion, at Ottawa, he led off by charging a bargain, somewhat corrupt in its character, upon Trumbull and myself,--that we had entered into a bargain, one of the terms of which was that Trumbull was to Abolitionize the old Democratic party, and I (Lincoln) was to Abolitionize the old Whig party; I pretending to be as good an old-line Whig as ever. Judge Douglas may not understand that he implicated my truthfulness and my honor when he said I was doing one thing and pretending another; and I misunderstood him if he thought he was treating me in a dignified way, as a man of honor and truth, as he now claims he was disposed to treat me. Even after that time, at Galesburgh, when he brings forward an extract from a speech made at Chicago and an extract from a speech made at Charleston, to prove that I was trying to play a double part, that I was trying to cheat the public, and get votes upon one set of principles at one place, and upon another set of principles at another place,--I do not understand but what he impeaches my honor, my veracity, and my candor; and because he does this, I do not understand that I am bound, if I see a truthful ground for it, to keep my hands off of him. As soon as I learned that Judge Douglas was disposed to treat me in this way, I signified in one of my speeches that I should be driven to draw upon whatever of humble resources I might have,--to adopt a new course with him. I was not entirely sure that I should be able to hold my own with him, but I at least had the purpose made to do as well as I could upon him; and now I say that I will not be the first to cry [...] "Hold." [...] I think it originated with the Judge, and when he quits, I probably will. But I shall not ask any favors at all. He asks me, or he asks the audience, if I wish to push this matter to the point of personal difficulty. I tell him, no. He did not make a mistake, in one of his early speeches, when he called me an [...] "amiable" [...] man, though perhaps he did when he called me an [...] "intelligent" [...] man. It <b>really</b> <b>hurts</b> me very much to suppose that I have wronged anybody on earth. I again tell him, no! I very much prefer, when this canvass shall be over, however it may result, that we at least part without any bitter recollections of personal difficulties.|$|E
