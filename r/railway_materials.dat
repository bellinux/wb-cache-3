500|$|Belgian firms {{initially}} copied and mass-produced British designs, {{but soon}} began specializing in <b>railway</b> <b>materials,</b> chemicals, weapons and raw materials. These items were all widely exported, making Belgium {{one of the}} foremost industrial powers in the world. One of the most successful exporters was Édouard Empain, nicknamed the [...] "Tramway King", whose company ran infrastructure projects across Europe, Asia and South America. Empain's projects included the Paris Métro system, completed in 1900, and the entire Egyptian suburb of Heliopolis, which was finished in 1905.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James Beatty, who {{had played}} an {{important}} part in working with Peto's partnership to build the European and North American Railway, was recruited as chief engineer. The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell, who had also worked on the European and North American Railway. Campbell's first task was to create a wharf at Balaclava where the <b>railway</b> <b>materials</b> could be unloaded, with a yard adjacent. He planned for the track to pass along the middle of the main street of the town. It then went through a gorge at the north of the town close to the water's edge and over swampy ground to the village of Kadikoi. From here, the railway had to rise some [...] {{to the top of the}} plateau. Of the routes available, Campbell chose to follow the existing road. Although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7, Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14. [...] A stationary engine would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline. Once on the plateau, the ground was rough but fairly level and here it presented fewer problems. Lord Raglan's headquarters were at the top of the col, and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here.|$|E
