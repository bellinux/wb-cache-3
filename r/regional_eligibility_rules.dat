It describes how SREC markets function [...] key policy design provisions, eligible technologies, state and <b>regional</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules,</b> solar alternative compliance payments, measurement and verification methods, long-term contracting provisions, and rate caps. It also examines the trends of SREC markets [...] trading volumes, sourcing trends, trends {{in the size of}} solar photovoltaic (PV) systems driven by these markets, and trends in price and compliance. Throughout, the paper explores key issues and challenges facing SREC markets and attempts by policymakers to address some of these market barriers. Data and information presented in this report are derived from SREC tracking systems, brokers and auctions, published reports, and information gleaned from market participants and interviews with state regulators responsible for SREC market implementation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the structure and}} consequences of <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules</b> for a major social program in the U. S. - the Job Training Partnership Act. We find that temporal and geographic variation in written <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules</b> has little consequence for the size and composition of the eligible population, but stable rules are important. The stable <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules</b> are inequitable because they discriminate {{on the basis of}} income sources and family status. We examine whether this inequity is a consequence of efficient screening, given standard objectives for government intervention in human capital markets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III needs an initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule.</b> Subjects were 14 athletic directors from two NCAA Division III athletic conferences. Data were analyzed and the results were reported in frequencies and percentages. The percentages were shown in the following areas: university and athletic director demographics; eligibility rules; and athletic directors experience and their opinion on an <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule.</b> The athletic directors showed favor towards an initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> by just a slight margin of 57 %, although the reasoning for supporting and disagreeing with it was varied. Previous research pertaining only to Division III had not been produced prior to this study. Suggestions include a push toward a Division III initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> but institutions still need freedom to admit students of all academic levels and those with learning disabilities. The research does not intend to speak for all Division III institutions, but simply to make athletic directors as well as the NCAA aware of the need for initial eligibility.
