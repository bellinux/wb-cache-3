5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over the central United States drifted east {{and added a}} westward component to Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The {{high pressure}} system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of <b>rain</b> <b>on</b> Florida, with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 27, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters. The system dissipated shortly after over open waters. Although the storm remained over {{water for the}} duration of its existence, the outer reaches of the system brought rain and light winds to Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of <b>rain</b> <b>on</b> August 25. Between August 26 and 27, Cape Hatteras received 2.06 in (52.3 mm) of rain from the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of <b>rain</b> <b>on</b> the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E

5|$|Ophelia moved {{extremely}} {{slowly in}} and around North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10inches (254mm) of <b>rain</b> <b>on</b> many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak Island, where 17.5inches (445mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7–12feet (2–4m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying inlets of Pamlico Sound. At the storm's peak, over 240,000 customers were without power in coastal North Carolina. One indirect fatality was reported due to a traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 world {{championship}} season opened with the Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham {{was affected by}} a cold, and qualified poorly before retiring when the BT19's gearbox failed. Surtees led the race in his Ferrari before his differential failed on lap 15; the race was won by Jackie Stewart in a 2-litre BRM P261. At the following Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit, Brabham survived an enormous 135miles per hour (215km/h) slide in the <b>rain</b> <b>on</b> the first lap. The shower eliminated half the field, including Stewart, who would miss the next race with his injuries. The BT19, using Goodyear tyres that were not suited to the conditions, came home fourth of five classified finishers. Surtees won the race for Ferrari, the last before he quit the Italian team.|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped 36.71inches (932mm) of <b>rain</b> <b>on</b> Dauphin Island, {{setting the}} new {{record for the}} most {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclone related rainfall {{in the state of}} Alabama, and is among the largest in the United States. The storm also became the earliest 5th tropical or subtropical storm of a season when it reached tropical storm strength on July 17.
