50|$|The peak-end rule is an {{elaboration}} on the snapshot {{model of}} remembered utility proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Daniel Kahneman. This model dictates that an event is not {{judged by the}} entirety of an experience, but by prototypical moments (or snapshots) {{as a result of}} the representativeness heuristic. The remembered value of snapshots dominates the actual value of an experience. Fredrickson and Kahneman theorized that these snapshots are actually the average of the most affectively intense moment of an experience and the feeling experienced at the end. The effects of the duration of an experience upon <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluation</b> are extremely slight. Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled this phenomenon duration neglect. The peak-end rule is applicable only when an experience has definite beginning and end periods.|$|E

The findings from this research suggest that a memory-based framework can provide a parsimonious, comprehensive explanation for <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations.</b> In addition to accounting for past findings such as a preference for improving over declining temporal sequences and the important role of peak (both high intensity and unique) experiences, we demonstrate that imposing a delay prior to <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> can create a preference reversal due to the reduced accessibility of final or common instances.

40|$|Events in a {{sequence}} may each be evaluated as good or bad. We propose that such good-bad evaluations evoke emotional responses that change current mood. A model of recurrent updating of current mood is developed and compared to a model of how {{a sequence}} of events evoking emotional responses is evaluated retrospectively. In Experiment 1, 149 undergraduates are presented sequences of lottery outcomes with a fixed probability of losing or winning different amounts of money. Ratings of current mood are made after the sequence. <b>Retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> are either made after the ratings of current mood or, in a control condition, when no ratings of current mood are made.

40|$|In the literature, {{the nature}} of the {{relationships}} between memory processes and summary evaluations is still a debate. According to some theoretical approaches (e. g., “two-memory hypothesis”; Anderson, 1989) <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> are based on the impression formed while attending to the to-beassessed stimuli (on-line judgment) – no functional dependence between information retrieval and judgment is implied. Conversely, several theories entail that judgment must depend, at least in part, on memory processes (e. g., Dougherty, Gettys, & Ogden, 1999; Schwarz, 1998; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). The present study contributes to this debate by addressing two important issues. First, it shows how more comprehensive memory measures than those used previously (e. g., Hastie & Park, 1986) are necessary in order to detect a relationship between memory and <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Secondly, it demonstrates how memory strategies influence the relationship between memory and judgment. Participants recalled lists of words, after having assessed each of them for their pleasantness. Results showed a clear association between memory and judgment, which was mediated by the individual strategies participants used to recall the items...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{tests the}} idea that retrospective voting in presidential elections is conditional, that <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> are applied more strictly to incumbents seeking election than to in-party candidates (successor candidates) who are not incumbents. Voters may assign only partial credit or blame for national conditions to successor candidates because, unlike incumbents, these candidates did not personally have power over the policies that might have affected the national conditions {{leading up to the}} election. This theory of conditional retrospective voting is examined at both the aggregate level on elections since 1948 and with individual-level survey data since 1972. The analysis consistently finds, as the theory of conditional retrospective voting contends, that the electorate’s <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> matter significantly more to the vote for an incumbent than to the vote for a successor candidate of the in-party. Democratic theorists often turn to theories of retrospective voting to explain how democracies can function effectively with electorates having modest levels of information and sophistication. 1 Unlike prospective voting, which requires the electorate to know, evaluate, and contras...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the relative strength of party identification, comparative candidate images and <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> as electoral determinants {{of the vote}} in Mexico. It seeks to disentangle the simultaneous influences among these variables, in particular, the cognitive process of projection of partisan predispositions on other political perceptions. To understand the mental process that derives in the vote decision, a structural equations model with latent variables was specified. Using cross-sectional surveys, the model was tested in two different moments of the 1999 Quintana Roo gubernatorial campaign, at the beginning and close to its end. This election resembles an electoral dynamic observed in the presidential elections of 1994 and 1988, as well as in half of the gubernatorial elections of the last six years. ^ By {{the end of the last}} century, economic crises and the liberalization of the electoral system derived in the PRI losing the absolute majority of the electoral preferences.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} concept of savoring and defines it as a state of mindfulness in which consumers appreciate the pleasure they get {{at the very moment}} from an outcome or experience. Whereas past research has focused on savoring the present or the past, limited research has studied consumers savoring an experience to be consumed in the future. Focusing on the temporal dimension of the future, this dissertation contributes to the literature by (1) theoretically differentiating savoring from related constructs, (2) identifying factors that impact the extent to which consumers savor the future, and (3) examining savoring's impact on consumers' immediate and <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the savored experience. It also (4) studies whether and how expectations about the valence of the future experience play a role in this process. Finally, this dissertation (5) examines whether savoring leads to more positive evaluations even when consumption experiences are worse than expected.; Four empirical studies find that the more consumers savor a future consumption experience the more positively they evaluate it and the more positively they remember it. The results also show that having time available to think about the future is a necessary but not sufficient condition for savoring to occur. Consumers must also use the available time to enjoy thinking about the future. Having sufficient time but using that time to merely "wait" for the experience will not induce savoring and its effects (Study 2). Consumers must also have sufficient information regarding the future experience (Study 3) in order to savor the future. Savoring the future not only enhances current and <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the savored experience, it also enhances expectations about the valence of the future experience (i. e., it will be better). Importantly though, savoring does not impact immediate and <b>retrospective</b> <b>evaluations</b> by affecting expectations themselves. Savoring is also found to positively affect evaluations even when the experience turns out to be not nearly as good and is thus negatively disconfirmed (Study 4). Combined, this research demonstrates that savoring has a significant and consistent effect on evaluations...|$|R
