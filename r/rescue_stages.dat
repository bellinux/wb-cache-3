40|$|AbstractIn {{evacuation}} {{models of}} buildings, neighborhoods, areas, cities and countries important psychological parameters are not frequently used. In this paper {{the relevance of}} some important variables from disaster psychology will be discussed. Modeling psychological variables will enhance prediction of human behavior during evacuations. John Leach’s Dynamic Disaster Model describes three phases and five stages: A Pre-impact phase (Threat Stage and Warning Stage), an Impact phase, and a Post-impact phase (Recoil <b>Stage,</b> <b>Rescue</b> <b>Stage</b> and Post-traumatic Stage). In each phase and stage specific human behavior has been {{supposed to be a}} psychological response to a disaster. These responses are remarkably consistent and transferable across kinds of disasters. Evacuation happens during Pre-impact phase, Impact phase and Post-impact phase (Recoil <b>Stage</b> and, or <b>Rescue</b> <b>Stage).</b> People’s cognitive and emotional states and overt behavior will be very different across the phases. During the Pre-impact phase risk estimation is very low, so evacuation is not seen as an inevitable action. Heavy stress and denial of life-threatening events during the Impact phase will hinder effective evacuation. Inactivity, apathy and childlike dependency on other people during the Recoil Stage will restrain survivors from active evacuation. Evacuation models will be more effective if phases and accompanying human behavior are taken into account...|$|R

The film showcases many aspects of human nature, both good and bad. The title, Argo, ostensibly refers to a bad science fiction fantasy film that provides the vehicle for the escape; it serves as an excellent metaphor. The mythological Jason, who sailed the Argo in his search for the Golden Fleece, was saved from infanticide at birth by his mother, Alcimedes, who smuggled him out of Thessaly by pretending he was stillborn, faking his burial, and entrusting him to be raised by a centaur in another kingdom.

40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{the leading}} cause of blindness in working-age adults. Early stage DR involves inflammation, vascular leakage, apoptosis of vascular cells and neurodegeneration. In this study, we hypothesized that cells derived from the stromal fraction of adipose tissue (ASC) could therapeutically <b>rescue</b> early <b>stage</b> DR features. Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic athymic nude rats received single intravitreal injection of human ASC into one eye and saline into the other eye. Two months post onset of diabetes, administration of ASC significantly improved "b" wave amplitude (as measured by electroretinogram) within 1 - 3 weeks of injection compared to saline treated diabetic eyes. Subsequently, retinal histopathological evaluation revealed a significant decrease in vascular leakage and apoptotic cells around the retinal vessels in the diabetic eyes that received ASC compared to the eyes that received saline injection. In addition, molecular analyses have shown down-regulation in inflammatory gene expression in diabetic retina that received ASC compared to eyes that received saline. Interestingly, ASC were found to be localized near retinal vessels at higher densities than seen in age matched non-diabetic retina that received ASC. In vitro, ASC displayed sustained proliferation and decreased apoptosis under hyperglycemic stress. In addition, ASC in co-culture with retinal endothelial cells enhance endothelial survival and collaborate to form vascular networks. Taken together, our findings suggest that ASC are able to rescue the neural retina from hyperglycemia-induced degeneration, resulting in importantly improved visual function. Our pre-clinical studies support the translational development of adipose stem cell-based therapy for DR to address both retinal capillary and neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|We {{isolated}} a Drosophila fickleP (ficP) mutant with a shortened copulatory {{duration and}} reduced adult-stage life span. The reduced copulatory duration is ascribable to incomplete fusion {{of the left}} and right halves of the apodeme that holds the penis during copulation. ficP is an intronic mutation occurring in the Btk gene, a gene which encodes two forms (type 1 and type 2) of a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) family cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase as a result of alternative exon usage. The ficP mutation prevents the formation of the type 2 isoform but leaves expression of the type 1 transcript intact. Ubiquitous overexpression of the wild-type cDNA by using a heat shock 70 promoter during the late larval or pupal <b>stages</b> <b>rescued</b> the life span and genital defects in the mutant, respectively, establishing the causal relationship between the ficP phenotypes and the Btk gene mutation.

40|$|Deregulation of host-microbiota {{interactions}} {{in the gut}} is a pivotal characteristic of Crohn's disease. It remains unclear, however, whether commensals and/or the dysbiotic microbiota associated with pathology in humans are causally involved in Crohn's pathogenesis. Here, we show that Crohn's-like ileitis in Tnf(ΔARE/+) mice is microbiota-dependent. Germ-free Tnf(ΔARE/+) mice are disease-free and the microbiota and its innate recognition through Myd 88 are indispensable for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) overexpression and disease initiation in this model. The epithelium of diseased mice shows no major defects in mucus barrier and paracellular permeability. However, Tnf(ΔARE/+) ileitis associates with the reduction of lysozyme-expressing Paneth cells, mediated by adaptive immune effectors. Furthermore, we show that established but not early ileitis in Tnf(ΔARE/+) mice involves defective expression of antimicrobials and dysbiosis, characterized by Firmicutes expansion, including epithelial-attaching segmented filamentous bacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes. Microbiota modulation by antibiotic treatment at an early disease <b>stage</b> <b>rescues</b> ileitis.

40|$|Oocyte meiotic {{progression}} and maternal-to-zygote transition {{are accompanied}} by dynamic epigenetic changes. The functional significance of these changes and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here we show that Setdb 1, a lysine methyltransferase, controls the global level of histone H 3 lysine 9 di-methyl (H 3 K 9 me 2) mark in growing oocytes. Conditional deletion of Setdb 1 in developing oocytes leads to meiotic arrest at the germinal vesicle and meiosis I stages, resulting in substantially fewer mature eggs. Embryos derived from these eggs exhibit severe defects in cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst <b>stage.</b> <b>Rescue</b> experiments by expressing wild-type or inactive Setdb 1 in Setdb 1 -deficient oocytes suggest that the catalytic activity of Setdb 1 is essential for meiotic progression and early embryogenesis. Mechanistically, up-regulation of Cdc 14 b, a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression, greatly contributes to the meiotic arrest phenotype. Setdb 1 deficiency also leads to derepression of transposons and increased DNA damage in oocytes, which likely also contribute to meiotic defects. Thus, Setdb 1 is a maternal-effect gene that controls meiotic progression and is essential for early embryogenesis. Our results uncover an important link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway governing meiotic progression...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that nucleoli of oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage (GV nucleoli) are not necessary for oocyte maturation but are essential for early embryonic development. Nucleoli of 2 -cell embryos (2 -cell nucleoli) have morphology similar to that of nucleoli in oocytes at the GV stage. In this study, we examined the ability of 2 -cell nucleoli to substitute for GV nucleoli in terms of supporting early embryonic development by nucleolus aspiration (enucleolation) and transfer into metaphase II (MII) oocytes or 2 -cell embryos that were derived from enucleolated oocytes at the GV stage in the pig. When 2 -cell embryos were centrifuged to move the lipid droplets {{to one side of the}} blastomere, multiple nucleoli in the nucleus fused into a single nucleolus. The nucleoli were then aspirated from the 2 -cell embryos by micromanipulation. The injection of 2 -cell nucleoli to GV enucleolated oocytes at the MII <b>stage</b> <b>rescued</b> the embryos from the early embryonic arrest, and the resulting oocytes developed to blastocysts. However, the injection of 2 -cell and GV nucleoli to 2 -cell embryos derived from GV enucleolated oocytes rarely restored the development to blastocysts.

40|$|T lineage {{commitment}} {{occurs in}} a discrete, stage-specific manner during thymic ontogeny. Intrathymic precursor transfer experiments and the identification of CD 4 + 8 + double-positive (DP), Vα 14 Jα 18 natural T (iNKT) cells suggest that commitment to this lineage might occur at the DP stage. Nevertheless, this matter remains contentious because others failed to detect Vα 14 Jα 18 -positive iNKT cells that are CD 4 + 8 +. In resolution to this issue, we demonstrate that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ) 0 / 0 thymi, which accumulate immature single-positive (ISP) thymocytes that precede the DP stage, do not rearrange Vα 14 -to-Jα 18 gene segments, suggesting that this event occurs at a post-ISP stage. Mixed radiation bone marrow chimeras revealed that RORγ functions in an iNKT cell lineage-specific manner. Further, introgression of a Bcl-xL transgene into RORγ 0 / 0 mice, which promotes survival and permits secondary rearrangements of distal Vα and Jα gene segments at the DP <b>stage,</b> <b>rescues</b> Vα 14 -to-Jα 18 recombination. Similarly, introgression of a rearranged Vα 14 Jα 18 transgene into RORγ 0 / 0 mice results in functional iNKT cells. Thus, our data support the "T cell receptor-instructive (mainstream precursor) model" of iNKT cell lineage specification where Vα 14 -to-Jα 18 rearrangement, positive selection, and iNKT cell lineage commitment occur at or after the DP stage of ontogeny...|$|R
