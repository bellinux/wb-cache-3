25|$|At {{the very}} C-terminal {{end of the}} protein is the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif <b>recognition</b> <b>site,</b> the conserved MEEVD pentapeptide, that is {{responsible}} for the interaction with co-factors such as the immunophilins FKBP51 and FKBP52, the stress induced phosphoprotein 1 (Sti1/Hop), cyclophilin-40, PP5, Tom70, and many more.|$|E
25|$|Structure: The {{structure}} of this protein domain is a left-handed coiled-coil followed by four transmembrane beta strands. It is thought that, once trimerisation has occurred, these beta strands further fold into a 12-stranded beta-barrel. It {{also contains a}} <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> for signal peptidases, which means the enzyme will recognise the signal peptide and cleave it at a particular point.|$|E
40|$|<b>Recognition</b> <b>sites</b> for [3 H]imipramine and [3 H]mianserin {{are located}} in {{different}} structures and regulate different neuronal functions. <b>Recognition</b> <b>sites</b> for [3 H]imipramine are located on serotonergic terminals, {{are part of the}} supramolecular organization of the uptake mechanisms and can be down-regulated by prolonged administration of the drug. When the number of <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> for imipramine is down-regulated, uptake of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) in rat brain hippocampal slices is increased. The presence of the binding sites for imipramine in 5 HT terminals is essential to mediate the down-regulation of <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> for norepinephrine (NE) and NE-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Mianserin binds on a site that is modulated by 5 HT, the number of its binding sites is not down-regulated by repeated treatment and, like imipramine, decreases the NE-dependent cyclase but not the number of beta-adrenergic receptor <b>recognition</b> <b>sites.</b> Repeated treatment with imipramine and mianserin down-regulated the number of 5 HT 2 <b>recognition</b> <b>sites.</b> Several lines of evidence indicate that binding site for mianserin is related but not identical to the 5 HT 2 receptor binding site...|$|R

25|$|However, the meganuclease-induced genetic recombinations {{that could}} be {{performed}} were limited by the repertoire of meganucleases available. Despite the existence of hundreds of meganucleases in nature, {{and the fact that}} each one is able to tolerate minor variations in its <b>recognition</b> <b>site,</b> the probability of finding a meganuclease able to cut a given gene at the desired location is extremely slim. Several groups turned their attention to engineering new meganucleases that would target the desired recognition sites.|$|E
25|$|A {{more radical}} option {{has been to}} exploit a {{property}} that {{plays an important role}} in meganucleases’ naturally high degree of diversification: the possibility of associating or fusing protein domains from different enzymes. This option makes it possible to develop chimeric meganucleases with a new <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> composed of a half-site of meganuclease A and a half-site of protein B. By fusing the protein domains of I-DmoI and I-CreI, two chimeric meganucleases have been created using this method: E-Drel and DmoCre.|$|E
25|$|Meganucleases are endodeoxyribonucleases {{characterized}} by a large <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> (double-stranded DNA sequences of 12 to 40 base pairs); {{as a result this}} site generally occurs only once in any given genome. For example, the 18-base pair sequence recognized by the I-SceI meganuclease would on average require a genome twenty {{times the size of the}} human genome to be found once by chance (although sequences with a single mismatch occur about three times per human-sized genome). Meganucleases are therefore considered to be the most specific naturally occurring restriction enzymes.|$|E
5000|$|Tn10 has a {{composite}} structure {{and it is}} composed {{of a pair of}} insertion sequence elements (IS10) flanking five genes. Only one of the IS10 elements encodes a functional transposase. [...] Since the ends of the IS10 element contain the transposase <b>recognition</b> <b>sites,</b> Tn10 has a total of four such sites. If the transposase binds the two <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> flanking an IS10 element, the IS10 element undergoes transposition independently of the larger composite structure. If the transposase binds the two outermost <b>recognition</b> <b>sites,</b> the whole composite Tn10 structure undergoes transposition.|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{possible}} major T cell <b>recognition</b> <b>site(s)</b> of chironomid antigens, we established human T cell lines and clones (CD 3 + 4 + 8 -) reactive to soluble extracts {{of the adult}} midge of Tokunagayusurika akamusi (TAA) and/or Chironomus yoshimatsui (CYA). All T cell lines and clones proliferated heavily in response to relatively large molecular weight fractions of TAA (MW {{greater than or equal}} to 15, 000). Nine clones reactive to TAA were classified into 3 groups according to reactivity, indicating the existence of at least 3 distinct T cell <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> in TAA. Five T cell clones responded to both TAA and CYA, although the two chironomid antigens were serologically distinct.

25|$|Glutathione, {{along with}} {{oxidized}} glutathione (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), {{have been found}} to bind to the glutamate <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. Glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are different from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute glutathione receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. Glutathione is also able to activate the purinergic P2X7 receptor from Müller glia, inducing acute calcium transient signals and GABA release from both retinal neurons and glial cells.|$|E
25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of smooth muscle cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in smooth muscle cell biomarkers and a reduction in the derived smooth muscle cell population. There is evidence that the control of smooth muscle cell differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition of smooth muscle cell differentiation. A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this breed of sheep.|$|E
2500|$|Most conserved is {{the primary}} {{sequence}} of the amino acyl acceptor stem. [...] This portion of the molecule has an invariable A residue in the discriminator position and a G-U pair at position 3 (except in Seculamonas ecuadoriensis, which has a G-C pair); this position is the <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> for alanyl tRNA synthase. P2 is a helix of variable length (3 to 10 base pairs) and corresponds to the anticodon stem of tRNAs, yet without an anticodon loop (as not required for tmRNA function). P2 stabilizes the tRNA-like structure, but four nucleotides invariant across oomycetes and jakobids suggest an additional, currently unidentified function. P3 has five base pairs and corresponds to the T-arm of tRNAs, yet with different consensus nucleotides both in the paired region and the loop. The T-loop sequence is conserved across oomycetes and jakobid, with only few deviations (e.g., Saprolegnia ferax). Finally, instead of the tRNA-like D-stem with a shortened three-nucleotide [...] D-loop characteristic for bacterial tmRNAs, mitochondrial counterparts have a highly variable 5 to 14-nt long loop.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} two new {{site-specific recombination}} systems named VCre/VloxP and SCre/SloxP for genome engineering. Their <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> are dif-ferent from Cre <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> because VCre and SCre recombinases share less protein similarity with Cre, {{even though the}} basic 13 - 8 - 13 structures of their <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> are identical. Mutant VloxP and SloxP, which have the same uses as mutant loxP, were also developed. VCre/VloxP and SCre/ SloxP in combination with Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT systems can serve as powerful tools for genome engineering, especially when used to genetically modify both alleles of a single gene in mouse and human cells...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an affinity chromatography method to isolate specific RNAs and RNA-protein complexes formed in vivo or in vitro. It exploits the highly selective binding of the coat protein of bacteriophage R 17 {{to a short}} hairpin in its genomic RNA. RNA containing that hairpin binds to coat protein that has been covalently bound to a solid support. Bound RNA-protein complexes can be eluted with excess R 17 <b>recognition</b> <b>sites.</b> Using purified RNA, we demonstrate that binding to immobilized coat protein is highly specific and enables one to separate an RNA of interest from a large excess of other RNAs in a single step. Surprisingly, binding of an RNA containing non-R 17 sequences to the support requires two <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> in tandem; a single site is insufficient. We determine optimal conditions for purification of specific RNAs by comparing specific binding (retention of RNAs with <b>recognition</b> <b>sites)</b> to non-specific binding (retention of RNAs without <b>recognition</b> <b>sites)</b> over a range of experimental conditions. These results suggest that binding of immobilized coat protein to RNAs containing two sites is cooperative. We illustrate the potential utility of the approach in purifying RNA-protein complexes by demonstrating that a U 1 snRNP formed in vivo on an RNA containing tandem <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> is selectively retained by the coat protein support...|$|R

40|$|The EBNA 1 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) {{activates}} latent-phase DNA replication by {{an unknown}} mechanism that involves binding to four <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> in the dyad symmetry (DS) element of the viral latent origin of DNA replication. Since EBV episomes are assembled into nucleosomes, we have examined the ability of Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1) {{to interact with the}} DS element when it is assembled into a nucleosome core particle. EBNA 1 bound to its <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> within this nucleosome, forming a ternary complex, and displaced the histone octamer upon competitor DNA challenge. The DNA binding and dimerization region of EBNA 1 was sufficient for nucleosome binding and destabilization. Although EBNA 1 was able to bind to nucleosomes containing two <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> from the DS element positioned {{at the edge of the}} nucleosome, nucleosome destabilization was only observed when all four sites of the DS element were present. Our results indicate that the presence of a nucleosome at the viral origin will not prevent EBNA 1 binding to its <b>recognition</b> <b>sites.</b> In addition, since four EBNA 1 <b>recognition</b> <b>sites</b> are required for both nucleosome destabilization and efficient origin activation, our findings also suggest that nucleosome destabilization by EBNA 1 is important for origin activation...|$|R

50|$|However, a {{recognition}} sequence {{refers to a}} different aspect from that of <b>recognition</b> <b>site.</b> A given recognition sequence can occur one or more times, {{or not at all}} on a specific DNA fragment. A <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> is specified by the position of the site. For example, there are two PstI <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> in the following DNA sequence fragment, start at base 9 and 31 respectively. A recognition sequence is a specific sequence, usually very short (less than 10 bases). Depending on the degree of specificity of the protein, a DNA-binding protein can bind to more than one specific sequence. For PstI, which has a single sequence specificity, it is 5'-CTGCAG-3'. It is always the same whether at the first <b>recognition</b> <b>site</b> or the second in the following example sequence. For Sp1, which has multiple (16) sequence specificity as shown above, the two recognition sites in the following example sequence fragment are at 18 and 32, and their respective recognition sequences are 5'-GGGGCGGAGC-3' and 5'-TGGGCGGAAC-3'.|$|E

In order to find general patterns in DNA <b>recognition</b> <b>sites,</b> which may reflect important properties of protein–DNA interaction, we analyse the binding sites of all known type II restriction endonucleases.

Moreover, we study patterns of nucleotide order in <b>recognition</b> <b>sites.</b> Our analysis reveals a striking accumulation of adjacent purines (R) or pyrimidines (Y). We discuss three possible reasons: RR/YY dinucleotides are characterized by (i) stronger H-bond donor and acceptor clusters, (ii) specific geometrical properties and (iii) a low stacking energy. These features make RR/YY steps particularly accessible for specific protein–DNA interactions.
