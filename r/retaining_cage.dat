5000|$|Early in the 20th-century farmers built {{numerous}} drainage canals {{to create}} arable farming {{land in the}} wetland. This dried the wetland out, and only in the 1990s Rand Water started a rehabilitation programme to restore the wetland. Part of their motivation {{was due to the}} realisation that clean water could be supplied more cost-effectively by forgoing chemical and mechanical treatment, and rather letting the wetland push its water back into the Vaal River where it augmented the water scheme already in place. The whole project cost over two million Rand and ongoing efforts continue to improve the situation. [...] "Working for Wetlands" [...] is a program supported by three separate government ministries (Water Affairs, Agriculture and Tourism). Headed in the Memel area by an engineer from Zimbabwe, Working for Wetlands annually employs between 30-90 unskilled workers who build gabions (rocks placed in wire <b>retaining</b> <b>cages)</b> and weirs to slow erosion and resurrect marshland.|$|R

500|$|Aquaculture {{has been}} defined as [...] "the farming of aquatic organisms {{including}} fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants and implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated." [...] In practice it can take place in the sea or in freshwater, and be extensive or intensive. Whole bays, lakes or ponds may be devoted to aquaculture, or the farmed animal may be <b>retained</b> in <b>cages</b> (fish), artificial reefs, racks or strings (shellfish). Fish and prawns can be cultivated in rice paddies, either arriving naturally or being introduced, and both crops can be harvested together.|$|R
50|$|The outer {{universal}} joint allows greater angular changes but not changes in shaft length. It is normally {{a ball and}} cage type with an inner race splined to the intermediate shaft. An outer race is formed in the yoke. The <b>cage</b> <b>retains</b> the balls in location in grooves in both races.The balls transfer the drive from the shaft to the hub and allow for changes in horizontal angle and for a wide steering angle to be achieved. A flexible rubber boot fitted to each joint retains grease and keeps out dirt and moisture.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the interaction of transition metal clusters with B, C, N, O, and Si reveal novel structure and properties: Co 12 C 6, Mn 12 C 6, and Mn 24 C 18 clusters form stable ferromagnetic hollow cages with total magnetic moments of 14 μB, 38 μB, and 70 μB, respectively. Replacement of C with B, N, O, or Si has significant impact on their structure and magnetic properties. For example, Mn 20 Si 12 cluster forms a ferrimagnetic dodecahedral hollow cage with a total magnetic moment of 36 μB while Mn 12 N 6, X 12 C 6 (X = Ni, Cu, Pd, Pt), and Cu 12 O 6 possess no magnetic moment, although they <b>retain</b> hollow <b>cage</b> structures. Mn 12 B 6 and Mn 24 Si 18, on the other hand, form compact ferrimagnetic structures. Synthesis of hollow cage clusters with unique magnetic properties may lead to important applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} joint {{experimental}} and theoretical study of CO chemisorption {{on the golden}} cages. We find that the Au 17 − cage is highly robust and <b>retains</b> its <b>cage</b> structure in Au 17 − (CO) −. On the other hand, the Au 16 − cage is transformed to a structure similar to Au 17 − upon the adsorption of CO. Au 18 − is known to consist of two nearly degenerate structures, i. e., a cage and a pyramidal isomer, which coexist in the cluster beam. However, upon CO chemisorption only the cage isomer is observed while the pyramidal isomer no longer exists due to its less favorable interaction with CO, compared to the cage isomer. We find that inclusion of the spin-orbit effects is critical in yielding simulated spectra in quantitative agreement with the experimental data and providing unequivocal structural information and molecular insights into the chemical interactions between CO and the golden cages...|$|R

The energy dependence of chemisorption characteristic was studied. We found that there existed an energy threshold for chemisorption of C 20 to occur. Between 10 and 20 eV, the C 20 fullerene has high probability of chemisorption and the adsorbed <b>cage</b> <b>retains</b> its original structure, which supports the experimental observations of memory effects. However, the structures of the adsorbed bowl and ring C 20 were different from their original ones.

40|$|Calculations were {{conducted}} at the G 4 MP 2 and G 4 composite method levels of theory on the 35 potential carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and phosphorus tetrahedrane derivatives with the general form C~a~N~b~Si~c~P~d~H~(4 -b-d) ~ (where a+b+c+d= 4). At both levels of theory, optimized electronic ground state neutral singlet gas phase (298. 15 K, 1 atm) geometries were obtained for 24 of the 35 possible C/N/Si/P tetrahedrane derivatives. Corresponding enthalpies of formation were calculated using the atomization method. Triplet state neutral tetrahedron starting geometries for all compounds either resulted in cage opening or failed to converge. Only 9 cationic and 3 anionic forms converged to stable geometries that <b>retained</b> the tetrahedron <b>cage</b> and were absent imaginary frequencies, thereby allowing the calculation of adiabatic ionization energies and electron affinities...|$|R
50|$|In early 2011, Timmer {{and other}} members of TVN {{purchased}} a 2011 GMC Yukon XL, which would be the base vehicle for a second Dominator vehicle named Dominator 2. Changes from the first Dominator are said to include a flex fuel engine, improved aerodynamic streamlining, swiveling rear passenger seats, improved hydraulics, and upgraded armor protection as well as anchoring spikes that could allow it to engage tornadoes stronger than those the original Dominator could safely face. Timmer also stated that both vehicles would be used with one going into tornadoes to gather data from inside the funnel while the other would collect data from just outside the tornado, with the intention of comparing the two sets of data. The second generation Dominator features reinforced sheet metal and transparent Lexan has been strengthened with higher-quality steel and an additional LINE-X coating. This shell is firmly affixed to the frame and chassis of the GMC Yukon. The new model <b>retains</b> a roll <b>cage</b> and racing-car safety seats with full-torso belts for added crew protection.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{deposition}} of C- 20 fullerenes on a diamond (001) -(2 x 1) {{surface and the}} fabrication of C- 20 thin film at 100 K were investigated by a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the many-body Brenner bond order potential. First, {{we found that the}} collision dynamic of a single C- 20 fullerene on a diamond surface was strongly dependent on its impact energy. Within the energy range 10 - 45 eV, the C- 20 fullerene chemisorbed on the surface <b>retained</b> its free <b>cage</b> structure. This is consistent with the experimental observation, where it was called the memory effect in "C- 20 -type" films [P. Melion, Int. J. Mod. B 9, 339 (1995); P. Milani, Cluster Beam Synthesis of Nanostructured Materials (Springer, Berlin, 1999) ]. Next, more than one hundred C- 20 (10 - 25 eV) were deposited one after the other onto the surface. The initial growth stage of C- 20 thin film was observed to be in the three-dimensional island mode. The randomly deposited C- 20 fullerenes stacked on diamond surface and acted as building blocks forming a polymerlike structure. The assembled film was also highly porous due to cluster-cluster interaction. The bond angle distribution and the neighbor-atom-number distribution of the film presented a well-defined local order, which is of sp(3) hybridization character, {{the same as that of}} a free C- 20 cage. These simulation results are again in good agreement with the experimental observation. Finally, the deposited C- 20 film showed high stability even when the temperature was raised up to 1500 K...|$|R

During the experiment, 36 fish (24 females and 12 males) in spring 2013 and 36 fish (24 females and 12 males) in fall 2013 were collected from the Shirud River estuary in Mazandaran Province, the Southern Caspian Sea during their upstream migration to the freshwater. All fish were injected with hCG at the doses of 1000, 1500 and 2000 IU. kg BW- 1. The injection was a two - step process (50 % of hormone in each step) by 12 h interval. After the first injection, fish were <b>retained</b> in the <b>cages</b> in the river beds and 24 hours after the second injection, fish were checked for egg and sperm release after mild abdomen pressure. Blood samples were taken for determining sex steroid levels. Results showed that hCG hormone injections caused increase in migration of germinal vesicle in the oocyte of female and sperm release in males. Significant differences were found in the serum E 2 and 17 α-OHP levels in hCG - injected fish compared to the control. However, no significant differences were found in serum T 3 and T 4 levels in the hCG -injected fish. According to the results, the appropriate hCG dosage to induce the reproduction acceleration in Caspian lamprey is 1500 - 2000 IU. kg BW- 1...|$|R
