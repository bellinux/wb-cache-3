5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, but only {{to the east of}} the Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E

Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends.

25|$|On September 22, 1920, Poland {{attacked}} Lithuanian {{units in}} the Suwałki Region on a wide front. Overwhelmed by 4–5 times larger Polish forces, some 1,700–2,000 Lithuanian troops surrendered and were taken prisoner. Polish forces then marched, as planned on September 8, across the Neman River near Druskininkai and Merkinė {{to the rear of}} the Soviet forces near Hrodna and Lida. The Red Army hastily retreated. The Lithuanians had had limited intelligence warning that such an attack might occur, but chose an inadequate defensive strategy and spread their forces too thinly along the entire Polish–Lithuanian front without sufficient forces to protect the bridges across the Neman. This attack, just two days after the resolution by the League of Nations to cease hostilities, put more pressure on Poland to settle the dispute peacefully. On September 26, the Poles captured Hrodna and the Polish foreign minister proposed new negotiations in Suwałki. The Battle of the Niemen River drastically altered the balance of power: Vilnius, in Lithuanian hands since August 26, was now exposed to a Polish attack. Indeed, the Poles had already decided to capture the city and used the negotiations in Suwałki to stall and buy the time necessary to make preparations. The Lithuanian side was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E

Costello and Kent continued in a tradition that was reminiscent of the original Kangaroos; when a federation needed a new tag team title, the Kangaroos were brought in and acknowledged as champions on arrival instead of holding a tournament to determine the champions. In 1967, the Japanese federation [...] "International Wrestling Enterprise" [...] (IWE) brought the Kangaroos in as the first Trans-World Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Champions.

500|$|Blackbeard and Bonnet left Delaware Bay and {{returned}} to the Caribbean in November, where they successfully continued their piracy. On 17November, a 200-ton ship named the Concorde was attacked by two pirate craft nearly [...] away from the island of Martinique. The lieutenant on board described the pirate vessels as one having 12 guns and 120 men and the other having eight guns and 30 men. The crew of the Concorde put up a fight, but surrendered after the pirates bombarded them with [...] "two volleys of cannons and musketry." [...] Blackbeard took the Concorde and sailed south into the Grenadines, where he renamed the ship Queen Anne's Revenge, possibly as an insult to King George I of Great Britain. Some time after 19December, Bonnet and Blackbeard separated. Bonnet now sailed into the western Caribbean. In March 1718, he encountered the 400-ton merchant vessel Protestant Caesar off Honduras. The ship escaped him, and his frustrated crew became restive. When Bonnet encountered Blackbeard again shortly afterwards, Bonnet's crew deserted him to join Blackbeard. Blackbeard put a henchman named Richards in command of the Revenge. Bonnet, surprised that his colleague had betrayed him, found himself as a guest aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. Bonnet confided in a few loyal crew members that he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his criminal life if he could exile himself in Spain or Portugal.

[...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death.
