5|$|California Chrome has <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> inbreeding; he is 4 × 3 to Mr Prospector, {{meaning that}} this {{ancestor}} appears {{once in the}} third and once in the fourth generations of his pedigree. He is also 4 × 4 to Numbered Account and 4 × 5 to Northern Dancer.|$|E
40|$|RCS {{is shown}} in Figure 2. As expected, these results {{correspond}} with the measured results in [4]. 4. CONCLUSION This letter presents an alternative implementation of TD-AIM for solving scattering problems. Since the cubic spline is as the tem-poral basis function and the rot operator from the integrals of far-zone interactions is analytically removed, the interpolating procedure both for temporal and space in TD-AIM is simple and accurate, and the TD-CFIE can be solved with <b>relatively</b> <b>littler</b> memory and computational resources accurately. Simulation re-sults have been presented. In our experience, when NFFT 3, the computing speed of the largest FFT is acceptable...|$|R

5|$|Canterbury {{experiences}} an {{oceanic climate}} (Köppen climate classification Cfb), similar to {{almost all of}} the United Kingdom. Canterbury enjoys mild temperatures all year round, being between 1.8°C (35.2°F) and 22.8°C (73°F). There is <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Grove Campground was {{affected}} <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> by storms, {{as compared to}} other camp meeting sites in the area. However, in 1889, attendance of the camp meeting was significantly affected by inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|The Pomeranian is a {{small but}} {{energetic}} breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent attention, they need <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> exercise: it is recommended to take them on a short daily walk or let them run around an enclosed space.|$|E
40|$|Despite the <b>relatively</b> "egalitarian" (<b>little</b> pay for performance) {{structure}} of military compensation, {{those who do}} better on tests of proficiency in their military occupation are likely to re-enlist t those who do worse, and this difference is not primarily due to the Army's unwillingness to allow its worst performers to re-enlist. In contrast, those with the best scores on the general ability test given prior to enlistment are likely to re-enlist...|$|R
40|$|Direct scoring of {{progression}} of pleural and parenchymal lesions was compared with change assessed by independent readings to the ILO classification among 155 men from HM Dockyard, Devonport, followed-up for 10 years. For pleural calcification the two methods agreed closely, whereas direct scoring yielded <b>relatively</b> too <b>little</b> {{progression of}} small opacities {{and too much}} progression of pleural thickening. The choice of method for assessing progression should depend on objectives...|$|R
40|$|In an {{exchange}} economy with no aggregate uncertainty, and Bayesian agents, Pareto optimal allocations provide full insurance if {{and only if}} the agents have a common prior. It is hard to explain why there is <b>relatively</b> so <b>little</b> betting taking place. One is led to ask, when are full insurance allocations optimal for uncertainty averse agents? it turns out that commonality of beliefs, appropriately defined, is key again.

5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with {{aircraft}} carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> success {{at the start of}} the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, {{the storm had}} <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War (17751783), the Continental Army made <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> use of cavalry, {{primarily}} {{relying on}} infantry {{and a few}} dragoon regiments. The United States Congress eventually authorized regiments specifically designated as cavalry in 1855. The newly formed American cavalry adopted tactics based on experiences fighting over vast distances during the Mexican War (18461848) and against indigenous peoples on the western frontier, abandoning some European traditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 1.5 mm, its {{diameter}} 2 mm. The shell consists of about three convex whorls forming a comparatively low, somewhat depressed spire. The entire surface below the <b>relatively</b> large, <b>little</b> raised, smooth nuclear whorl, is covered with raised, rounded, well-separated, revolving microscopic threads, most distinct on the base. The small umbilicus is scarcely more than a chink. The aperture and the operculum are typical.|$|R
30|$|Until <b>relatively</b> recently, <b>little</b> {{specific}} {{research has}} sought to understand exactly what cost policies such as animal health legislation have on the pastoral production system and how these might be reduced. Notable exceptions include recent work on livestock marketing in eastern Africa that has begun to demonstrate the impediments colonial-era animal health legislation designed for state-led marketing has on the growth of regional private sector-led trade, for example (McPeak and Little 2006).|$|R

5|$|From {{the early}} part of the period there is <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> {{metalwork}} and a larger amount of ceramics. The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.|$|E
5|$|Highway132 {{is a short}} {{connector}} {{highway that}} travels between Dacre and Renfrew, connecting Highway41 with Highway17 via Highway60. The majority of the route travels through the Canadian Shield, {{with the exception of}} the final few kilometres approaching Renfrew, where it descends into the Ottawa Valley. Because of its rugged surroundings, there is <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> human habitation along the route outside of the communities of Dacre and Shamrock.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} {{with the rest of}} India, Kerala experiences <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> sectarianism. According to 2011 Census of India figures, 54.73% of Kerala's residents are Hindus, 26.56% are Muslims, 18.38% are Christians, and the remaining 0.32% follow another or have no religious affiliation. Hindus constitute the majority in all districts except Malappuram, where they are outnumbered by Muslims. Kerala has the largest population of Christians in India.|$|E

5|$|On 27 April NVA rockets hit Saigon and Cholon for {{the first}} time since the 1973 ceasefire. It was decided that from this time only C-130s would be used for the {{evacuation}} due to their greater maneuverability.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmed—Ishaan returning {{home from school and}} putting away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style {{for the film}} that involved <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> camera movement.|$|E
5|$|The Castle {{is open to}} {{tourists}} only via guided tours. These occur daily outside of term time, but are more restricted during the term due to potential conflicts with {{the running of the}} college. Furthermore, events in the university timetable may result in their cancellation. Tourists are not otherwise permitted entry to the college or any common areas. There is <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> conflict between students and tourists, with many of the guided tours done by students themselves.|$|E

50|$|Construction was <b>relatively</b> {{easy with}} <b>little</b> {{requirement}} for heavy civil engineering works; however {{much of the}} subscribed capital was not forthcoming when the calls were made, the lack of cash severely slowed construction, many shares were forfeit, and the directors resorted to unauthorised borrowing.|$|R
50|$|Other {{environmental}} issues include bad waste disposal and beach theft. Although the Maldives are kept <b>relatively</b> pristine and <b>little</b> litter {{can be found}} on the islands, no good waste disposal sites exist. Most trash from Male and other resorts is simply dumped at Thilafushi.|$|R
5|$|The Pseudonarcissus {{group in}} their natural habitat prefer humid {{situations}} such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations. In Germany, which has <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> limestone, Narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Willamette Valley is mild year-round, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers; extreme {{temperatures}} are uncommon. Most rainfall occurs outside {{the growing season}} and the valley gets <b>relatively</b> <b>little</b> snow. Not {{all parts of the}} Valley are suitable for viticulture, and most wineries and vineyards are found west of the Willamette River, with the largest concentration in Yamhill County.|$|E

Of these threats, Redstone was considered just within the Hercules' capabilities, able to defend against such a target over a relatively limited range. Increasing performance against these longer-range [...] "theatre" [...] weapons would require more extensive upgrades that would have pushed the time-frame out to the range when FABMDS was expected.|$|R
50|$|Although {{these studies}} do show {{statistical}} {{significance for the}} effects of whale-watching boats, these results do not have biological significance and need to be researched further.
