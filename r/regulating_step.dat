40|$|The striatal-enriched protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase (STEP) {{family is}} expressed within dopaminoceptive neurons of the CNS and is particularly enriched within the basal ganglia and related structures. Alternative splicing produces several isoforms {{that are found}} {{in a number of}} subcellular compartments, including postsynaptic densities of medium spiny neurons. The variants include STEP 61, a membrane-associated protein, and STEP 46, a cytosolic protein. The C terminals of these two isoforms are identical, whereas the N-terminal domain of STEP 61 contains a novel 172 amino acid sequence that includes several structural motifs not present in STEP 46. Amino acid sequencing revealed a number of potential phosphorylation sites in both STEP isoforms. Therefore, we investigated the role of phosphorylation in <b>regulating</b> <b>STEP</b> activity.

40|$|Hyperhomocysteinaemia is {{generally}} accepted {{as an independent}} and graded risk factor for both arterial occlusive disease and venous thrombosis. The only way of homocysteine degradation is conversion to cysteine in the transsulfuration pathway in which the <b>regulating</b> <b>step</b> is catalysed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Mild impairment of CBS function could therefore affect homocysteine concentration, in particular after methionine loading, and consequently cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We analysed two silent polymorphisms and one short tandem repeat in the CBS gene (ie 699 C [...] >T, 1080 C [...] >T and - 5697 (GT) STR) as genetic markers potentially in linkage disequilibrium with a functional polymorphism. We assessed their association with fasting and post-methionine load homocysteine in 190 patients with arterial occlusive disease, and in 381 controls. No differences in CBS genotype frequencies between cases and controls were found, nor was a particular CBS genotype associated with an elevated risk of arterial occlusive disease. Although we did find {{a high rate of}} linkage disequilibrium between the two single nucleotide polymorphisms and the GT STR, none of the genotypes defined by the three CBS variants studied showed an association with elevated fasting, post-load or increase upon methionine loading homocysteine concentrations. In conclusion, we did not find any indication that genetic variation in the CBS gene is associated with increased homocysteine concentrations...|$|E

40|$|The insulin/IGF {{signaling}} pathway is a highly conserved regulator of metabolism in flies and mammals, regulating multiple physiological functions including lipid metabolism. Although insulin signaling is known to regulate the activity {{of a number of}} enzymes in metabolic pathways, a comprehensive understanding of how the insulin {{signaling pathway}} regulates metabolic pathways is still lacking. Accepted knowledge suggests the key <b>regulated</b> <b>step</b> in triglyceride (TAG) catabolism is the release of fatty acids from TAG via the action of lipases. We show here that an additional, important <b>regulated</b> <b>step</b> is the activation of fatty acids for beta-oxidation via Acyl Co-A synthetases (ACS). We identify pudgy as an ACS that is transcriptionally regulated by direct FOXO action in Drosophila. Increasing or reducing pudgy expression in vivo causes a decrease or increase in organismal TAG levels respectively, indicating that pudgy expression levels are important for proper lipid homeostasis. We show that multiple ACSs are also transcriptionally regulated by insulin signaling in mammalian cells. In sum, we identify fatty acid activation onto CoA as an important, <b>regulated</b> <b>step</b> in triglyceride catabolism, and we identify a mechanistic link through which insulin regulates lipid homeostasis.

30|$|In recent years, the {{synthesis}} and breakdown of Chls in higher {{plants have been}} extensively studied (Gossauer and Engel 1996; Hörtensteine and Kräutler 2011; Steccanella et al. 2015). At {{the first step of}} Chls biosynthesis, the formation of aminolevulinate acid (ALA) is the rate-controlling point of whole pathway. Thereby, glutamyl-tRNA reductase (Glu-TR) is the key enzyme for metabolic and environmental control (Kumar and Soll 2000; Gough et al. 2003). At the branch point of Chls biosynthetic pathway, magnesium chelatase (MgCH) and ferri chelatase (FeCH) compete for protoporphyrin (Proto) to synthesis of heme and Mg-Proto, respectively, which also is an important <b>regulating</b> <b>step</b> in Chls biosynthesis. In addition, the higher level accumulation of heme can lead to inhibition of {{the synthesis}} of Chls in plants by feedback regulation (Guo et al. 1998; Terry and Kendrick 1999; Brumann et al. 2014). At the later steps of Chls biosynthesis, the light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide). In the processes, the tripolymer of the POR-NADPH-Pchlide was disaggregated, and the Chlide was released accompany with the breakdown of POR (Apel et al. 1980; Armstrong et al. 1995; Holtorf and Apel 1996; Reinbothe et al. 2010; Kim and Apel 2012; Talaat 2013; Menon et al. 2016). Finally, Chlide was catalyzed by chlorophyll synthetase (CHL) and chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), respectively, and then turned into Chl a and Chl b, respectively (Beale 1999, 2005).|$|E

Thus there is a paucity of literature investigating visuomotor control of step descent. This thesis addressed {{the importance of the}} lower visual field (lvf) in <b>regulating</b> <b>step</b> descent landing control, and determined when visual feedback is typically used in regulating landing control prior to / during step descent. When step descents were completed from a stationary starting position, with the lvf occluded or degraded, participants adapted their stepping strategy {{in a manner consistent with}} being uncertain regarding the precise location of the foot / lower leg relative to the floor. However, these changes in landing control under conditions of lvf occlusion were made without fundamentally altering stepping strategy. This suggests that participants were able to plan the general stepping strategy when only upper visual field cues were available. When lvf was occluded from either 2 or 1 step(s) prior to descending a step during on-going gait, stepping strategy was only affected when the lvf was occluded in the penultimate step. Findings suggest that lvf cues are acquired in the penultimate step / few seconds prior to descent and provide exproprioceptive information of the foot / lower leg relative to the floor which ensures landing is regulated with increased certainty. Findings also highlight the subtle role of online vision used in the latter portion of step descent to 'fine tune' landing control...|$|E
30|$|Among {{the members}} of ABA {{biosynthesis}} enzymes, NCED is the foremost one which catalyzes the <b>regulating</b> <b>step</b> of this pathway. The first NCED gene (VP 14) was cloned in maize by insertional mutagenesis, and exhibits mild ABA-deficient phenotypes due to gene redundancy (Tan et al., 1997). To date, 5 NCED genes are most probably involved in ABA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Iuchi et al., 2000; Schwartz et al., 2003) and rice (Saika et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2009). As {{is the case for}} other carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes, NCED proteins from various species are located in chloroplast (Qin and Zeevaart, 1999; Iuchi et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2003). Gene expression analysis reveals that the transcript level of OsNCED 2 gene is abundant in seed (Zhu et al., 2009) while OsNCED 1 is mainly expressed in rice leaves (Ye et al., 2011). Like Arabidopsis, the NCED 3 gene is significantly induced by water stress, which is responsible for the dramatically increase of ABA level in rice and Arabidopsis exposed to water stress (Tan et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2011). NCED 3 is also reported to express in root, indicating its function in responding to environmental cues (Tan et al., 2003). Interestingly, the OsNCED 1 gene, which has the highest expression level in rice leaf and is the housekeeping gene in normal conditions, is significantly suppressed by water stress. This may lead to the conclusion that ABA accumulation has a feedback effect on the expression of OsNCED 1 gene (Tian et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} {{has emerged}} as an attractive alternative to random mutagenesis and screening to design cell factories for industrial fermentation processes. The design of metabolic networks has been realized by gene deletions or strong overexpression of heterologous genes. There is an increasing body of evidence that indicates complete inactivation of native genes and high-level activity of heterologous enzymes may be deleterious to the cell. To moderately implement their expression, genes of interest are expressed {{under the control of}} promoters with different strengths. Constructing a promoter library is labor-intensive and requires precise quantification of the promoter strength. However, when the mechanisms of pathway regulation are known, it is possible to exploit this information to effect genetic changes efficiently. We report the implementation of this concept to reducing glycerol production during aerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Glycerol is produced to dispose excess cytosolic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and the <b>regulating</b> <b>step</b> in the pathway is mediated by glycerol 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (encoded by GPD 1 and GPD 2 genes). We expressed NADH oxidase in S. cerevisiae {{under the control of the}} GPD 2 promoter to modulate the decrease in cytosolic NADH to the right level where the heterologous enzyme does not compete with oxidative phosphorylation while at the same time, decreasing glycerol production. This metabolic design resulted in substantially decreasing glycerol production and indeed, the excess carbon was redirected to biomass, resulting in a 14 % increase in the specific growth rate. We believe that such strategies are more efficient than conventional methods and will find applications in bioprocesses...|$|E

Our goals {{was to determine whether}} dopaminergic medication improves preplanned and unplanned walking turns in individuals with PD, compared to healthy controls. Nineteen older adults with mild-to-moderate PD and 17 healthy controls performed one of the following three tasks, presented randomly: walking straight, or walking and turning 180 ° to the right or left. The walking direction was visually cued before starting to walk (preplanned) or after (unplanned, i. e., 0. 6 m before reaching the turning point). Subjects with PD were assessed off dopaminergic medication (OFF) and on dopaminergic medication (ON) medication. Turning strategy (step and spin turns), turning performance (turning distance and body rotation) and walking pattern were analyzed for three turning steps. Irrespective of medication state and turning condition, step and spin turns followed a nearly 50 : 50 distribution. After intake of dopaminergic medication, subjects with PD increased their turning distance but not the amount of body rotation or their walking pattern. Compared to controls, turning impairments in subjects with PD remained while ON medication and problems <b>regulating</b> <b>step</b> width were the most prominent features of their walking pattern. Specifically, subjects with PD turned with narrower cross-over steps, i. e. when the external foot crossed over the line of progression of the internal leg.
