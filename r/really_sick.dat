500|$|Prior to the {{broadcast}} of the 13th season, Parker and Stone made every episode from the previous 12 seasons of South Park available for free viewing on the official series website, South Park Studios. New episodes from the 13th season were made available for {{one week after the}} original airdate, then removed for 30 days, after which they were returned to the site permanently. The episodes were uncensored and ad-supported, so no membership fees were required to view the shows. In a statement, Parker and Stone said, [...] "We got <b>really</b> <b>sick</b> of having to download our own show illegally all the time. So we gave ourselves a legal alternative." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'You know what, I'm {{going to}} be freezing. I'm {{going to be}} miserable, I'll be {{complaining}} all day, I'll be sorry that I ever chose a cold place. So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that Paul would be central to the serial's 6000th episode. Executive producer Susan Bower had hinted previously that the milestone would involve Paul and Alan Fletcher teased audiences with the revelation that something horrible would happen to an iconic character. Of Paul's involvement and the reasoning behind it Bower explained: [...] "As Stefan Dennis – Paul Robinson – was in the first episode 25 years ago, it was decided that his character play a most important role in this very special event [...] Paul Robinson, or P.R as we like to call him, has been up to his usual tricks {{over the past few weeks}} and everyone on Ramsay Street is becoming <b>really</b> <b>sick</b> of him. What will they do about it?" [...] It was then announced the plot would be a whodunnit style arc, in which Paul is left fighting for his life after being pushed from the mezzanine level of Lassiter's Hotel.|$|E

60|$|The {{vice-consul}} laughed forlornly in his exasperation, but {{he agreed}} with Clementina when she said, in further excuse, that Mrs. Lander was <b>really</b> very <b>sick.</b> He pushed back his hat, and scratched {{his head with a}} grimace.|$|R
500|$|Getzein's {{record for}} {{complete}} games {{is based in}} part on the customs of the 1880s. [...] In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported that managers were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the bygone era. [...] It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice:"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted him all over the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was <b>really</b> <b>sick</b> he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had received, and that {{he would be able to}} finish the game." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think that}} we've {{always wanted to}} be doctors and psychiatrists. I was <b>really</b> <b>sick</b> when I was a kid so I grew up in a lot of hospitals. Sadie was in a couple of institutions... so I think we all had our eyes wide open. So I guess we've always wanted to see it from the other side." [...] - Shinn, 1997 {{interview}} ...|$|E
5000|$|Marie Castello died {{unexpectedly}} on June 27, 2008, {{at the age}} of 93. According to Castello's great-granddaughter, Sally Castello, [...] "She <b>really</b> wasn't <b>sick.</b> She just wasn't feeling well. She was very, {{very strong}} until the day she died." [...] The American flag at the Convention Hall-Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park was lowered to half staff in her honor.|$|R

50|$|A young man, 20 {{years of}} age. Your typical {{university}} student. Attends a technical institute, and has just taken (and passed) his driver's license examination. Lives with his family—a taciturn and unsupportive {{mother and father}} and a little sister who only ever has harsh words for him. Has never <b>really</b> been <b>sick</b> in his entire life. Has never really had much of an aim for his entire life, either.|$|R
2500|$|Mchinji Hospital is {{the only}} medical {{facility}} for several miles. According to actress Claire Sweeney, mothers [...] "only come here if their children are <b>really</b> <b>sick</b> because work on the farm nearly always comes first." [...] As of 2008, the children's ward of the hospital contains 185 children suffering from malaria, pneumonia or anaemia. Patients at the hospital are fed a blend of milk, protein and medicine. The hospital does not have beds for those accompanying the sick, cooking or washing facilities, although in early 2008 a brick shelter was created to protect parents from nature.|$|E
2500|$|Goodrem's {{second album}} Mistaken Identity, was {{released}} in Australia on 8 November 2004 and debuted at {{number one on the}} ARIA Albums chart. It was certified five times platinum for sales of 350,000 copies. The album spent 46 weeks in the top fifty. It also reached number seven in New Zealand, and peaked at number 25 in the UK. The album's lead single [...] "Out of the Blue", which was co-written and produced by Guy Chambers was released prior to the album on 8 October 2004. [...] "Out of the Blue" [...] debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number nine in the UK". This was Goodrem's sixth straight number one single in Australia. It was certified platinum in Australia. The second single [...] "Mistaken Identity" [...] was released only in Australia debuted at number seven and was certified Gold. [...] "Almost Here", a duet with Irish singer Brian McFadden was released as the third single and reached number three in the UK and became her seventh ARIA number one, along with her first number one in Ireland. It was certified platinum in Australia. [...] "A Little Too Late" [...] was released only in Australia and peaked at number 13. [...] "Be Strong" [...] was released as the album's fifth and final single in Australia as a digital download on 16 October 2005. At the time of release, digital downloads were not included as part of the main singles chart, therefore it was ineligible to chart. Much of the album, in particular [...] "Extraordinary Day", was inspired by her battle with cancer. Reflecting on that period of her life, Goodrem said [...] "It's weird to see pictures of that time. In some ways the fact that I was so sick was so out there, and yet I kept it really private. No-one saw me on the days I was <b>really</b> <b>sick.</b> I was 18 when I was diagnosed and I had a number one album and single in the country. And in the UK, I was number two. It was such a bipolar year.|$|E

50|$|Piñata Party: Angie {{was told}} to be a swinger. However, the group picked quickly {{and she was a}} stuffer. When she saw the piñatas bouncing, that was her out and claimed to be sick and Tracey took her place. Angie took a step outside of the ring on purpose, a move that kept $10,000 out of the pot. The {{producers}} even called in to ask Angie if she <b>really</b> was <b>sick.</b>|$|R
60|$|Minnie May, aged three, was <b>really</b> very <b>sick.</b> She lay on {{the kitchen}} sofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse {{breathing}} could be heard all over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged {{to stay with the}} children during her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.|$|R
50|$|Hot Rodney {{pretends to}} be ill so that {{everyone}} will make a fuss of him. But when all his friends <b>really</b> do get <b>sick,</b> Rodney {{is the only one}} fit enough to look after them.|$|R

60|$|Seeing Bahama Bill was <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> Songbird {{went to his}} {{assistance}} and called Mr. Rover. Then Captain Barforth was consulted and he gave the man some medicine.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{thought she}} <b>really</b> made Pat <b>sick</b> and {{could make him}} better, I'd try to pacify her somehow," [...] said the Story Girl decidedly. [...] "I'm frightened of her, too--but just look at poor, darling Paddy." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What {{he did was}} reprehensible, that's true... {{the other}} thing is, he is {{extremely}} damaged. He is an extremely damaged human being. And really, in our society we should not kill <b>sick</b> people. He <b>really</b> is a <b>sick</b> person." ...|$|R
50|$|Still others {{suggest that}} one must have the {{strength}} of the Übermensch in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the Übermensch will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they <b>really</b> are <b>sick,</b> not because of any choice they made.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother! Mother! My little mother--you're sick, you're <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> and I didn't {{know and}} I spoke so harshly. Oh, what is it, what is it, mother dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I'm <b>really</b> <b>sick.</b> Mrs. Meeker, like yourself, {{persists}} in treating {{me as if}} I were. I'm feeling fine--perfectly well, only I'm not as rugged as I want to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you too bad, my boy, {{to take a}} {{turn with}} me? I've {{a word or two}} I want to say; but if you're <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> Thady, and are going to bed, I'll come down early to-morrow morning. Would you sooner I did so?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{inspired}} by the childhood nightmares of Getty. According to a post-production producer who had worked on the film and a friend of Getty, Ryan Readenour: [...] "When he was young he would have these <b>really</b> powerful, <b>sick,</b> twisted dreams, and were so shocking to him that he didn’t think they came from him." [...] Getty conceived the idea that it could be a storyteller who created these dreams, and The Storyteller was then used as the first title of the film.|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} dinner-time came he <b>really</b> was <b>sick</b> with love,--or sick with disappointment. He {{felt that he}} could not eat his dinner under the battery of raillery which was always coming from Sir Magnus, and {{therefore}} he had told the servants that as the evening progressed he would have something to eat in his own room. And then he went out to wander in the dusk beneath the trees in the garden. Here he was encountered by Mr. Arbuthnot, with his dress boots and white cravat. [...] "What the mischief are you doing here, old fellow?" ...|$|R
60|$|March pleaded {{his wish}} to find how {{his wife had}} got through the afternoon, and he escaped to her. He would have told her now that Kenby was in the house, but he was <b>really</b> so <b>sick</b> of the fact himself {{that he could not}} speak of it at once, and he let her go on celebrating all she had seen from the window since she had waked from her long nap. She said she could never be glad enough that they had come just at that time. Soldiers had been going by the whole afternoon, and that made it so feudal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} the meat is as sweet as a nosegay--and for the bread, it's good enough, and too good, {{for a set of}} lubbers, that lie shamming Abraham, and {{consuming}} the Right Honourable Company's victuals--I don't speak to them that are <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> for God knows I am always for humanity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most of {{them are}} bachelors, and tough. They've stood their own cooking so long {{that they ought to}} be, and if anybody's <b>really</b> <b>sick</b> I hold off and tell him to wait until he can get a doctor. A {{sensitive}} conscience," [...] he added reflectively, [...] "is quite a handicap in this business." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{said before}} the three oldest will be left to go to school. Jess is too small. You will like him the best {{of any of the}} children, {{although}} he is the worst. I expect he will whip his Aunt Mary the first day. Buck, though never <b>really</b> <b>sick,</b> is very delicate. He is the best child I ever saw and is smart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How I {{should like}} to know if you <b>really</b> were so <b>sick</b> at heart that you hanged {{yourself}} there, or if it is only a hobgoblin that's before me!' said the man. 'Ah, well! you may hang there for me, whether you are a hobgoblin or not,' and on he went with his ox.|$|R
50|$|With the Indians on {{the verge}} of folding, union boss Dave Beck and Roscoe Torchy Torrance urged Sick to the rescue two weeks before Christmas (1937). Owner of one of the citys few recession-proof {{enterprises}} (beer), Sick could afford to take on a baseball club. The oddest part of it all was that <b>Sick</b> <b>really</b> didn't care for sports.|$|R
6000|$|... "His wife! thought I; always his wife: and I {{remember}} Juliette, who <b>really</b> grew <b>sick</b> at {{the smell}} of a pipe, and Harmodius would smoke, until, at last, the poor thing grew to smoke herself, like a trooper. To compensate, however, {{as much as possible}} for the loss of my cigar, Dambergeac drew from his pocket an enormous gold snuff-box, on which figured the self-same head that I had before remarked in plaster, but this time surrounded with a ring of pretty princes and princesses, all nicely painted in miniature. As for the statue of Louis Philippe, that, in the cabinet of an official, is a thing of course; but the snuff-box seemed to indicate a degree of sentimental and personal devotion, such as the old Royalists were only supposed to be guilty of.|$|R
