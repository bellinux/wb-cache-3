40|$|Abstract. <b>Repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> {{represent}} temporal {{relations among}} data items, {{which could be}} used for data summarization and data prediction. More and more data of various applications is generated as a data stream. Based on time sensitive concern, mining <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> from the whole history data sequence of a data stream does not extract the current trend of patterns in the stream. Therefore, the traditional strategies for mining <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> on static database are not applicable to data streams. For this reason, an algorithm, named appearing-bit-sequence-based incremental mining algorithm, for efficiently discovering recently <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> from a data stream is proposed in this paper. The appearing bit sequences are used to monitor the occurrences of patterns within a sliding window. Two versions of algorithms are proposed by maintaining the appearing bit sequences of maximum <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> and closed <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> respectively. Accordingly, the cost of re-mining <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> over a sliding window is reduced to that of monitoring frequency changes of the maintained patterns. The experimental results show that the incremental mining methods perform much better than the re-miming approach...|$|R

30|$|Frankly speaking, it is {{not easy}} to {{discover}} the valuable knowledge from our real life. For this issue, the past studies made on knowledge discovery can be categorized two classifications, namely, algorithm-driven and application-driven studies. Algorithm-driven studies focused on how to increase the efficiency, while the application-driven ones focused on how to successfully apply the mining algorithms to applications. In this paper, on one hand, we propose an efficient mining algorithm to discover the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> On the other hand, an application for music recommendation is lifted to justify the motivation of pattern mining. In terms of mining algorithm, first, we construct an informative index called QPI containing positions and occurrences of patterns. It can effectively reduce the cost of mining of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> By QPI, a prefix-search-based algorithm named FMRP performs efficiently on mining the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> In terms of application, a music recommender system based on the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> is proposed to cope with problems in traditional recommender systems. The main intent is to link the user preferences and the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> on music. The experimental results reveal that our proposed mining algorithm is more efficient than the compared methods on different data. Moreover, the proposed recommender system based on the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> performs more effective in facing very sparse data. This is just the beginning of applying the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> In the future, the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> will further be used as representative features in recognizing objects in other real applications.|$|R

30|$|Mining the {{valuable}} knowledge from real data {{has been a}} hot topic for a long time. <b>Repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is one of the}} important knowledge, occurring in many real applications such as musical data and medical data. In this paper, our purposes are to contribute an efficient mining algorithm for <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> and to conduct a real application using the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> mined. In terms of mining the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> although a number of past studies were made on this issue, the performance cannot still earn the users’ satisfactions especially for large data sets. For this issue, in this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm named Fast Mining of <b>Repeating</b> <b>Patterns,</b> which achieves high performance of discovering the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> by a novel index called Quick-Pattern Index. In terms of applications, a music recommender system named repeating-pattern-based music recommender system is proposed to deal with problems in music recommendation.

The experimental results show that our proposed mining algorithm and recommender system outperform the previous works in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, respectively.|$|R
30|$|The great {{progress}} {{of information technology}} makes the real data grow rapidly. Actually, {{there is a large}} amount of knowledge in these data such as graph data, sequence data, transaction data, and so on. Therefore, data mining on pattern discovery has been studied for many decades. To discover the valuable patterns hidden in the real data, a number of mining algorithms are proposed nowadays. In recent studies, the patterns are categorized into several categories, including association patterns, sequential <b>patterns,</b> cyclic <b>patterns,</b> <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> and so on. Different patterns are useful to different fields of data engineering. For association patterns, they are motivated by applications of market basket analysis to discover relations between products purchased. For sequential patterns, they are somewhat different from the association patterns, because the sequential patterns are with temporal continuities. For cyclic patterns, the starting pattern is also the ending pattern in a sequence, which can be viewed as the extension of sequential <b>patterns.</b> For <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> contains a set of sequential elements, which can also be viewed as a sequence repeats in a regular form. For example, a string { 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2 } contains a repeating substring { 1, 2 }, which is identified as a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern.</b> The major difference between the cyclic <b>patterns</b> and <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> is that a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> does not need to consider the start and end of a sequence must be the same. In fact, <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> are popular, because they can be regarded as a set of representative patterns facilitating object recognition. Lots of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> appear in our life, such as musical data and medical data.|$|R
30|$|Note that, {{for music}} recommendation, the <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> is {{somewhat}} {{different from that}} in Definition  1. In formal, assume {{that there are two}} repeating substrings A and C in a string B, where A contains C. Here, even if A contains C, A and C are both kept as our <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> for music recommendation. For example, the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> of a string { 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 } include { 1, 2, 3 }, { 1, 2 } and { 2, 3 }.|$|R

30|$|Hsu et al. [9] {{proposed}} {{a method to}} generate the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this method, a string-join operation and a data structure called RP tree were proposed to achieve high performance of mining of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> The basic idea {{of this approach is}} to iteratively join two short <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> into a long one. To speed up the join procedure, a tree structure named RP tree was proposed. Although the tree structure can reduce the time complexity of join operations, the checking cost is so high that the generation of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> is inefficient. In addition to RP tree, another tree structure for generating the <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> is suffix tree. Basically, the suffix tree is the compressed tree for the nonempty suffixes of a string. Since a suffix tree is a compressed tree, it consists of an important idea that the procedure of mining of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> highly refers to its sub-trees. Once constructed, several operations can be performed quickly, for instance, locating a substring, locating matches for a regular expression pattern, etc. Suffix trees also provide the linear-time solution for the longest common substring problem [16, 20]. Unfortunately, the construction of such a tree for a string takes much time and space.|$|R

5000|$|The {{principle}} behind Banburismus {{is relatively}} simple (and {{seems to be}} rather similar to the Index of Coincidence). If two sentences in English or German are written down one above the other, and a count is made of how often a letter in one message {{is the same as}} the corresponding letter in the other message; there will be more matches than would occur if the sentences were random strings of letters. For a random sequence, the repeat rate for single letters is expected to be 1 in 26 (around 3.8%), and for the German Navy messages it was shown to be 1 in 17 (5.9%). If the two messages were in depth, then the matches occur just as they did in the plaintexts. However, if the messages were not in depth, then the two ciphertexts will compare as if they were random, giving a repeat rate of about 1 in 26. This allows an attacker to take two messages whose indicators differ only in the third character, and slide them against each other looking for the giveaway <b>repeat</b> <b>pattern</b> that shows where they align in depth.|$|E

40|$|The {{elementary}} {{building block}} of all intermediate filaments (IFs) is a dimer featuring a central a-helical rod domain flanked by the N- and C-terminal end domains. In nuclear IF proteins (lamins), the rod domain {{consists of two}} coiled-coil segments, coil 1 and coil 2, that are connected by a short non-helical linker. Coil and the C-terminal part of coil 2 contain the two highly conserved IF consensus motifs involved in the longitudinal assembly of dimers. The previously solved crystal structure of a lamin A fragment (residues 305 - 387) corresponding to {{the second half of}} coil 2 has yielded a parallel left-handed coiled coil. Here, we present the crystal structure and solution properties of another human lamin A fragment (residues 328 - 398), which is largely overlapping with fragment 305 - 387 but harbors a short segment of the tail domain. Unexpectedly, no parallel coiled coil forms within the crystal. Instead, the a-helices are arranged such that two anti-parallel coiled-coil interfaces are formed. The most significant interface has a right-handed geometry, which is accounted for by a characteristic 15 -residue <b>repeat</b> <b>pattern</b> that overlays with the canonical heptad <b>repeat</b> <b>pattern.</b> The second interface is a left-handed anti-parallel coiled coil based on the predicted heptad <b>repeat</b> <b>pattern.</b> In solution, the fragment reveals only a weak dimerization propensity. We speculate that the C-terminus of coil 2 might unzip, thereby allowing for a right-handed coiled-coil interface to form between two laterally aligned dimers. Such an interface might co-exist with a heterotetrameric left-handed coiled-coil assembly, which is expected to be responsible for the longitudinal A(CN) contact. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
