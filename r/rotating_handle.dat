25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
50|$|The {{retractable}} {{bridge at}} Lock 11 replaced the original swing bridge in 1900. It is {{operated by a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> and a cogged wheel which causes the bridge deck to roll forwards and backwards on rails and comes to rest across the lock chamber. The canal has towpaths on both sides from Ardrishaig to Crinan Bridge and horses assisted unpowered craft until 1959.|$|E
50|$|The SSG 2000 {{is derived}} from the Sauer 80/90 target rifle. It has a bolt action with <b>rotating</b> <b>handle,</b> but {{non-rotating}} bolt. When the handle is rotated to close the action, six lugs are driven onwards from the rear part of the bolt body to lock into the receiver. The action also features a loaded chamber indicator. The heavy barrel is hammer-forged and has a flash hider/muzzle brake unit installed. The wooden stock is adjustable. The trigger is two-stage.|$|E

50|$|The {{weapon was}} fired by <b>rotating</b> the <b>handle,</b> with the barrels firing in sequence. By <b>rotating</b> the <b>handle</b> quickly {{a high rate of}} fire could be achieved, or slowly, single shots. Once the nine rounds of {{ammunition}} in the chamber were expended, the cylinder could be removed for reloading and a fresh cylinder could be inserted into the breech.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were three}} {{significant}} models {{on the same}} chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A sliding sun roof was standard, operated by a <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> above the driver. Folding rear arm rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings.|$|E
5000|$|Secateurs have short {{handles and}} are {{operated}} with one hand. [...] A spring between the handles causes the jaws to open again after closing. When not in use, the jaws may be held closed by a safety catch or by a loop holding the handles together. Some types {{are designed for}} right-handed or left-handed use only, and some incorporate a <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> to reduce friction and minimize hand stress during repetitive use. There are also longer versions called telescopic pruners, which are adjustable for long-reach and operate {{by means of a}} rod system inside of a telescoping pole between the handles and the blades. An early version of these was known as an averruncator.|$|E
5000|$|On June 8, 2001, Usachov {{performed}} {{his seventh}} career spacewalk. He and NASA astronaut James Voss donned spacesuits entered the small, spherical transfer compartment at the forward {{end of the}} Zvezda Service Module during an [...] "internal" [...] spacewalk. The spacewalk at the ISS was the first without {{the presence of a}} shuttle. Just after the ISS flew over {{the dark side of the}} Earth, they removed a hatch at the Earth-facing part of the compartment to open it to the vacuum of space and officially begin the spacewalk at 9:21 a.m CDT. During the 19-minute spacewalk which ended at 9:40 a.m. CDT, Usachov and Voss moved a docking cone from storage and using a <b>rotating</b> <b>handle,</b> installed it in the lower port hatch. The installation of the docking cone was necessary to prepare for the arrival of the Russian docking compartment.|$|E
25|$|The Jarmann M1884 fired a 10.15mm {{black powder}} {{cartridge}} in an 8-round, tubular magazine {{in which the}} rounds were lined up in a tube below the barrel.

However, this action is not considered strong enough to fire modern ammunition, since the only locking {{is provided by the}} <b>rotating</b> bolt <b>handle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary: hand {{orientation}} (supinated, neutral, pronated) and grip width {{are commonly}} varied during pull-ups and lat pull-downs {{in an attempt}} to focus the training on specific muscle groups or to ensure that the movement is specific to the sporting action. the aim of this article was to identify if varying grip width and hand orientation effects muscle activity during pull-ups and lat pull-downs. it has been demonstrated that using <b>rotating</b> <b>handles</b> during pull-ups or using a pronated grip during lat pull-downs tends to result in the greatest activation of the latissimus dorsi, with no difference in latissimus dorsi activity between grip widths...|$|R

5000|$|The device {{consisted}} of a circular dial with a single central rotating pointer, like a clock. The dial was engraved with the ranges in yards. The clockwork motor drove the pointer at a constant rate determined by a control on the right hand side of the device. This had a handle and its own dial, on which {{the rate of change}} of range (or [...] "range rate") could be selected. This was calculated by other means, often by use of a Dumaresq or a time-and-range plot. A second <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> was fitted {{to the left of the}} clock. This was connected by gears to the dial plate, which rather than being fixed as on a clock, could be rotated. One turn of the handle would rotate the scale 100 yd relative to the pointer. Thus the clock could be set to the initial range to a ship, or corrections could be made to update the reading without disturbing the mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Early cannons were muzzle-loading, {{but were}} {{replaced}} later with breech-loading models. These {{are used in}} modern whaling, {{with the exception of}} many Norwegian cannons which utilize an improved muzzle-loading design, with a breech firing system. In the early 20th century, almost all cannons were similar to the Kongsberg 90 mm design. With a trigger mounted {{on the back of a}} steel handle which would lever a thin rod up to the firing device in the horizontally sliding breechblock. To load, the rear cover plate would be rotated, exposing the back of the rectangular breechblock. The breechblock would be opened by rotating a handle on the top of the breech, and the spent cartridge case removed, to be reloaded with powder and wadding. A new cartridge would be prepared and slid up into the firing chamber, the breechblock would be closed by rotating the handle counterclockwise, the rear cover would be rotated back to cover the rear chamber, a harpoon would be prepared, inserted into the muzzle, and tied on. Then another <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> on the side of the breechblock would be pulled back to cock the firing pin. This handle was directly adjacent to the firing trigger on the block. The gun was solid steel, and had a glycerin recoil cylinder mounted under the barrel. The inner barrel and breech would bounce back on the recoil, while the handle and swivel in the deck would be mounted on a stationary outer cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The Ferguson rifle: British Major Patrick Ferguson {{designed}} his rifle, {{considered to}} be the first military breechloader, in the 1770s. A plug-shaped breechblock was screw-threaded so that <b>rotating</b> the <b>handle</b> underneath would lower and raise it for loading with ball and powder; the flintlock action still required conventional priming.|$|R
5000|$|Pull-ups (including chins) can be {{done with}} a supinated, neutral or pronated grip (often called [...] "chin-ups", [...] "hammer grip pull-ups", and [...] "pull-ups", in order). Grips may match each other or be {{different}} (mixed grip). Grips may also rotate throughout the movement, such as by doing them on rings, <b>rotating</b> <b>handles</b> (false grip) or pull up handles. The range of motion used by trainers can vary. The fullest possible range is with straight arms overhead (elbow directly above shoulder), to pulling when the arms are at the sides (elbow directly below shoulder). People sometimes only train portions, such as avoiding locking out the arms at the bottom, or stopping when the head/chin/neck touch the bar. Positions within the range are also trained isometrically, as in flexed-arm and straight-arm hangs for time.|$|R

40|$|Considering {{human being}} {{as a control}} element in a {{feed-back}} control system, we use as input random noise, {{in the form of}} electrical voltage, generated by a noise-generator. We use as controled system 1, 1 /s 1 /s+ 1, 1 /s (s+ 1), 1 /s^ 2, using an analogue computer, and a potentiometer having circularly <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> at operation point. We perform experiments in error-compensating manual control system. We let an amateur perform error-compensating operations until he is considered to be sufficiently proficient, and we analyze its process. What is unique in this study is that we consider the gain which is obtained by taking the difference between the circular transfer function including the human operator and human transfer function; and that we study the human characteristics when we change the gain before and after the Human operator, with the product of the two gains kept constant. We obtained better control results for controled systems of first order than those of zero order. We found also that for controled system of second order it is likely to diverge and it requires considerable proficience to control. We think it is impossible to controled systems of more than second order. For error e，we take control area ∫^T_O |e|dt and ∫^T_O e^ 2 dt，and we state progress of learning as effect of human learning...|$|E

40|$|The {{latent period}} of visual sensor motor {{reaction}} depends, in part, on the sensory and integrative {{processes in the}} brain, but is also influenced by {{the rate of the}} muscle contraction. There is no clear evidence in the literature whether the rotational inertia of segments of limbs has any direct effect on the reaction time. The aim of our study was to identify this relationship. The study involved 566 right handed students aged 16 – 17 of both genders beginning their post puberty period. Reaction time was measured during experimental adduction of the forearm and hand, using a special <b>rotating</b> <b>handle</b> and lever connected to a computer that recorded the reaction time (~ 1 ms). Calculations of the rotational inertia were carried out using regression models by Zatsiorsky and other authors. Each gender group was divided into three subgroups: with high, medium and low values of rotational inertia. It was found that individuals with high values of rotational inertia of forearm and wrist demonstrated significantly longer reaction times. This pattern was apparent in both gender groups. Although males illustrated greater values of rotational inertia than females they demonstrated relatively shorter reaction times. This contradiction can be explained by greater muscle power of young men. We recommend taking into account the amount of rotational inertia of the responsive segment in all kinds of research which require measurement of reaction time. The article was translated by the authors...|$|E
