5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E

We find that, {{as part of this}} process, decoherence is necessarily induced on any quantum system described relative to these frames. We explore this process with examples involving <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> for phase and orientation. Quantifying the effect of changing quantum <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> provides a theoretical description for this process in quantum experiments, and serves as a first step in developing a relativity principle for theories in which all objects including <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> are necessarily quantum.

50|$|Some modern video {{encoding}} standards, such as H.264/AVC, {{allow the}} use of multiple <b>reference</b> <b>frames.</b> This allows the video encoder to choose among more than one previously decoded frame on which to base each macroblock in the next frame. While the best frame for this purpose is usually the previous <b>frame,</b> the extra <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> can improve compression efficiency and/or video quality. Note that different <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> can be chosen for different macroblocks in the same frame. The maximum number of concurrent <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> supported by H.264 is 16. Different <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> can be chosen for each 8x8 partition of a macroblock. Another video format that supports multiple <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> is Snow, which can handle up to eight. The Theora codec provides a limited form of multiple <b>reference</b> <b>frames,</b> allowing <b>references</b> to both the preceding frame and the most recent intra frame.|$|R
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E
5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic {{parameters}} {{for such a}} large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as {{the central part of}} the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E
25|$|Physics in non-inertial {{reference}} frames was historically {{treated by}} a coordinate transformation, first, to an inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> performing the necessary calculations therein, and using another {{to return to}} the non-inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> In most such situations, the same laws of physics can be used if certain predictable fictitious forces are added into consideration; an example is a uniformly rotating <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> which can be treated as an inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> if one adds a fictitious centrifugal force and Coriolis force into consideration.|$|E

25|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of any entity {{depends on the}} <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> {{in which it is}} measured. However the total energy of an {{isolated}} system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> This is called the Oberth effect. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.|$|E

In this framework, the existence of perfect classical <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> is usually assumed. However, such ideal <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> might not always be available. The <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> required in metrology strategies can either degrade or become misaligned during the estimation process. We investigate how the imperfectness of <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> leads to noise which in general affects the ultimate precision limits in measurement of physical parameters. Moreover, since quantum parameter estimation can be phrased as a quantum communication protocol between two parties, our results provide deeper insight into quantum communication protocols with misaligned <b>reference</b> <b>frames.</b> Our framework allows {{for the study of}} general noise on the efficiency of such schemes.

25|$|Since {{there is}} no {{absolute}} <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> in relativity theory, a concept of 'moving' doesn't strictly exist, as everything is always moving with respect to some other <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> Instead, any two frames that move {{at the same speed}} in the same direction are said to be comoving. Therefore, S and S′ are not comoving.|$|E
25|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of such systems {{depends on the}} choice of {{reference}} frame: the <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> that gives the minimum value of that energy {{is the center of}} momentum frame, i.e. the <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the invariant mass of the system as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} not always so trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> doesn't see objects he would describe as moving faster {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.|$|E

Based on this investigation, we also propose a motion range prediction (MRP) method to exploit <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> and precisely guide the statistical motion learning process.

25|$|The speed, {{and thus}} the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by {{choosing}} a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> of this observer. The same bullet is stationary {{from the point of}} view of an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy. By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's invariant mass, which is independent of the <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

25|$|If one <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> is {{assigned}} {{precisely the same}} time to two events that are at different points in space, a <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> that is moving relative to the first will generally assign different times to the two events.

50|$|When decoding, <b>reference</b> <b>frames</b> must {{be stored}} in memory until {{they are no longer}} needed for further decoding.
