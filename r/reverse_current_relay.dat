50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R

30|$|In [72], an {{algorithm}} {{for distance}} and over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> coordination is discussed which uses GA as solver. In this article, the fitness function for optimal combine distance <b>relays</b> to over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> coordination is formulated by adding new terms {{to the time}} inverse over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> coordination fitness function as discussed in [6]. Additional terms in fitness function of time inverse over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> coordination problem, results in optimal selection of zone- 2 for distance relays. The various time-inverse over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> characteristics are considered for each back up over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> {{and the best of}} them are selected using GA as a solver. In [73], another method was also discussed for optimization of zone- 2 operational time of distance relays. This method provides better backup protection and higher line protection coverage as compare to other methods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{design and}} {{application}} of a fuzzy logic based controller to a leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> was presented in this paper. A novel approach based on fuzzy logic to form the tripping action of leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> was investigated. In addition to the theoretical aspect of fuzzy logic, detection of a leakage current, measurement of the leakage current, determination of its duration, trip opening of faulty cases and detailed system architecture were also introduced. The inspected fuzzy logic technique to control the tripping action of the leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> was intended to improve the performance of conventional leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> control for human safety and system reliability. The relationship between the controlled output of the fuzzy processor and properties of leakage current for the proposed relay was explored by using a graphical output expression. It was observed that the proposed leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> based on fuzzy logic was more reliable than conventional leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay...</b>|$|R
30|$|Another {{method for}} {{automatically}} determining the optimum timing for Zone- 2 of distance relays with directional over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> had {{been discussed in}} [74]. In [74], optimal coordination between distance relays and directional over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> for a series compensated lines had been discussed. In order to solve this non-linear and non-convex combine distance and over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> coordination problem, a modified adaptive particle swarm optimization (MAPSO) was used in [75].|$|R
40|$|Short circuit {{interruption}} {{that often}} {{occur at the}} distribution system 20 KV can cause distruption {{of the distribution of}} electrical energy to the consumer. This short circuit interruption can be resolved by doing the coordination of protection at distribution system 20 KV to isolate the interference well and protect the equipment at distribution system 20 KV. Coordination between over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> on side of incoming or outgoing at Penyulang Palur 12 and recloser as a primary protection must be exact and appropriated. The purpose of this research is to know the over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> and recloser settings more appropriated based of the short circuit which happens at distribution system 20 KV Penyulang Palur 12. Setting time of over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> on incoming side(0, 7) over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> on outgoing side(0, 5) and recloser(0, 3) agree with IEE 242 - 1986 standard whch have minimal time setting is 0, 3 second. Research begins with collection electrical data at penyulang Palur 12. And then determine the setting of over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> and recloser. Then illustrate the curve of coordination over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> and recloser. The protection’s place more further from the powergrid, setting of the current and time should be getting smaller...|$|R

If the sum reward with selecting the <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> {{is larger than the}} one without selecting the <b>current</b> <b>relay,</b> the PU makes a stop and vice versa. Therefore, the multiple relay selection problem can be further formulated as a sequential decision problem which can be solved by the optimal multiple stopping theory.|$|R
30|$|Protection schemes are {{provided}} for distribution systems for quick disconnection of faulty section from the remaining healthy portion of power system. Main aim of protection schemes is {{to restrict the}} fault spread. Normally distribution lines and feeders are protected by over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> [5]. Over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> are used as primary {{as well as in}} backup protection relays for the distribution networks. However, their slow operating speed is not a desirable feature for their application as primary protection schemes for sub transmission systems. For sub transmission systems, distance relays are ideal choice for primary protection and over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> are used in back up protection relays.|$|R
25|$|For a bias {{less than}} the PIV, the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is very small. For a normal P–N {{rectifier}} diode, the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> through the device in the micro-ampere (µA) range is very low. However, this is temperature dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, {{a substantial amount of}} <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> can be observed (mA or more).|$|R
40|$|The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> {{tends to}} occur in the {{transition}} region of the guiding magnetic field in a magnetically insulated coaxial diode (MICD). Influence of the guiding magnetic field on characteristics of the MICD especially on the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is studied by the particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation in this paper. The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is confirmed to be irrelevant with the guiding magnetic field strength. However, the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is clarified quantitatively to depend on the electric and magnetic field distribution in the upstream of the cathode tip. As the MICD has been widely employed in microwave tubes, a simple approach to suppress the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> on the premise of little change of the original diode is valuable and thus proposed. The optimum matching point between the cathode and the magnetic field is selected in consideration of the entrance depth tolerance, the diode impedance discrepancy and the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> coefficient...|$|R
30|$|From the literature, {{it is also}} {{observed}} that, the relay coordination problems are optimised without any upper limit of CTI [21, 43]. This results in delayed operation of backup over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> particularly when the fault current contribution from Photovoltaic based DER is weak. Operating time of over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> for such systems is enhanced by optimal selection of multiple time-inverse relay characterises during relay coordination studies [115].|$|R

40|$|An {{idealized}} {{steady state}} {{model of a}} stream of energetic electrons neutralized by a <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> in the pre-flare solar plasma was developed. These calculations indicate that, in some cases, a significant fraction of the beam energy may be dissipated by the <b>reverse</b> <b>current.</b> Joule heating by the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is a more effective mechanism for heating the plasma than collisional losses from the energetic electrons because the Ohmic losses are caused by thermal electrons in the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> which have much shorter mean free paths than the energetic electrons. The heating due to <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> is calculated for two injected energetic electron fluxes. For the smaller injected flux, {{the temperature of the}} coronal plasma is raised by about a factor of two. The larger flux causes the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> drift velocity to exceed the critical velocity for the onset of ion cyclotron turbulence, producing anomalous resistivity and an order of magnitude increase in the temperature. The heating is so rapid that the lack of ionization equilibrium may produce a soft X-ray and EUV pulse from the corona...|$|R
50|$|When diodes {{switch from}} forward {{conduction}} to reverse cut-off, a <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> flows briefly as stored charge is removed. It is the abruptness with which this <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> ceases which characterises the step recovery diode.|$|R

Microscopic changes as a result of hot spots defects and overheating of the solar module, linked to <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> effects, were also documented and discussed. Experimental evidence showed that different levels of <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> are confirmed to be a major degrading factor affecting the performance, efficiency, and power of solar modules...|$|R
30|$|Application of {{mathematical}} based optimization methods for relay coordination was first time proposed by A.T. Urdanta et al. in 1988 [6]. In that paper, two techniques were suggested for solving the time inverse over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> coordination problem. First technique was applicable for fixed network configuration {{and second one}} was for a variable network configuration. The optimization problems were formulated as a minimax problem for multiple network configurations. In [29] a methodology based on the linear programming and considering the definite time backup relays for optimal relay settings was presented. Linear programming methods were simple and easily converge to optimal solutions. But they were only helpful for optimal selection of TDS of over <b>current</b> <b>relays.</b> Designer experience was used for selection of plug settings (PSs) of over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> in relay coordination problems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the energy levels of intrinsic defects in high-purity semi-insulating 4 H-SiC, we apply discharge current transient spectroscopy (DCTS), a graphical peak analysis method {{based on the}} transient <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> of a Schottky barrier diode, because transient capacitance methods such as deep level transient spectroscopy and isothermal capacitance transient spectroscopy are feasible only in low-resistivity semiconductors. The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> consists of the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> through the balk and the surface leakage current of the diode. It is elucidated that the sacrificial oxidation could dramatically reduce the surface currents of diodes {{in the case of}} high-purity semi-insulating 4 H-SiC, suggesting that the densities and emission rates of traps in the bulk of the SiC can be determined from the transient <b>reverse</b> <b>current...</b>|$|R
30|$|The time inverse-relay {{characteristics}} of over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> are mathematically modelled using curve-fitting techniques. From these modelled time-inverse characteristics, time dial settings (TDS) and operating {{time of the}} over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> are calculated. These methods began with a functional form such as polynomials function, which {{has the potential of}} approximating the published relay curves. Thereafter, the functional coefficients are determined by using computer, which best fits to the curves. Developmental work using these techniques up to 1989 are available in IEEE Committee report [10].|$|R

If such solar cells are encapsulated into solar modules, hot-spot phenomenon will emerge in use. In this paper, the effect of <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> on reliability of crystalline silicon solar modules was investigated. Based on the experiments, considering the different shaded rate of cells, the relation between <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> of crystalline silicon solar cells and conduction of bypass diode was investigated for the first time.

40|$|Rectifying {{contacts}} to polycrystalline diamond (PCD) can he improved significantly {{by using}} a metal/undoped PCD/p-type doped PCD structure. In this paper, {{a model for the}} <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> of a metal/undoped PCD/p-type doped PCD junction diode is proposed. In this model, the undoped PCD is treated as a slightly doped p-type semiconductor due to the existence of the deep level defects of acceptor-states. The electric field, which is needed to calculate the <b>reverse</b> <b>current.</b> is obtained by considering the p-type doped PCD layer and the undoped PCD layer as a high-low junction. The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is therefore, modeled as the transport of holes through the undoped PCD layer based on the Poole-Frenkel effect. The simulated <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is compared with experimental results and a good agreement between the simulated and experimental results is achieved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
