2500|$|The Disciplinary Directorate, the Board of Discipline, and the Disciplinary Committee {{form the}} {{foundation}} of the disciplinary process of the Institute. These entities are quasi-judicial and have substantial powers like that of a Civil Court to summon and enforce attendance or require discovery and production of documents on affidavit or otherwise. The Disciplinary Directorate is headed by an officer designated as Director (Discipline). On receipt of any information or complaint that a member has allegedly engaged in any misconduct, the Director (Discipline) shall arrive at a prima facie opinion {{whether or not there is}} any misconduct. If the Director (Discipline) is of the opinion that the misconduct is covered by the items listed in the first schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, he shall refer the case to the Board of Discipline. If he is of the Opinion that the case is covered by the Second Schedule or both schedules of the CA Act, he will refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee. If the Board of Discipline finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> for up to three months or impose a fine up to 1,00,000/-. If the Disciplinary Committee finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> permanently or impose a fine up to 5,000/-. [...] Any member aggrieved by any order may approach the Appellate Authority.|$|E
2500|$|To {{give people}} shares {{initially}} there is formally a two step process. First, under CA 2006 section 558, shares must be [...] "allotted", or created {{in favour of}} a particular person. Second, shares are [...] "issued" [...] by being [...] "transferred" [...] to a person. In practice, because shares are not usually ‘bearer shares’ (i.e. the share is a physical piece of paper), the [...] "transfer" [...] simply means that the person’s name is entered on the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>members.</b> Under CA 2006 sections 768 and 769, a certificate that evidences the share issue should be given by the company within two months. In a typical company constitution, directors are entitled to issue shares {{as part of their}} general management rights, although they have no power to do so outside the constitution. An authorisation must state the maximum number of allottable shares and the authority can only last for five years.|$|E
