With the development of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market in recent years, the non-rational growth of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credit</b> of the commercial banks in China has increased the risk of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credit.</b> The paper assesses the credit risk of listed <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> companies based on logistic regression model. The results show that on the whole the logistic regression model can predict accurately.

In addition, the assessment results of logistic regression model demonstrates that the prediction is asymmetric because the model makes a high predictive accuracy for credit non-default group, while a low predictive accuracy for credit default group...|$|R

In light of global <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> bubbles, China's <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> cycle has attracted wide attention since 1998. The present paper analyzes three driving {{factors in the}} context of the current <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> cycle; namely, economic growth, macroeconomic environment and institutional establishment. Supported by econometric analysis using quarterly data from 1992 - 2004, the present paper indicates that <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> will develop steadily and that housing prices will consistently rise in the relative long run. Based on quantitative analysis, it is concluded that the implications of the current <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> cycle for financial stability include risks of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credit</b> exposure, government guarantees and maturity mismatch. Some corresponding policy implications are discussed, such as advancing banking reform, encouraging the rational behavior of local governments and strengthening the regulation of foreign capital flows in and out of China's <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> industry.

We study two questions: (i) do the liabilities have an important impact on the optimal asset allocation? (ii) do alternative asset classes add value relative to stocks and bonds? We empirically examine these questions using a vector autogression for returns, liabilities and macro-economic state variables. We find {{that the costs of}} ignoring the liabilities in the asset allocation are substantial and increase with the investment horizon. Second, the augmented asset menu adds value from the perspective of hedging the liabilities...|$|R

There are two basic reasons that explain the withdrawal of mortgage banks from the current events in <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> debt finance. Both are linked to a lack of risk identification in <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investment. First, mortgage banks are engaged in a portfolio of bad <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>credits.</b> In the past and today, banks do not receive information to price the true property risks. Especially from their money transfer to eastern Germany they still suffer of high deprecations in these engagements. The high impact of single properties can not be diversified. This is why banks were exposed to higher risks than they calculated in their market risk exposure. On the other hand, the preparation for Basel II indicates how sensitive risk have to be treated according to the new regulatory environment. This causes a split of relationship ties where <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> risks were not priced for decades. The result is a failure of all sorts of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> finance in Germany.

It is important that creditors identify the risks associated to the credit in order for the bank to avoid credit losses in the future. The purpose of our study is to find out how Sweden's major banks are working with risk management when credit rating a customer and revaluating risk during the operating credit period. We also examined how banks appraise a property to be mortgaged. This study is based on a qualitative methodology where we have used a semi-structured interview when interviewing representatives from each of the four major banks in Sweden; Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and Swedbank. The results shows that banks identify and manage the risks and uncertainties associated with granting loans by working on the basis of guidelines and policies. However, there are no guidelines for how the soft factors must be analysed when credit rating, even though they are very important to the banks. When appraising commercial <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> in connection to credit rating the banks use multiple valuation methods to ensure the value of the property. The study also shows that banks are working similar because of the fact that they are highly regulated and supervised.
