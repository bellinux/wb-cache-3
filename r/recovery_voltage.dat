The objective is to realistically capture the dynamic characteristics of <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> phenomena, avoiding, however, the full scale transient simulation. The approach uses the quadratized power flow model with explicit induction motor representation.

These methods are temporary load interruption and the use of Static Var Compensators (SVCs). The loads are temporarily tripped and then reconnected. The locations and sizes of SVCs are also determined. The criterion to be met is the <b>recovery</b> of <b>voltages</b> at all buses in the network to 0. 9 pu within 1 s following a disturbance. Simulations are done on a typical distribution system with a large number of motor loads using Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) software with the help of Python programming language for automation and control and the results are analyzed. The results show that load interruption aids and significantly improves the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> following a disturbance in the network. It is also observed from the results that the use of SVCs also enables the voltage to recover faster with the criterion for <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> at all buses fulfilled. However, the best results are obtained when load interruption is combined with the use of SVCs. The two methods complement each other. When the two methods are combined the amount of load that has to be interrupted is less and the number of SVCs required is also reduced. This results in fewer loads being interrupted. Moreover, the investment cost on SVCs is also reduced...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, the voltage {{stability}} and post disturbance <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> times are investigated for the Nordic 32 test system for different load combinations {{with and without}} large scale integration of solar PV power plants. In addition, the mitigation of the voltage stability and <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time phenomena through various Dynamic Var Compensators are investigated. The study is commenced with {{detailed analysis of the}} Nordic- 32 test system that mimics the Swedish power grid through a Power System Simulation Software (PSS/E). The dynamic analysis was then done through PSS/E dynamic simulation capability to investigate the fault induced VRT (<b>Voltage</b> <b>Recovery</b> Time) through different load combinations in the system. It has been found that the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time when induction motor loads are introduced beside complex (constant impedance and constant current) loads is significantly higher than that of the case when having complex loads only. Moreover, the system is {{more likely to have a}} voltage collapse with less number of cascaded disturbances in the case when having induction motors in the system. Also, if induction motor loads are dispersed throughout the weak buses in the system instead of being concentrated into a single bus, the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time increases even more and the system becomes much more prone to a voltage collapse. The improvement of the voltage stability of the system has been done through the installation of Dynamic Var Compensators at the point of common coupling with the induction motor loads. The performance of various Dynamic Var Compensators such as Static Var Compensators (SVC) and Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOM) has been investigated in the mitigation of the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time with different load combinations and it has been found that the STATCOM was superior to the SVC in reducing the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time and postponing the voltage collapse. The base case with the induction motor loads was able to withstand N- 1 contingency. SVCs and STATCOMs are installed at the induction motor load buses with the same rating of 300 Mvar capacitive power for both devices such that the minimum voltage sag induced due to the fault doesn’t decrease below 0. 8 p. u. It has been noticed that the system was able to withstand N- 2 contingency for both compensators cases. For the case with SVC the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time was reduced from 0. 9 seconds in the base case to 0. 665 seconds which corresponds to a reduction of 26 % of <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time with a minimum voltage sag of 0. 8 p. u. However, for the case with STATCOM, the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time was reduced to 0. 364 seconds that corresponds to a reduction of 60 % of <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time with a minimum voltage sag of 0. 87 p. u. The effects of large scale solar PV plants penetration has been investigated. It has been found that the maximum allowable solar PV penetration is 30 % of the total generation for the base case due to the limits imposed by the Nordic Grid Code for frequency deviations due to the lack of inertia for PV plants. It has been also found that the voltage stability gets worse due to the increase in the <b>voltage</b> <b>recovery</b> time in the case of 30 % PV penetration, this is because the time constant for the exciter models of the conventional generating units in PSS/E is less than that of the PV model. Adding to that, the significant reactive power losses in the transmission lines since the PV plants located far away v from the load center. The effect of irradiance changes with load profile changes throughout year has been investigated.
