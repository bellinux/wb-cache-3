2500|$|New Zealand lies {{along the}} {{boundary}} between the Australian and Pacific Plates. In the South Island most of the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> between these plates is taken up along a single dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault with a major reverse component, the Alpine Fault. In the North Island, the displacement is mainly taken up along the Kermadec subduction zone, although the remaining dextral strike-slip component [...] of the relative plate motion is accommodated by the North Island Fault System (NIFS). A group of dextral strike-slip structures, known as the Marlborough Fault System, transfer displacement between the mainly transform and convergent type plate boundaries in a complex zone at the northern end of South Island.|$|E
2500|$|While the C5 {{may have}} been {{initially}} criticized for using inexpensive materials and older technology (e.g., [...] composites in body panels and floor boards; an OHV engine; and leaf springs), ostensibly as cost-cutting measures, these components are actually very strong for their relatively light weight (low mass), or have proven reliability. The C5's modular body panels make excellent use of a lightweight composite material known in the automotive industry as SMC or Sheet Molded Composite, a type of fiberglass that is blended and bonded with plastics. SMC provides better protection against direct blows because it is very stiff and will not dent. The floor boards on the C5 are a composite sandwich of SMC with balsa wood in the middle. Balsa wood was chosen for its extreme stiffness, light weight and excellent sound absorption qualities. The all aluminium LS1 overhead valve engine is much lighter than its cast iron predecessor, the LT1, and provides for a much lower hoodline when compared to an overhead cam design of <b>relative</b> <b>displacement.</b> The composite leaf springs are much lighter and sit much lower than typical coil springs and help provide the C5 with its excellent ride characteristics and distinctive ride height.|$|E
2500|$|The Roadmaster {{received}} its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased. The biggest change {{was a much}} larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an “observation car.” It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced [...] "VentiPorts." [...] Four were displayed {{on each of the}} Roadmaster's front fenders, with three on the fenders of the Super, Century, and Special. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car’s hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief Harlow Curtice was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> of the straight-eight engine installed.|$|E
30|$|With {{regards to}} {{displacement}} limits, the plasticity literature usually reports {{means for the}} horizontal distances between crown centroid and stem base, often as <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> (displacement divided by mean crown radius), but maximum values are less common. [Muth and Bazzaz (2003]) show <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> less than 1 for mixed hardwoods. In old-growth European beech, [Schröter et al. (2012]) found a maximum displacement of 6.26 m. [Longuetaud et al. (2013]) gave <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> of up to 7.68 in mixed broadleaves. In Scots pine, [Vacchiano et al. (2011]) calculated stand means between 1.0 and 3.9 m across 4 sites in the Alps. Figure five of [Gatziolis et al. (2010]) shows horizontal deviations between surveyed stem base and LiDAR-assessed tree top exceeding 10 m in both conifers and hardwoods, although some of that {{may be due to}} measurement error.|$|R

The influences of temperature differences on radius <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> of the contact node pairs and the sensor pre-pressure were obtained.

So the transfer of pressure that the strip applied on the outer surface of shapemeter roll is seriously affected, and the shape measuring signal is interrupted...|$|R

30|$|The {{accuracy}} of the <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> depends on the atmospheric environment, distance to targeted area, topographic features, {{and size of the}} moving area relative {{to the size of the}} stationary area. Monserrat et al. (2014) reviewed the {{accuracy of}} the GB-InSAR of different manufacturers and Atzeni et al. (2015) compared the displacements of the GB-InSAR, which is the same type as the one in this research, with those of a total station. These studies suggest that the accuracy of GB-InSAR is in the millimetric scale. However, the atmospheric environment of Owakudani was different from the conditions in these studies. Moreover, there were no other monitoring instruments in Owakudani to compare with the GB-InSAR. Hence, we could not exactly evaluate the error bounds of the <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> of the case presented in this article. As will be mentioned later in this article, the authors calculated the standard deviations of the <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> of GB-InSAR before the earthquake swarm.|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the heterogeneous nature of stress transmission in granular materials, {{the concept of}} the “strong” network consisting of contacts with large normal forces has been proposed by Radjaï et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 61 (1998) ]. The shear stress is mainly determined by this strong network. The dual viewpoint is adopted here, by not only considering the forces at contacts, but also the deformation. It is shown that the strain increments are determined by the tangential component of the <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> at the contacts. A “mobile” network consisting of contacts with large tangential <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> is defined that primarily accounts for the strain increments. The investigation of the relation between the strong and the mobile networks shows that these networks are largely unrelated. An alternative network is defined that consists of contacts at which the contribution to the work input is large. It is found that this work input occurs primarily through the tangential forces and tangential <b>relative</b> <b>displacements...</b>|$|R
