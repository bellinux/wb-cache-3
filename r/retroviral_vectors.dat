We have used an rAAV to transfer and express the murine cationic amino acid transporter which functions as the ecotropic retroviral receptor, thereby rendering human cells conditionally susceptible to infection by an ecotropic <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector.</b> The proportion of human HeLa cells expressing the receptor at 60 h varied {{as a function}} of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) with the rAAV. Cells expressing the ecotropic receptor were efficiently transduced with an ecotropic <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector</b> encoding a nucleus-localized form of beta-galactosidase. Cells coexpressing the ecotropic receptor and nucleus-localized beta-galactosidase were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and cell lines were recovered by cloning at limiting dilution. After growth in culture, all clones contained the <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector</b> genome, but fewer than 10 % (3 of 47) contained the rAAV genome and continued to express the ecotropic receptor. The ecotropic receptor coding sequences in the rAAV genome were under the control of a tetracycline-modulated promoter. In the presence of tetracycline, receptor expression was low and the proportion of cells transduced by the ecotropic <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector</b> was decreased. Modulation of receptor expression was achieved with both an episomal and an integrated form of the rAAV genome.

This requires a novel mechanism whereby the interaction of <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector</b> particle with its cognate cellular receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways resulting in stable epigenetic modifications. Murine B cells exposed to <b>retroviral</b> <b>vector</b> particles triggered the colocalization of the retroviral cellular receptor [mouse cationic amino acid transporter 1 (mCAT 1) ] and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) into lipid microrafts, which in turn activated TLR 2 signaling pathways. TLR 2 activation induced STAT 3 phosphorylation and increased phosphorylated histone 3 (H 3) at the STAT 3 -binding site of the IL- 10 promoter. In addition, TLR 2 activation during transduction activates nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, α (NFKBIA), thereby preventing the translocation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) complex to the nucleus and the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.
