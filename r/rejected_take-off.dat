50|$|Reverse thrust mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in <b>rejected</b> <b>take-offs</b> and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.|$|R
50|$|On May 25, 2008, a Boeing 747-209F/SCD (N704CK {{serial number}} 22299/462) from the company's fleet overran runway 20 at Brussels Airport. The {{aircraft}} broke in three {{and came to}} a complete stop in a field bordering the runway. There were four crew members and one passenger on board, and no injuries were reported. The aircraft destined for Bahrain International Airport was loaded with 76 tons of goods, half of which was diplomatic mail. Belgian investigators announced that the accident was caused by the decision to <b>Reject</b> the <b>Take-Off</b> 12 knots after passing V1 speed.

5000|$|On February 22, 1998, Chanchangi Airlines' chief pilot asked Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Kaduna, Nigeria for {{permission}} to conduct flight training within the airport's circuit using a Chanchangi Airlines Boeing 737-2K3 which had arrived from Lagos approximately one hour earlier. As visibility had reduced to 600 meters, he was told it was below the minimum allowed for landing and his request was not feasible. Next, the pilot requested he be allowed to conduct <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off</b> training, and permission was subsequently granted by ATC. Several individuals joined the captain for the exercise. He was instructed to begin the training on Runway 05, and once in position permission for [...] "takeoff" [...] was given. Normally, any single rejected takeoff at high speed would require a minimum of ten minutes to allow the brakes to cool before the aircraft could be safely operated again, and depending on various factors, this time period could be much longer, something the pilot certainly would have known. However, within the next twelve minutes, the pilot inexplicably conducted no less than four rejected take-offs, {{at least one of}} them and possibly all four of them at high speed. The brakes on one of the main landing gears (left side) began to catch fire, exacerbated by leaking hydraulic fluid. The pilot continued to taxi the aircraft until the tires and then the wheels of the left main gear disintegrated, preventing the plane from moving any further. He then called for emergency services. Unfortunately, they were unable to prevent the aircraft from burning to the ground. There were no fatalities. The chief pilot alleged he did not use the brakes for his practice rejected take-offs, however the evidence was unequivocally otherwise.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} an interface modified by graphene to simultaneously improve the mechanical and frictional properties of carbon/graphene/carbon (C/G/C) composite. Results {{indicated that the}} C/G/C composite exhibits remarkably improved interfacial bonding mode, static and dynamic mechanical performance, thermal conductivity, and frictional properties in comparison {{with those of the}} C/C composite. The weight contents of carbon fibers, graphene and pyrolytic carbon are 31. 6, 0. 3 and 68. 1 wt %, respectively. The matrix of the C/G/C composite was mainly composed of rough laminar (RL) pyrocarbon. The average hardness by nanoindentation of the C/G/C and C/C composite matrices were 0. 473 and 0. 751 GPa, respectively. The flexural strength (three point bending), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), interfacial debonding strength (IDS), internal friction and storage modulus of the C/C composite were 106, 10. 3, 7. 6, 0. 038 and 12. 7 GPa, respectively. Those properties of the C/G/C composite increased by 76. 4 %, 44. 6 %, 168. 4 % and 22. 8 %, respectively, and their internal friction decreased by 42. 1 % in comparison with those of the C/C composite. Owing to the lower hardness of the matrix, improved fiber/matrix interface bonding strength, and self-lubricating properties of graphene, a complete friction film was easily formed on the friction surface of the modified composite. Compared with the C/C composite, the C/G/C composite exhibited stable friction coefficients and lower wear losses at simulating air-plane normal landing (NL) and <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off</b> (RTO). The method appears to be a competitive approach to improve the mechanical and frictional properties of C/C composites simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the civil}} {{aviation}} industry {{has gone through}} great technological and commercial change in the last decades, basic civil aviation training has not kept pace accordingly. The changes in civil aviation have rarely resulted in research programs {{in the field of}} basic training, which has long received minimal attention from the industry. In the research presented in this thesis, methods for understanding basic civil aviation training, primarily assessment of mental workload, have been explored in order to find levers with which such training may be improved. In the first study, a comparison of in-flight heart rate data during simulator and aircraft flights shows that the data from a small, non-intrusive sports recorder have a correlation of. 981 with data from a clinical and research recorder. This indicates that the sports recorder provides a reliable and cost-effective method for obtaining heart rate data for assessment of mental workload. The second study focused on the effects of introducing aircraft equipped with the modern technology of an airliner into ab initio training. Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect data from flight instructors and students. The results show that anticipated problems in the use of displays, aircraft speed and side control had limited impact on the training. The conclusion is that with extensive preparation, introduction of modern aircraft in ab initio training can be accomplished successfully. In the third study, heart rate and eye movement data as well as subjective ratings of mental workload were collected in order to compare mental workload in simulator and aircraft during ab initio training. The results indicate that there is a high degree of correlation in psychophysiological reactions between the two types of flight. However, for some flight segments the heart rate was lower in the simulator, indicating that the mental workload was higher in the aircraft. Differences in heart rate for the <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off</b> and engine failure segments indicate that in the simulator, the increase in workload starts in advance of the occurrence of an event and that the mental workload for ?unexpected? events seems to be of a preparatory nature in the simulator and more related to management of the situation in the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|This {{study on}} the {{enhancement}} of high-speed flywheel energy storage is to investigate composite materials that are suitable for high-speed, high-energy density for energy storage and/or energy recovery. The main motivation {{of the study is}} to explore the application of the flywheel in the aviation industry for recovering some of the energy that is currently being lost at the wheel brakes of an aircraft due to the high temperature developed in the brake stack as a result of landing, frequent brake applications during taxiing in or out of heavy traffic airports and <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off.</b> Lamina and laminate mechanical properties of materials suitable for flywheel high-speed energy storage were investigated. Design and optimum stress analysis were used to determine the shape factor, maximum stress and energy density for a flywheel with a constant stress disk and a constant thickness rim. Analytical studies along {{with the use of the}} CADEC-online software were used to evaluate the lamina and laminate properties. This study found that the use of hybrid composite material with higher strength (based on first ply failure strength) and lower density and lower elastic moduli for the disk than the rim material will yield high-speed and high-energy density. The materials designed based on the results from this study show outperformance compared to previous published results of standard flywheel material combinations. The safe rotational velocity and energy density were found to be 166, 000 RPM and 2. 73 MJ/kg respectively. Therefore, results from this study will contribute to aiding further development of the flywheel that has recently re-emerged as a promising application for energy storage due to significant improvements in composite materials and technology. Further study on flywheel energy recovery from aircraft brakes revealed that more than half of the energy dissipated at the wheel brake as heat could be recovered and converted to some useful form. In this way, the operating life of the brakes can be prolonged. The total additional weight to the aircraft was found to be less than 0. 2 % of the maximum take-off weight. This additional weight can be offset by reducing the design payload while ensuring that the structural efficiency of the aircraft is not altered. It was also found that applying this method of flywheel energy recovery to active commercial Boeing- 777 aircraft will result in savings equivalent to the annual carbon emission of a 6 MW fossil fuel power plant. This will also contribute to the aviation industry climate change mitigation...|$|E
