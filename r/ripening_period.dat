25|$|Acidity {{is highest}} in wine grapes {{just before the}} start of veraison, which ushers in the <b>ripening</b> <b>period</b> of the annual cycle of grape vines. As the grapes ripen, their sugar levels {{increase}} and their acidity levels decrease. Through the process of respiration, malic acid is metabolized by the grape vine. Grapes from cooler climate wine regions generally have higher levels of acidity due to the slower ripening process. The level of acidity still present in the grape is an important consideration for winemakers in deciding when to begin harvest. For wines such as Champagne and other sparkling wines, having high levels of acidity is even more vital to the winemaking process, so grapes are often picked under-ripe and at higher acid levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{very dry}} climates that receive little rainfall, {{irrigation}} is considered essential to any viticultural prospects. Many New World wine regions such as Australia and California regularly practice irrigation {{in areas that}} couldn't otherwise support viticulture. Advances and research in these wine regions (as well as some Old World wine regions such as Israel), have shown that potential wine quality could increase in areas where irrigation is {{kept to a minimum}} and managed. The main principle behind this is controlled water stress, where the vine receives sufficient water during the budding and flowering period, but irrigation is then scaled back during the <b>ripening</b> <b>period</b> so that the vine then responds by funneling more of its limited resources into developing the grape clusters instead of excess foliage. If the vine receives too much water stress, then photosynthesis and other important processes such as nutrient storage could be impacted with the vine essentially shutting down. The availability of irrigation means that if drought conditions emerge, sufficient water can be provided for the plant so that the balance between water stress and development is kept to optimal levels.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the change in sugar, acids and pH levels other components of the grapes are building up during the ripening process.

2500|$|For {{the most}} part, {{many of these}} qualities are {{difficult}} to objectively measure so evaluation of the physiological ripeness of grapes is centered around observing and physically sampling the grapes. With experience winemakers and viticulturists learn to associate certain taste and characteristics with different stages of development. They evaluate the skin and pulp texture of the berry {{as well as the}} color of skins, seeds and stems. If the seeds are still green, the tannins inside the grape {{are more likely to be}} harsh and bitter. As the tannins continue to develop, the seeds start darkening in color. They will observe the lignification of the stems as they turn from being flexible and green to hard, woody and brown (for many varieties but not all) indicating that vine has completed its work in developing its [...] "offspring" [...] grape clusters and has started to store carbohydrates and resources for its next growing season.

2500|$|Water is very crucial {{during the}} early budding and {{flowering}} stages of the growing season. In areas where there is not sufficient rainfall, irrigation may be needed during {{this time in the}} spring. After fruit set, the water needs for the vine drop and irrigation is often withheld till the period of veraison when the grapes begin to change color. This period of [...] "water stress" [...] encourages the vine to concentrate its limited resources into lower yields of smaller berries creating a favorable skin to juice ratio that is often desirable in quality wine production. The benefits or disadvantages of irrigation during the <b>ripening</b> <b>period</b> itself is a matter of debate and continuing research in the wine growing community. The only area of mostly agreement is the disadvantages of water close to harvest after a prolonged dry period. Grapevines that have been subjected to prolonged water stress have a tendency to rapidly absorb large amounts of water if its provided. This will dramatically swell the berries, potentially causing to them crack or burst which will make the prone to various grape diseases. Even if the berries do not crack or burst, the rapid swelling of water will cause a reduce concentration in sugars and phenolic compounds in the grape producing wines with diluted flavors and aromas.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the use of}} {{irrigation}} is disparaged or even prohibited in many premium wine producing regions, its use in Washington is absolutely vital and is a major asset in quality wine production. The average vineyard in Eastern Washington receives approximately [...] in annual rainfall, most of it during the winter months. Without irrigation, agriculture in the region would not be possible. Compared to other wine regions that do not need or practice irrigation, a vineyard manager in Washington State has {{more control over the}} potential quality of the grapes. Utilizing drip irrigation and controlling the amount of water the vines receive and wine allows the grower to limit the amount of vigor (and thus yields) of vine and leverage water stress to produce more concentrated flavors and phenolic compounds in the grape. Growers will often withhold water early in the growing season to control the leaf canopy, which can have a beneficial business aspect by saving money compared to using costly viticultural chores such as sucker pruning, leaf striping and mildew treatment to control and tend to the leaf canopy. Applying a controlled amount of water during the <b>ripening</b> <b>period</b> following veraison encourages the grapes to ripen faster without a reductive loss in quality. One additional benefit {{of irrigation}} is frost protection. Following harvest, growers will soak the soil of the vineyard to moisten the soil down to two feet. As temperatures drop, this water can form a protective layer of ice that will give the vine a few extra degrees of protection from freezing temperature that may damage the roots.|$|E
50|$|In general, grapevines {{thrive in}} {{temperate}} climates which grant the vines long, warm periods during the crucial flowering, fruit set and <b>ripening</b> <b>periods.</b> The physiological processes {{of a lot}} of grapevines begin when temperatures reach around 50 F. Below this temperature, the vines are usually in a period of dormancy. Drastically below this temperature, such as the freezing point of 32 F the vines can be damaged by frost. When the average daily temperature is between 63 and 68 F the vine will begin flowering. When temperatures rise up to 80 F many of the vine's physiological processes are in full stride as grape clusters begin to ripen on the vine. One of the characteristics that differentiates the various climate categories from one another is the occurrence and length of time that these optimal temperatures appear during the growing season.|$|R

2500|$|What {{constitutes}} [...] "ripeness" [...] {{will vary}} according to what style of wine is being produced {{as well as the}} particular views of winemakers and viticulturists on what optimal ripeness is. The style of wine is usually dictated by the balance between sugars and acids. What may be considered [...] "ripe" [...] for one winemaker could be considered under ripe to another winemaker or even overripe to yet a third winemaker. Climate and the particular grape variety will also play a role in determining ripeness and date of harvest. In very hot climates, such as certain areas in California and Australia, ripeness is usually achieved around 30 days after veraison starts while in much cooler climates, like the Loire Valley and parts of Germany, this may not occur until 70 days after veraison. The <b>ripening</b> <b>periods</b> for each individual grape variety will vary with grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon taking much longer to ripen compared to early ripening varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot noir.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} factors {{influencing}} the ripening process of grapevine is the climate and weather. Sunlight and temperature warmth are vital to the physiological functions of the grapevine (such as photosynthesis). An absence of either, such as long periods of extensive cloud cover, will cause many functions of the vine to slow or even completely halt as the vine enters a type of [...] "survival mode". As the grapevine funnels more resources to preserve its own survival, less resources are directed towards the ripening {{and development of the}} grape clusters. Excessive heat can also cause a grapevine to react adversely. The occurrence of heat waves during the growing season, particularly as it nears harvest, can cause the sugars in grapes to jump as acids fall dramatically. Some winemakers may decide to harvest early in order to maintain acid levels even though other components (such as tannins and phenolic compounds) may not be at optimal ripening. For the winemakers that decide to [...] "wait it out", a lack of acid can be partially rectify during the winemaking process with the addition of acids such as tartaric acid. It is much more difficult to remedy the effects of extensive rains during the <b>ripening</b> <b>period.</b> Steady rains before the harvest can cause the berries to swell with water which dilutes the flavors as well as causing cracking in the skin that creates openings for spoilage causing microorganism to propagate. Because of these risks, the threat of prolong rainfall during a vintage may cause an early harvest before the grapes have fully ripened. The most favorable vintages allow a slow, steady ripening without drastic jumps in heats or the threat of excessive rain fall.|$|E

50|$|Of all {{environmental}} factors, temperature {{seems to}} have the most profound effect on viticulture as the temperature during the winter dormancy effects the budding for the following growing season.

Sustained intermediate temperatures and minimal day-to-day variability during the growth and <b>ripening</b> <b>periods</b> are favourable. Grapevine annual growth cycles begin in spring with bud break initiated by consistent day time temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius. The unpredictable nature of climate change may also bring occurrences of frosts which may occur outside of the usual winter periods. Frosts cause lower yields and effects grape quality due to reduction of bud fruitfulness and therefore grapevine production benefits from frost free periods.|$|R
