2500|$|By 1949 the Soviet Union had {{concluded}} twenty-year bilateral treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with Poland {{and several other}} countries, which usually granted the Soviet Union rights to a continued military presence on their territory. The Polish government, however, had no operational control over the Soviet forces. On December 17, 1956, {{as one of the}} agreements of the Polish October period, the Polish and Soviet governments signed the dedicated treaty that would finally fully regulate the Soviet military presence in Poland, the [...] "Agreement on Legal Status of Soviet Troops Temporarily Stationed in Poland". According to the 1956 treaty (which was further developed by later, more specific amendments), the Soviet military in Poland was limited to 66,000 troops, although the Soviets never fully disclosed the actual number of personnel of the Northern Group to the Polish government, and the Polish government had no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> the Soviet bases. The treaty also limited the number of Soviet bases in Poland to 39, while the actual number of bases reached 79. The Soviets also installed nuclear weapons in Poland, without informing the Polish government of that fact. The treaty's name declared the Soviet military presence to be temporary, while in fact the treaty did not contain any limitations to the duration of their stay, nor any provisions on their withdrawal. Until the 1956 agreement, the Soviet troops stationed in Poland were seen by some Poles as occupying Polish territory; even afterwards they were de facto exempt from any Polish oversight and their role of an 'allied force' stationed in the territory was viewed by many as a mere propaganda claim. The issue of Polish-Soviet military cooperation was further regulated the next year, and in the 1965 Polish-Soviet friendship treaty that reflected the Soviet domination of Polish military policy.|$|E
2500|$|A day later, the Missouri General Assembly {{created the}} Missouri State Guard (replacing the MVM) {{theoretically}} {{to defend the}} state from attacks from perceived enemies from {{either side of the}} war (although from its inception, all Missouri State Guard planning focused on conflict with Federal forces). The governor appointed Sterling Price as the commander with the rank of major general of state forces. The state guard was divided into divisions, with each division consisting of units raised from a military district of Missouri and command by a brigadier general. Because much of their recruiting areas were behind Union lines, many divisions were the size of a brigade, consisting of only a few regiments. Fearing Missouri's tilt to the South, William S. Harney, the Federal commander of the U.S. Army's Department of the West (which included Missouri) negotiated the Price-Harney Truce on May 12, 1861, which nominally agreed to cooperation between the U.S. Army and the MSG to maintain order in Missouri and protect it from outside interference. Jackson publicly declared his support for the truce, while secretly requesting that Confederate forces enter Missouri to [...] "liberate" [...] Missouri from Federal control. After complaints by Missouri Unionists, Harney was replaced by Lyon (who was promoted to [...] brigadier general of volunteers), further undermining the fragile truce. On June 12, 1861, Lyon and Jackson met at the St. Louis' Planter's House Hotel in a last attempt to avoid a resumption of fighting. Both sides were inflexible, with Lyon demanding the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> any area of the state for Confederate intervention, and Jackson refusing and demanding that Federal forces be restricted to the St. Louis metropolitan area.

2500|$|Beyond union {{governance}} {{through the}} vote and elections, members have five main statutory rights. First, although statute asserts that a union is [...] "not a body corporate", in every practical sense it is: it can make contracts, commission torts, hold property, sue and be sued. The union's executives and officials carry out actions on its behalf, and their acts are attributed to it by ordinary principles of agency. However, if any union official acts ultra vires, beyond the union's powers, every member {{has a right to}} claim a remedy for the breach. For example, in Edwards v Halliwell a decision of the executive committee of the National Union of Vehicle Builders to increase membership fees was restrained, because the constitution required a two-third vote of members first. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 28 requires unions to keep accounts, giving a [...] "true and fair" [...] view of its financial affairs. Records are kept for six years, members have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> them, they are independently audited and overseen by the Certification Officer. Third, members have a right to not give contributions to the trade union's political fund, if there is one. Since the early success of the UK Labour Party in promoting working people's welfare through Parliament, both courts and Conservative governments attempted to suppress unions' political voice, particularly compared to funding by employers through control of corporations. Under TULRCA 1992 sections 72, 73 and 82, a union must hold a separate fund for any [...] "political object" [...] (such as advertising, lobbying or donations), members must approve the fund by ballot at least every 10 years, and individual members have a right to opt-out of it (unlike shareholders in companies). Unions must also have political objects in the constitution. In 2010, just 29 from 162 unions had political funds, though 57 per cent of members contributed. This generated £22m. Consolidated statistics on corporate political spending, by contrast, are not available.|$|E

5000|$|Denning {{essentially}} argues (not unlike noblesse oblige) that if {{an inspector}} has a statutory <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> the property under construction, he thereby acquires a duty of care to inspect carefully. That is to say: {{a person who has}} a right has duties attached to that right. But jurists Dias and Hohfeld have shown that rights and duties are jural correlatives. That is to say: if someone has a right, someone else owes a duty to them. So here, the inspector has a <b>right</b> (<b>to</b> <b>inspect),</b> and the builder has a duty to let them inspect. The later Murphy v Brentwood DC case revealed Denning's reasoning in Dutton to be flawed [...]The statement here that [...] "the inspector has a <b>right</b> (<b>to</b> <b>inspect),</b> and the builder has a duty to let them inspect" [...] does not correctly reflect the right/duty correlative as propounded by Dias. The inspector has <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> and is duty bound to apply his professional expertise in carrying out the inspection. It is this 'expertise' of his that a third party would be relying on albeit not directly, but it is reasonable for a person purchasing a house to believe that 'if the District Council has certified a building as safe then it must be safe'. Thus, the inspector as a professional man has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> and the duty to carry out that inspection with diligence and report to the 'community' any defect he finds in the building or his inability to inspect at all or in full whether owing to obstruction by the builder or to any other reason, and not to certify the building as safe when he knew or ought to know that it was not.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn a {{globally}} competitive environment, sustaining {{high yield}} {{with a minimum}} number of quality controls is key for manufacturing plants to remain competitive. In modern semiconductor manufacturing facilities, with the moves to ever smaller geometries and the variety among products to be run concurrently, designing efficient control plans is becoming increasingly complex.

However, when control parameters are over- or under-estimated, a dynamic sampling static sampling strategy can lead to poor results. In this paper we propose an integer linear programming approach to optimize the use of inspection capacity through dynamic sampling. The goal is to determine two key parameters (called warning limit and inhibit limit) that are related to the resulting level of risk and the available inspection capacity. The model has been implemented on a commercial solver and tested using actual industrial data. Results show that the overall risk can be strongly reduced without any additional capacity...|$|R
