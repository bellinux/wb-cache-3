5|$|Thus, Peking opera {{is not a}} {{monolithic}} form, but rather a coalescence of many older forms. However, the new form also creates its own innovations. The vocal requirements {{for all of the}} major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera. The Chou, in particular, <b>rarely</b> <b>has</b> a singing part in Peking opera, unlike the equivalent role in Kunqu style. The melodies that accompany each play were also simplified, and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms. Perhaps most noticeably, true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera. The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century. The Anhui troupes reached their peak of excellence {{in the middle of the}} century, and were invited to perform in the court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that had been established during the Taiping Rebellion. Beginning in 1884, the Empress Dowager Cixi became a regular patron of Peking opera, cementing its status over earlier forms like Kunqu. The popularity of Peking opera has been attributed to the simplicity of the form, with only a few voices and singing patterns. This allowed anyone to sing the arias themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} problem {{experienced}} by humans {{in the initial}} hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, {{commonly referred to as}} space sickness. It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but <b>rarely</b> <b>has</b> it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.|$|E
25|$|Cohn {{also points}} out that while the {{identification}} of the disease as having buboes relies on accounts of Boccaccio and others, they described buboes, abscesses, rashes and carbuncles occurring all over the body, the neck or behind the ears. In contrast, the modern disease <b>rarely</b> <b>has</b> more than one bubo, most commonly in the groin, and is not characterised by abscesses, rashes and carbuncles. This difference, he argues, ties in with the fact that fleas caused the modern plague and not the Black Death. Since flea bites do not usually reach beyond a person's ankles, in the modern period the groin was the nearest lymph node that could be infected. As the neck and the armpit were often infected during the medieval plague, it appears less likely that these infections were caused by fleas on rats.|$|E
