5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several <b>re-examinations</b> of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E

Microsoft also filed for patent <b>re-examination</b> with the USPTO. The <b>re-examination</b> confirmed all the challenged claims. Not satisfied with this result, Microsoft filed an appeal to the Commissioner of Patents. This was turned down. Microsoft then filed another <b>re-examination</b> request. This second request was denied by the USPTO.|$|R

He never finished {{the book of}} his 28 years in the fur trade, based on his 77 field notebooks, before he died. In the 1890s geologist J.B. Tyrrell resurrected Thompson's notes and in 1916 published them as David Thompson's Narrative, {{as part of the}} General Series of the Champlain Society.

25|$|Before {{the losses}} of the Latvian {{government}} in the cases Podkolzina v. Latvia (ECHR) and Ignatāne v. Latvia (UN HRC), {{a certain level of}} command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to <b>re-examinations</b> of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the Equal Rights party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections) from participation. As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima and local councilors can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1830, based on a specimen taken from the Red Sea, which was designated to be the holotype. Rüppell named the species Citula armata, placing his new species in what {{was at the time}} a valid jack genus created by Georges Cuvier in 1816. Citula was later synonymised with Pseudocaranx, and all its members were re-examined and placed {{in a number of different}} jack genera. C. armata became Caranx armatus, also masculinising the species name. Finally, the species was placed in Carangoides after <b>re-examinations</b> of its anatomy by a number of authors as part of a larger investigation into the taxonomy of the carangid fishes. The species was subsequently described independently under three different names, with Cuvier applying Caranx ciliaris to the species, Masamitsu Ōshima applying Citula pescadorensis and Yojiro Wakiya Caranx schlegeli. These are all considered to be invalid junior synonyms under ICZN rules.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the first five-year plan in 1928 led to a <b>re-examination</b> of the roles of Gosplan and VSNKh, the supreme state organization for management of the economy at this time. This <b>re-examination</b> of roles was required because VSNKh itself also had responsibility for planning through the Industrial Planning Commission (Promplan). <b>Re-examination</b> of roles was also required as the {{introduction of}} the first five-year plan meant that Gosplan's role was no longer one of prognosis and drafting of 'control figures' since plans had now become orders to act.|$|R

500|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale, like the Burgess Shale itself, formed around [...] in the Mid Cambrian period. They were {{discovered}} in Canada in 1886, and Charles Doolittle Walcott collected over 60,000specimens {{in a series of}} field trips up from 1909 to 1924. After a period of neglect from the 1930s to the early 1960s, new excavations and <b>re-examinations</b> of Walcott's collection continue to discover new species, and statistical analysis suggests discoveries will continue for the foreseeable future. Stephen Jay Gould's book Wonderful Life describes the history of discovery up to the early 1980s, although his analysis of the implications for evolution has been contested.|$|E

[...] The service became interested in performing ship-borne operations with the Harrier. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt promoted {{the concept of a}} Sea Control Ship, a 15,000-ton light carrier equipped with Harriers and helicopters, to supplement the larger aircraft carriers of the US Navy. An amphibious assault ship, , was converted into the Interim Sea Control Ship and operated as such between 1971 and 1973 with the purpose of studying the limits and possible obstacles for operating such a vessel. Since then the Sea Control Ship concept has been subject to periodic <b>re-examinations</b> and studies, often in the light of budget cuts and questions over the use of supercarriers.|$|E
500|$|Though a bestseller, {{the novel}} has also {{received}} significant scrutiny by literary critics. Especially during the 1960s and 70s, a novel with great popularity and significant academic scrutiny is unusual; in literary study, the canon and its academic defenders often focused on [...] "high literary" [...] works that didn't have large popular followings. In {{her study of}} postmodernism, Linda Hutcheon described The French Lieutenant Womans binary of popular and academic interest as a paradox similar to the postmodern thematic binaries produced within the novel's content. Because of its prominence since publication, the novel has received {{a variety of different}} academic <b>re-examinations</b> in light of numerous critical and thematic approaches. Some of the most popular concerns for the novel are its discussion of gender, especially questioning [...] "Is the novel a feminist novel?", its engagement with metafictional and [...] concepts and its treatment of science and religion.|$|E

2500|$|Later <b>re-examinations</b> of {{the remains}} {{confirmed}} Smith's original identification of the mummy as belonging to a young male (although with feminine trends) (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 201 but pushed the estimated age of death back to around 20 years. (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 201-202 These <b>re-examinations</b> also indicated that the body {{showed no signs of}} [...] delayed maturation, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. xi and that, while the skull was of unusual shape, it certainly wasn't abnormal, and showed no indication of hydrocephalus. Reconstruction of the facial features of the skull also indicated that there was no resemblance with Akhenaten's representation on his monuments. It must be remembered though, that Akhenaten's representations are highly stylised. After the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun a close resemblance was noted between his mummy and the body found in KV55 and later tests showed both shared the same blood-group (A2) and serum antigen (MN), all of which suggests Tutankhamun and the individual found in KV55 were closely related to each other, either as father and son, or brothers. Based on these results it was concluded that the KV55 body was too young to be Akhenaten and they were seen to support the claim that the mummy was that of Smenkhkare, an idea first proposed by Rex Engelbach in 1931.|$|E
