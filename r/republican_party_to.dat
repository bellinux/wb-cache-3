In 2000, Newsom paid $500 to the San Francisco <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> be on the party's endorsement slate.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E

50|$|The Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Republicano Independiente) was a {{political}} party in Cuba, led by Juan Gualberto Gómez. It was formed around 1900, after splits in the <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> in Havana, Matanzas and Las Villas. The split {{was caused by the}} opposition of the <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> Gualberto Gómez's radical position against the Platt Amendment. The Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> supported Gualberto Gómez's position on the issue.|$|R

5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> {{support the}} presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a two-party system, but had only contempt for those who bolted the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the <b>Republican</b> <b>party,</b> <b>to</b> support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted they vote for dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E

25|$|Winthrop Rockefeller had {{few members}} of his own party to guide his {{programs}} through the legislature. Eleven of Rockefeller vetoes were overridden, far more than for other Arkansas governors in a four-year period. The fate of Rockefeller programs rested with the Democratic legislators, one of whom, Arkansas House Speaker Sterling R.

50|$|During the 1898 election, the Democratic Party regained {{control at}} the state level, {{in part due to}} a {{campaign}} based on white racial fears and white supremacy, accompanied by widespread violence and intimidation of blacks by the Red Shirts.

In 1964, Osro Cobb, a Republican former state chairman who had also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, refused to endorse Rockefeller but openly Faubus, who subseqauently gave Cobb a temporary appointment to the Arkansas Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Until 1964, Georgia's state {{government}} had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the Democratic Party, {{of any state}} in the Union. This record was established {{largely due to the}} disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.|$|E
