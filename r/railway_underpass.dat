The Strategic Highway Improvement Program (SHIP) was a program between the federal and provincial government to upgrade highways with a main focus over five years to twin {{this section of the}} Yellowhead. By 2012 the Yellowhead is to be twinned from Saskatoon to the Alberta boundary. $164 million has been allocated for the two national highways in Saskatchewan, to finish twinning the Trans-Canada Highway 1 and to twin the Yellowhead between North Battleford and Lloydminster by the Federal and provincial governments on March 5, 2003.|$|E

Subsequently these designs are tested with a list of criteria and the most interesting configurations are used for the design study of this research. In the design study the overall design is worked out to a more detailed level. A solution is found for connecting the elements together and obtain a watertight structure and structural safety. Within the design study, a suitable execution schedule is searched for various situations. Structural and Building EngineeringConcreteCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Underpasses {{are common}} in modern railway lines. Wildlife {{corridors}} and drainage conduits often fall into this category of partially buried structures. Their dynamic behavior has received far less attention than that of other structures such as bridges, but their large number makes their study an interesting challenge {{from the viewpoint of}} safety and cost savings. Here, we present a complete study of a culvert, including on-site measurements and numerical modeling. The studied structure belongs to the high-speed railway line linking Segovia and Valladolid in Spain. The line was opened to traffic in 2004. On-site measurements were performed for the structure by recording the dynamic response at selected points of the structure during the passage of high-speed trains at speeds ranging between 200 and 300 km/h. The measurements provide not only reference values suitable for model fitting, but also a good insight into the main features of the dynamic behavior of this structure. Finite element techniques were used to model the dynamic behavior of the structure and its key features. Special attention is paid to vertical accelerations, the values of which should be limited to avoid track instability according to Eurocode. This study furthers our understanding of the dynamic response of <b>railway</b> <b>underpasses</b> to train loads...|$|R

40|$|Grobelno {{settlement}} lies {{right in}} between of Šentjur municipiality on its West and the Šmarje municipiality on its East. The {{nucleus of the}} settlement is consisted of a built that was formed with the crossing of the public road and the railway. The urban conditions have {{with the increase of}} the road and railway traffic worsened in addition to the presence of the negative influences on the habitat. The main road represents a connection of Šmarje pri Jelšah and Rogaška Slatina in direction of Celje and of the central Slovenia. At the Grobelno territory it in many ways and in different levels crosses the railways causing traffic, habitat and regional development of space obstacles. My thesis contains developing and a study of possible solutions of out-of-level crossing, a comparison according to the traffic, technical, cost and spacial criteria in addition to a proposal of the most suitable solution. In my final thesis I have developed three independent variations of the G 2 - 107 / 1275 public road with out-of-level crossings with the main and the regional railways besides the relation to the already existing road network. I have also produced the solutions of the juctions of local roads, accesses, driveways and all touching junctions now useless because of the relocation of the main public road. For the basis of the designing I have used the basic topographic plan and ortophoto. The central part of the space in question is a flat land – the bottom of the valley is curved by the crossing of the river Slomščica and the left affluent of the Šentvid creek. The dinamics of the relief is specific since the valley is surrownded by hills on North and South. The agriculturally used territory lies on the sunily areas, sunless areas are mainly covered with forests. The bottom of the valley is used partly for agriculture, the rest are damp meadows. Beacuse of the closeness of the creeks this territory can not be used for constuctions of the <b>railway</b> <b>underpasses.</b> In order to discover the potentials of the area in consideration of the specific spacial situation we need to get acquainted with the space in question. The problem analysis point out the advantages of the area worth using and the remediation of the shortages. Every specific spacial situation {{is a part of the}} broader social context and reveals topics and probems the experts nowadays come across.

5000|$|The Georgetown South railway {{expansion}} {{project was}} initiated in 2009 with Metrolinx now as its proponent. [...] The project represented {{a significant increase}} in railway capacity, with the former 2-track railway being widened to 4 tracks, with a total of 8 tracks where the Milton line and Barrie line share the corridor. All level crossings along the corridor were eliminated with using <b>railway</b> or roadway <b>underpasses.</b> The plan would allow for an increased frequency of trains on the route, increasing service from approximately 50 per day to about least 300. It drew criticism from Weston community groups, which opposed the increased use of diesel locomotive on the basis of air pollution. They preferred instead that the corridor be electrified. The group has also requested more stations along the route.|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} nine {{microsatellite}} DNA loci and a population genetic approach, we evaluate the barrier {{effect of the}} Qinghai-Tibet Railway on toad-headed lizard, Phrynocephalus vlangalii. The study area is along a 20 km stretch of the railway on northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and {{this section of the}} railway was constructed between 1958 - 1979. Both assignment tests and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were used for data analysis. We found significant genetic differentiation between the populations from the study area and those from a further southeastern area, which are separated by a 20 km gap. This suggests the existence of population substructure at a fine-scale. However, we did not detect any difference between samples from the western and eastern sides of the railway within the study area, and concluded that the railway may not impose a significant barrier effect on these lizard populations at the present time. Available suitable habitat alongside the <b>railway</b> and bridge <b>underpasses</b> may have facilitated the gene exchange between the sides. The relatively short time since the completion of the railway may not allow the differentiation to accumulate to a detectable level. Since the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau maintains a unique and fragile ecosystem, long-term monitoring of such man-made landscape features is imperative for protecting this ecosystem.
