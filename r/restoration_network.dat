25|$|Maritime {{interests}} {{argue that}} {{in light of the}} closure of the MRGO, and the loss of the deepwater access it provided to the Gulf of Mexico, modern oceangoing vessels are unable to access the inner harbor of the Industrial Canal, permanently limiting the canal's utility as a site for shipyards and other industry requiring water access. Without a new lock, the port's France Road Container Terminal and Jourdan Road Wharf would also remain closed due to the inadequate deepwater access. Proponents of the new lock additionally cite dwindling barge traffic as evidence that the existing obsolete lock is choking off commerce. Opponents point to the same figures to support their contention that insufficient demand exists to justify the new lock.

In this paper, we develop an exact optimization approach which lets us exploit the inherently statistical nature of the traffic in ATM in capacity planning for restoration. This is based on formulation of a backup-VP restoration capacity design that permits a controlled maximum of convergent flow overloads on spans during restoration. Results show that significant capacity savings can be obtained relative to STM if ATM restoration is allowed even modest restoration-induced oversubscription of bandwidth on surviving spans. We give two Integer Program (IP) formulations and a pair of algorithms for upper and lower bounding of the spare capacity required for ATM Backup-VP restoration. These methods should facilitate further exploration of ATM restoration strategies which exploit the intrinsic differences between ATM and STM transport...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Current {{means of}} {{providing}} loop-back recovery, which {{is widely used}} in SONET, rely on ring topologies, or on overlaying logical ring topologies upon physical meshes. Loop-back is desirable to provide rapid preplanned recovery of link or node failures in a bandwidth-efficient distributed manner. We introduce generalized loop-back, a novel scheme for performing loop-back in optical mesh networks. We present an algorithm to perform recovery for link failure and one to perform generalized loop-back recovery for node failure. We illustrate the operation of both algorithms, prove their validity, and present a network management protocol algorithm, which enables distributed operation for link or node failure. We present three different applications of generalized loop-back. First, we present heuristic algorithms for selecting recovery graphs, which maintain short maximum and average lengths of recovery paths. Second, we present WDM-based loop-back recovery for optical networks where wavelengths are used to back up other wavelengths. We compare, for WDM-based loop-back, the operation of generalized loop-back operation with known ring-based ways of providing loop-back recovery over mesh networks. Finally, we introduce the use of generalized loop-back to provide recovery {{in a way that}} allows dynamic choice of routes over preplanned directions.
