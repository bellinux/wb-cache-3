5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His <b>research</b> <b>interests</b> include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
5|$|As an academic, {{he taught}} Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, the Romantic poets, Malaysian and Singaporean literatures, and {{creative}} writing, among other subjects. His <b>research</b> <b>interests</b> included the modern novel (E. M. Forster, D. H. Lawrence and Joseph Conrad) and {{the novels of}} Empire (such as Rudyard Kipling), Commonwealth literature (including Botswana writer Bessie Head), and William Shakespeare's Roman plays. When he headed the English Department, it introduced the study of Commonwealth/New Literatures in English, and of English language as a major so that graduates would be better equipped to teach English in schools and junior colleges. Thumboo was appointed a Professorial Fellow by NUS in 1995 {{and continues to be}} associated with the university as an emeritus professor, a position he has held since he retired from full-time teaching in September 1997. He served as the first Chairman and Director of the university's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005.|$|E
5|$|With his students, Voight has {{analyzed}} pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced seismicity, volcanic debris avalanches, and {{volcanic eruption}} prediction. Voight has {{also served as}} a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, {{as well as in the}} United States. Voight's <b>research</b> <b>interests</b> in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.|$|E

40|$|Our {{quantitative}} {{understanding of}} how scientists choose and shift their research focus over time is highly consequential, because it affects {{the ways in which}} scientists are trained, science is funded, knowledge is organized and discovered, and excellence is recognized and rewarded. Despite extensive investigations of various factors that influence a scientist's choice of research topics, quantitative assessments of mechanisms that give rise to macroscopic patterns characterizing <b>research</b> <b>interest</b> evolution of individual scientists remain limited. Here we perform a large-scale analysis of publication records, finding that <b>research</b> <b>interest</b> change follows a reproducible pattern characterized by an exponential distribution. We identify three fundamental features responsible for the observed exponential distribution, which arise from a subtle interplay between exploitation and exploration in <b>research</b> <b>interest</b> evolution. We develop a random walk based model, allowing us to accurately reproduce the empirical observations. This work presents a quantitative analysis of macroscopic patterns governing <b>research</b> <b>interest</b> change, discovering a high degree of regularity underlying scientific research and individual careers...|$|R
