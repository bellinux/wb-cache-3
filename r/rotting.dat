5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of <b>rotting</b> corpses or sewage, but also <b>rotting</b> vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the <b>rotting</b> wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like <b>rotting</b> wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in <b>rotting</b> wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E

5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials.

5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to fruit in smaller groups on the ground, rather than on or around <b>rotting</b> wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} our current work on exploring {{the consistency of}} read-only transactions (<b>ROT)</b> in real-time systems. A <b>ROT</b> is a transaction that only reads, but does not update any data items. Since {{there is a significant}} proportion of <b>ROTs</b> in several real-time systems, it is important to investigate how to process <b>ROTs</b> efficiently with separate algorithms. We identify three different consistency requirements for <b>ROTs.</b> Particularly, we define a weaker form of consistency, view consistency, which allows <b>ROTs</b> to perceive different serialization order of update transactions, thus permitting non-serializable execution of transactions. However, <b>ROTs</b> are still ensured to see consistent data. Based on view consistency, we present two algorithms which let <b>ROTs</b> read the most recent and consistent data without interfering with update transactions. The recency of data read by a <b>ROT</b> could be important in some real-time applications. 1. Introduction A read-only transaction (<b>ROT)</b> is a tra [...] ...|$|R
