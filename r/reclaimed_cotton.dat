40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the recycling of cotton waste garments by fibre regeneration. Easy care finished cotton fabrics and indigo dyed waste denim garments were successfully purified, dissolved in a suitable solvent and spun into fibres. The physical properties of the resultant fibres were compared with standard lyocell fibres spun from wood pulp and the fibres regenerated from the cotton waste garments exhibited improved mechanical and molecular properties relative to the typical fibres regenerated from wood pulp. Furthermore the results have indicated that a suitable blend of wood pulp and pulp <b>reclaimed</b> form <b>cotton</b> based waste garments can produce fibres with properties that are intermediate to cotton and lyocell fibres. The results suggest an alternative approach to fibre resource management by converting cotton based waste garment through regeneration processing into second lifetime cellulosic fibre. The approach will contribute to the reduction of both economic and environmental impact of waste garments and better management of resources required for production of cotton and synthetic fibres...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the impacts of {{agricultural}} exploitation of coastal wetlands on ecosystem CO 2 exchange, although coastal wetlands have been widely reclaimed for agricultural use across the world. We measured net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) and its major components, gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) using an eddy covariance flux technique in a natural coastal wetland (reed) and an adjacent, newly <b>reclaimed</b> farmland (<b>cotton)</b> in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that agricultural reclamation changed the ecosystem CO 2 exchange of the coastal wetland at three distinct levels. Initially, the conversion from the wetland to farmland changed the light response parameters (alpha, A(max), and R-eco, day) of NEE and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco mainly by changing the dominant vegetation type. Over the growing season, NEE, R-eco and GPP were significantly correlated with LAI at both sites and aboveground biomass at the farmland site. Next, the reclamation of wetland modified the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of ecosystem CO 2 exchange. Significant differences in diurnal variations of NEE between the wetland and farmland sites were found during the growing season (with the exception of June and July). Seasonal means of daily GPP and R-eco values at the wetland site were higher than those at the farmland. Ultimately, the agricultural reclamation altered the CO 2 sequestration capacity of the coastal wetland. The cumulative NEE in the wetland (- 237. 4 g Cm- 2) was higher than that in the farmland (- 202. 0 g Cm- 2). When biomass removal was taken into account, the farmland was a strong source for CO 2 of around 131. 9 g Cm- 2 during the growing season. Overall, land use changes by reclamation altered ecosystem CO 2 exchange at several ecological scales by changing the dominant vegetation type and altering the ecosystem's natural development.
