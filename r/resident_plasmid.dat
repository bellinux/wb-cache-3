5000|$|Rieger, Michaelis, and Green, in 1976 stated: [...] "abortive {{transfer}} - any DNA {{transfer from}} bacterial donor to recipients cells {{that fails to}} establish the incoming DNA {{as part of the}} hereditary material of the recipient. A. t. has been observed following → transduction → transformation, and → conjugation. In all cases, the transmitted fragment is diluted out as the culture grows. Failure of integration of transferred DNA into the hereditary material of the recipient cell may be due to: 1. The failure of incoming DNA to form circular molecules; 2. circularization takes place, but the circular molecule fails to take up maintenance system. A. t. of the extrachromosomal elements (→ plasmids) as opposed to chromosomal fragments, is relatively uncommon elements since plasmids are genetic elements of autonomous survival in a bacterial cell. It is only when a mutation in the recipient or a <b>resident</b> <b>plasmid</b> makes the host component of the plasmid maintenance system inactive that a. t. of a plasmid occurs.

In general, ΔpAMβ 1 was transferred more efficiently than the pGKV plasmids.

40|$|Plasmid factors {{involved}} in the stable propagation of pKD 1 -derived vectors in Kluyveromyces lactis transformants have been identified. Three genes (A, B and C) {{have been found to}} be present in pKD 1 : the interruption of the B and C genes led to high plasmid instability. Stability could be restored in trans when host cells contained pKD 1 as the <b>resident</b> <b>plasmid</b> (pKD 1 + strains). The A gene, which codes for a site-specific recombinase, did not affect plasmid partitioning. Vectors bearing only the pKD 1 replication origin (or a chromosomal ARS), and no other pKD 1 sequence, were very unstable both in the presence and absence of the <b>resident</b> <b>plasmid</b> in host cells. These vectors could be stabilized in pKD 1 + strains, but not in pKDI- strains, by the insertion of a 200 bp-long pKDI sequence. This sequence, called the cis-acting stability locus (CSL), together with the products of the B and C genes, ensured plasmid partitioning at cell divison. Possible hairpin structures and direct repeats were regularly spaced within the CSL.

No plasmid was found {{in any of the}} E. coli recipients, even in matings in which a plasmid was identified in the donor Haemophilus sp. The Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. caused instability of <b>resident</b> <b>plasmids</b> in the recipient E. coli: all plasmids were lost within 30 generations in antibiotic-free media. However, by serial subculture in antibiotics, stable <b>resident</b> <b>plasmids</b> were obtained which carried the Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. and were transferable by conjugation and transformation among E. coli strains. All Haemophilus determinants hybridized with a probe for the Tcr determinant on Tn 10, which bears inducible Tcr. However, Haemophilus determinants were constitutively resistant to tetracycline in the Haemophilus donors and in the E. coli recipients. This constitutive expression was recessive to wild-type Tn 10 in the same cell, indicating that the constitutive phenotype resulted from the absence of an active repressor. Restrictive enzyme analysis of various E. coli plasmid derivatives bearing a Tcr determinant from Haemophilus sp. demonstrated that the inserted DNA was of similar size (8. 95 to 9. 35 kilobases), close to that of Tn 10.

Strains in some serogroups were more competent as recipients of plasmids than were those in others. Five test plasmids in an E. coli K- 12 (rough) donor transferred significantly less efficiently to two smooth strains than to their rough or semirough isogenic derivatives. When the same smooth and rough strains were used as donors, the plasmids transferred to E. coli K- 12 equally well. These results suggested that the O-antigenic lipopolysaccharide side chains of diarrheagenic E. coli isolates shielded the outer membrane receptors for conjugative pili, thus preventing plasmid entry. The different receptors for eight bacteriophages were also covered by O side chains.

Octopine Ti plasmids were found to become established only infrequently in recipients with a nopaline Ti plasmid and, vice versa, nopaline Ti plasmids were only rarely established in recipients with an octopine Ti plasmid. Rare clones in which the incoming octopine (nopaline) Ti plasmid had been established despite the presence of a nopaline (octopine) Ti plasmid appeared to harbor cointegrates consisting of the entire incoming Ti plasmid and the entire <b>resident</b> Ti <b>plasmid.</b> The integration event invariably had occurred in a region of the plasmids that is highly conserved in evolution and that is essential for oncogenicity. These results show that octopine and nopaline Ti plasmids cannot be maintained as separate replicons by one and the same cell.

Agrobacterial non-Ti octopine and nopaline plasmids were found to belong to another incompatibility group.

40|$|Cells {{transformed}} with bovine papilloma virus type 1 mutants in the E 6 or E 6 / 7 {{genes are}} resistant to high-copy-number amplification of wild-type DNA after supertransfection.

In contrast, the <b>resident</b> <b>plasmid</b> does not participate in amplification and is maintained at a constant low copy number. Cotransformation of M- mutants and wild-type DNA into these cells leads to shutoff of replication of both genomes.

After cellular digestion with 2 mg of lysozyme per ml for 7 min at 37 degrees C, 1 % {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} exposure resulted in complete and immediate lysis. Lactose (Lac) plasmid species in Streptococcus lactis C 2 and S. cremoris B 1 (30 and 37 megadaltons, respectively) were demonstrated upon examination of DNA from the cleared lysates by agarose gel electrophoresis. Increasing the lysozyme treatment to 20 min or more resulted in loss of the Lac <b>plasmid,</b> whereas other <b>resident</b> <b>plasmids</b> were unaffected and demonstrable in agarose gels. Diethylpyrocarbonate added before lysis prevented Lac plasmid loss in 20 -min lysozyme-treated cells, but was not effective after 40 min of lysozyme treatment. The results suggested that endogenous nuclease activity during the lysozyme treatment period initiated Lac plasmid DNA loss. The development of an efficient lysis procedure for the group N streptococci allowed rapid identification and characterization of plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Enteritidis PTs 1, 4 and 8, commonly associated with poultry world-wide, were converted to PTs 21, 6 and 13 a respectively.

Enzymatic studies allowed us to define the HMW structure as linear double-stranded tandem head-to-tail plasmid repeats.

Transfer of the selectable tetracycline resistance plasmid pBC 16 and other plasmids from B. thuringiensis to B. anthracis and B. cereus recipients occurred during mixed incubation in broth. Two plasmids, pXO 11 and pXO 12, found in B. thuringiensis were responsible for plasmid mobilization. B. anthracis and B. cereus transcipients inheriting either pXO 11 or pXO 12 were, in turn, effective donors. Transcipients harboring pXO 12 were more efficient donors than those harboring pXO 11; transfer frequencies ranged from 10 (- 4) to 10 (- 1) and from 10 (- 8) to 10 (- 5), respectively. Cell-to-cell contact was necessary for plasmid transfer, {{and the addition of}} DNase had no effect. The high frequencies of transfer, along with the fact that cell-free filtrates of donor cultures were ineffective, suggested that transfer was not phage mediated. B. anthracis and B. cereus transcipients which inherited pXO 12 also acquired the ability to produce parasporal crystals (Cry+) resembling those produced by B. thuringiensis, indicating that pXO 12 carries a gene(s) involved in crystal formation.

Laf+ and Laft were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. Plasmid analysis of Laf− Lafs variants revealed that pPM 52 and pPM 68 were cured with loss of Laf+ and Laft. Bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in Laf+ Laft transconjugants not harboring pPM 52 and pPM 68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants.

In vivo, while a plasmid {{carrying the}} ytl 2 gene was stabilized, another plasmid (lacking ytl 2) coexisting in the same cell was not. This result suggests that the Ytl 2 protein, newly synthesized in a transcription-translation complex, binds preferentially to DNA of the replicon which encodes it and that this binding initiates subsequent cooperative DNA coating by more Ytl 2 molecules. Plasmid-encoded newly synthesized Ytl 2 protein is thus unavailable to stabilize coresident plasmid DNA, which does not contain the ytl 2 gene. (C) 2001 Academic Press...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{analysis}} of essential genes has been generally {{restricted to the}} use of conditional mutations, or inactivating chromosomal mutations, which require a complementing plasmid that must either be counterselected or lost to measure a phenotype. These approaches are limited because they do not permit the analysis of mutations suspected to affect a specific function of a protein, nor do they take advantage of the increasing abundance of structural and bioinformatics data for proteins. Using the dnaC gene as an example, we developed a genetic method that should permit the mutational analysis of other essential genes of Escherichia coli and related enterobacteria. The method consists of using a strain carrying a large deletion of the dnaC gene, which is complemented by a wild-type copy expressed from a plasmid that requires isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for maintenance. Under conditions in which this <b>resident</b> <b>plasmid</b> is lost, the method measures the function of a dnaC mutation encoded by a second plasmid. This methodology should be widely applicable to the {{genetic analysis}} of other essential genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} and characterization of a Streptococcus lactis ML 3 strain which possessed a recombinant lactose plasmid is described. The recombination events generating this plasmid occurred in vivo in a recombination-deficient strain {{and appeared to}} be mediated by transposition events. Restriction mapping revealed that the recombinant plasmid, pDA 0307, contained a region of the lactose plasmid, pSK 08, linked to another <b>resident</b> <b>plasmid,</b> pSK 07. Copy number determinations indicated that the lac genes were present at approximately 20 copies per cell in pDA 0307, whereas the lac genes are normally present at approximately 10 copies per cell in pSK 08. The strain containing pDA 0307 displayed a 21 to 54 % increase in the expression of the Lac enzyme phospho-β-d-galactosidase. However, the strain containing pDA 0307 both grew and produced lactic acid in milk at rates identical to that of a strain containing pSK 08. This result suggests that lac gene dosage of plasmid-linked lac genes was not limiting the rate at which these derivatives of S. lactis ML 3 fermented milk...|$|E
40|$|We have inactivated the ospC, oppAIV, and guaB genes on the 26 -kb {{circular}} plasmid of Borrelia burgdorferi (cp 26) by allelic exchange. On {{several occasions}} following such transformations, the cp 26 of transformants had an aberrant mobility through agarose gels. Characterization of these cp 26 molecules {{showed that the}} plasmid had dimerized. These dimers were quite stable during either selective or nonselective passage. Subsequent transformations with dimer DNA supported the hypothesis that in B. burgdorferi, transforming cp 26 DNA most likely does not displace the <b>resident</b> homologous <b>plasmid</b> but rather must recombine in order to donate sequences that it carries. These serendipitous findings provide a mechanism for obtaining heterozygous complemented control strains when mutant phenotypes are characterized...|$|R
40|$|Soil samples {{collected}} from a fallow field {{which had not}} been cultivated for 5 years harbored a population of Agrobacterium spp. estimated at 3 × 107 CFU/g. Characterization of 72 strains selected from four different isolation media showed the presence of biovar 1 (56 %) and bv. 2 (44 %) strains. Pathogenicity assays on five different test plants revealed a high proportion (33 %) of tumorigenic strains in the resident population. All tumorigenic strains belonged to bv. 1. Differentiation of the strains by {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cellular proteins, and utilization patterns of 95 carbon substrates (Biolog GN microplate) revealed a diversified bv. 1 population, composed of five distinct chromosomal backgrounds (chr A, C, D, E, and F), and a homogeneous bv. 2 population (chr B). chr A, B, C, and D were detected at similar levels throughout the study site. According to opine metabolism, pathogenicity, and agrocin sensitivity, chr A strains carried a nopaline Ti plasmid (pTi), whereas chr C strains had an octopine pTi. In addition, four of six nontumorigenic bv. 1 strains (two chr D, one chr E, and one chr F) had distinct and unusual opine catabolism patterns. chr B (bv. 2) strains were nonpathogenic and catabolized nopaline. Although agrocin sensitivity is a pTi-borne trait, 14 chr B strains were sensitive to agrocin 84, apparently harboring a defective nopaline pTi similar to pAtK 84 b. The other two chr B strains were agrocin resistant. The present analysis of chromosomal and plasmid phenotypes suggests that in this Agrobacterium soil population, there is a preferential association between the <b>resident</b> <b>plasmids</b> and their bacterial host...|$|R
40|$|Three new Lactobacillus vectors {{based on}} cryptic Lactobacillus {{plasmids}} were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP 3537 {{consists of a}} 2. 3 -kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD 353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE 194, and pUC 19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE 317 and pLPE 323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE 194 into a 1. 7 - and a 2. 3 -kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD 353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP 825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397 - 401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 102 to 107 transformants per μg of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD 353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP 3537 or pLPE 323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2. 3 -kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE 317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD 353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1. 7 -kb plasmid. The curing phenomena {{are most likely to}} be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and <b>resident</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE 323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far...|$|R
