This model interprets the origins of the two contributions (intra- and interband transitions) of the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) by investigating the local and global behavior of the wavepackets. It also elucidates the underlying physical picture of the HHG intensity enhancement by means of carrier-envelope phase (CEP), chirp and inhomogeneous fields. It provides a deep insight into the emission of high-order harmonics from solids.

This paper introduces MEDLEY and summarizes the results for OAEI 2012. 1 Presentation of the system MEDLEY can be presented as an OWL ontology alignment method that relies on simple similarity metrics. Each ontology pair, can be transformed into graphs structures. This means that links are OWL primitives and nodes are classes, properties, and individuals. The algorithm includes a lexical, structural treatment. Each node can be matched with few ones, then MEDLEY select pairs that maximize the global similarity value. 1. 1 State, purpose, general statement MEDLEY generates alignments between OWL-DL ontologies based on simple lexical metrics and structures matching between links of each node (class, property, instance).

40|$|As a {{results of}} a {{depletion}} of atmospheric ozone all living organisms on the earth"s surface may be exposed to increased amounts of ultraviolet radiation. In man, ultraviolet radiation (UVR, especially UV-B) can cause, in addition to some beneficial effects like vitaming D formation, deleterious effects on the human health. Examples are diseasesof the skin, like erythema, photoageing and skin cancer and diseases of the eye, like keratitis and cataract. There are reasons to believe that UV-B radiation depresses the immunity against tumours and infectious diseases. It was demonstrated that UV-B suppresses the resistance against UV-induced tumours in mice and that this suppression is transferable to other mice if lymphocytes of UV-irradiated animals are used. Clinical research showed the induction of suppressor cells and inhibition of the NK activity by exposure to sunlight. UV-B can interact <b>in</b> <b>diffrent</b> ways with the immune system; antigen-presenting cells in the skin can be affected, the homing of lymphocytes may be distrurbed {{and the amount of}} suppressor cells often increased.

40|$|Summary A {{complete}} set of conditions describing the expanding undular bore transition in nonlinear conservative wave dynamics is derived. The transition conditions are obtained in a general form by employing the asymptotic formulation of the problem based on the Whitham modulation equations and allow, in particular, determination of the lead solitary wave amplitude {{as a function of}} the initial jump in (generally) non-integrable systems. Several examples pertaining to the shallow water dynamics and collisionless plasma physics are considered. BACKGROUND Undular bores (<b>in</b> <b>diffrent</b> contexts also called dispersive, or collisionless shocks) represent regions of rapidly oscillating nonlinear wave structures evolving out of smooth initial or boundary conditions of nonlinear dispersive wave equations. In the presence of small dissipation, the undular bores despite their oscillatory structure exhibit global properties characteristic for classical, turbulent bores or shock waves: they have steady, though wavy, profile and constant width such that the speed of the bore propagation and the transition conditions can be derived within the classical theory of hyperbolic conservation laws. The qualitative theory of such undular bores has been first developed by Benjamin and Lighthill [1] for shallow water waves and by Sagdeev [2] for rarefied plasma flows. This classical theory of steady undular bores, however, is valid only for the regime, when nonlinearity, dispersion and dissipation are in balance. Contrastingly, in the case when dispersive effects dominate dissipation, the traditional analysi...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how interaction between the actors works during Miniröris. In my observations the interaction occurs between children and teachers and children and children. In my study I have chosen to focus on the younger children in preschool, that is children 1 - 3 years. I have chosen to observe different Miniröris sessions to explore my question. I have personally selected which three preschools I will observe at. I have observed, three days in a row on three different departments, these three different departments are at three different preschools, in order to collect data. As I have observed, I have taken field notes to record what happens. In the study, interaction takes place between child and teacher and child and child. Based on my study I have come to the conclusion that interaction between the actors look different, for example children observe other children or teachers or the children observe and perform the movements they have observed. Sometimes the educators also has talked to the children by asking questions or giving them exhortations. Children have also different ways to cooperate in the performance of various movements. I have seen a pattern that the children have known a movement before someone told them or shown them. Children have participated <b>in</b> <b>diffrent</b> ways, I have seen children participated on a distance to the group.
