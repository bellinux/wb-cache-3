40|$|ABSTRACTIn some {{clinical}} studies performed {{in patients with}} perennial allergic rhinitis, <b>ramatroban,</b> a new thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist, significantly improved nasal symptoms. As yet the mechanism of action of this drug has not been fully elucidated. In the present study we investigated the effects of <b>ramatroban</b> on changes in nasal reactivity and levels of inflammatory cells and mediators in nasal lavage fluid after allergen challenge. <b>Ramatroban</b> was administered orally at a daily dose of 150 mg (b. i. d.) for 4 weeks to 11 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis exhibiting positive responses to nasal allergen challenge with house dust mite. Analysis of variance revealed {{that there was a}} significant decrease in eosinophil counts and eosinophil cationic protein levels in nasal lavage fluid when compared with values immediately before allergen challenge before and after <b>ramatroban</b> treatment. Histamine, tryptase and albumin levels were significantly decreased in analysis of variance before and after <b>ramatroban</b> treatment. The degree of nasal reactivity to histamine was also significantly decreased after the <b>ramatroban</b> treatment. These findings indicate that <b>ramatroban</b> decreases important pathogenic factors in allergic rhinitis, resulting in an improvement in nasal symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mast cell-derived {{prostaglandin}} D 2 (PGD 2), {{may contribute}} to eosinophilic inflammation and mucus production in allergic asthma. Chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on TH 2 cells (CRTH 2), a high affinity receptor for prostaglandin D 2, mediates trafficking of TH 2 -cells, mast cells, and eosinophils to inflammatory sites, and has recently attracted interest as target for treatment of allergic airway diseases. The present study involving mice explores the specificity of CRTH 2 antagonism of TM 30089, which is structurally {{closely related to the}} dual TP/CRTH 2 antagonist <b>ramatroban,</b> and compares the ability of <b>ramatroban</b> and TM 30089 to inhibit asthma-like pathology. Methods Affinity for and antagonistic potency of TM 30089 on many mouse receptors including thromboxane A 2 receptor mTP, CRTH 2 receptor, and selected anaphylatoxin and chemokines receptors were determined in recombinant expression systems in vitro. In vivo effects of TM 30089 and <b>ramatroban</b> on tissue eosinophilia and mucus cell histopathology were examined in a mouse asthma model. Results TM 30089, displayed high selectivity for and antagonistic potency on mouse CRTH 2 but lacked affinity to TP and many other receptors including the related anaphylatoxin C 3 a and C 5 a receptors, selected chemokine receptors and the cyclooxygenase isoforms 1 and 2 which are all recognized players in allergic diseases. Furthermore, TM 30089 and <b>ramatroban,</b> the latter used as a reference herein, similarly inhibited asthma pathology in vivo by reducing peribronchial eosinophilia and mucus cell hyperplasia. Conclusion This is the first report to demonstrate anti-allergic efficacy in vivo of a highly selective small molecule CRTH 2 antagonist. Our data suggest that CRTH 2 antagonism alone is effective in mouse allergic airway inflammation even to the extent that this mechanism can explain the efficacy of <b>ramatroban.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundIt {{is known}} that the {{symptoms}} of allergic rhinitis can significantly reduce {{the quality of life}} of the patient. One of such typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis is nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction is currently thought to be closely related to the presence and abundance of lipid mediators, such as leukotriene and thromboxane (TX) A 2. The novel drug <b>ramatroban,</b> a TXA 2 receptor antagonist, which has been developed by Bayer Yakuhin Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), has been demonstrated, in clinical trials, to improve nasal obstruction in the treatment of patients with allergic rhinitis and it has recently become commercially available. MethodsIn the present study, <b>ramatroban</b> was administered for 28 days to 10 patients who were diagnosed with perennial allergic rhinitis but were untreated. Changes in self-reported symptom scores and in vivo allergic reaction parameters were assessed during three observational periods. ResultsFrom baseline scores, all three symptom scores after 28 days treatment with <b>ramatroban</b> declined clearly in all patients, except for one patient who suffered a cold during the study period and had aggravated rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction as a result. The concentrations of histamine and TXB 2 (a metabolite of TXA 2) in the nasal fluid induced by antigen challenge after the 28 day treatment period also decreased in most subjects compared with concentrations during the pretreatment period. The symptom scores for nasal obstruction during the pretreatment period were correlated with the concentration of TXB 2 in antigen-induced nasal fluid. ConclusionsThe present study reconfirmed the clinical efficacy of a post-marketed drug, namely <b>ramatroban,</b> in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In addition, the results suggest that <b>ramatroban</b> suppressed the secretion of chemical mediators in nasal that are thought to be involved in the allergic reaction in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{show some}} level of basal {{activity}} {{even in the absence}} of an agonist, a phenomenon referred to as constitutive activity. Such constitutive activity in GPCRs is known to have important pathophysiological roles in human disease. The thromboxane A 2 receptor (TP) is a GPCR that promotes thrombosis in response to binding of the prostanoid, thromboxane A 2. TP dysfunction is widely implicated in pathophysiological conditions such as bleeding disorders, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Recently, we reported the characterization of a few constitutively active mutants (CAMs) in TP, including a genetic variant A 160 T. Using these CAMs as reporters, we now test the inverse agonist properties of known antagonists of TP, SQ 29, 548, <b>Ramatroban,</b> L- 670596 and Diclofenac, in HEK 293 T cells. Interestingly, SQ 29, 548 reduced the basal activity of both, WT-TP and the CAMs while <b>Ramatroban</b> was able to reduce the basal activity of only the CAMs. Diclofenac and L- 670596 showed no statistically significant reduction in basal activity of WT-TP or CAMs. To investigate the role of these compounds on human platelet function, we tested their effects on human megakaryocyte based system for platelet activation. Both SQ 29, 548 and <b>Ramatroban</b> reduced the platelet hyperactivity of the A 160 T genetic variant. Taken together, our results suggest that SQ 29, 548 and <b>Ramatroban</b> are inverse agonists for TP, whereas, L- 670596 and Diclofenac are neutral antagonists. Our findings have important therapeutic applications in the treatment of TP mediated pathophysiological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of human}} CRTH 2 + CD 4 + T helper type 2 (Th 2) cells with anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28 led to {{time-dependent}} production of prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) which peaked at 8 hr. The production of PGD 2 was completely inhibited by cotreatment with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (10 Î¼m) {{but was not}} affected by cotreatment with <b>ramatroban,</b> a dual antagonist of both the thromboxane-like prostanoid (TP) receptor and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2). Supernatants from activated CRTH 2 + CD 4 + Th 2 cells caused a concentration-dependent increase in the migration of naive CRTH 2 + CD 4 + Th 2 cells compared to supernatants from unstimulated CRTH 2 + CD 4 + Th 2 cells. The level of chemotactic activity peaked at 8 hr after activation, corresponding to the peak levels of PGD 2, but production of chemotactic activity was only partially inhibited by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac. In contrast, <b>ramatroban</b> completely inhibited the chemotactic responses of naive Th 2 cells to supernatants from activated CRTH 2 + CD 4 + Th 2 cells collected up to 8 hr after activation, although supernatants collected 24 hr after activation were less sensitive to inhibition by <b>ramatroban.</b> The selective TP antagonist SQ 29548 did not inhibit migration of Th 2 cells, implicating CRTH 2 in this response. These data suggest that CRTH 2 plays an important paracrine role in mediating chemotactic activation of Th 2 cells. Interestingly, although PGD 2 is produced from Th 2 cells and contributes to this paracrine activation, it appears that additional CRTH 2 agonist factors are also produced by activated Th 2 cells {{and the production of}} these factors occurs independently of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid metabolism...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mast cells release {{mediators}} upon stimulation {{that contribute}} to the pathogenesis of chronic airway disease, including the recruitment and activation of Th 2 lymphocytes. The objective was to determine the involvement of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and its receptors in the chemotaxis of Th 2 cells, using nasal polyp tissue. METHODS: Tissue explants from ten patients with nasal polyposis were incubated with RPMI alone or RPMI containing IgE/anti-IgE for 30 min. Some samples were treated with diclofenac to inhibit the production of PGD(2). Supernatants were assayed for PGD(2) content and for their ability to promote human Th 2 cell chemotaxis in the presence and absence of a CRTH 2 antagonist. Transcript levels of D protanoid receptor type 1 (DP(1)), chemoattractant receptor-homologous receptor expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2) and PGD(2) synthase were analysed by real time PCR. RESULTS: Increased release of PGD(2) by nasal polyp tissue treated with IgE/anti-IgE was significantly inhibited by preincubation of the tissue with diclofenac. Transcript levels of PGD(2) synthase, DP(1) and CRTH 2 receptors increased after stimulation with IgE/anti-IgE. Supernatants from IgE/anti-IgE-stimulated nasal polyp tissue caused significantly increased chemotaxis of Th 2 cells. The levels of PGD(2) produced and the degree of Th 2 cell chemotaxis were highly correlated. Diclofenac inhibited the production of Th 2 cell chemotactic activity, and the chemotactic effect of the supernatant on Th 2 cells was inhibited by the CRTH 2 antagonist <b>ramatroban.</b> CONCLUSION: These data suggest that in immunologically activated nasal polyp tissue, PGD(2) produced by mast cells promotes the migration of Th 2 cells through a CRTH 2 dependent mechanism...|$|E

DOI: 10. 1007 /s 00011 - 009 - 8112 - 3 Objective and design: Prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) {{has been shown to}} cause eosinophil, basophil and Th 2 cell chemotaxis in vitro and in vivo through an action on the prostaglandin CRTH 2 receptor. In the present study, the dependence of PGD 2 -induced eosinophil accumulation in vivo on interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) blood eosinophilia was investigated. Materials: Guinea-pigs were exposed to aerosols of 13, 14 dihydro 15 -keto PGD 2 (DK-PGD 2) or platelet activating factor (PAF) and the eosinophil content of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or blood determined. In some experiments, DK-PGD 2 was administered systemically and eosinophilia measured. Results: Aerosols of DK-PGD 2 caused eosinophil accumulation in the lungs 24 h after exposure. DK-PGD 2 (10 ??g. ml- 1) -induced airway eosinophilia was inhibited when animals were treated with the CRTH 2 receptor antagonist <b>ramatroban.</b> 1 ??? 4 h after exposure to DK-PGD 2 a significant decrease in blood eosinophil count was measured. The anti-IL- 5 antibody TRFK- 5 had no inhibitory effect of DK-PGD 2 -induced airway eosinophilia, but abolished airway eosinophilia induced by exposure of guinea-pigs to aerosols of PAF. Intracardiac injection of DK-PGD 2 induced a dose-related increase in blood eosinophil numbers. Conclusions: It is concluded that, in the guinea-pig, DKPGD 2 -induced airway eosinophilia is mediated by an action on prostaglandin CRTH 2 receptors and that this response appears to be independent of IL- 5...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that interaction of PGD(2) with chemoattractant receptor- homologous molecule expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2) promotes chemotaxis and proinflammatory cytokine production by Th 2 lymphocytes. In {{this study we}} show a novel function of CRTH 2 in mediating an inhibitory effect of PGD(2) on the apoptosis of human Th 2 cells induced by cytokine deprivation. This effect was mimicked by the selective CRTH 2 agonist 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-PGD(2), inhibited by the CRTH 2 antagonists <b>ramatroban</b> and TM 30089, and not observed in CRTH 2 -negative T cells. D prostanoid receptor 1 (DP(1)) or the thromboxane-like prostanoid (TP) receptor did not {{play a role in}} mediating the effects of PGD(2) on the apoptosis of Th 2 cells because neither the DP(1) antagonist BW 868 C nor the TP antagonist SQ 29548 had any effect on the antiapoptotic effect of PGD(2). Apoptosis of Th 2 cells induced by Fas ligation was not suppressed by treatment with PGD(2), illustrating that activation of CRTH 2 only inhibits apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation. Treatment with PGD(2) induced phosphorylation of Akt and BAD, prevented release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and suppressed cleavage of caspase- 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in Th 2 cells deprived of IL- 2. The PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 blocked the effect of PGD(2) both on the signaling events and on the apoptotic death of Th 2 cells. These data suggest that in addition to promoting the recruitment and activation of Th 2 cells, PGD(2) may also impede the resolution of allergic inflammation through inhibiting apoptosis of Th 2 cells...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) is a lipid {{mediator}} produced by mast cells, macrophages and Th 2 lymphocytes {{and has been}} detected in high concentrations in the airways of asthmatic patients. There are two receptors for PGD 2, namely the D prostanoid (DP) receptor and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2). The proinflammatory effects of PGD 2 leading to recruitment of eosinophils and Th 2 lymphocytes into inflamed tissues {{is thought to be}} predominantly due to action on CRTH 2. Several PGD 2 metabolites have been described as potent and selective agonists for CRTH 2. In this study we have characterized the activity of delta 12 -PGD 2, a product of PGD 2 isomerization by albumin. Delta 12 -PGD 2 induced calcium mobilization in CHO cells expressing human CRTH 2 receptor, with efficacy and potency similar to those of PGD 2. These effects were blocked by the TP/CRTH 2 antagonist <b>ramatroban.</b> delta 12 -PGD 2 bound to CRTH 2 receptor with a pKi of 7. 63, and a 55 -fold selectivity for CRTH 2 compared to DP. In Th 2 lymphocytes, delta 12 -PGD 2 induced calcium mobilization with high potency and an efficacy similar to that of PGD 2. delta 12 -PGD 2 also caused activation of eosinophils as measured by shape change. Taken together, these results show that delta 12 -PGD 2 is a potent and selective agonist for CRTH 2 receptor and can cause activation of eosinophils and Th 2 lymphocytes. These data also confirm the selective effect of other PGD 2 metabolites on CRTH 2 and illustrate how the metabolism of PGD 2 may influence the pattern of leukocyte infiltration at sites of allergic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|PGD 2, {{produced}} by mast cells, has been detected in high concentrations at sites of allergic inflammation. It can stimulate vascular and other inflammatory responses by interaction with D prostanoid receptor (DP) and chemoattractant receptor-like molecule expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2) receptors. A significant role for PGD 2 in mediating allergic responses {{has been suggested}} based on the observation that enhanced eosinophilic lung inflammation and cytokine production is apparent in the allergen-challenged airways of transgenic mice overexpressing human PGD 2 synthase, and PGD 2 can enhance Th 2 cytokine production in vitro from CD 3 /CD 28 -costimulated Th 2 cells. In the present study, we investigated whether PGD 2 {{has the ability to}} stimulate Th 2 cytokine production in the absence of costimulation. At concentrations found at sites of allergic inflammation, PGD 2 preferentially elicited the production of IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13 by human Th 2 cells in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. Gene transcription peaked within 2 h, and protein release peaked approximately 8 h after stimulation. The effect of PGD 2 was mimicked by the selective CRTH 2 agonist 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-PGD 2 but not by the selective DP agonist BW 245 C, suggesting that the stimulation is mediated by CRTH 2 and not DP. <b>Ramatroban,</b> a dual CRTH 2 /thromboxane-like prostanoid receptor antagonist, markedly inhibited Th 2 cytokine production induced by PGD 2, while the selective thromboxane-like prostanoid receptor antagonist SQ 29548 was without effect. These data suggest that PGD 2 preferentially up-regulates proinflammatory cytokine production in human Th 2 cells through a CRTH 2 -dependent mechanism {{in the absence of any}} other costimulation and highlight the potential utility of CRTH 2 antagonists in the treatment of allergic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Human cultured mast cells, immunologically {{activated}} with immunoglobuin E (IgE) /anti-IgE, {{released a}} factor(s) that promoted chemotaxis of human CRTH 2 + CD 4 + T helper type 2 (Th 2) lymphocytes. Mast cell supernatants collected at 20 min, 1 hr, 2 hr and 4 hr after activation caused a concentration-dependent {{increase in the}} migration of Th 2 cells. The effect of submaximal dilutions of mast-cell-conditioned media was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by <b>ramatroban</b> (IC 50 = 96 nm), a dual antagonist of both the thromboxane-like prostanoid (TP) receptor and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2), but not by the selective TP antagonist SQ 29548, implicating CRTH 2 in mediating the chemotactic response of these Th 2 cells. The effect of mast-cell-conditioned media was mimicked by prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) and this eicosanoid was detected in the conditioned media from activated mast cells in concentrations sufficient {{to account for the}} activity of the mast cell supernatants. Treatment of the mast cells with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (10 microm) inhibited both the production of PGD 2 and the CRTH 2 + CD 4 + Th 2 -stimulatory activity, while addition of exogenous PGD 2 to conditioned media from diclofenac-treated mast cells restored the ability of the supernatants to promote chemotaxis of these Th 2 cells. The degree of inhibition caused by diclofenac treatment of the mast cells was concordant with the degree of inhibition of chemotactic responses afforded by CRTH 2 blockade. These data suggest that PGD 2, or closely related metabolites of arachidonic acid, produced from mast cells may {{play a central role in}} the activation of CRTH 2 + CD 4 + Th 2 lymphocytes through a CRTH 2 -dependent mechanism...|$|E
