30|$|We {{investigated}} interval modulation of SSEs by {{two types}} of earthquake loading: effects of nucleation and external stress perturbation. We confirmed that SSE <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> tend to be shorter owing to a nucleation process of a nearby large earthquake, based on the numerical modeling with the frictional system. The decreasing rate of the SSE intervals depends on magnitude of the elastic interaction. One important point is {{the distance between the}} SSE and earthquake areas. When the distance between the SSE and earthquake areas is nearly zero with the same size of the SSE and earthquake areas, the short-term further decrease in the SSE <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> occurs just before the earthquake occurrence. Only the short-term decrease can be as significant as the fluctuation of the SSE <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> by external stress perturbation. The effect of the external stress perturbation on the SSE <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> continues until the occurrence of the adjacent earthquake.|$|R

It is SSW-NNE trending and runs for about 170km from the northwestern end of the Hula Basin to its junction with the Missyaf Fault. It has been the location of several major historical earthquakes, such as the 1202 Syria event. The estimated average slip rate along the Yammouneh fault is 4.0 to 5.5mm per year, with a major earthquake <b>recurrence</b> <b>interval</b> of 1020 to 1175 years.

25|$|The {{contrasting}} {{characteristics of}} the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Kenji Satake. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80–100-year <b>recurrence</b> <b>interval)</b> normally result in regions with high topographic relief, which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.|$|E

It extends 70km from {{the eastern part of}} the Hanmer Basin to just west of the junction with the Jordan Thrust near Kowhai River. The slip-rate for this segment, estimated from offset alluvial features, is about 23mm/yr. The fault dips steeply to the northwest at about 70° and forms the southern termination of the Seaward Kaikoura, Hawk and Amuri ranges. This topography is a result of the significant component of reverse displacement on this fault zone.

Characterizing fire regimes and projecting fire <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> for different biomes are important in managing those ecosystems and quantifying carbon dynamics of those ecosystems. This study used Canadian wildfire datasets, 1980 – 1999, to characterize relationships between number of fires and burned area for 13 ecozones and to calculate wildfire <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> in each ecozone. For the study period, wildfires were found to follow power–law relationships between frequency densities (number of fires normalized to unit bins) and burned areas in all ecozones. Power–law frequency–area relationships also held for both anthropogenic fires and natural fires in the 1980 s and 1990 s. For each Canadian ecozone using {{the parameters of the}} power–law frequency–area distributions, fire <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> were then calculated for wildfires equal to or larger than a given size of burned area. Fire <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> ranged from 1 to 32 years for burned areas> 2 km 2, and from 1 to 100 years for burned areas> 10 km 2 in every 10 000 -km 2 spatial area for each ecozone. The information obtained through characterizing the wildfires and the fire <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> calculated in this study will provide guidance to wildfire risk managers throughout Canada. The findings of this study will also be a benefit to future efforts in quantifying carbon dynamics in Canadian boreal terrestrial ecosystems...|$|R

Thus, by assuming frictional heterogeneity beneath the Kii Peninsula, which behaves as a barrier to rupture propagation, he found that Nankai Trough earthquakes tend to initiate off Kumano-nada, where the oceanic plate is subducting at a steep dip angle, and the increase in time intervals between rupture on the eastern and western segments with seismic cycles (from concurrent rupture to several years of time lag) occurs simultaneously with shortening of the <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> (111 – 95  years). Although a quantitative comparison of the <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> shows large gaps between simulated and historical values, this is qualitatively consistent with the increasing time intervals between rupture on the eastern and western segments in the three recent seismic cycles (e.g., simultaneous in 1707, 30  h in 1854, and 2  years in 1944 and 1946) and the shortening of the <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> (209, 147, and 90  years). Furthermore, Hori et al. (2009) suggested that seismic cycle simulations with nesting asperities (hierarchical asperity) with different fracture energies explained much larger variation of earthquake magnitudes and <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> because of the remarkable change in the stressing rate near the earthquake nucleation point (off Kumano-nada for Nankai Trough earthquakes) between seismic cycles.

Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown.

For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff hydrograph that might result from a 100-year storm, although the <b>recurrence</b> <b>interval</b> of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and climate change.|$|E
25|$|The source area of this {{earthquake}} has {{a relatively}} high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5–0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, {{it was estimated that}} the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260–880 years, which is consistent with the <b>recurrence</b> <b>interval</b> of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7 since 1926 in this area only had released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{statistical}} properties of <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> of extreme events {{is crucial to}} risk assessment and management of complex systems. The probability distributions and correlations of <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> for many systems have been extensively investigated.

In this Letter, we adopt an order-driven stock market model {{to address this issue}} for stock returns. We find that the distributions of the scaled <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> of simulated returns have a power law scaling with stretched exponential cutoff and the intervals possess multifractal nature, which are consistent with empirical results. We further investigate the effects of long memory in the directions (or signs) and relative prices of the order flow on the characteristic quantities of these properties. It is found that the long memory in the order directions (Hurst index $H_s$) has a negligible effect on the interval distributions and the multifractal nature. In contrast, the power-law exponent of the interval distribution increases linearly with respect to the Hurst index $H_x$ of the relative prices, and the singularity width of the multifractal nature fluctuates around a constant value when $H_x...|$|R

The epicenter of the shock was at the [...] fault's southwestern end, at a point where it may end, or merge with the east–west trending Pleito thrust fault. The White Wolf Fault (as illuminated by the aftershocks) was found to be curved, with less dip on the northeast end, though that zone also had a higher strike-slip component. Other distinct characteristics on that end of the fault were the shallower shocks and the less overall slip. If the total fault displacement came about as a result of the same type of large-displacement shocks like the one in 1952, the <b>recurrence</b> <b>interval</b> was proposed to be 170–450 years.

A study in Fallen Leaf Lake, just south of Lake Tahoe, used seafloor mapping techniques to image evidence for paleoearthquakes on the West Tahoe and revealed the last earthquake occurred between 4,100 and 4,500 years ago.

The 2011 Yellow Sea event also has a low stress drop, which is lower than the typical value for shallow intraplate earthquakes, similar to the 1984 Southern Yellow Sea event. Meanwhile, earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula and just off the east coast seem to have higher stress drops, indicating that they are typical intraplate events. Therefore, the Yellow Sea region may be in a different geologic, or tectonic, setting from that of the Korean Peninsula or northern China. Choi (2010) estimated stress drops of two moderate Yellow Sea events (2003 M 4.9 and 2003 M 5.0 events in Fig. 2) to be about 10 – 30 MPa.

However, the actual frequency of occurrence of these discharges is often several times more frequent than the statistical expectation. This result was confirmed by using the Log-Pearson Type 3 statistical method to analyze measured annual series of instantaneous peaks and peak daily means for 150 catchments in six states in the North Central Region of the United States. Discharge records ranged from 39 to 102 years and catchment sizes ranged from 29 to 6475 km 2.

The approach provided ratios of calculated to expected occurrences that were approximately 1. 0. For <b>recurrence</b> <b>intervals</b> less than five years, the FDD calculated discharges were much greater than those obtained by using the Log-Pearson Type 3 approach with annual series of instantaneous peaks or peak daily means.
