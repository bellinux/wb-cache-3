5|$|Cornering weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping {{of the rear}} suspension. Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. <b>Rear</b> <b>loading</b> also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E

25|$|In U.S. {{military}} service, the Short 330 {{was designated}} C-23A Sherpa. The C-23B Sherpa {{was similar to}} the C-23A, but with cabin windows. The C-23B+ Short 360 derivative was created by replacing the rear fuselage of Short 360s obtained on the second-hand market with the twin tail and <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp of the Short Sherpa.|$|E
25|$|C-23B+ Super Sherpa: Short 360 {{aircraft}} purchased as {{used aircraft}} by the U.S. Army and modified by the West Virginia Air Center (WVAC) for {{the replacement of}} the rear fuselage of the Short 360, with its single tall fin, with the twin tail and <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp of the Short Sherpa. 28 civil aircraft were modified.|$|E
25|$|A single C-123B {{was tested}} as a {{possible}} replacement for the Candle aircraft, with its <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp removed and replaced with a large box with 28 large lights. The aircraft could continuously light a two-mile circle from an altitude of 12,000ft. This aircraft, under the provisional designation NC-123B was dropped because the lights, fixed to the aircraft, made it far easier for enemy gunners to track compared to the earlier flare ships.|$|E

2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{system for}} the USAF's H-3E helicopters is described as standard to the HH-3E, and capable of being fitted as required to the CH-3E. [...] The basic system comprises three M60 machine guns, one each at the forward door, the opposite emergency window, and the <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp. The forward two positions comprise pintle mounts on skate rails, while the <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp station comprises a pedestal mount on an armored floor plate. The floor plate slides on two tracks, forward and back, to and from its firing position {{at the edge of}} the ramp. Either the standard infantry M60 can be used, with standard 200-round ammunition boxes attached, or the M60D variant, feeding via flexible ammunition chutes from 750-round boxes fixed to the floor (or to the armored floor plate for the <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp position).|$|E

50|$|The chassis is {{considerably}} different in design {{to the standard}} Defender chassis even though it looks similar. The side walls are standard, {{most of the rest}} is bespoke.The additional <b>rear</b> <b>load</b> bed mounting was to take increased weights as the standard chassis kept punching big dents in the rear floor.|$|R

2500|$|The {{conceptual}} design {{is for a}} large tandem wing aircraft with V-22 type engines and [...] rotors {{at each of the}} four wing tips. The C-130-size fuselage would have a [...] cargo bay with a <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp that could carry 110 paratroopers or 150 standard-seating passengers. In cargo configuration, it would accommodate eight 463L pallets.|$|E
2500|$|The Sikorsky S-61R was {{developed}} as a derivative of their S-61/SH-3 Sea King model. [...] It features a substantially revised fuselage with a <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp, a conventional though watertight hull instead of the S-61's boat-hull, and retractable tricycle landing gear. [...] The fuselage layout was used by Sikorsky for the larger CH-53 variants, and by the much later (though similarly-sized) S-92.|$|E
2500|$|The Type 192 shared some of {{its design}} {{features}} with the cancelled naval variants, which made it less than ideal for transporting troops. The front undercarriage was unusually tall, originally designed to give adequate clearance for loading torpedoes underneath the fuselage in the anti-submarine warfare role. This left the main passenger and cargo door [...] above the ground. The engines were placed {{at either end of}} the cabin. (By comparison the purpose-designed troop transport contemporary Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight had its engines above the aft cabin to permit a <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp). To provide access to the cabin from the cockpit there was a small entry past the engine that resulted in a bulge on the left side of the fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{external}} design alterations were minor detail changes. The bonnet was reshaped with a pressed bulge {{to allow the}} new, taller engine to fit in the engine bay whilst meeting pedestrian safety rules. This also avoided the need to re-design the engine sump to clear the axle. The new dashboard and ventilation system necessitated {{the removal of the}} distinctive air vent flaps underneath the windscreen which had been a feature of previous Land Rover utility models since the 1950s. While the flaps were deleted, the bulkhead pressing remained the same, so the outlines of where the flaps would be are still present. Passenger and <b>Rear</b> <b>Loading</b> doors were re-engineered to reduce corrosion and galvanic reaction. All other panels retained the same shape and styling that is viewed by enthusiasts as [...] "iconic".|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} of the CH-46 was largely taken up by its cargo bay, complete with a <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for the carriage of extended cargoes or for parachute drops. Various furnishings were normally provided to aid in its use as a utility rotorcraft, such as an internal winch mounted within the forward cabin, {{which can be used}} to assisting loading by pulling external cargo on pallets into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers, and an optionally-attached belly-mounted cargo hook, which would be usually rated at [...] for carrying cargoes externally underneath the Sea Knight; despite the hook having been rated at , this was safety restricted to less payload as they got older. When operated in a typical configuration, the CH-46 would usually be operated by a crew of three; a larger crew could be accommodated when required, which would be dependent upon mission specifics. For example, a search and rescue (SAR) variant would usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such operations. For self-defense, a pintle-mounted 0.50 in (12.7mm) Browning machine gun could be mounted {{on each side of the}} helicopter. Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of armor along with the machine guns.|$|E
2500|$|One hope of {{improving}} sales {{was to develop}} the Herald as a military transport. The Royal Air Force had a requirement for 45 tactical transports to replace piston-engined Vickers Valettas, and Handley Page began work in 1960 on the HP.124 to meet this need. This would have a new rear fuselage with a <b>rear</b> <b>loading</b> ramp under the raised tail. The HP.124 was considered favourite to beat Avro's 748 derivative, the Avro 780, with the high wing of the Handley Page expected to give easier loading than the more expensive Avro. While short-field testing of the prototype Herald 200 at RAF Martlesham Heath in 1961 showed off the Herald's good handling and ability to operate from unprepared airstrips, other obstacles were more taxing. [...] The Minister of Aviation, Peter Thorneycroft, refused to sign a contract for the HP.124 unless Handley Page would agree to a merger with British Aircraft Corporation or Hawker Siddeley {{as part of the}} government's policy of consolidation of the British aircraft industry. [...] As Hawker Siddeley offered less than half the valuation that Frederick Handley Page placed on the company, the merger did not occur, and the RAF's order went to the Avro 780, which became the Andover. The Herald Series 400 was a simpler tactical transport with a strengthened cabin floor and side loading doors that could be opened in flight for dropping of supplies or paratroops. Eight were built for the Royal Malaysian Air Force.|$|E
