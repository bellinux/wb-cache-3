25|$|Cobra Mark III {{production}} {{began on}} 1 January 1965; two prototypes {{had been sent}} to the United States in October 1964. Cars were sent to the US as unpainted <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis,</b> and they were finished in Shelby's workshop.|$|E
25|$|Post-2000, {{assembly}} and {{setting of the}} motion proceeded, and attention turned {{to the design of}} the boiler; a £250,000 appeal was launched. Tornado became a <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> by October 2002, and achieved the first synchronous movement of the motion and all wheels in August 2004.|$|E
25|$|Shipping {{costs were}} considerable: From Kenosha, Wisconsin the Nash engines and {{drivelines}} went to England for installation in the Healey-fabricated frames. Healey then sent the <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> to Italy, where Pininfarina's craftsmen fashioned the bodywork and assembled the finished product. Finally Farina exported the cars to America. The {{result was a}} $5,908 sticker price in 1953, while the new Chevrolet Corvette was $3,513.|$|E
5000|$|The body {{engineer}} for the Corvette was Ellis James Premo. He presented a {{paper to the}} Society of Automotive Engineers in 1954 regarding {{the development of the}} body. Several excerpts highlight some of the key points in the body material choice: The body on the show model was made of reinforced plastic purely as an expedient {{to get the job done}} quickly.Although we were going ahead with the building of an experimental plastic body in order to get a car <b>rolling</b> for <b>chassis</b> development work - at the time of the Waldorf Show, we were actually concentrating body-design-wise on a steel body utilizing Kirksite tooling for the projected production of 10,000 units during the 1954 model year. It was some time later that we decided to produce this quantity in reinforced plastic.About this time, some doubt was expressed that we should build the 1954 model of steel. People seemed to be captivated by the idea of the fiberglass plastic body. Furthermore, information being given to us by the reinforced plastic industry seemed to indicate the practicality of fabricating plastic body parts for automobiles on a large scale.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new control {{strategy}} for the active control of a hydraulically controlled half-car active suspension system. Our study proposes a special construction of the suspension system where the hydraulic actuator is {{to be placed in}} series with the conventional passive one to form a special case of low-frequency active suspension. The full dynamics of the electro-hydraulic servo-valve and hydraulic actuator were employed. Response of proposed control strategy has been tested for different road profiles and riding conditions including car <b>chassis</b> <b>rolling</b> effect when cornering and pitch movements when braking/ acceleration. Results have shown superior performance of our modified controller over passive suspensions and many other controllers of previous studies. Simulations show that our proposed controller provide better passenger comfort as it lowers maximum body acceleration by 94. 3 % and with reduction in body travel by 98. 8 % of that of passive one. Also, our proposed control strategy has shown better road handling and car stability over a whole range of road and inertial disturbances...|$|R
25|$|Ray Saidel, {{enthusiastic}} {{about the prospect of}} selling TVRs in the United States, purchased several cars in addition to the <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> that he had bought previously; he imported one Open Sports and three Coupes, with the intention of selling them under the Jomar name. He was not especially successful in selling the cars, and felt that one problem lay in the car's styling. Saidel wrote to the factory and suggested that the next model be styled as a fastback.|$|E
25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a floor pan extended by 21inches behind {{the front seat and}} strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The floor pan with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|E
25|$|The more {{powerful}} 6C 1750 (1752cc actual) {{was introduced in}} 1929 in Rome. The car featured {{a top speed of}} 95mph, a chassis designed to flex and undulate over wavy surfaces, as well as sensitive geared-up steering. It was produced in six series between 1929 and 1933. Base model had a single overhead cam; Super Sport and Gran Sport versions had double overhead cam engine (DOHC). Again, a supercharger was available. Most of the cars were sold as <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> and bodied by coachbuilders such as Zagato, and Touring. Additionally, there were 3 examples built with James Young bodywork, one of which {{is a part of the}} permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA in original, unrestored condition.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Alfa Romeo {{announced}} that the 8C {{was not to be}} sold to private owners, but by autumn 1931 Alfa sold it as a <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> in Lungo (long) or Corto (short) form with prices starting at over £1000. The chassis were fitted with bodies from a selection of [...] Italian coach-builders (Carrozzeria) such as Zagato, Carrozzeria Touring, Carrozzeria Castagna, Pininfarina and Brianza, even though Alfa Romeo did make bodies. Some chassis were clothed by coach-builders such as Graber, Worblaufen and Tuscher of Switzerland and Figoni of France. Alfa Romeo also had a practice of rebodying cars for clients, and some racing vehicles were sold rebodied as road vehicles. Some of the famous first owners include Baroness Maud Thyssen of the Thyssen family, the owner of the aircraft and now scooter company Piaggio Andrea Piaggio, Raymond Sommer, and Tazio Nuvolari.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> is {{the chassis}} {{of a car}} or truck, {{assembled}} together with the engine and drivetrain, but without bodywork. Such <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> were built by car makers, for supply to coachbuilders who would later build the bodywork. Although common {{in the early days}} of motoring, such <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis</b> are now rare. A few custom markets, such as limousines, may still use them.|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I the Australian Government imposed a tariff on imported vehicles, with tax concessions applying to <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis,</b> as a stimulus to develop a sovereign motor vehicle industry. The chassis concession acted as a financial incentive for local coach-builders to import factory built <b>rolling</b> <b>chassis,</b> and fit uniquely Australian designed and built bodies, leading {{to the establishment of}} an Australian motor vehicle bodybuilding industry in the early 1920s.|$|E
