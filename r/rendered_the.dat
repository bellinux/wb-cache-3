5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> painting unfashionable.

5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E

5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> colors in post-production {{to make them more}} subtle, for realism.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{was laid}} down at Brest in November 1905 and {{launched}} on 21 September 1907. She {{was completed in}} January 1911 and commissioned into the French fleet.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1928 Florida–Georgia game, Georgia fans trumpeted {{the return}} of center Ike Boland to bolster its defense. Florida's defense, however, <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> Georgia Bulldogs' running game, {{including}} that of fullback Herdis McCrary, ineffective {{en route to a}} 26–6 victory. This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and solidified the Gators as legitimate contenders for their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Hansa served {{abroad for}} the first nine years of her career in the German navy. In 1884, it was found that her iron hull was badly corroded, which <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> ship unfit for further active service. She was {{therefore}} removed from active duty and used for a variety of secondary roles. From 1884 to 1888, she served as a guard ship in Kiel, where she also trained engine and boiler room personnel. In 1888, she was stricken from the naval register and used as a barracks ship in Kiel. She was moved to Mönkeberg in 1905, where she continued to train boiler room personnel, until 1906 when she was sold to ship-breakers and dismantled for scrap.|$|E

In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing {{nearly all of the}} film's violence, which effectively <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1982, Clemson University was put on {{probation}} by the NCAA for recruiting violations.

Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which <b>rendered</b> <b>the</b> monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E
