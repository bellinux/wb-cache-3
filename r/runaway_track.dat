50|$|Because of {{accidents}} involving downgrade runaway trains {{in the late}} 1880s, the then Southern Railway built two runaway safety spur tracks. These were originally manned junctions, which were always switched to a 60 ft pile of earth, which could stop downgrade runaway trains. Only upon hearing a whistle signal from the downgrade train would the signalman manning the spur junction throw the switch to keep the train on the main line. In later years, CTC signaling was installed along with automated switches and timer circuits for the one surviving runaway safety track {{at the bottom of}} the grade at Melrose. Trains running downgrade were required to maintain 8 mph when approaching the <b>runaway</b> <b>track</b> switch. This would allow a timer circuit to determine if a train was under control, in which case the switch from the <b>runaway</b> <b>track</b> at Melrose would be aligned to the mainline. But for speed greater than 8 mph the switch would remain aligned for the <b>runaway</b> <b>track.</b> Saluda Grade was one of the few grades in the country where uphill trains could travel faster than their downhill counterparts. Most uphill trains had to double or triple the grade, splitting the train into sections to be taken up the grade to Saluda one at a time and reassembled there for the rest of the trip to Asheville.|$|E

After the <b>Runaways</b> <b>track</b> Victor down at his school, the sight of Karolina Dean {{activates}} Victor's electromagnetic superpowers - it would later be revealed that Victor's powers would manifest only when he came in contact with another superhero, hence Karolina.|$|R
5000|$|Laurel Summit (13.04 mi) is in current-day Laurel Summit State Park. The {{railroad}} built a pavilion {{here for}} summer dances. At this point, {{there was a}} southward spur to the community of Kuhn, built in 1908 and owned by Blair Lumber Company. Immediately {{to the east of}} Laurel Summit, the right-of-way passes from Westmoreland County into Somerset County, and runs down the east face of Laurel Hill. The segment between Laurel Summit and Allenvale constituted the steepest segment of the route. There were emergency turn-offs for runaway trains, and the default position of the switch was to keep it turned to the emergency <b>runaway</b> <b>track.</b> Therefore a train would have had to make numerous stops while a crew member disembarked, turned the switch toward the main line, and then reverted the switch toward the <b>runaway</b> <b>track</b> after the train had passed.|$|E

50|$|On 19 November 1910, {{the driver}} of a goods train was killed after his train got out of control on the Heathcote branch line, as it descended the steep grade leading to the {{junction}} of the branch with the main North East railway line at Kilmore Junction (later known as Heathcote Junction). The air brakes on the train had become defective, so the driver and guard {{decided to use the}} hand brakes on the goods wagons to control the train on its descent. These proved ineffective and the train ran away down the grade. It was diverted on to a 66 yd runaway siding which had recently been provided at the junction to prevent out-of-control trains from running on to the main line. When the locomotive hit the clay bank {{at the end of the}} <b>runaway</b> <b>track</b> it overturned, and the driver was fatally injured.|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} Bloodhounds were {{exported}} to the USA is not known. Bloodhounds {{were used to}} <b>track</b> <b>runaway</b> slaves before the American Civil War, {{but it has been}} questioned whether the dogs used were genuine Bloodhounds. However, in the later part of the 19th century, and in the next, more pure Bloodhounds were introduced from Britain, and bred in America, especially after 1888, when the English breeder, Edwin Brough, brought three of his hounds to exhibit at the Westminster KC show in New York City. He went into partnership with Mr J L Winchell, who with other Americans, imported more stock from Britain. Bloodhounds in America have been more widely used in tracking lost people and criminals - often with brilliant success - than in Britain, and the history of the Bloodhound in America is full of the man-trailing exploits of outstanding Bloodhounds and their expert handlers, the most famous hound being Nick Carter. Law enforcement agencies have been much involved in the use of Bloodhounds, and there is a , originating in 1962.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the early}} members of the Underground Railroad {{were part of the}} American Colonization Society and the Quakers. Its early state president, Rev. Stephen S. Harding, later the {{governor}} of Utah, used his home in Milan as a safehouse. The members maintained numerous safehouses throughout the state, these included barns, private homes, churches, and even caves and coal mines were used. The system gradually evolved in the 1830s and 1840s, and reached it peak use during the 1850s. After the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, slave catchers were able to operate much more freely and aggressively. A network of slave catchers grew, mostly {{in the southern part of}} the state, offering their services and knowledge of the area to southerners who were <b>tracking</b> <b>runaway</b> slaves. The slave catchers' continued agitation of their neighbors, and the common sight of bound slaves being drug back to the south had a gradual effect among the majority of the population, stirring them from their former indifference to the issue of slavery and leading to more widespread involvement in the underground railroad and the general attempt to hamper the efforts of the slave catchers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1841, Wathaurung man Bonjon (or, alternately, [...] "Bon Jon") {{was charged}} with murder for killing Yammowing of the Gulidjan people whose {{territory}} bordered that of the Wathaurung. According to the Wesleyan missionary Francis Tuckfield, one of the witnesses in the case, Bonjon had {{been in contact with}} Europeans more than any other member of the Wathaurong, having even been a volunteer member of the Native Police for some time. According to police magistrate Foster Fyans, Bonjon was with the Native Police for seven months, <b>tracking</b> <b>runaway</b> horses and generally assisting the other members. The prosecution alleged that on or about 14 July 1841, Bonjon shot Yammowing {{in the head with a}} carbine at Geelong, killing him.The prosecution ultimately abandoned the case and Bonjon was eventually discharged. The case in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip, R v Bonjon, later become notable for the legal question of whether the colonial courts had jurisdiction over offences committed by Aboriginal people inter se, that is, by one Aboriginal person against another, and the legal situation as to the British acquisition of sovereignty over Australia, and its consequences for the Aboriginal people.|$|R

Sparks further elaborated about the song:What grabbed me at first actually was the fact it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and tried to imagine what they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell."Battlefield" [...] was released digitally in the United States on May 8, 2009, and was sent to US contemporary hit radios on May 25.

5000|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by Bill Conti, since the series' regular composer, John Barry, {{was unable to}} work in the UK for tax reasons (he, like many high earning Britons, had become a tax exile in the 1970s). Barry had recommended Conti as a possible alternative. Conti's score is notable for its use of disco elements (which prompted Danny Biederman to write in the liner notes to the two-CD release The Best of James Bond: 30th Anniversary Limited Edition, [...] "Conti's largely disco-styled score feels more like a celebration of the music of the moment than a score of durability"). During the main ski chase sequence (the <b>track</b> <b>Runaway),</b> Conti showed that he had versed himself in the previous Bond films' music, as his manages to evoke memories of the music from previous ski action in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. This, Conti's only contribution to the series to date, was released as an album concurrent with the film's release and later on a bootleg compact disc in combination with John Barry's music from Octopussy. When the soundtrack was officially released on CD in the year 2000, six bonus tracks were added that further showed Conti's versatile approach to the film, aiding the production in its return to a tougher, more realistic James Bond. Not released but also heard in the film is a brief homage to John Williams' familiar theme from Jaws, when an unseen underwater horror (it is revealed to be an attacker in a JIM diving suit) approaches within the sunken ship. This was the third Bond film in a row to wittily include familiar music from a classic film. Additionally, notes from the title song to The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "Nobody Does It Better", can be heard as the tones of a key code for a security door early in the film.|$|R
