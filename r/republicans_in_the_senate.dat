5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E

Carper said that he preferred legislation that would have a greater chance of becoming law, such as an increase to only $9 an hour.|$|E

Many privacy advocates have decried this law and Senator Feinstein's vote in favor of it.|$|E
500|$|The Liberal Republican {{movement}} {{lasted from}} 1870 to 1875 {{and at times}} {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between party members, both Democrat and Republican, who adopted all or parts of the Liberal Republican reform agenda. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872, a Liberal Republican platform, that gave amnesty to former Confederates. Another instance occurred when the Democratic Party reluctantly and chaotically melded with the Liberal Republican Party in the presidential election of 1872, in support of the reformer, Horace Greeley. [...] The height of the Liberal Republican era in the U.S. Congress was from the periods of 1873 to 1875 with 7 Liberal <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and 4 Liberal Republicans in the House of Representatives.|$|E
500|$|On February 7, 2017, <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> voted that Sen. Warren had {{violated}} Senate rule 19 {{during the debate}} on attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, claiming that she impugned his character when she quoted statements made about Sessions by Coretta Scott King and Sen. Ted Kennedy. [...] "Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill {{the free exercise of}} the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen," [...] King wrote in a 1986 letter to Sen. Strom Thurmond, which Warren attempted to read on the Senate floor. This action prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions' nomination for United States Attorney General. Instead, she stepped into a nearby room and continued reading King's letter while streaming live on the Internet.|$|E

500|$|Republican {{leaders had}} heard that Borah was an {{attorney}} for corporations, who had prosecuted labor leaders; they believed him sympathetic to their Old Guard positions and assigned him to important committees. [...] In fact, Borah believed in the rights of unions, {{so long as they}} did not commit violent acts. When Borah staked out progressive positions after his swearing-in, Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, hoped to put pressure on him through the Westerner's corporate clients, only to find that he had given up those representations before coming to Washington. Borah became {{one of a growing number}} of progressive <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Yet, Borah often opposed liberal legislation, finding fault with it or fearing it would increase the power of the federal government. Throughout his years in the Senate, in which he would serve until his death in 1940, his idiosyncratic positions would limit his effectiveness as a reformer.|$|E
500|$|On July 17, 2011, Cordray was {{selected}} over Warren {{as the head}} of the entire CFPB. However, his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization. [...] This was part of a pattern of conflict between <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations. On July 21, 2011, Senator Richard Shelby wrote an op-ed article for The Wall Street Journal affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different. Politico interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was [...] "Dead on Arrival". In October, as the nomination continued to be on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General endorsed Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination. The final vote was 53-45, with 50 out of 51 Democrats voting for cloture, and 45 out of 47 Republicans voting against.|$|E

50|$|The 1942 United States {{elections}} were held on November 3, 1942, and elected {{the members of}} the 75th United States Congress. In Democratic President Franklin D.
