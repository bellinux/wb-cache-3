40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis of fiber tension distribution within a ring spun yarn without relaxation. Yarn <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> is determined {{on the basis}} of the translation of fiber tension at the spinning triangle, as presented in the first part of this series of papers, into the fiber tension within the yarn. The results from numerical simulations indicate that, with fiber buckling, the yarn exhibits a lower average fiber tension and, thus, a much reduced yarn <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> than that without fiber buckling. Comparison with experiments confirmed that fiber buckling exists in ring yarns while the assumption of no fiber buckling is not realistic. Generally, a low yarn twist results in low average fiber tension in the yarn and, thus, a reduced yarn <b>residual</b> <b>torque.</b> A symmetrical spinning triangle leads to a slightly higher yarn <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> than a right-angle spinning triangle when the yarn counts and twists are identical and fiber buckling occurs.

40|$|A {{wave energy}} {{dissipation}} (WED) -based linear acoustic approach and a vibro-acoustic modulation (VM) -based nonlinear method were developed comparatively, for detecting bolt loosening in bolted joints and subsequently evaluating the <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> of the loose bolt. For WED-based, an analytical model residing on the Hertzian contact theory was established, whereby WED {{was linked to}} the <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> of a loose bolt, contributing to a linear index. For VM-based, contact acoustic nonlinearity (CAN) engendered at the joining interface, when a pumping vibration perturbs a probing wave, was interrogated, and the nonlinear contact stiffness was described in terms of a Taylor series, on which basis a nonlinear index was constructed to associate spectral features with the <b>residual</b> <b>torque.</b> Based respectively on a linear and a nonlinear premise, the two indices were validated experimentally, and the results well coincided with theoretical predication. Quantitative comparison of the two indices surmises that the VM-based nonlinear method outperforms the WED-based linear approach in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, and particularly when the bolt loosening is in its embryo stage. In addition, the detectability of the nonlinear index is not restricted by the type of the joint, against a high dependence of its linear counterpart on the joint type.

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for spin-stabilized spacecraft attitude prediction is presented for {{the influence of}} the residual magnetic torques and the satellite in an elliptical orbit. Assuming a quadripole model for the Earth s magnetic field, an analytical averaging method is applied to obtain the mean <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> in every orbital period. The orbit mean anomaly is used to compute the average components of <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> in the spacecraft body frame reference system. The theory is developed for time variations in the orbital elements, giving rise to many curvature integrals. It is observed that the residual magnetic torque does not have component along the spin axis. The inclusion of this torque on the rotational motion differential equations of a spin stabilized spacecraft yields conditions to derive an analytical solution. The solution shows that the <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> does not affect the spin velocity magnitude, contributing only for the precession and the drift of the spin axis of the spacecraft. The theory developed has been applied to the Brazilian s spin stabilized satellites, which are quite appropriated for verification and comparison of the theory with the data generated and processed by the Satellite Control Center of Brazil National Research Institute.

40|$|ABSTRACTDesign of a Pump Jet Propulsor (PJP) was {{undertaken}} for an underwater body with axisymmetric configuration using {{axial flow compressor}} design techniques supported by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis for performance prediction. Experimental evaluation of the PJP was carried out through experiments in a Wind Tunnel Facility (WTF) using momentum defect principle for propulsive performance prior to proceeding with extensive experimental evaluation in towing tank and cavitation tunnel. Experiments were particularly conducted with respect to Self Propulsion Point (SPP), <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> and thrust characteristics over a range of vehicle advance ratio in order to ascertain whether sufficient thrust is developed at the design condition with least possible imbalance torque left out due to residual swirl in the slip stream. Pumpjet and body models were developed for the propulsion tests using Aluminum alloy forged material. Tests were conducted from 0 m/s to 30 m/s at four rotational speeds of the PJP. SPP was determined confirming the thrust development capability of PJP. Estimation of <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> was carried out at SPP corresponding to speeds of 15, 20 and 25 m/s to examine {{the effectiveness of the}} stator.

40|$|During {{the mode}} {{transition}} from the pure electric propulsion mode to the hybrid propulsion mode, clutch-based pre-transmission parallel hybrid electric vehicles are subject to drivability issues. These issues originate {{from the fact that}} in the clutch-based pre-transmission parallel hybrid powertrain (CPPHP) configuration, the clutch connects the engine and the motor. Without a carefully designed mode transition control that coordinates the engine torque, clutch torque and motor torque, torque sluggishness and surges occur during the mode transition, and <b>residual</b> <b>torque</b> oscillation occurs after the mode transition. In this paper, a discrete-time model predictive control (DMPC) -based controller is proposed to address these drivability-related issues.

Furthermore, by using discrete-time Laguerre functions and introducing the equilibrium state and the ranking of constraints, an explicit solution of the discrete-time model predictive controller is obtained.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the choice of}} either no-slip or stress-free boundary conditions affects numerical models of rapidly rotating flow in Earth's core by computing solutions of the weakly-viscous magnetostrophic equations within a spherical shell, driven by a prescribed body force. For non-axisymmetric solutions, we show that models with either choice of boundary condition have thin boundary layers of depth E^(1 / 2), where E is the Ekman number, and a free-stream flow that converges to the formally inviscid solution. At Earth-like values of viscosity, the boundary layer thickness is approximately 1 m, for either choice of condition. In contrast, the axisymmetric flows depend crucially on the choice of boundary condition, in both their structure and magnitude (either E^(- 1 / 2) or E^(- 1)). These very large zonal flows arise from requiring viscosity to balance <b>residual</b> axisymmetric <b>torques.</b> We demonstrate that switching the mechanical boundary conditions can cause a distinct change of structure of the flow, including a sign-change close to the equator, even at asymptotically low viscosity. Thus implementation of stress-free boundary conditions, compared with no-slip conditions, may yield qualitatively different dynamics in weakly-viscous magnetostrophic models of Earth's core.

While much of the focus has been directed towards robot-based methods, mechanically passive methods capable of providing similar therapeutic benefits in a less expensive and safer package are also being explored. Such devices are more practical for wide-spread use, both in a clinical setting {{as well as for}} in-home therapy. This thesis developed a mechanically passive device for neuromuscular rehabilitation after stroke called WRIST (Wrist Resonator for Independent Stroke Training). WRIST incorporates a tone-canceling linkage designed to counteract intrinsic wrist stiffness to ease movement, as well as an appropriately designed mass and superimposed spring stiffness to create a resonant environment that the user can take advantage of to facilitate repetitive wrist flexion and extension.

Using the average method of modified small parameters, the dimensionless coupling equation of the two exciters is deduced. The synchronization criterion for the two exciters is derived as the torque of frequency capture being {{equal to or greater}} than the absolute value of difference between the <b>residual</b> electromagnetic <b>torques</b> of the two motors. The stability criterion of synchronous state is verified to satisfy the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. The regions of implementing synchronization and that of stability of phase difference for the two exciters are manifested by numeric method. Synchronization of the two exciters stems from the coupling dynamic characteristic of the vibrating system having selecting motion, especially, under the condition that the parameters of system are complete symmetry, the torque of frequency capture stemming from the circular motion of the rigid frame drives the phase difference to approach PI and carry out the swing of the rigid frame; that from the swing of the rigid frame forces the phase difference to near zero and achieve the circular motion of the rigid frame. In the steady state, the motion of rigid frame will be one of three types: pure swing, pure circular motion, swing and circular motion coexistence. The numeric and experiment results derived thereof show that the two exciters can operate synchronously as long as the structural parameters of system satisfy the criterion of stability in the regions of frequency capture. In engineering, the distance between the centroid of the rigid frame and the rotational centre of exciter should be as far as possible.

It might {{be explained by the}} fact that currents, electromagnetic torque value changes might be affected from stator terminal only. Nothing taking place in rotor circuit could be affected directly. Induction motor rundown regime attracts interest due to its particular feature: under unfavorable circumstances large inrush current and short-time shock nature mechanical forces at repeated motor switching at persistent stator field dangerous for induction motor can appear. Investigation and detailed research of induction motor rundown regime is important. Rundown regime occurs at any instance of induction motor switching. Rundown regime starts switching induction motor stator windings without power supply. Such switching can be purposeful or might occur because of some kind of network damages.

40|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{accurate}} accelerometers, the GOCE mission {{has proven to be}} a unique source of thermosphere neutral density and cross-wind data. In the current methods, in which only the horizontal linear accelerations are used, the vertical winds cannot be obtained. In the algorithm proposed in this paper, angular accelerations derived from the individual gradiometer accelerations are used to obtain the vertical wind speeds as well. To do so, the measured angular rate and acceleration are combined to find a measurement of the torque acting on the spacecraft. This measurement is then corrected for modeled control torque applied by the magnetic torquers, aerodynamic torque, gravity gradient torque, solar radiation pressure torque, the torque caused by the misalignment of the thrust with respect to the center of gravity, and magnetic torque caused by the operation of several different subsystems of the spacecraft bus. Since the proper documentation of the magnetic properties of the payload were not available, a least squares estimate is made of one hard- and one soft-magnetic dipole pertaining to the payload, on an aerodynamically quiet day. The model for aerodynamic torque uses moment coefficients from Monte-Carlo Test Particle software ANGARA. Finally the neutral density, horizontal cross-wind, and vertical wind are obtained from an iterative process, in which the <b>residual</b> forces and <b>torques</b> are minimized. It is found that, like horizontal wind, the vertical wind responds strongly to geomagnetic storms. This response is observed over the whole latitude range, and shows seasonal variations.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{model for the}} evolution of a protostellar disc that has formed self-consistently from the collapse of a molecular cloud core. The global evolution of the disc is followed for several million years after its formation. The capture {{of a wide range of}} spatial and temporal scales is made possible by use of the thin-disc approximation. We focus on the role of gravitational torques in transporting mass inward and angular momentum outward during different evolutionary phases of a protostellar disc with disc-to-star mass ratio of order 0. 1. In the early phase, when the infall of matter from the surrounding envelope is substantial, mass is transported inward by the gravitational torques from spiral arms that are a manifestation of the envelope-induced gravitational instability in the disc. In the late phase, when the gas reservoir of the envelope is depleted, the distinct spiral structure is replaced by ongoing irregular nonaxisymmetric density perturbations. The amplitude of these density perturbations decreases with time, though this process is moderated by swing amplification aided by the existence of the disc's sharp outer edge. Our global modelling of the protostellar disc reveals that there is typically a <b>residual</b> nonzero gravitational <b>torque</b> from these density perturbations, i. e. their effects do not exactly cancel out in each region. In particular, the net gravitational torque in the inner disc tends to be negative during first several million years of the evolution, while the outer disc has a net positive gravitational torque. Our global model of a self-consistently formed disc shows that it is also self-regulated in the late phase, so that it is near the Toomre stability limit, with a near-uniform Toomre parameter Q≈ 1. 5 - 2. 0.
