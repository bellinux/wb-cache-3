40|$|Development {{of new and}} {{innovative}} products through efficient technologies {{is essential for the}} implementation of sustainable developments in highly competitive chemical industries. Based on this context, raw materials originating from biomass have been widely used for the production of chemicals and materials. Steam cracking of bio-based or renewable feedstocks in a conventional steam cracking set-up is identified as a promising approach for the sustainable production of base-chemicals. In a two-step process for the production of base-chemicals, firstly, bio-derived feedstock is upgraded into a more suitable feedstock which comprises mainly paraffin range hydrocarbons with a lower oxygen content than the original feedstock; secondly, the upgraded feedstock is converted into base-chemicals by conventional steam cracking technology. This research work identifies wood-derived <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> as a potential feedstock for the production of base-chemicals by catalytic upgrading and steam cracking methods. The main aim of this work was to carry out the catalytic hydrotreating of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> feedstocks such as <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acid (TOFA), distilled <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (DTO) and crude <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO) on a commercial, sulfided NiMo catalyst at different process conditions. The effects of space time and process temperatures on the distribution of products from the hydrotreatment of different <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> feeds were investigated. Hydrotreating chemistry of oxygenates in <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> were assessed based on the achieved conversion of reactants and product distribution under the investigated conditions. Furthermore, the steam cracking of hydrodeoxygented <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (HDO-tall oil) feeds was carried out, and evaluation of the yield of olefins in comparison with conventional steam cracking feeds such as naphtha and natural gas condensate (NGC) ...|$|R

30|$|Conventionally, crude <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO) is {{obtained}} from the <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> soap by adding sulfuric acid to liberate free fatty and resin acids [1]. The CTO is then further purified and fractionated by vacuum distillation to obtain several commercial fractions including <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acids (TOFAs) (20 – 40  %), <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> rosin (TOR) (25 – 35  %), light oil (10 – 15  %), and pitch residue (20 – 30  %) [2 – 4]. The average yield of CTO is {{in the range of}} 30 – 50  kg/ton of pulp. In general, oleic (C 18 : 1) and linoleic (C 18 : 2) acids are the most significant fatty acid components in TOFAs.

40|$|Abstract Moisture content {{control is}} a very {{effective}} way of protecting timber. Treatments with environment-friendly, biodegradable <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> are known to reduce the capillary water uptake of pine sapwood greatly, but despite the good results achieved {{there have been two}} problems that limit the use of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> for wood protection, the large amount of oil needed and the tendency for the oil to exude from the wood. This work was undertaken in order to obtain an understanding of the mechanism of wood protection by means of crude <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO) and to find technical solutions to the main problems limiting its use for industrial wood protection. It is shown that the emulsion technique is one way of solving the first problem, as it provides high water-repellent efficiency at considerably lower oil retention levels. The fact that water is used as a thinner in this technique instead of the commonly used organic solvents is beneficial from environmental, economic and safety points of view. It is also shown that although the drying properties of CTO are inadequate for use as such in wood preservation, its oxidation and polymerization can be accelerated considerably by means of iron catalysts, which prevent the oil from exuding out of the wood. This also increases the water repellent efficiency of CTO treatment. Most impregnation oils do not dry when applied in large quantities, because they hinder the diffusion of air through the wood, which supplies the necessary oxygen. Limiting of the oil uptake by the means of the emulsion technique disturbs the airflow to a lesser extent, and thus enhances the drying process. Hence, both the emulsion technique and the use of an iron catalyst improve both the water-repellent efficiency of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> treatment and the rate of drying of the oil, thus solving the two main problems related to wood impregnation with <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> in one single-stage treatment which can be used in existing wood preservation plants. This is advantageous from both an industrial and an economic point of view...|$|R
