50|$|Engineering geologist.(a) Elements of the {{engineering}} geologist specialty. The practice of engineering geology involves the interpretation, evaluation, analysis, and application of geological information and data to civil works. Geotechnical soil and rock units are designated, characterized, and classified, using standard engineering soil and rock classification systems. Relationships are interpreted between landform development, current and past geologic processes, ground and surface water, and the strength characteristics of soil and rock. Processes evaluated include both surficial processes (for example, slope, fluvial, and coastal processes), and deep-seated processes (for example, volcanic activity and seismicity). Geotechnical zones or domains are designated based on soil and rocked geological strength characteristics, common landforms, related geologic processes, or other pertinent factors. Proposed developmental modifications are evaluated and, where appropriate, analyzed to predict potential or likely changes in types and rates of surficial geologic processes. Proposed modifications may include such things as vegetation removal, using various types of earth materials in construction, applying loads to shallow or deep foundations, constructing cut or fill slopes and other grading, and modifying ground and surface water flow. The effects of surficial and deep-seated geologic processes are evaluated and analyzed to predict their potential effect on public health, public safety, land use, or proposed development.(b) Typical engineering geologic applications and types of projects. Engineering geology is applied during all project phases, from conception through planning, design, construction, maintenance, and, in some cases, reclamation and closure. Planning-level engineering geologic work is commonly conducted in response to forest practice regulations, critical areas ordinances, and the State Environmental Policy Act. Typical planning-level engineering geologic applications include timber harvest planning, proposed location of residential and commercial developments and other buildings and facilities, and alternative route selection for roads, rail lines, trails, and utilities. Site-specific engineering geologic applications include cuts, fills, and tunnels for roads, trails, railroads, and utility lines; foundations for bridges and other drainage structures, retaining walls and shoring, dams, buildings, water towers, slope, channel and shoreline stabilization facilities, fish ladders and hatcheries, ski lifts and other structures; landings for logging and other work platforms; airport landing strips; <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> systems; blasting; and other major earthwork projects such as for aggregate sources and landfills.|$|E

30|$|When roadways {{are driven}} in broken <b>rocks,</b> <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> is not {{effective}} to control roadway deformations {{because of poor}} anchoring performance and low bearing capacity of bolts. Besides, when damaged roadways are repaired or overhauled, <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> can also hardly get good reinforcement performance. Combination of <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> and grouting is a promising approach to solve the reinforcement problems stated above.|$|R
30|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bolting</b> in Chinese {{coal mines}} {{had gone through}} a process from low strength, high strength, to high {{pretension}} and extra high strength. The <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> used in early time were mechanical anchored bolts, point-anchored bolts, and split-set bolts, which were of low strength and stiffness, applicable to roadways in simple geological conditions and used in a limited scope. In 1995, <b>rock</b> <b>bolted</b> gateroads accounted for only 15  % of total gateroads in Chinese coal mines. During 1996 – 1997, the Australian <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> technology was introduced, and additional researches and tests had been conducted based on the local geological and mining conditions, which obviously improved the level of <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> technology in China. The new technology, materials and methods, such as <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> made of deformed rebar with high strength and anchored with full-column resin, the dynamic bolting design method, and the pretensioned resin cables with small boreholes, were widely applied in some coal districts, good support performance and economic benefits had been achieved. To tackle the roadway support problems at depth and under complex conditions, the <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> technique with high pretension and extra high strength was developed since 2005, which can not only control the roadway deformation, but also greatly increase the roadway driving rate. The modern support design thought with high strength, high stiffness, high reliability and low density were realized. At present, <b>rock</b> <b>bolted</b> gateroads in state-owned medium-to-large coal mines accounts for about 70  %, even over 90  % in some coal districts, and <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> has been {{the first choice of}} roadway support forms in coal mines.|$|R

Corrosion is a {{negative}} contributor on the structural integrity of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and leads to degradation of the mechanical properties of steel <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> Exposure to chloride, seawater, salt and saltwater and deicing chemical environments influences <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and weakens it. In order to evaluate the influence of corrosion {{and the size of}} the steel on the mechanical properties of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt,</b> an experimental investigation was conducted on <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> whose rebar is 8, 12, 16, and 18 mm diameter...|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} on the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> {{at home and abroad}} has been conducted mainly focused on the development of new <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> methods (shape, material, fixing method, etc.); however, the experimental study on the reinforcing effects of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> is insufficient. The analysis of the existing studies found that these studies were conducted through a numerical analysis in the concept of the support and others (shotcrete, steel rib, etc.) in terms of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> Thus, there have been few experimental studies on the reinforcing effects of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> only [1].|$|E

30|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bolting</b> {{mechanism}} {{is different from}} that of supports acting on the roadway surface. As rocks basically belong to non-continuum, the method used for continuum is not applicable in analyzing the functions of <b>rock</b> <b>bolting.</b> To fully exert the function of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts,</b> enough anchoring force is necessary, moreover, spreading the bolt resistance force into the rocks is also important. The non-continuous deformations, caused by separation, slip, fracture opening and new-born cracks, are the key factors to prevent the bolt resistance force from spreading into rocks. Lots of underground practices have shown that <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> should be installed with enough pretension as soon as the roadway is excavated, the initial separation of rocks can be restrained, and the bolting performance is best (Zhang and Gao 2004; Kang et al. 2007 a). However, if <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are installed in broken and separated <b>rocks,</b> even the <b>bolts</b> were heavily loaded, the bolting performance is poor. Therefore, the bolting theory with high pretension and extra high strength was proposed (Kang et al. 2007 b, 2009 c), the cores of which emphasize the decisive roles of bolt pretension and its spreading into <b>rocks</b> on <b>bolting</b> performance. The <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> with high pretension and extra high strength can effectively reinforce roadways once for all without twice or more supporting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bolts</b> work by 'knitting' {{the rock}} mass {{together}} sufficiently {{before it can}} move enough to loosen and fail by unraveling (piece by piece). As in the photo, <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> {{may be used to}} support wire mesh, but this is usually a small part of their function. Unlike common anchor <b>bolts,</b> <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> can become 'seized' throughout their length by small shears in the rock mass, so they are not fully dependent on their pull-out strength. This has become an item of controversy in the Big Dig project, which used the much lighter pull-out tests for <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> rather than the proper tests for concrete anchor bolts.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model of the}} grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> in soft rock. The behavior of both the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> system and the single <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> are discussed respectively. The coupling mechanism of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and rock mass is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} displacement. A simple method is suggested for the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> design in tunneling. According to the analysis, displacement of rock mass controls the initial force in rock mass. Case simulations confirm the previous findings that a bolt in-situ has a pick-up length, an anchor length and at least one neutral point. The theoretical prediction of single <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> agrees with the measured data. The position of the neutral point is not only related to the length of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and the internal radius of the tunnel, but is also strongly influenced by the properties of rock mass. Neutral point and maximum axial load in the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> tend to be constant when the anchor length of the bolt is sufficiently long, which means that increasing the length of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> may result in only a slight improvement in displacement control under certain conditions...|$|E
30|$|This study thus {{attempted}} {{to confirm the}} reinforcing effects of the jointed rock mass {{in terms of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> by creating a concrete block ground that has simulated the uniform jointed rock mass and conducting a large scale model test based on the pretension of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and the length of the reinforced ground as parameters. To obtain the reinforcing effects that only the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> exerts, the elastic modulus of the model ground reinforced by the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> reinforcing the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> was derived by creating the model ground into a cantilever shape, excavating the bottom ground of the concrete block, and measuring the maximum deflection of the model ground.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the contribution of grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> on the stability of concrete dams. The load capacity of the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are assessed considering eventual deteriorating processes. An additional objective was to compare the resulting load capacity with the prevailing regulations in RIDAS (the power companies’ guidelines on dam safety) and possibly suggest new guideline values. The literature study consists of two parts; concrete dams and grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> In the first part concrete dams are discussed and especially the inherent forces and aspects when controlling their stability. The second part treats grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> and the theoretical focus is on their function and possible failure modes {{as well as on}} the degrading processes (primarily corrosion) that are affecting the <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b>   Subsequently, the theory was applied on the Swedish concrete buttress dam Storfinnforsen, which is the largest concrete dam in Sweden. The dam was selected for this study mainly because its shape is archetypical for buttress dams. In addition, a digitalized model of the dam was obtainable from previous research projects.   A numerical analysis with the finite element analysis software ABAQUS was performed in order to evaluate the stability of the dam and to support the analytical analysis. The load capacity of the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> was analytically evaluated with consideration to eventual degradation. Assuming a corrosion rate of 60 μm/year, the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> in Storfinnforsen could after 100 years be trusted with a load capacity of approximately 180 MPa. That load capacity is due to shear failure, which constitutes the most plausible failure mode for <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> in buttress dams. The value 180 MPa is to be seen in contrast to the current limitation of 140 MPa that is defined in RIDAS (2011). The conclusion of this thesis is accordingly, that the maximum allowed load capacity that can be assigned the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> in the stability calculations of concrete dams can be increased from todays 140 MPa. This conclusion is substantiated by the analytical analyses with the numerical calculations as support...|$|R

In this paper, an innovative piezoelectric device named a “smart washer” with the impedance method is proposed {{with the aim of}} developing a real-time device to monitor the pre-stress level of rock bolts. The proposed method was verified through tests on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> specimen. By applying high-frequency sweep excitations (typically > 30 kHz) to the smart washer that was installed on the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> specimen, we observed that the variation in impedance signatures indicated the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress status. With the degradation of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress, the frequency in the dominating peak of the real part of the electrical impedance signature increased. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a normalized root mean square deviation (RMSD) index was developed to evaluate the degradation level of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress. The experimental results demonstrated that the normalized RMSD-based looseness index, which was computed from the impedance value detected by the “smart washer”, increased with loss of the pre-stress of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> Therefore, the proposed method can effectively detect the degradation of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress, as demonstrated by experiments...|$|E
