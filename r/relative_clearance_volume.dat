The objectives of this study were to characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of FP and a pharmacologically active metabolite of CIC (desisobutyryl-ciclesonide [Des-CIC]) using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach, to investigate selected covariate effects on PK and PD parameters of FP and Des-CIC, and to assess the systemic effects of FP and CIC on serum cortisol suppression in patients with persistent asthma. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, 5 -period, crossover, multicenter clinical study. A total of 32 patients were enrolled and given basic asthma medication (salmeterol 50 mu g twice per day [BID] and CIC 160 mu g daily in the evening) through the entire study. During crossover periods, patients were given placebo or CIC 160 mu g BID (ex actuator), CIC 320 mu g BID (ex actuator), FP 220 mu g BID (ex actuator), or FP 440 mu g BID (ex actuator). The FP and Des-CIC PK were described using a 1 -compartment and a 2 -compartment linear model with first-order absorption process. The FP population PK parameter estimates of the first-order rate constant, <b>relative</b> <b>clearance,</b> and <b>volume</b> of distribution were 4. 07 1 /h, 890 L/h, and 9800 L, respectively.

Although rolling piston compressor {{is a kind of}} compact structure compressor, the existence of the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is inevitable in a compressor, the more the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> the lower the volumetric efficiency of compressor. The overflow is a method to improve the volumetric efficiency of a compressor which had been discussed in wankel compressor, in the overflowing process the clearance space with high pressure is connected directly with the space with lower pressure, mostly that is in the moment, one of the chambers in the {{rotary compressor}} {{is at the end of}} the exhaust process, and another chamber is at the sucking stage or the initial compression process. The gas pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is visibly higher than that in the compression chamber.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oesophageal {{clearance}} of {{acid reflux}} {{consists of an}} initial <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> followed by neutralisation of the acidified mucosa by swallowed saliva (chemical clearance). Ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM), a frequent finding in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), has been claimed to underlie prolonged acid clearance by affecting oesophageal emptying and saliva transport. Intraluminal impedance allows non-radiological monitoring of movement of oesophageal liquids. AIMS: To evaluate the relevance of IOM during oesophageal <b>volume</b> and chemical <b>clearance</b> using combined pH impedance measurements. SUBJECTS: Impedance was validated with fluoroscopy to study <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> in three healthy subjects. Acid clearance tests were performed in 10 healthy subjects in the upright and supine positions, before and after oesophageal peristaltic disruption with sildenafil 50 mg. METHODS: After instillation of an acid bolus, simultaneous manometry, pH, and impedance were used to study oesophageal motility, chemical <b>clearance,</b> and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance,</b> respectively. RESULTS: Impedance allowed assessment of <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> accurately, showing a strong correlation with fluoroscopy (r(2) = 0. 89). Sildenafil provoked a graded impairment in oesophageal motility in healthy subjects without affecting saliva secretion. In the upright position, <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> was slightly prolonged only with severe IOM (> 80 % abnormal peristaltic sequences). In the supine position, severe IOM significantly prolonged chemical and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance.</b> Moderate IOM (30 - 80 % abnormal peristalsis) had no effect. With normal peristalsis and moderate IOM, clearance times were similar in the upright and supine positions. Severe IOM however had {{a greater impact on}} clearance in the supine than in the upright position. CONCLUSION: Ineffective oesophageal motility has little effect on oesophageal clearance during upright acid reflux. With supine reflux, only severe IOM is associated with prolonged oesophageal clearance. status: publishe...|$|R

Its genetic polymorphism significantly influences the efficacy and safety of some drugs, which might cause adverse effects and therapeutic failure. Methods and results: The aim of this research was mainly to explore the catalytic activities of 22 newly reported CYP 2 D 6 isoforms (2 D 6 * 87, * 88, * 89, * 90, * 91, * 92, * 93, * 94, * 95, * 96,* 97, * 98, *R 25 Q, F 164 L, E 215 K, F 219 S, V 327 M, D 336 N, V 342 M, R 344 Q, R 440 C, R 497 C) on dapoxetine in vitro. The research was designed with an appropriate incubation system in test tubes and carried out in the constant temperature water. Through detecting its two metabolites desmethyldapoxetine and dapoxetine-N-oxide, the available data were obtained to explain the influence of CYP 2 D 6 polymorphism on the substrate drug dapoxetine. As a result, the intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) values of most variants were significantly altered when compared with the counterpart of CYP 2 D 6 * 1, with most of these variants exhibiting either reduced Vmax and/or increased Km values. For dapoxetine demethylation pathway (which produces desmethyldapoxetine), 2 D 6 * 89 and E 215 K exhibited no markedly decreased <b>relative</b> <b>clearance</b> of 92. 81 % and 97. 70 %, respectively. The <b>relative</b> <b>clearance</b> of rest 20 variants exhibited decrease in different levels, ranging from 20. 44 % to 90. 90 %. For the dapoxetine oxidation pathway (which produces dapoxetine-N-oxide), the <b>relative</b> <b>clearance</b> values of three variants, 2 D 6 * 90, * 94, and V 342 M, exhibited no markedly increased <b>relative</b> <b>clearance</b> of 106. 17 %, 107. 78 %, and 109. 98 %, respectively; the rest 19 variants exhibited significantly decreased levels ranging from 27. 56 % to 84. 64 %. In addition, the kinetic parameters of two CYP 2 D 6 variants (2 D 6 * 92 and 2 D 6 * 96) could not be detected, due to the defect of the CYP 2 D 6 gene. Conclusion: As the first report of all aforementioned alleles for dapoxetine metabolism, these data may help in the clinical assessment of the metabolic elimination of dapoxetine and may provide fundamental information for further clinical studies.
