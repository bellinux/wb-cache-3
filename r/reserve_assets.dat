50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> {{in the balance}} of payments and are located in the capital account.

In terms of financial assets classifications, the <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> can be classified as Gold bullion, Unallocated gold accounts, Special drawing rights, currency, Reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other transferable deposits, other deposits, debt securities, loans, equity (listed and unlisted), investment fund shares and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments. In the Central Bank’s Balance Sheet, foreign exchange reserves are assets, along with domestic credit.|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} reserve regime based {{mainly on}} the US dollar has served the world well for decades, but it faces an uncertain future as the economic hegemony of the United States is increasingly challenged {{by the emergence of}} new economic powers. The regime is flawed fundamentally, moreover, because additions to the supply of the main <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> require the United States to run balance-of-payments deficits, which tend to undermine confidence in the dollar. This paper proposes a transformation of the reserve regime that would cause Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the International Monetary Fund to become the main <b>reserve</b> <b>asset.</b> An orderly transition would be achieved by creating a Substitution Account into which official holders of dollars could deposit them in exchange for SDRs.

40|$|This paper explores some {{implications}} {{of the use of}} national currencies as international reserves. First, a closed economy overlapping-generations model is developed to derive time-consistent tax and inflation policies for a government that is financing a given stream of expenditures. Second, the effects of allowing a government to hold a foreign currency as a <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> and to have its currency held as a <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> abroad are considered. The use of national currencies as currencies of denomination for international lending creates an incentive for the governments whose currencies are used to alter their inflation rates to extract resources {{from the rest of the}} world. When reserves are constrained to be nonnegative the use of national currencies as international reserves raises the inflation rate in reserve issuing countries but does not effect theiInflation rate in reserve holders. The opposite result arises when loans are denominated in the borrowers' currencies. ...|$|R
