25|$|On {{the eve of}} the Revolution, 95 {{percent of}} the American {{population}} lived outside the cities—much to the frustration of the British, who were able to capture the cities with their Royal Navy, but lacked the manpower to occupy and subdue the countryside. In explaining the importance of the cities in shaping the American Revolution, Benjamin Carp compares the important role of waterfront workers, taverns, churches, kinship networks, and local politics. Historian Gary B. Nash emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Butler {{was elected}} to Congress as a Republican, and soon came to {{identify}} with that party's more <b>radical</b> <b>element.</b> In 1868, {{he was among the}} leaders in President Andrew Johnson's impeachment. Butler's wartime exploits earned him support among blacks and abolitionists, which, combined with his existing base among laborers, ensured his reelection for several terms. His radicalism made him enemies among conservative Republicans, however, and when he lost his seat in the Democratic wave of 1874, he began to shift his allegiance to the nascent Greenback Party. In 1876, he returned to the House as a Republican, but in 1878 he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts as an independent Greenbacker with Democratic support. Butler had supporters across the political spectrum—he was often said to be [...] "a member of all parties and false to each"—and was considered a presidential possibility when the Greenbackers convened in Chicago in 1880.|$|E

He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until [...] the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution. [...] Philadelphia suffered serious inflation, causing problems especially for the poor, who were unable to buy needed goods. This led to unrest in 1779, with people blaming the upper class and Loyalists. A riot in January by sailors striking for higher wages ended up with their attacking and dismantling ships. In the Fort Wilson Riot of October 4, men attacked James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was accused of being a Loyalist sympathizer. Soldiers broke up the riot, but five people died and 17 were injured.|$|E

2500|$|The Ultra-Tories {{were the}} leaders of {{reaction}} and seemed to dominate the Tory Party, which controlled the government. [...] Every untoward event seemed to point to a conspiracy on the left which necesstated more repression to head off another terror such as happened in the [...] French Revolution in 1793. [...] Historians find that the violent <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> was small and weak; there were a handful of small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed. [...] Nevertheless techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to arrest and hold suspects without cause or trial). [...] Sidmouth's Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "outside of the box" [...] {{thinking}} {{incorporated by}} AMC in the Pacer {{as the first}} [...] "wide, small car" [...] attempted to capture a revolutionary change in marketplace, but {{a radical departure from}} what was accepted by consumers as [...] "good styling" [...] was a risky strategy. Only the largest firms can stick with a <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> until it [...] "grows," [...] and the automaker’s dominance in the marketplace may eventually establish it as a standard feature. However, by the late 1970s the styling research axiom no longer applied that if a car with some controversial styling was liked by {{at least half of the}} potential market segment; then chances were good that this feature was a differential advantage for the manufacturer. The AMC Pacer incorporated many controversial styling and design innovations that led to its market failure after five model years.|$|E

2500|$|A new, {{unexpected}} {{political discourse}} {{emerged in the}} 1970s centered on the environment. The debates did not fall neatly into a left-right dimension, for everyone proclaimed {{their support for the}} environment. Environmentalism appealed to the well-educated middle class, but aroused fears among lumbermen, farmers, ranchers, blue collar workers, automobile companies and oil companies whose economic interests were threatened by new regulations. Conservatives therefore tended to oppose environmentalism while liberals endorsed new measures to protect the environment. Liberals supported the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club, and were sometimes successful in blocking efforts by lumber companies and oil drillers to expand operations. Environmental legislation limited the use of DDT, reduced acid rain, and protected numerous animal and plant species. Within the environmental movement, there was a small <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> that favored direct action rather than legislation. [...] By the 21st century debates over taking major action to reverse global warming by and dealing with carbon emissions were high on the agenda. The environmental movement in the United States has given little support to third parties, unlike Europe, where Green parties play a growing role in politics.|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly a deep split {{opened up}} in the republican ranks. The {{moderate}} element had national support and called itself [...] "True Republicans." [...] The more <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> set out to disfranchise whites—such as not allowing a man to hold office {{if he was a}} private in the Confederate army, or had sold food to the Confederate government, plus land reform. [...] About 20,000 former Confederates were denied the right to vote in the 1867 election. [...] In 1867 radical [...] (1814–1880), a white preacher, editor and Scalawag (white Southerners supporting Reconstruction) mobilized the black Republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to Freedmen and poor whites. The [...] "True Republicans" [...] (the moderates), led by former Whigs, businessmen and planters, while supportive of black suffrage, drew the line at property confiscation. A compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters. Hunnicutt's coalition took control of the Republican Party, and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the Confederacy. The Virginia Republican party became permanently split, and many moderate Republicans switched to the opposition [...] "Conservatives". The Radicals won the 1867 election for delegates to a constitutional convention.|$|E
60|$|Walter Scott says, {{there is}} in the castle a secret chamber; the {{entrance}} to which, by the law of the family, can be known only to three persons at once--the lord of the castle, his heir apparent, and any third person whom they might choose to take into their confidence. See, now, the materials which the past gives to the novelist or poet in these old countries. These ancient castles are standing romances, made to the author's hands. The castle started a talk upon Shakspeare, and how much of the tragedy he made up, and how much he found ready to his hand in tradition and history. It seems the story is all told in Holingshed's Chronicles; but his fertile mind has added some of the most thrilling touches, such as the sleep walking of Lady Macbeth. It always seemed to me that this tragedy had more of the melancholy majesty and power of the Greek than any thing modern. The striking difference is, that while fate was the <b>radical</b> <b>element</b> of those, free will is not less distinctly the basis of this. Strangely enough, while it commences with a supernatural oracle, there is not a trace of fatalism in it; but through all, a clear, distinct recognition of moral responsibility, of the power to resist evil, and the guilt of yielding to it. The theology of Shakspeare is as remarkable as his poetry. A strong and clear sense of man's moral responsibility and free agency, and of certain future retribution, runs through all his plays.|$|E
