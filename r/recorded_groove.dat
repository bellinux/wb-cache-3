2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove.</b> The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|E
50|$|A smooth-tipped stylus (in popular usage {{often called}} a needle {{due to the}} former use of steel needles for the purpose) is used to play the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove.</b> A special chisel-like stylus is used to engrave the groove into the master record.|$|E
50|$|In a {{phonograph}} reproducer, {{the diaphragm}} is a flat disk of typically mica isinglass that converts the mechanical vibration imparted on the buttress from the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> into sound. In {{the case of}} acoustic recording the reproducer converts the sound into {{the motion of the}} needle that scribes the groove on the recording media.|$|E

5000|$|Welsh band Super Furry Animals {{released}} the album Rings Around The World as a 3-record set on Epic Records. Sides 1, 2 and 4 played normally. Side 3 played {{from the inside}} out and side 5 was on a 7-inch single. The side consisted of one <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> {{in the center of the}} record and was a perfectly timed loop of the music for a non-album song called, [...] "All the Shit U Do." ...|$|E
50|$|The stylus {{is subject}} to hard wear {{as it is the}} only small part that comes into direct contact with the {{spinning}} record. In terms of the pressure imposed on its minute areas of actual contact, the forces it must bear are enormous. There are three desired qualities in a stylus: first, that it faithfully follows the contours of the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> and transmits its vibrations to the next part in the chain; second, that it does not damage the recorded disc; and third, that it is resistant to wear. A worn-out, damaged or defective stylus tip will degrade audio quality and injure the groove.|$|E
5000|$|The phonograph, {{invented by}} Thomas Edison in 1877, could both record sound and play it back. The {{earliest}} type of phonograph sold recorded on a thin sheet of tinfoil {{wrapped around a}} grooved metal cylinder. A stylus connected to a sound-vibrated diaphragm indented the foil into the groove as the cylinder rotated. The stylus vibration was at a right angle to the recording surface, so {{the depth of the}} indentation varied with the audio-frequency changes in air pressure that carried the sound. This arrangement is known as vertical or [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] recording. The sound could be played back by tracing the stylus along the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> and acoustically coupling its resulting vibrations to the surrounding air through the diaphragm and a so-called [...] "amplifying" [...] horn.|$|E

5000|$|In 1922, Billing {{patented}} {{a recording}} system intended to produce laterally-cut disc records with {{ten times the}} capacity of existing systems. Billing's [...] "World Record Controller" [...] fitted onto a standard spring-wound gramophone, using a progressive gearing system to initially force the turntable speed down from 78 rpm to 33 rpm and then gradually increase rotational speed of the record as it played, so that the linear speed at which the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> passed the needle remained constant. This allowed over ten minutes playing time per 12-inch side of Billing's special [...] "World" [...] records, but {{the high cost of}} his long-playing discs (10 shillings apiece, or nearly $29 today) and the complexity of the playback attachment prevented popular acceptance. A further musical invention, the [...] "Duophone" [...] unbreakable record, appeared in 1925, but was discontinued in 1930 as its material rapidly wore out needles and most Duophone recordings were made by the obsolete acoustical process.|$|E
50|$|Early {{methods of}} {{recording}} sound included phonograph cylinders (a stylus would draw wax grooves {{on the outside}} of a cylinder), gramophone <b>records</b> (<b>grooves</b> on the flat side of a disk) and magnetic recordings.|$|R
50|$|Holt was {{technically}} correct, as the Dynagroove process used tracing compensation, which pre-distorted the <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> {{to cancel}} out the distortion created by playback with a conical-shaped phonograph stylus, which could not track the <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> accurately in the high frequencies, especially in the inner grooves of an LP. The process worked well with playback via a conical stylus, typical of most phonograph cartridges prior to about 1964. However, if one played a Dynagroove record with an elliptical-shaped stylus, this pre-distortion became audible. As {{the decade of the}} 1960s progressed, high quality playback cartridges increasingly used elliptical styli. This development made tracing compensation obsolete by about 1970, and RCA quietly stopped using the technique.|$|R

50|$|In {{a moving}} magnet cartridge, the stylus {{cantilever}} carries a tiny permanent magnet, which is positioned between {{two sets of}} fixed coils (in a stereophonic cartridge), forming a tiny electromagnetic generator. As the magnet vibrates {{in response to the}} stylus following the <b>record</b> <b>groove,</b> it induces a tiny current in the coils.|$|R
50|$|In his {{analysis}} of voice and speech, he made use of photographic registration and magnification of the surface features of a phonograph <b>record's</b> <b>grooves</b> to visually display the sounds of speech. Through his work, he determined that the passage of air through the mouth cavity, modified for each vowel, strongly affected the harmonics of tones from the larynx.|$|R

50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the pickup {{cartridge}} over the groove, the stylus tracking the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and <b>record</b> <b>groove.</b> At its simplest, a tone arm is a pivoted lever, free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} hit single {{to have a}} <b>recorded</b> locked <b>groove</b> is [...] "Muskrat Love" [...] by Captain & Tennille. A few years later, in December 1975, a British artist known as Chris Hill did a {{break-in}} record (see Dickie Goodman or Bill Buchanan) called, [...] "Renta Santa" [...] on Philips 6006-491 that included a <b>recorded</b> locked <b>groove</b> {{at the end of}} the side.|$|R

50|$|A new stylus {{invented by}} Keller made {{possible}} the first high-fidelity musical recordings after he worked with sound engineer, Irad S. Rafuse. Their ideas led the way for single-groove stereo records when they proposed recording two sound channels on a master disk. On April 19, 1938, Keller was issued US patent number 2,114,471 for his idea of recording the two channels of a stereo recording in one <b>record</b> <b>groove,</b> each at 45 degrees from vertical.|$|R
50|$|Phono cartridges, {{also known}} as pickups, are {{electromechanical}} devices which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip of which makes physical contact with the <b>record's</b> <b>groove.</b> In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.|$|R

5000|$|The design {{attacked}} the [...] "high-ground" [...] by eschewing the spring isolation, {{which was then}} regarded as a major strength. Instead, it addressed the issues of Groove drag and lateral rigidity, the ultimate objective of which was to stabilise the relationship between cartridge stylus and the spinning <b>record</b> <b>groove.</b> Springs were not considered sufficiently rigid in the lateral plane, and permitted too much rotation of the suspended parts relative to the motor.|$|R
