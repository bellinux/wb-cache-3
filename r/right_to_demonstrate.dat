The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of PDPA Politburo members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take [...] "families, both parents and children, under its supervision."

40|$|This article {{explores the}} role of {{environmental}} justice as a transformative tool in litigation <b>to</b> enforce socio-economic <b>rights</b> in South Africa. Because environmental justice recognises the intrinsic links between the distribution of basic resources, and the environments in which poor people continue to find themselves in post- 1994 South Africa, it {{has the ability to}} enhance and strengthen the enforcement of socio-economic <b>rights.</b> <b>To</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the transformative potential of environmental justice, I discuss its origins and its incorporation into South African law. I then demonstrate that, despite having been incorporated into our law, environmental justice has failed to capture the imagination of lawyers engaged in socio-economic rights litigation. Sustainable development and human rights discourses have been the dominant voices, at the expense of environmental justice, and its transformative potential. Through an analysis of Mazibuko v City of Johannesburg I point to how linking environmental justice <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> access to basic water could have encouraged the court to adopt a more redistributive and transformative approach. To conclude, I consider the potential of environmental justice in socio-economic <b>rights</b> litigation <b>to</b> challenge poverty and effect transformation in the lives of poor people in South Africa.

40|$|The aim of {{this case}} study is to examine {{differences}} in the political framing of immigration questions by the Danish People’s Party and the Sweden Democrats in relation to religious sentiments. The material analysed consists of speeches in records from Danish and Swedish parliamentary debates, and through textual analysis {{it is found that}} variations exists regarding how religion is used to highlight homogeneity and heterogeneity. The Danish People’s Party and the Sweden Democrats both use religion to assemble heterogeneity, and emphasise human <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> how Islam fundamentally opposes a modern Western worldview. However, the Danish People’s Party makes more extensive use of religion to emphasise homogeneity than the Sweden Democrats do, and this framing strategy seems to have superimposed a sense of religious conflict on the debate in Denmark. A perceived dispute between Islam and Christianity has made the Danish People’s Party set forth proposals aimed to strengthen religious homogeneity, protect Christian dominance, and restrict the influence of Islam in the social sphere. The empirical findings are discussed in relation to different secular paths in Denmark and Sweden, and to theories that take into account the constitutive elements of a Scandinavian religious identity, and the circumstances under which religious identity may attain renewed significance. ...|$|R
