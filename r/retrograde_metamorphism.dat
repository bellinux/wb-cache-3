40|$|Rocks {{associated}} with an orogenic gold system in the Paleoproterozoic Granites/Tanami Inlier of northern Australia exhibit strong natural remanent magnetism, identifiable in regional aeromagnetic data. Petrographical analysis indicates the two dominant magnetic minerals in the rocks of this region are multidomain magnetite and monoclinic pyrrhotite. Chemical analysis using an electron microprobe has determined that the magnetite and pyrrhotite are stoichiometrically pure, without significant elemental substitution. Alternating field demagnetization, Curie Temperature, and hysteresis analysis indicates that the remanently magnetized phase is monoclinic pyrrhotite with low magnetic susceptibility. In contrast, multidomain magnetites lack remanence and have high magnetic susceptibilities. Pyrrhotite is preserved in the rock mass along with other sulfide minerals as millimeter-scale veins parallel to regionally developed, penetrative mylonitic shear bands (c-planes) formed during sulfide remobilization in the waning, cooling stages of hydrothermal Au deposition. In contrast, magnetite grains exhibit porphyroblastic textures, consistent with formation during prograde to peak metamorphism, indicating formation prior to pyrrhotite, earlier in the orogenic cycle. Because of the low Curie Temperature (ca. 325 °C) of pyrrhotite, it is therefore likely that remanent magnetization effects observed in aeromagnetic images of the Tanami Inlier, are {{associated with}} structures intimately related to the late stages of Au mineralization during <b>retrograde</b> greenschist <b>metamorphism</b> after the peak thermal point of the orogenic cycle.

The limitations of the forward models are due to some important differences between the conditions and behavior of prograde dehydration and retrograde rehydration reactions, even though rehydration is simply a reverse dehydration reaction. Rehydration reactions commonly proceed heterogeneously in a non-equilibrium state (e.g., Brodie and Rutter 1985; Plunder et al. 2012), whereas dehydration reactions occur under relatively homogeneous conditions in a perfect equilibrium state. As described in detail in the next section, rehydration reactions are generally fluid-induced and occur via replacement of relict minerals by equilibrated minerals (e.g., Andersen et al. 1991; Imon et al. 2002; Ota et al. 2004; Okamoto and Toriumi 2005; Putnis 2009; Putnis and Austrheim 2010; Centrella et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} crystal-plasticity on the U-Th-Pb system in zircon is studied by {{quantitative}} microstructural and microchemical {{analysis of a}} large zircon grain collected from pyroxenite of the Lewisian Complex, Scotland. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping reveals a c. 18 ° variation in crystallographic orientation that comprises both a gradual change in orientation {{and a series of}} discrete low-angle (< 4 °) boundaries. These microstructural data are consistent with crystal-plastic deformation of zircon associated with the formation and migration of dislocations. A heterogeneous pattern of dark cathodoluminescence, with the darkest domains coinciding with low-angle boundaries, mimics the deformation microstructure identified by EBSD. Geochemical data collected using the Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) shows a positive correlation between concentrations of the elements U, Th and Pb (ranging from 20 – 60 ppm, 30 – 110 ppm, and 14 – 36 ppm, respectively) and Th/U ratio (1. 13 – 1. 8) with the deformation microstructure. The highest measured concentrations and Th/U coincide with low-angle boundaries. This enrichment is interpreted to reflect enhanced bulk diffusion of U and Th due to the formation and migration of high-diffusivity dislocations. 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages for individual analyses show no significant variation across the grain, and define a concordant, combined mean age of 2451 ± 14 Ma.

40|$|The Amdo terrane holds {{one of the}} {{important}} keys to understand the tectonic evolution of Central Tibet. Here we report the results from a combined study of Cathodoluminescence imaging, LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating, and trace element analysis of zircons from high-pressure (HP) mafic granulites from the Amdo terrane. Zircons from the mafic granulite are rounded or anhedral and show sector or planar domains with low Th/U ratios, low REE contents, and flat HREE patterns, and can be divided into two types. The first type of zircons shows negative Eu anomalies, indicating that they coexisted with garnet and symplectitic plagioclase during the <b>retrograde</b> stage of <b>metamorphism,</b> whereas the second type possesses positive Eu anomalies, implying that they formed during the peak-metamorphic stage of the HP granulite. U-Pb data yielded a weighted mean ²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U age of 190. 7 ± 3. 0 Ma (MSWD= 2. 8, n= 8) for zircons with positive Eu anomalies, interpreted as the time of the peak metamorphism, and a mean age of 181. 4 ± 1. 8 Ma (MSWD= 2. 2, n= 16) for zircons with negative Eu anomalies corresponding to the amphibolite-facies retrogression. Combining with previous data, we suggest that the Amdo terrane became a microcontinent in the Tethys Ocean during the Permian-Triassic rifting between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes, and then the Amdo terrane subducted to about 50 -km-depth beneath the Qiangtang terrane experiencing HP granulite-facies metamorphism in the Early Jurassic at 190 Ma. The region was then uplifted to the mid-crustal levels (~ 20 km) with an exhumation rate of ca. 3 mm/year.

Results {{are consistent with the}} following complex polyphase tectono-metamorphicevolution. The kyanite/sillimanite bearing garnet biotite gneisses contain monazite ages of 938 ± 23 Ma and zirconSHRIMP ages of 945 ± 7 Ma, referring to a Neoproterozoic metamorphism, i. e. similar to the age of the Jinning orogeny in the Yangtze block of southern China. This correlation suggests that the paragneiss has affinities with the Yangtze block (South China block). The Neoproterozoic monazites were found inside coarse grained porphyroblastic garnets containing amphibolite facies mineral inclusion assemblages. The kyanite/sillimanite-bearing garnet biotite gneisses also contain early Paleozoic monazite ages of 422 – 425 Ma and 455 – 460 Ma, detected in amphibolite facies mineral assemblages associated with matrix minerals. Using phase equilibrium- and geothermobarometric calculations, PT conditions of 560 – 610 °C/ 5. 8 – 7. 0 kbar and 610 – 675 °C/ 4. 6 – 6. 5 kbar were calculated respectively for both amphibolite facies assemblages. The early Paleozoic ages of 422 – 425 Ma and 455 – 460 Ma were detected in 8 monazite grains from the investigated paragneiss samples. Based on the Y and Eu contents variation of the early Paleozoic monazite domains (measured by EMP), the 422 – 425 Ma monazite ages are interpreted to have formed during an amphibolite facies tectono-metamorphic overprint that post-dates (U) HP metamorphism and can thus be related to exhumation of previously deeply subducted rocks. Alternatively, the 455 – 460 Ma monazite ages are interpreted to represent the age of the prograde subduction zone metamorphism. We conclude therefore that the mineral assemblage of the kyanite/sillimanite-bearing garnet–biotite gneiss (and associated retro-eclogite) was formed during an early Paleozoic subduction/collision event, which involved late Proterozoic (938 – 945 Ma) crystalline basement inliers of minimal mid amphibolite facies grade.

40|$|Abstract The Palaeoproterozoic Johan Petersen Intrusive Centre (JPIC) {{formed as}} a {{continental}} arc at the North Atlantic Craton margin during {{the formation of the}} ca. 1. 9 Ga Nagssugtoqidian Orogen (NO) in SE Greenland. Magmatic Ni-Cu deposits in the coeval Trans-Hudson and Svecofennian Orogens (THO and SFO) make the NO the primary target for Ni-Cu deposits in Greenland. Using mapping, petrography, geochemistry, and multiple sulphur isotope geochemistry, this thesis deals with the formation of the JPIC and related mineralisation, and compares it with previously discovered Ni-Cu mineralisation in the NO and Trans-Hudson and Svecofennian Orogens. The JPIC formed from an early series of dioritic to granitic magmas intruding into paragneiss under granulite facies conditions. A mafic series of gabbroic rocks intruded into both the paragneiss and the earlier felsic series rocks. Late mafic-ultramafic sheets and magmatic breccias intruded predominantly into the mafic series rocks. Two episodes of intrusion by mafic-ultramafic stringers happened when the felsic and mafic series rocks were semi-solid. Late granite likely formed from back-veining of residual melts. Uplift during orogenesis caused <b>retrograde</b> amphibolite facies <b>metamorphism,</b> and late hydrothermal alteration of both intrusive rocks and their mineralisation took place under temperature conditions corresponding to amphibolite- to mid greenschist facies. The mineralised rocks in the JPIC occur as contact mineralisation between the intrusive rocks and the adjacent paragneiss, as mineralisation in the stringers mingling with the mafic series rocks, and as accumulated sulphide liquids in the later sheets and breccias. In the contact style mineralisation, sulphides are disseminated, network-like or semi- massive and show S isotopic compositions indicating a Palaeoproterozoic sedimentary sulphur source. Ni and Cu contents in the sulphide phase are low. Sulphides in the mineralised stringers and mafic-ultramafic sheets and breccias are disseminated to network-like, and have mantle-like isotopic compositions of sulphur. The ultramafic sheets and breccias have higher Ni-Cu contents and tenors and currently form the primary targets. The JPIC mineralisation is similar to that in the Kotalahti-Vammala belt of the SFO, and although sub-economic at the moment, possible existence of deeper-seated sulphides would give the area an upside potential for more discoveries...|$|R

The locality has been extensively investigated for the presence of porphiritic copper mineralization in the Bučim block (mine is placed about 5 km toward the south). Eclogite has been reported {{for the first time in}} the block by Denkovski & al. (1983, 1984). Later on the occurrence was investigated in more details by several authors (Mirčovski, 1991; Mirčovski 1989; Mirčovski 1990 / 91; Mirčovski & al., 1997; Korikovsky & al., 1997). Occurrence of eclogite-amphibolite within the Bučim block is structurally placed between Vardar zone and Serbo-Macedonian masiff. It is about 20 km long and about 8 to 12 km wide. There are different oppinions that Bučim block is a part of Vardar zone as well that it is a part of Serbo-Macedonian masiff. In the sorroundings of investigated rocks there are mixed Precambrian, Paleozioc and Tertiary rocks. Precambrian rocks are represented by various types of gneisses, eclogite amphibolite and various amphibolites. Paleozoic rocks are represented by diabase (SE of Koševo) which cuts amphibole-biotite gneiss. Tertiary rocks are represented by trahite and trachyteryolite dykes cutting muscovite-biotite gneiss. Eclogite-amphibolite is named in accordance to proposed nomenclature for this type of rocks (Carswell, 1990). It is possible to distinguish prograde and <b>retrograde</b> phase of <b>metamorphism</b> in the rocks. Peak of prograde metamorphism is estimated to be at 650 º C and 12 to 12. 5 Kbar. Retrograde phase begun with slight increase of temperature to about 700 º C and significant decreasing the pressure to about 4 to 4. 5 Kbar (Mirčovski 1990 / 91;). Eclogite-amphibolite is medium grained, dark green rock built of omphacite, diopside, garnet, two generations of amphibole (tschermakite-pargasite-hastingsite), two generations of plagioclase feldspars (prograde, 12 to 27 mol% An; retrograde, 46 to 73 mol% An), zoisite, quartz, rutile and titanite (there is sometimes corrona of titanite around rutile). It is possible to conclude that metamorfic peak of prograde phase determined on the basis of Sm/Nd method was T= 260 ą 49 Ma (with starting &# 949;Nd=- 0. 3) achieved during Upper Permian and it could be interpret as the latest phase of Hercynian orogenesis...|$|R

It is composed of accreted arc- and oceanic-derived metaigneous rocks, serpentinized peridotites and minor metasediments forming a structural pile. Combined detailed mapping, structural and metamorphic analysis, and geochronology show that the deformation {{can be divided into}} five main events (D 1 -D 5). An early subduction-related D 1 deformation and M 1 metamorphism produced greenschist (mafic rocks of the Gaspar Hernández peridotite-tectonite), blueschist and eclogite (metamafic blocks in the Jagua Clara mélange), high-P epidote-amphibolite and eclogite (Cuaba unit), and lower blueschist and greenschist-facies conditions (Morrito unit). This was followed by M 2 decompression and cooling in the blueschist, greenschist and low-P amphibolite-facies conditions. The shape of the retrograde P-T path, the age of the exhumation-related D 2 structures, and the tectonic significance of D 2 deformation are different in each structural unit. Published U-Pb and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau ages and T-t/P-t estimations reveal diachronic Turonian-Coniacian to Maastrichtian <b>retrograde</b> M 2 <b>metamorphism</b> in the different structural units of the complex, during a consistent D 2 top-to-the-NE/ENE tectonic transport. Regionally, a similar top-to-the-ENE tectonic transport also took place in the metasedimentary nappes of the Samaná complex during the Eocene to earliest Miocene. This kinematic compatibility indicates a general northeastward progradation of deformation in the northern Caribbean convergent margin, as the successive tectonic incorporation of arc, oceanic and continental-derived terrains to the developing Caribbean subduction-accretionary complex took place. D 3 -D 5 deformations are discontinuous and much less penetrative, recording the evolution from ductile to brittle conditions of deformation in the complex. The D 3 event substantially modified the nappe-stack and produced open folds with amplitudes up to kilometer-scale. The Late Paleocene-Eocene D 4 structures are ductile to ductile-brittle thrusts and inverse shear bands. D 5 is a Tertiary, entirely brittle deformation that had considerable influence in the geometry of the whole complex. From the Miocene to the Present, it has been cut and laterally displaced by a D 5 sinistral strike-slip fault system associated with the Septentrional fault zone. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural geometries and style of deformation closely resemble those of the turtleback structures in central Death Valley, as opposed to the core complexes in southeastern California and southern Arizona. Displacement along a stacked system of detachment faults was accomplished by brittle deformation and placed unmetamorphosed late-Miocene to Pleistocene marine and non-marine sedimentary rocks on upper amphibolite facies metamorphic tectonites. The metamorphic rocks have been pervasively intruded by igneous rocks of various ages, ranging in composition from tonalites to monzogranites. Mid-miocene (?) hydrothermal <b>metamorphism</b> <b>retrograded</b> the core rocks to greenschist facies, and clasts of these rocks are found in a syntectonic sedimentary breccia indicating that hydrothermal fluids preceded and facilitated faulting. Foliation within metamorphic rocks has been transposed and refolded into a WNW to NW trending antiform. A parallel trending antiform is defined by the dips on the uppermost detachment fault. Penetrative high-angle conjugate normal faults and fractures that are oriented perpendicular to the antiform have pervasively brecciated the rocks within the core. The maximum strain direction, as determined from the orientation of the high-angle faults beneath the upper detachment, is east-west. This is consistent with kinematic indicators that give a WNW sense of movement on the detachment faults. Orientation of the high-angle normal faults above the upper detachment indicates a more NW - directed maximum strain. The structurally lowest detachment zone exposed represents a mid-crustal shear zone upon which mid- and upper-crustal rocks were tilted and cataclastically deformed in response to the opening to the proto-Gulf. Syndepositional marine sediments were deposited directly on the uplifted shear zone. Continued extension along detachment faults tectonically thinned and removed the late-Miocene to Pliocene marine deposits and locally placed Pleistocene redbeds directly against the metamorphic basement. Subsequent high-angle normal faults that cut the detachments are considered to sole into a presently active mid crustal shear zone. Extension associated with the development of Sierra El Mayor core complex is consistent with Mid-Miocene to present Pacific-North America plate motions...|$|R
40|$|The Río San Juan {{metamorphic}} complex exposes {{a segment}} of a high-pressure subduction-accretionary complex built during convergence between the Caribbean island arc and the North America continental margin. It is composed of accreted arc- and oceanic-derived metaigneous rocks, serpentinized peridotites and minor metasediments forming a structural pile. Combined structural geology, microtextural relations, multi-equilibrium calculations and thermodynamical modelling, together with published isotopic ages, allow reconstructing the metamorphic P-T-t paths of each nappe/unit and their links to the structural evolution. In all units of the complex, three major stages (M 1 to M 3) in the tectonothermal evolution have been distinguished. The M 1 stage corresponds to the prograde evolution towards the pressure-peak of metamorphism under blueschist or eclogitic-facies conditions. The M 2 stage {{is related to the}} main retrogressive event and is characterized by the S 2 -L 2 fabric development in all lithologies and at all scales. The M 3 stage represents continuous exhumation from ductile to ductile-brittle deformation regimes. However, the shape of the retrograde P-T path, the age of the exhumation-related D 2 structures and the tectonic significance of D 2 deformation are different in each structural unit. In the upper structural levels of the Jagua Clara serpentinitic-matrix mélange, the counter-clockwise P-T path of the eclogite blocks is typical of rocks exhumed {{in the early stages of}} intra-oceanic subduction zones. The clockwise P-T path obtained for the lower Cuaba unit is characterized by a strong isothermal decompression from the garnet-epidote amphibolite and eclogite-facies pressure-peak. This P-T evolution can be explained by rapid exhumation caused by extensional tectonics, in relation to a major modification of convergence conditions across the subduction zone. The P-T path also explains local syn-M 2 partial melting processes, because it crosses the wet solidus for IAT mafic compositions. The P-T path obtained for the high-P Guineal Schists, with exhumation trajectory following the burial trajectory, can be related to exhumation during active subduction. This exhumation was most likely driven by a combination of underthrusting of tectonic units and erosion processes. Available geochronological data and T-t/P-t estimates reveal a Late Campanian to Maastrichtian <b>retrograde</b> M 2 <b>metamorphism</b> in the lower structural units of the complex during a consistent D 2 top-to-the-NE/ENE tectonic transport. A similar tectonic transport has also been recognized in the metasedimentary nappes of the Samaná complex during Eocene to earliest Miocene. These relations indicate a northeastward progradation of deformation during the successive tectonic incorporation of arc, oceanic and continental-derived terrains to the developing Caribbean subduction-accretionary complex.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a new model}} for the structural and metamorphic evolution of the Eastern Elba Nappe Stack (EENS), in the innermost Northern Apennines, Central Italy, based on detailed field mapping and macro and microstructural analysis by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy-dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and the calculation of phase equilibria. The complex tectonic evolution of the orogenic wedge can be conceptualized by a sequence of distinct deformation episodes, referred to sequentially as D 1 through D 6. Although each event is distinct from the others, the dynamic nature of wedges is such that different episodes might be transiently active coevally at different structural levels of the wedge, even mutually overprinting as deeper portions of the system are progressively exhumed toward the surface and shallower domains. This results in complex geometric and overprinting relationships, which can {{make it difficult to}} read and unravel the details of these structural evolutions. D 1 represents an initial phase of underplating in the Eocene Oligocene. It led to a thick accretionary wedge and the development of only recently documented HP-LT blueschist facies metamorphism, scantily preserved on Elba Island. This initial phase was followed by prolonged exhumation during the Late Oligocene Early Miocene during D 2. For the first time, the prolific west-vergent D 2 structures of the EENS are documented and incorporated into a model, explaining the exhumation of the HP-LT assemblage through westward extension as part of a channel flow process during <b>retrograde</b> greenschist facies <b>metamorphism.</b> 	Exhumation was followed by a renewed phase of compression, D 3, from the Early to Middle Miocene, during which eastward out-of-sequence thrusts and pervasive east-vergent isoclinal folding deformed the EENS. The east-vergent folds have been documented at all sizes, ranging from the micro- to kilometric scale, including the previously undescribed Acquadolce Antiform, a kilometric-scale fold in the southern portion of the Acquadolce Unit. 	Gravitational instability led to eastward extension in the Middle Miocene during D 4. After which, a final compressional D 5 stage, characterized by compression lasting from the Late Miocene to the Pliocene occured. The Monte Capanne (8 Ma) and Porto Azzurro (5. 9 - 6. 2 Ma) plutons were emplaced during this phase, and syn-contact metamorphic structures developed. Major D 5 structures include a HT-LP mylonitic belt with east-vergent thrust kinematics causing the juxtaposition of low-grade or non-metamorphic rocks onto the higher-grade Acquadolce Unit along the Capo Norsi Thrust. This was followed during D 5 b by the formation of the world-famous top-to-the-east, low-angle Zuccale Fault (ZF), which until recently has been interpreted as a normal fault. Recent publications and this study indicate that the ZF is actually a thrust, formed during the final phase of compression. 	Finally, during a D 6 phase of Late Pliocene Pleistocene age, uplift and brittle normal faulting affected the EENS, through the formation of new faults and the reactivation of earlier thrust structures. 	The structural and metamorphic evolution of the EENS and innermost Northern Apennines, though complex, reflects the relatively simple processes controlling dynamic and cyclic wedge growth...|$|R
