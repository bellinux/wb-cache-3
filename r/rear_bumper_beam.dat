40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{the fuel}} {{economy has been}} an {{inevitable}} issue {{for the development of}} new cars, and one of the important measures to improve the fuel economy is to decrease the vehicle weight. In order to obtain this goal, the researches about lighter, stronger and the well impact absorbing <b>bumper</b> impact <b>beam</b> have been studied without sacrificing bumper safety. In this study, the overall weight reduction possibility of <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> impact <b>beam</b> could be examined based on the variation of frontal, offset and corner impact crash capability by substituting a ultra high strength steel material (boron steel) having tensile strength of 1. 5 GPa grade instead of conventional steels. In addition, the section variations (open section, closed section, open section with 5 stays) of the <b>bumper</b> impact <b>beam</b> structure were examined carefully. It could be reached that this analysis could be well established and be contributed for design guid...|$|R
40|$|Bumper {{is divided}} in two types, they are front <b>bumper</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>bumper.</b> Main {{function}} {{both of them}} are for absorbing impact by reducing damage and to the potential for bodily injury during an accident. <b>Rear</b> car <b>bumper</b> system has three main components. They are the fascia, energy absorber and <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> The fascia is the outer cover in this system. It is attaches to the quarter panels and rear end panel of the system. The energy absorber attaches to the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> is mounted directly to the vehicle body. These components were reviewed for differences in shape and construction prior to being assembled to the vehicles. For this project, <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> of PROTON Persona car was chosen to be benchmarking. Then, the new <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> was design by using SOLIDWORK Software in dimensional of PROTON Persona car. By using FEA tools that is ALGOR software, the new design was analyzed at three different parts and constant force. Improvement of <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> design was compared based on material used, attachment, analysis on Stress Von Mises and displacement, installation, buying and repairing cost, and others.

40|$|AbstractAutomobile bumper {{subsystem}} is {{the frontal}} and rear {{structure of the}} vehicle that has the purpose of energy absorption during low velocity impact. The main component of this subsystem is the transverse <b>bumper</b> <b>beam,</b> generally made by steel.

40|$|The <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> {{today is}} {{generally}} {{made of steel}} via stamping. The structural and Complexity potential of such parts is very high but investments and variable costs are significant. A process offering an economic and flexible alternative is roll forming. In this paper, a simulation {{has been done in}} order to compare between roll forming and stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> CAD softwares have been used for the simulation and analysis which are Solidwork 2005 and finite element analysis software Algor version 21. The <b>bumper</b> <b>beams</b> have been design in Solidwork and the Algor has been used to make stress analysis to the <b>bumper</b> <b>beams.</b> The static stress with linear material model has been applied to the both <b>bumper</b> <b>beams</b> that are from stamping and roll forming for comparison. The surface loads that have been applied to the <b>bumper</b> <b>beams</b> are calculated from the velocity of Gen- 2 car at 80 km/h to 120 km/h. From the analysis the maximum stress for stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> is 282. 82 MPa and 243. 29 MPa for roll forming <b>bumper</b> <b>beam.</b> After that, the analysis about costs to produce each <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> has been done. The costs that have been considered for this thesis are costs from man, machines and materials. From the calculation the production of stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> need cost about RM 26 032 400 and for the roll forming <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> just need RM 3 010 600 for the production cost. As a conclusion, from this thesis roll forming <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> has more advantages compare to stamping <b>bumper</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the most}} {{important}} part of the automotive front bumper system, namely, the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam,</b> is studied by changing the material and thickness to improve the crashworthiness performance in low-velocity impact.

Lightweight is the main purpose of this article. First, the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> analysis is accomplished for carbon fiber composite and steel material to analyze their deformation, weight, impact force, energy absorption, and the acceleration of the impactor. As a consequence, the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> made by carbon fiber composite achieves better impact behavior.

40|$|<b>Bumper</b> <b>beam</b> {{absorbs the}} {{accidental}} kinetic energy by deflection in low-speed impact and by deformation in high-speed impact. The safety regulations "low-, and high-speed, and pedestrian impacts" along with new environmental restrictions "end-of-life vehicles" increased the complexity level of bumper system design. The new bumper design must be {{flexible enough to}} reduce the passenger and occupant injury and stay intact in low-speed impact besides being stiff enough to dissipate the kinetic energy in highspeed impact. The reinforcement beam plays {{a vital role in}} safety and it must be validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) and experimental tests before mass production. The careful design and analysis of <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> effective parameters can optimize the strength, reduce the weight, and increase the possibility of utilizing biodegradable and recyclable materials to reduce the environmental pollution. Developing the correct design and analysis procedures prevents design re-modification. On the other hand, analysis of the most effective parameters conducive to high <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> strength increases the efficiency of product development. Cross section, longitudinal curvature, fixing method, rib thickness, and strength are some of the significant design parameters in <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> production. This study critically reviews the related literature on bumper design {{to come up with the}} optimal <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> design process. It particularly focuses on the effective parameters in the design of <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> and their most suitable values or ranges of values. The results can help designers and researchers in performing functional analysis of the <b>bumper</b> <b>beam</b> determinant variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
