25|$|Under a <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA,</b> first {{enacted in}} 1998, individuals, whether {{employees}} or self-employed, voluntarily contribute post-tax funds {{to an individual}} retirement arrangement (IRA). In contrast to the 401(k) plan, the Roth plan requires post-tax contributions, but allows for tax free growth and distribution, provided the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years and the account owner has reached age 59½. <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> contribution limits are significantly lower than 401(k) contribution limits. For tax-years 2016 and 2017, individuals may contribute no more than $5,500 per year to a <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> if under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older. Additionally, <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> contribution limits are reduced for taxpayers with a Modified Adjusted Gross Income (modified AGI) greater than $117,000 ($184,000 for married filing jointly), phasing out entirely for individuals with a modified AGI of $132,000 ($194,000 for married filing jointly), for 2016.

5000|$|Excluding SEPs and SIMPLEs (i.e., {{concerning}} traditional, rollover, and <b>Roth</b> <b>IRAs),</b> 15.1% {{of individuals}} holding an IRA contributed to one. The percentage was much higher for Roth IRAs: 7.2% of owners of traditional or rollover IRAs (same for contribution purposes) contributed, while 29.5% of owners of <b>Roth</b> <b>IRAs</b> contributed.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike <b>Roth</b> <b>IRAs,</b> {{owners of}} <b>Roth</b> 401(k) {{accounts}} (designated Roth accounts) must begin distributions at age 70½, as with IRA and other retirement plans. (Pub 4530) ...|$|R
25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA,</b> such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (<b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E
25|$|According to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in the US, various {{retirement}} accounts such as: Traditional IRAs, <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA,</b> SEP IRA, or 401k plan accounts require that a qualified trustee, or custodian, hold IRA assets {{on behalf of}} the IRA owner. The trustee/custodian provides custody of the assets, processes all transactions, maintains other records pertaining to them, files the required IRS reports, issues client statements, helps clients understand the rules and regulations pertaining to certain prohibited transactions, and performs other administrative duties {{on behalf of the}} self-directed retirement account owner.|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{under the}} current system who {{accumulated}} savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved {{under the current}} system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and [...] "hidden taxes" [...] embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be [...] "taxed" [...] a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.|$|E
50|$|Assets in <b>Roth</b> <b>IRAs</b> grow tax free; interests, dividends, {{and capital}} gains are all exempt from income taxes. Contributions to <b>Roth</b> <b>IRAs</b> {{are limited to}} those with annual incomes less than the {{threshold}} established yearly by the IRS. The benefits of these plans, however, are only available to workers and families whose incomes and expenses allow them excess funds to commit for a long period, typically until the investor reaches age 59½. The effect of these tools are further limited by the contribution limits placed on them.|$|R

2500|$|The Roth 401(k) {{is a type}} of {{retirement}} savings plan. It was authorized by the United States Congress under the Internal Revenue Code, section 402A, and represents a unique combination of features of the <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> and a traditional 401(k) plan. Since January 1, 2006, U.S. employers have been allowed to amend their 401(k) plan document to allow employees to elect <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> type tax treatment for a portion or all of their retirement plan contributions. The same change in law allowed <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> type contributions to 403(b) retirement plans. The Roth retirement plan provision was enacted as a provision of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA 2001).|$|E

2500|$|Roth {{was known}} as a fiscal conservative. Critics blamed him for {{national}} deficits under Reagan. He was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance, serving as Chairman from September 12, 1995 through January 3, 2001. He was best remembered as a strong advocate of tax cuts, and he co-authored the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, also known as the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut with Jack Kemp. Roth was also the legislative sponsor of the individual retirement account plan that bears his name, the <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA.</b> It is a popular individual retirement account that has existed since 1998. The Roth 401(k), which did not become available until 2006, is also named after Roth. He {{was also one of the}} few Republicans to vote for the Brady Bill and the ban on semi-automatic weapons.

50|$|For Canadians with U.S. Roth IRAs: A {{new rule}} (2008) {{provides}} that Roth IRAs (as defined in section 408A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and similar plans {{are considered to}} be pensions. Accordingly, distributions from a <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> (as well as other similar plans) to a resident of Canada will generally be exempt from Canadian tax {{to the extent that they}} would have been exempt from U.S. tax if paid to a resident of the U.S. Additionally, a resident of Canada may elect to defer any taxation in Canada with respect to income accrued in a <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> but not distributed by the <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA,</b> until and to the extent that a distribution is made from the <b>Roth</b> <b>IRA</b> or any plan substituted therefor.
