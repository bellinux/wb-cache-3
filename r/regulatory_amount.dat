40|$|Bank {{capital has}} a {{critical}} role in banking business the world over. Capital is a principal aspect of regulation and will determine how long a bank remains in business from a regulatory point of view. Its cost and the <b>regulatory</b> <b>amount</b> {{have an impact on the}} competitiveness of an institution and will influence the rate of expansion of a bank. The contribution of capital to the profitability and survival of a commercial bank remain an unresolved empirical issue. Prior research on the relationship between capital and profitability has largely focused on developed economies, especially the USA, and Europe. However, the results have been inconclusive. There is no evidence of such kind of a research done to date that focuses on an emerging economy such as South Africa. The seemingly conflicting finding coupled with regulations imposing equity capital adequacy from the Basel 11 Accord present an opportune platform for further research on the relationship between capital and profitability. Using South Africa as a unit of analysis and using the Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM), and Panel Two Stage Least Squares (2 SLS) or Pooled IV method as the estimation techniques, this study tested the hypothesis that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between bank capital and profitability. The results from the study provide evidence of a positive relationship between capital ratio (CAR), return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) and supported the generally held notion that there is a positive relationship between bank capital and profitability. This research output provided new insights into the long-run impact of bank capital on profitability and survival. From a bank specific strategic decision-making perspective, this would assist financial institutions and investors in tailoring investment decisions in response to policy decisions that relate to bank capital. From the public policy perspective, this would assist both governments and regulators in formulating better- informed policy decisions regarding the importance of bank capital. Business ManagementD.

There is an on-going and high profile discussion of aid-for-trade {{associated with the}} Doha negotiations of the World Trade Organization. There continue also questions {{about how best to}} achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The analysis in this paper explicitly considers how to target aid most effectively to increase trade – a fundamental question related to the crisis and policy debate over restarting the world trading system. Using detailed data on aid flows from the OECD, the analysis here estimates the responsiveness of trade flows to specific types of foreign aid. The findings indicate that aid directed toward promoting trade enhances the trade performance of recipient countries: a 1 percent increase in aid directed toward trade policy and <b>regulatory</b> reform (<b>amounting</b> to about US$ 11. 7 million more such aid) could generate an increase in global trade of about US$ 818 million.

As the dollar aid flow is relatively small, such targeted aid mitigates concerns about absorptive capacity and real exchange rate appreciation, which may accompany larger disbursements. ...|$|R

Recently, ICSID arbitrators gradually attract application of principle of proportionality by citing European Courts of Human Right (ECHR) and its case laws, and World Trade Organization (WTO) Jurisprudence. However, there are numerous opinion among several scholars on the application of this principle by ICSID tribunals. Various tribunals and scholars have accepted that the host states could enjoy their sovereign rights in order to enhance socio-economic condition, protect environment and protect essential interest of State during state of emergency/economic crisis through adopting various regulatory measures. At the same time host states are under compulsion to fulfill their contractual commitments which were given at the entry of investment. This situation creates more difficult to the arbitrators to come to a conclusion whether <b>regulatory</b> measures <b>amount</b> to indirect taking as these regulatory measures prevent the use and enjoyment of investors’ property rights.

The legal foundation for these challenges is found in Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. If successful, these Paragraph IV challenges generally lead to large market share losses for incumbents and sharp declines in average market prices. This paper estimates, for the first time, the welfare effects of accelerated generic entry via these challenges. Using aggregate brand level sales data between 1997 and 2008 for hypertension drugs in the U.

With regard to several criteria, the growth-dependent factor TIF-IA behaves like a bacterial sigma factor: (i) it associates physically with pol I, (ii) it is required for initiation of transcription, (iii) it is present in limiting amounts and (iv) under certain salt conditions, it is chromatographically separable from the polymerase. In addition, evidence is presented that dephosphorylation of pol I abolishes in vitro transcription initiation from the ribosomal gene promoter without significantly affecting the polymerizing activity of the enzyme at nonspecific templates. The involvement of both a regulatory factor and post-translational modification of the transcribing enzyme provides an efficient and versatile mechanism of rDNA transcription regulation which enables the cell to adapt ribosome synthesis rapidly to a variety of extracellular signals...|$|R

Despite this significant advantage, the possibility that barrel material can affect the oligomeric state of the protein drug exists. The present {{study was designed to}} compare the effect of different syringe materials and silicone oil lubrication on the protein aggregation. The stability of a recombinant fusion protein, abatacept (Orencia), and a fully human recombinant immunoglobulin G 1, adalimumab (Humira), was assessed in silicone oil-free (SOF) and silicone oil-lubricated 1 -mL glass syringes and polymer-based syringes in accelerated stress study. Samples were subjected to agitation stress, and soluble aggregate levels were evaluated by size-exclusion chromatography and verified with analytical ultracentrifugation. In accordance with current <b>regulatory</b> expectations, the <b>amounts</b> of subvisible particles resulting from agitation stress were estimated using resonant mass measurement and dynamic flow-imaging analyses. The amount of aggregated protein and particle counts were similar between unlubricated polymer-based and glass syringes. The most significant protein loss was observed for lubricated glass syringes.

From a pool of hybrid plasmids carrying Sau 3 A fragments representing the entire yeast genome, a 13 kb DNA fragment containing the regulatory gene DURM was cloned by complementation of a durM mutation which prevents the growth on allantoin as sole nitrogen source. Cells containing the cloned DNA recover the inducibility of ureaamidolyase by allophanate.

40|$|The {{privatization}} {{of drinking water}} utilities is a topic of increasing importance in the United States and abroad. In the United States, increasing populations, aging infrastructure, and the growing threat of climate change means public utilities face many important challenges in the coming years. In {{the current state of}} affairs, privatization is an attractive option for local governments. It allows them shift the management of their utility to a private firm while providing an infusion of revenue. While privatization is attractive, it is also controversial. Critics of privatization believe that it will lead to many negative outcomes. In this dissertation, I take the question of privatization seriously. Using a mix of normative and quantitative methods, I consider the implications of privatization for local democracy. I begin my analysis by evaluating common criticisms of privatization. Many critics argue that privatization is contrary to a human right to water. I suggest that the human right to water only requires that states ensure all individuals receive access to a safe and affordable source of water, not that the source necessarily be public. Instead, the human right to water creates a strong duty for states to regulate private provision of drinking water. Similarly, I argue that critics? concerns about affordability, quality, and conservation are perhaps overstated when a strong regulatory state exists. I find that the arguments against privatization that hold the most weight are those that emphasize local democratic processes, since privatization in the <b>regulatory</b> state <b>amounts</b> to a centralization of political authority. I then turn to a series of statistical analyses focused on utility responsiveness to local context. First, I examine the difference in private and public utility responsiveness in the context of drinking water compliance, finding that while private utilities outperform public in general, this is conditional on levels of citizen participation. Second, I investigate the adoption of water rates, finding that while private utilities are less likely to adopt conservation oriented policy in general, they are no less responsive to local context. My analysis suggests the importance of regulation, political context, and local government in drinking water policy...|$|R

This review summarizes the findings available to day concerning CoQ distribution, biosynthesis, regulatory modifications and its participation in cellular metabolism. There are a number of indications that this lipid is not always functioning by its direct presence at the site of action but also using e. g. receptor expression modifications, signal transduction mechanisms and action through its metabolites. The biosynthesis of CoQ is studied in great detail in bacteria and yeast but only to a limited extent in animal tissues and therefore the informations available is restricted. However, it is known that the CoQ is compartmentalized in the cell with multiple sites of biosynthesis, breakdown and regulation which is the basis of functional specialization. Some <b>regulatory</b> mechanisms concerning <b>amount</b> and biosynthesis are established and nuclear transcription factors are partly identified in this process. Using appropriate ligands of nuclear receptors the biosynthetic rate can be increased in experimental system which raises the possibility of drug-induced upregulation of the lipid in deficiency.

In this case the extent of disturbances is dependent on the localizaion and the modified distribution of the lipid at cellular and membrane levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} data {{collection}} and reporting standards The design of any clinical trial involves a variety of tradeoffs. One set of issues involves balancing the opportunity to collect large amounts of data on each subject with other important priorities, {{such as the ability}} to verify the quality of the data, the number of subjects that can be studied in the trial, the length and intensity of follow-up, and the cost of the trial.

30|$|The AHLs {{receptor}} {{proteins in}} S. cerevisiae {{are the most}} critical factor to explain both the morphological changes and the effects on ethanol tolerance during exposure to AHLs (C 12 -HSL or 3 OC 6 -HSL). Theoretically, according to their hydrophobic structures {{and their ability to}} traverse bacterial cell membranes, it is possible that AHLs freely diffuse into fungal cells and bind to intracellular receptor protein. The other two possible mechanism of action for AHLs in eukaryotic cells are as modulators of intracellular biochemical reaction and as extracellular ligands for membrane-associated receptor proteins (Shiner et al. 2005). In this study, the influence of AHLs on S. cerevisiae particularly reflected on the morphological changes and slightly apoptosis observed by optical microscope and flow cytometer (FSC/SSC). Related researches had found <b>amount</b> <b>regulatory</b> proteins have similar effects on the S. cerevisiae growth, for examples, protein phosphatases which could dramatically effects on cell shape, the single yeast isozyme of protein kinase C (Pκc 1 p) that is capable of maintenance the cellular integrity, and HtrA-like protein Nma 111 P plays a crucial role in yeast apoptosis (Fahrenkrog et al. 2004; Heinisch et al. 1999; Ronne et al. 1991). Besides, the hexokinase (Augustin et al. 1965) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Nagodawithana and Steinkraus 1976) have been shown to decrease ethanol tolerance. All of these are valuable for identification the regulation mechanisms of AHLs in S. cerevisiae. AHLs would probably have the similar receptor-proteins and then initiate the regulation pathways of growth or other functions in S. cerevisiae.|$|R

With this invaluable resource as a reference, several groups have begun to sequence, assemble and analyse the genomes of various relatives of S. cerevisiae. Such analyses have led to more accurate annotation of the reference genome, clearer evidence for which genes are genuine and which seem dubious, and a wealth of information on <b>regulatory</b> motifs. The <b>amount</b> of sequence data is considerable, and many more interesting observations are likely to emerge from secondary studies. This work describes two such discoveries. It has been determined that the regions immediately surrounding budding yeast centromeres are excessively divergent between the species, and highly polymorphic between strains. This occurs despite the obvious importance of centromeres in chromosome dynamics, and despite the absence of lengthy repetitious DNA that is characteristic of centromeres in other eukaryotes. As such it is a most unexpected finding, and although the mechanisms responsible for this 'supervariation' remain unclear it is sufficient to serve as a fingerprint for readily distinguishing many almost identical strains. It has also been established that a sizeable subtelomeric section of the S. cerevisiae genome has {{at some point in the}} past been horizontally transmitted (probably by hybrid introgression) to European strains of a wild relative Saccharomyces paradoxus. This is part of a growing body of evidence that there is extensive gene flow even between so-called species and that budding yeast genomes have a more complex and multi-layered history than previously anticipated...|$|R

This study investigated the quality of antimalarial drugs and selected antibiotics at all levels of the health facility supply chain in PNG.; Medicines were obtained from randomly sampled health facilities and selected warehouses and hospitals across PNG and analysed for API content using validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Of 360 tablet/capsule samples from 60 providers, 9. 7 % (95 % CI 6. 9, 13. 3) contained less, and 0. 6 % more, API than pharmacopoeial reference ranges, including 29 / 37 (78. 4 %) primaquine, 3 / 70 (4. 3 %) amodiaquine, and one sample each of quinine, artemether, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amoxicillin. According to the package label, 86. 5 % of poor-quality samples originated from India. Poor-quality medicines were found in 48. 3 % of providers at all levels of the supply chain. Drug quality was unrelated to storage conditions.; This study documents the presence of poor-quality medicines, particularly primaquine, throughout PNG. Primaquine is the only available transmission-blocking antimalarial, likely to become important to prevent the spread of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum and eliminating P. vivax hypnozoites. The availability of poor-quality medicines reflects the lack of adequate quality control and regulatory mechanisms. Measures to stop the availability of poor-quality medicines should include limiting procurement to WHO prequalified products and implementing routine quality testing...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear acetyltransferase MOF (KAT 8 in mammals) is a subunit of {{at least}} two multi-component {{complexes}} involved in transcription regulation. In the context of complexes of the 'Non-Specific-Lethal' (NSL) type it controls transcription initiation of many nuclear housekeeping genes and of mitochondrial genes. While this function is conserved in metazoans, MOF has an additional, specific function in Drosophila in the context of dosage compensation. As a subunit of the male-specific-lethal dosage compensation complex (MSL-DCC) it contributes to the doubling of transcription output from the single male X chromosome by acetylating histone H 4. Proper dosage compensation requires finely tuned levels of MSL-DCC and an appropriate distribution of MOF between the <b>regulatory</b> complexes. The <b>amounts</b> of DCC formed depends directly on the levels of the male-specific MSL 2, which orchestrates the assembly of the DCC, including MOF recruitment. We found earlier that MSL 2 is an E 3 ligase that ubiquitylates most MSL proteins, including MOF, suggesting that ubiquitylation may contribute to a quality control of MOF's overall levels and folding state as well as its partitioning between the complex entities. We now used mass spectrometry to map the lysines in MOF that are ubiquitylated by MSL 2 in vitro and identified in vivo ubiquitylation sites of MOF in male and female cells. MSL 2 -specific ubiquitylation in vivo could not be traced due to the dominance of other, sex-independent ubiquitylation events and conceivably may be rare or transient. Expressing appropriately mutated MOF derivatives we assessed the importance of the ubiquitylated lysines for dosage compensation by monitoring DCC formation and X chromosome targeting in cultured cells, and by genetic complementation of the male-specific-lethal mof 2 allele in flies. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of MOF ubiquitylation as a reference for future studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor-quality {{life-saving}} medicines are a {{major public}} health threat, particularly in settings with a weak <b>regulatory</b> environment. Insufficient <b>amounts</b> of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) endanger patient safety and {{may contribute to the}} development of drug resistance. In the case of malaria, concerns relate to implications for the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). In Papua New Guinea (PNG), Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are both endemic and health facilities are the main source of treatment.

50|$|Americium is {{the only}} {{synthetic}} element to have {{found its way into}} the household, where {{the most common type of}} smoke detector uses 241Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. This isotope is preferred over 226Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation. Element collector Theodore Gray mentions in his book The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe: You might think that a synthetic radioactive element that follows plutonium (94)—and has a significantly shorter half-life—would be some kind of superbomb material, available only to scientists in secret laboratories. Perhaps a mad scientist is studying americium in a lair somewhere, but if you want some yourself you can simply walk into any neighborhood hardware store, supermarket, or Wal-Mart and buy some, no questions asked.The reason is not that americium is fundamentally less dangerous than the elements around it. In fact, the commonly available isotope, 241Am, is significantly more radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium, and at least as toxic. No, the difference is simply that there is a useful application for americium that requires only a very tiny amount, and for which a company was prepared to go through the effort required to carve out and get a <b>regulatory</b> exception. The <b>amount</b> of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class II antigens is down-regulated when B cells differentiate into plasma cells. We have studied the mechanism of down-regulation of MHC class II expression in a BALB/c strain-derived murine plasmacytoma cell line, NS 1. NS 1 cells express MHC class I antigens but not MHC class II antigens. We tested 20 uncloned hybrid cell lines obtained from the fusion of NS 1 cells with MHC class II-expressing splenic B cells prepared from CBA, SJL or BALB/c mice. All the hybrid cell lines expressed MHC class I antigens of either or both parental haplotypes but did not express MHC class II. One NS 1 X splenic B cell hybrid clone, K 3, was used to further validate these results; K 3 cells expressed MHC class I but not MHC class II antigens. K 3 was fused to the MHC class II-expressing B lymphoma A 20, and the seven resulting hybrid cell lines were again found to express MHC class I but not MHC class II antigens. Since NS 1 is a subclone of the P 3 -X 63 Ag 8 murine plasmacytoma, we also tested one P 3 -X 63 Ag 8 x splenic B cell hybrid, Sp 2 / 0, and two Sp 2 / 0 x splenic B cell hybrids. All were found to express the appropriate MHC class I antigens but did not express MHC class II. Thus, our {{results suggest that the}} NS 1 plasmacytoma suppresses MHC class II expression by a phenotypically dominant regulatory mechanism. We found that NS 1 cells express correctly sized mRNA for the MHC class II genes A alpha, E alpha and the invariant chain. The co-{{expression of}} MHC class I protein and I-A and I-E region gene transcripts provides strong evidence that the MHC gene cluster is structurally intact, and that lack of class II expression is due to a genetic <b>regulatory</b> mechanism. The <b>amounts</b> of class II mRNA expressed by NS 1 cells were at least equivalent to those found in splenic lymphocytes. Therefore, this regulation must operate post-transcriptionally...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Banks play a {{strategically}} {{important role}} in the machinations of both global finance and the global economy. Ensuring the stability and good governance of the banking milieu falls within the ambit of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) which recognised the importance of banks and established the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in 1974. The BCBS has engineered and distributed two accords ? Basel I and Basel II ? {{over the last two decades}} since 1988 with the goal of promoting adequately and appropriately regulated banks. The latest of these ? Basel II ? embraces three risk components namely market, credit and operational risk. The most significant aspect of the current (Basel II) accord is the determination of the appropriate <b>amount</b> of <b>regulatory</b> capital, i. e. an amount which is not so lenient that it allows banks to regularly fail and yet not be too onerous as to impede the day to day operations of a bank. The assessment of bank capital adequacy and the enforcement of sufficient retained capital are important functions undertaken by banking supervisors. Basel II requires that banks retain sufficient capital, at given confidence levels, to prevent insolvency. Banks must also satisfy local regulators (who may interpret and impose more stringent aspects of the accord) that additional risks have been adequately and appropriately addressed and the requisite capital has been reserved for these. The ultimate aim of the BCBS is to align banks' <b>regulatory</b> capital (the <b>amount</b> required to keep banks solvent as decided by the BCBS) with banks' internal (or economic) capital. The former is estimated via equations which are based on several economic assumptions, but are by definition highly conservative. The equations comprise several inputs, some of which are determined by banks using the most advanced approaches but many of which have been deliberately fixed by the BCBS as a means of introducing and establishing the perceived austerity into capital requirement formulas. The rationale behind the choices of fixed parameters has never been publicly released and this opacity obscures the fairness of the capital requirements; fairness in the sense of "do these fixed parameter restrictions make for capital requirements that are too onerous or too lenient?" Without details of how to estimate these fixed parameters, banks using the BCBS-specified equations must simply accept that the requirements are "fair" or at least appropriate. This thesis establishes measurement methodologies of the opaque, fixed variables of Basel II?s capital equations using banks' own empirical data. Using these methodologies, banks (of any size and complexity) may determine their own unique parameters from their own internal loss experience and thus assess the fairness of the imposed regulatory capital charges. If these are deemed too lenient, banks can increase their capital reserves and if too onerous, banks can adjust the pricing of risky securities. In either case, banks using these methodologies will be able to establish precisely their unique, empirical capital requirements without blind acceptance of obscured parameters in the capital calculations of Basel II.
