40|$|The weeks {{following}} {{the birth of}} a child can be stressful for new mothers. Maternal stress may be increased when mothers are dissatisfied with instrumental partner support (e. g., division of childcare duties and family decision-making power). The purpose of the current study was to determine if there is an association between dissatisfaction with partner support and maternal stress in the postpartum period, and to examine whether that association is mediated by demand-withdraw communication between partners. Participants were 49 women who completed questionnaires about satisfaction with partner support, female demand/male withdraw communication in their relationship, and their own perceived stress approximately 8 weeks after giving birth. Findings support the hypothesis that demand-withdraw communication mediates the association between dissatisfaction with partner support and maternal stress. This finding suggests that fathers' withdrawal in the context of mothers' <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> or change appears to be associated with increased levels of maternal stress. <br/...|$|R

40|$|This {{report was}} <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> at the {{interdisciplinary}} plenary {{session of the}} 13 th International Conference of Religious Sociology (Lloret de Mar, Spain, Sept 4 s 1975). It first underlines {{some of the differences}} between the sociological and the psychological approach of the contemporary charismatic phenomenon. If the psychology of the charismatic experience is expressed in terms of desire, subjectivity, language, and an eventual regression to on-language glossolalia), the method of biographical conversations (C. L Harper) is too strongly contaminated by an artificial reconstruction of the past to determine its object scientifically. As for the study of personality features typical of sympathizers of the Pentecostal Movement (W. W. Wood) it too leaves aside what appears to be essential for the psychology of the phenomenon under study, namely the interactions experienced within the group and between group and leader. Basing his remarks on personal observations and lengthy conversations with ten well known leaders, the rapporteur shows how the systematic avoidance of clashes in the charismatic assemblies leads to and maintains both jubilant spontaneity which is attributed to the immediacy of the Spirit's presence, and mute frustrations which lead some of the participants to demonstrations of glossolalias. The understanding of these latter manifestations has progressed rapidly during the last five years by means of various analyses, phonetic (F. D Goodman), linguistic (W. J. Samarin), and lastly psychological (J. P. Kildhal). The observations of the last named researchers are briefly outlined. In conclusion the theoretical concept of regression in the service of the Ego is discussed in order to account for the tension between the desire for highly differentiated communications leading inevitably to psychological divergences and socio-political confrontations and more elementary nedd which uses energies in purely expressive and semantically a-historical demonstrationsGodin André.

This technique, known from DSL, and currently under <b>discussion</b> <b>for</b> <b>RF</b> wireless, seems also attractive for IR indoor systems, but needs to be examined under the specific conditions of the wireless optical channel. An ideal channel capacity analysis is performed to assess potential data rates in the multi-path IR channel typically present in rooms. Further on, by means of simulations, the authors investigate the throughput maximization for practical systems with the use of bit-loading. For capacity maximization, optimal allocation of the optical signal power over the sub-channels in the frequency domain is calculated, according to the channel state and optical power constraint (safety regulations for human eye and skin). Although still suboptimal, it could be considered as the most suitable bit and power allocation technique for the proposed adaptive system...|$|R

Advisors: Dr. Deanne Magnusson, Dr. David Chapman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxi, 283 pages. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the extent to which families within the Shravasti district of Uttar Pradesh, India are engaged in their children's education, as well as to examine the child, family, school, and community factors that are potentially associated with families' involvement in their children's education. Additionally, through mediation analysis (Preacher and Hayes, 2008), the educational aspirations that are held for the child were examined in relation to way these aspirations potentially mediate the relationship between factors within the child, family, school, and community contexts and family engagement in education. Seven forms of family engagement were examined in this study, including financial investment in children's schooling, educational aspirations for the child's level of educational attainment, whether or not family helps the child in his or her study, whether or not the family accompanies the child to school, and whether or not the child's caretaker visits the school for the purpose of attending a meeting as a member, when presence is needed for reasons such as paying fees or enrollment, and/or at the teacher's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> about the child's study or behavior. Multiple linear and binary logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between child, family, school, and community factors and different forms of family engagement. Out of the various contextual factors examined, the findings revealed that the dummy variables for the household's village of residence and the child's age were among the most consistent indicators family engagement in education. Furthermore, based on the findings from the mediation models in which educational attainment aspirations served as the mediator variable, one or more significant indirect effects were found with each of the dependent variables of financial investment in education, family help with study, and family accompaniment to school. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the nature of family engagement in education in the Shravasti district of Uttar Pradesh, India, providing knowledge of the factors that are related to various forms of family engagement in education in the Shravasti district. Moreover, through this study, practical strategies are offered for Indian educators in order to facilitate more collaborative relationships with the parents and families of Indian students...|$|R

The number of representative seats, however, was based on the population of the state, and to further complicate matters, slave states were allowed to count 3/5ths of their slave population to increase their number of representatives. The population of the North had grown more rapidly than the South, and the South had a large percentage of slaves, which resulted in a lower countable populace. Thus, the proposed Tallmadge Amendment could further restrict the weight of the slaveholding South in the Union. By a close vote on February 16, 1819, the House of Representatives adopted the Tallmadge Amendment, however it was promptly rejected by the Senate.
