This study {{introduces}} {{the current states}} and progress of the overseas digitization manufacture technology <b>of</b> airplane <b>ducts,</b> and analyzes the problems about manufacture technology of bent tubes in airplane production in China. Thus, instead of the full pattern, the three-dimensional models are proposed to conduct the NC(Numerical Controling) bending and examine the bending quality, and the integrated digitization manufacture technology <b>of</b> airplane <b>ducts</b> is developed. The key problems are solved including standardization modeling <b>of</b> <b>ducts,</b> 3 D data transfering, virtual processing analysis, digital modular fixture design/manufacturing, and NC bending/manufacturing/inspection <b>of</b> <b>ducts.</b> The technology has been successfully applied into the digital forming manufacturing <b>of</b> airplan <b>ducts...</b>|$|R

Duct acoustic problems in Category 2 are solved by the DRP finite difference scheme with the selective artificial damping method and results are presented and compared to reference solutions...|$|R

40|$|Free {{vibration}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>ducts</b> is {{the first}} step to understand the coupling between structural and acoustic modes in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) ducts. This thesis covers free vibration analysis <b>of</b> different <b>duct</b> shapes like rectangular, circular, flat oval and elliptical. These types <b>of</b> <b>ducts</b> are extensively used in HVAC systems. Transfer Matrix (TM) method is used to calculate natural frequencies and mode shapes for rectangular and flat oval ducts with simply supported boundary conditions. Free vibration analysis <b>of</b> cylindrical <b>ducts</b> and curved plates is explained as subsections <b>of</b> flat oval <b>ducts.</b> TM method is only useful for simply supported boundary conditions...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the effect}} <b>of</b> the <b>duct,</b> the {{slipstream}} pattern and aerodynamic characteristic <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor {{are different from the}} conventional open-type rotor. It can reduce the risk of component damage and enhance the operational safety. In addition, both the <b>duct</b> and rotor <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor can produce thrust. Thrust which is produced by the duct is due to negative pressure on the duct inlet, which contributes a maximum of 50  % to the total. Furthermore, the noise <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is lower than the conventional open-type rotor (Keys et al. 1991; Desjardins et al. 1991). Consequently, the analysis of the aerodynamic noise <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is the main topic for this paper.|$|R

By comparing with the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> fan with a single rotor, results {{show that there is}} interference between the upper and lower rotors, the upper one interferes the lower one more heavily and interference is reduced with the increase of distance between the rotors; the <b>duct</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> fan with coaxial rotors can provide more lift than the one with a single rotor...|$|R
