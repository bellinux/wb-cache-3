Remote sensing is a demonstrated valuable tool to characterize environmental conditions that support schistosomiasis transmission.

We present a mixed-methods approach that builds on the remotely sensed ecological variables by exploring water and sanitation related community characteristics as independent risk factors of schistosomiasis transmission...|$|E
40|$|The amoebae Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba spp., and Balamuthia mandrillaris are {{free-living}} amoebae {{found in}} both water and soil. They are opportunistic pathogens in humans. Acanthamoeba {{is the most}} common cause of illness, usually infecting the eyes and sometimes causing a sight-threatening keratitis. Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris can cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, in addition to infections of the lungs and skin. N. fowleri causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. There is little known regarding the ecology and occurrence of these organisms. A total of 36 high-use <b>recreational</b> <b>surface</b> waters in Arizona were surveyed over a period of two years to assess the occurrence of N. fowleri and seasonal and environmental factors. Overall, 9. 3 % of the warm weather samples collected were positive for N. fowleri, whereas 16. 3 % of the samples were positive during cold weather. Although the presence of N. fowleri could not be significantly correlated with physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity, and the presence of heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli, a weak correlation (0. 52) with live amoebic activity was observed. Five lakes to the north and northeast of Phoenix tested positive for the N. fowleri on more than one occasion over multiple seasons. Finished drinking water samples (n= 785) from a municipal potable distribution system were evaluated for the presence of N. fowleri, B. mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba spp. from 18 different regions during three different sampling periods. Physical and chemical parameters were also evaluated but provided no significant correlations with the occurrence of amoebae or indicator organisms. A total of 138 samples (17. 9 %) were positive for viable amoebae in distribution water with more than an adequate chlorine residual (average of 0. 86 mg/L). Microorganisms that are typically used to monitor microbial water quality such as coliforms and E. coli would likely not be found under these circumstances. Clusters with three or more samples testing positive for viable amoebae per region were observed during all three periods. Viable amoebae may not only provide a better assessment of the microbial quality of water, but such clustering could reveal areas with potential water quality issues within the distribution system...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter species, {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in humans, are of worldwide significance. Drinking and <b>recreational</b> <b>surface</b> waters {{have been identified as}} a major vehicle of pathogenic Campylobacter spp. transmission to humans. Outbreaks of campylobacteriosis as well as sporadic cases have been reported both locally and internationally. However, in only a small proportion of cases has the responsible organism been isolated from the implicated water source. The inherent difficulties with isolation of Campylobacter spp. from environmental water sources make the development of more reliable, alternative isolation and detection methods a preferred option. In this study, the potential for aquatic invertebrates to act as biological indicators for detecting Campylobacter spp. from recreational water was investigated. The suspension and filter feeding strategies of aquatic invertebrates allowing them to concentrate Campylobacter cells to readily detectable levels within their tissues was explored. Sampling of water, mussels, cockles and snails from the Avon-Heathcote rivers and estuary revealed low isolation rates with no apparent correlation between Campylobacter presence in water and the invertebrates. Placement of freshwater mussels in the Avon and Heathcote rivers proved successful for isolation of Campylobacter spp., while marine mussels, cockles and snails routinely tested negative. Hence, the freshwater mussel was chosen as a candidate bio-indicator. In vitro (tank) experiments showed close correlation between Campylobacter detection in mussels and water. However, isolation of Campylobacter from mussels was deemed to be no better than testing the water itself. Environmental Campylobacter isolates were analysed by resistotyping, flaA PCR-RFLP typing and PFGE to determine relationships between isolates. Although very few isolates were found to be clonal, a high level of genetic relatedness was determined between isolates from the Avon and Heathcote rivers. This indicates a common source of input between these rivers, most likely to be from birds. A validation study {{for the use of the}} cadF virulence gene as a marker for PCR detection of pathogenic Campylobacter species was under taken. Although useful for distinguishing Campylobacter spp. in pure culture, this system was found to show a degree of unreliability for specific detection from environmental samples...|$|E

40|$|Ambient and <b>recreational</b> <b>surface</b> waters {{worldwide}} experience fecal pollution due to {{a variety}} of anthropogenic sources. Fecal waste has been proven, for over a century, to harbor pathogenic microorganisms which subsequently cause a variety of disease and illness in human hosts. The benefits of utilizing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) as a simple, inexpensive means to detect fitful human pathogens within a variety of water matrices are vast. However, no universal agreement exists in regard to which indicator is best suited for detection of fecal contamination and pathogens in environmental waters, and no single standard for bacterial indicators has been federally mandated. This study sought to explore the potential benefits of a multiple-indicator approach to water quality analysis of fresh and brackish surface waters. The distribution and fluctuation of two frequently used, EPA approved groups of FIB – fecal coliform and Enterococcus – were explored, and relationships between the two FIB groups were examined in fresh and brackish surface waters of Central and South Florida. Samples were collected over a period of 12 consecutive months, spanning April 2015 through March 2016, and analyzed using membrane filtration procedures outlined in Standard Methods 9222 D and EPA method 1600. Raw and log transformed colony forming unit (CFU) data, per 100 mL, was analyzed annually and seasonally through linear regression, Spearman correlation, and exploratory data analysis techniques performed in R-Studio. The results of this study showed a moderate to strong relationship between fecal coliform and Enterococcus under both fresh and brackish conditions. The presence of a positive, linear relationship between fecal coliform and Enterococcus in both fresh and brackish water was apparent in both seasonal and annual regression analysis; upward and downward fluctuation(s) in one variable was shown to predict similar fluctuation(s) in the other year-round. However, while fecal coliform and Enterococcus showed moderate to strong correlations, causation was not implied. Low R 2 values showed that the FIB groups were not dependent upon one another in any case, either annually or seasonally. The results of this study challenge previously accepted views of fecal coliform and Enterococcus effectiveness as ideal fresh and brackish water FIB, their suitability as sole indicators of fecal pollution, and their ideal usage as indicators for waters of varying salinities; results support those previously seen in studies such as Hanes and Fragala 1967, which emphasize the need for a multiple indicator approach to water quality analysis of ambient and recreational waters experiencing brackish conditions...|$|E

40|$|HUMANS {{have used}} turfgrasses {{to enhance their}} {{environment}} for over 10 centuries. Golf has been played on turfgrass for five centuries, or one-half that time. Thus, humans have had an interest and willingness to invest time in maintain-ing turfgrasses for the enhancement of their environment for many centuries. Point in fact, turfgrasses {{may be one of}} the oldest techniques humans have used to enhance their external living environment. Thomas Jefferson, one of the foremost statesmen in the United States, once wrote that communi-ties "should be planned with an eye to the effect upon the human spirit by being continually surrounded by a maximum of beauty. " Over 7, 500 species of grasses, grouped in 600 genera, are widely distributed through-out the world. While turfgrasses can be identified as to their origin in specific regions of the world, many of the major turfgrasses used in the United States have been natural-ized in North America for over 400 years. If humans should disappear from this conti-nent, these turfgrasses would continue to persist and thrive. Turfgrasses are one of the principal vege-tations used on golf courses. While there are certain intensively maintained turfed areas on the golfcourse in terms of closely mowed putting greens, tees, and fairways, more than 70 % of the golf course is devoted to areas consisting of a naturalized ecosystem (Table 1). These areas provide rich habitat for trees, shrubs, flowers, birds, fish, and other wild-life. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for Dr. James B. Beard golf courses not to be recognized for their valuable contribution in preserving a natural-ized ecosystem in and near urban areas. If golf courses did not exist, these areas probably would be used for either urban residential and industrial development or for intensive agriculture. Turfs have numerous important functions as well as being both aesthetically attractive and important outdoor <b>recreational</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{optimisation}} design of the Litija section on the middle Sava River where Ponovice derivation hydro power plant is being planned. The aim of the thesis is to propose an overall solution for the discussed area from the hydropower, spatial development and environmental point of view. In the introduction, the importance of hydroelectric energy in the Republic of Slovenia is described, {{as it is the}} far most important renewable energy source in this country. Energy policy is stated in the national energy programme – a strategic document with long-term development targets and directives. Among the most important projects, there is also the construction of HPP on the middle Sava River that will complete the chain of power plants on the Sava River. This thesis contains the detailed description of the chain design, concession regulation, operational regime, designed facilities and regulations. The empirical part constitutes the solutions for the Litija area. The Ponovice derivation HPP will cause the redirection of the original Sava River stream through the derivation tunnel to the engine room in Ponovice. This is why the flow of water and water level in the stream through Litija will reduce which will change the water course and the environment of the town alongside the Sava River significantly being one of the main concerns of the local population. As a solution to these concerns, 2007 the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering and the company Geateh prepared the pre-investment technical spatial documentation for HPP on the middle Sava River providing the construction of two small dams. In this thesis, the suggested design was analysed, the mathematical hydraulic model of the existing situation and suggested solutions were made and it was ascertained that the optimisation with three smaller broad crested weirs is possible. The model resulted in profiles that enable the comparison between designed regulations. This new design affects less the physical environment and is therefore preferable as well as it assures higher dam river level alongside the town. The engine room was redesigned with Straflomatrix turbines. The dam-barrage was designed as a broad crested weir with a rubber membrane. For the analysed section, we suggested new regulations of river surrounding in order to get new <b>recreational</b> <b>surfaces</b> and tourism potential for further development...|$|R

The human population there is growing faster {{than anywhere else in}} Oregon in a basin with almost 50 percent Federal land. It is home to a primarily service economy and renowned outdoor <b>recreational</b> opportunities. <b>Surface</b> {{water resource}}s are fully allocated and municipalities are looking to limited groundwater supplies to fulfill increased demands. Agriculture accounts for 95 percent of the water use where up to 50 percent of the water delivered is lost to leakage frome open, unlined delivery canals. Not only have the resources of the Basin been used to the limit by the human population, but there are tribal, federal and environmental interests committed to augmenting current levels of streamflows to benefit water quality and fisheries in the Basin. Four strategies to manage the water resources are presented: A) requiring mitigation for new groundwater pumping permits; B) reallocation of water rights by creating a market for sale and leases of water rights and mitigation credits; C) municipal and agricultural water conservation projects; and D) a regional commitment to use collaborative processes to derive new solutions. The first three strategies can create measurable differences in the way water resources are used. The requirement of mitigating new groundwater pumping by implementing some form of surface water conservation project will drive reallocation of water rights and mitigation credits and conservation projects into fruition. The fourth strategy of collaborative stakeholder processes provides the underpinning for the first three strategies to succeed and the source of future strategies, which in the end can result in fewer court ordered solutions to the resource issues in this Basin.

40|$|Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest known oxygen-evolving {{photosynthetic}} microorganisms, {{and they}} have had major impacts on shaping our current atmosphere and biosphere. Their long evolutionary history has enabled cyanobacteria to develop survival strategies and persist as important primary producers during numerous geochemical and climatic changes {{that have taken place}} on Earth during the past 3. 5 billion years. Today, some cyanobacterial species form massive surface growths or 'blooms' that produce toxins, cause oxygen depletion and alter food webs, posing a major threat to drinking and irrigation water supplies, fishing and <b>recreational</b> use of <b>surface</b> waters worldwide. These harmful cyanobacteria can take advantage of anthropogenically induced nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), and hydrologic modifications (water withdrawal, reservoir construction). Here, we review recent studies revealing that regional and global climatic change may benefit various species of harmful cyanobacteria by increasing their growth rates, dominance, persistence, geographic distributions and activity. Future climatic change scenarios predict rising temperatures, enhanced vertical stratification of aquatic ecosystems, and alterations in seasonal and interannual weather patterns (including droughts, storms, floods); these changes all favour harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Therefore, current mitigation and water management strategies, which are largely based on nutrient input and hydrologic controls, must also accommodate the environmental effects of global warming...|$|R

Exposure to these waters may have negative health effects. During two successive 1 -year study periods, the water quality in two canals (2003 to 2004) and five recreational lakes (2004 to 2005) in Amsterdam was tested {{with regard to the}} presence of fecal indicators and waterborne pathogens. According to Bathing Water Directive 2006 / 7 /EC, based on Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococcus counts, water quality in the canals was poor but was classified as excellent in the recreational lakes. Campylobacter, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia were detected in the canals, as was rotavirus, norovirus, and enterovirus RNA. Low numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were detected in the recreational lakes, despite compliance with European bathing water legislation. The estimated risk of infection with Cryptosporidium and Giardia per exposure event ranged from 0. 0002 to 0. 007 % and 0. 04 to 0. 2 %, respectively, for occupational divers professionally exposed to canal water. The estimated risk of infection at exposure to incidental peak concentrations of Cryptosporidium and Giardia may be up to 0. 01 % and 1 %, respectively, for people who accidentally swallow larger volumes of the canal water than the divers.

40|$|Swimming {{in inner-city}} surface waters is {{popular in the}} warm season, but can have {{negative}} consequences such as gastro-intestinal, ear and skin infections.

Nonetheless, the <b>recreational</b> use of <b>surface</b> waters is attractive for residents. In order to save financial and organizational resources, local authorities need to estimate the most relevant pathways of pathogens into surface waters. In particular, when detailed data on a local scale are missing, this is quite difficult to achieve. For this reason, we have developed an easy-to-apply model using the example of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci as a first approach to the local situation, where missing data can be replaced by data from literature. The model was developed based on a case study of a river arm monitored in western Germany and will be generalized for future applications. Although the limits of the EU Bathing Water Directive are already fulfilled during dry weather days, we showed that the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and overland flow had the most relevant impact on the microbial surface water quality. On rainy weather days, combined sewer overflows are responsible for the highest microbial pollution loads.

MRSA has been isolated from <b>recreational</b> beaches, high-touch <b>surfaces</b> in homes, universities and other community environmental surfaces. However, in most cases the strains were not characterized to determine if they are related to community-acquired or hospital-acquired clinical strains. We compared 55 environmental MRSA from 805 samples including sand, fresh and marine water samples from local marine and fresh water recreational beaches (n= 296), high touch surfaces on the University of Washington campus (n= 294), surfaces in UW undergraduate housing (n= 85), and the local community (n= 130).
