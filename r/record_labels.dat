5|$|Both {{independent}} and major <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this thesis was to {{illustrate}} {{the creation of a}} successful independent <b>record</b> <b>label.</b> The research analyzed current music business trends in addition to general business literature.

25|$|As the RIAA curve was {{essentially}} an American standard, it had little impact outside the USA {{until the late}} 1970s when European <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> began to adopt the RIAA equalization. It was even later when some Asian <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> adopted the RIAA standard. In 1989, many Eastern European <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> and Russian <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> such as Melodiya were still using their own CCIR equalization. Hence the RIAA curve did not truly become a global standard until the late 1980s.|$|R

5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent <b>record</b> <b>labels.</b> Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by <b>record</b> <b>labels.</b> David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E

50|$|The Futureheads {{set up this}} <b>record</b> <b>label</b> {{some time}} after they split with their former <b>record</b> <b>label</b> 679 Recordings in late 2006, {{apparently}} disliking the direction they were taking them.
