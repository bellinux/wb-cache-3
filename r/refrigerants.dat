5|$|Carbon {{occurs in}} all known organic life {{and is the}} basis of organic chemistry. When united with hydrogen, it forms various {{hydrocarbons}} that are important to industry as <b>refrigerants,</b> lubricants, solvents, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of plastics and petrochemicals, and as fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} <b>refrigerants.</b> In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Halogenated <b>refrigerants,</b> termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as <b>refrigerants,</b> electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
25|$|An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{waste heat}} {{recovery}} unit can be more efficient at low temperature range using <b>refrigerants</b> that boil at lower temperatures than water. Typical organic <b>refrigerants</b> are ammonia, pentafluoropropane (R-245fa and R-245ca), and toluene.|$|E

50|$|Variable <b>refrigerant</b> flow (VRF), {{also known}} as {{variable}} <b>refrigerant</b> volume (VRV), is an HVAC technology invented in 1982.

25|$|The {{absorption}} {{cycle is}} similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the <b>refrigerant</b> vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the <b>refrigerant</b> in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the <b>refrigerant</b> vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of <b>refrigerant,</b> it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of <b>refrigerant</b> and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (<b>refrigerant)</b> with water (absorbent), and water (<b>refrigerant)</b> with lithium bromide (absorbent).|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{concerns}} {{developed over}} the role chlorofluorocarbons play in damaging the ozone layer. By 1996, almost all nations had banned chlorofluorocarbon <b>refrigerants</b> and commercial production ceased. Fluorine continued {{to play a role}} in refrigeration though: hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were developed as replacement <b>refrigerants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until the 1990s, the <b>refrigerants</b> {{were often}} {{chlorofluorocarbons}} such as R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), {{one in a}} class of several <b>refrigerants</b> using the brand name Freon, a trademark of DuPont. Its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987 because of the damage that CFCs cause to the ozone layer if released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, the DuPont company commercialized organofluorine {{compounds}} {{at large}} scales. Following trials of chlorofluorcarbons as <b>refrigerants</b> {{by researchers at}} General Motors, DuPont developed large-scale production of Freon-12. DuPont and GM formed a joint venture in 1930 to market the new product; in 1949 DuPont took over the business. Freon {{proved to be a}} marketplace hit, rapidly replacing earlier, more toxic, <b>refrigerants</b> and growing the overall market for kitchen refrigerators.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} an experimental study on a freezer which has small cooling capacity. Typically a freezer uses primary <b>refrigerant</b> (direct cooling) to cool or freeze a product. In this study, {{a prototype of}} freezer using a compressor 250 W nominal power at 220 V was designed and constructed. The freezer is operated on two conditions, that is, using primary and secondary <b>refrigerant.</b> R 22 and R 290 (propane) were used as primary <b>refrigerant,</b> whereas aqueous solution of propylene glycol as secondary <b>refrigerant.</b> Comparison of the system performance between the primary and the secondary <b>refrigerant</b> werepresented. Also, the experimental {{results showed that the}} use of R 290 as primary <b>refrigerant</b> to replace R 22 in the freezer could save electrical power consumption by 18. 5 %. Meanwhile, the use of the secondary <b>refrigerant</b> yielded energy savings by 33. 19 % compared with the primary <b>refrigerant...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Refrigerant</b> {{may also}} explain flash-gas occurrence. When a system lacks <b>refrigerant,</b> {{or has a}} leakage, it may exhibit flash-gas as the volume in the piping exceeds the {{capacity}} of the <b>refrigerant</b> to fill it as liquid. This may force the <b>refrigerant</b> into a phase change. On the other hand, lack of <b>refrigerant</b> can sometimes also produce the opposite effect: an overall increase on the subcooling (and superheating) which will depend on the size and design of the system and its piping. If the system’s <b>refrigerant</b> is degenerate, flash-gas may also be produced, as physical properties of the fluid change. This happens because the piping is designed for a specific <b>refrigerant</b> mixture that allows liquid in the liquid line, given certain thermodynamic conditions. If the <b>refrigerant</b> mixture changes its composition considerably, the original designs will not be adequate. Degenerated <b>refrigerant</b> produced by leakage, chemical decomposition or loading with gas when using a glided refrigerant; will most likely make the system perform very poorly, alter oil’s circulation or composition, and may eventually render gear inoperative.|$|R

40|$|The {{off-cycle}} <b>refrigerant</b> {{mass migration}} {{has a direct}} influence on the on-cycle performance since compressor energy is necessary to redistribute the <b>refrigerant</b> mass. No studies, as of today, {{are available in the}} open literature which experimentally measured the lubricant migration within a refrigeration system during cycling or stop/start transients. Therefore, experimental procedures measuring the <b>refrigerant</b> and lubricant migration through the major components of a refrigeration system during stop/start transients were developed and implemented. Results identifying the underlying physics are presented. The <b>refrigerant</b> and lubricant migration of an R 134 a automotive A/C system-utilizing a fixed orifice tube, minichannel condenser, plate and fin evaporator, U-tube type accumulator and fixed displacement compressor-was measured across five sections divided by ball valves. Using the Quick-Closing Valve Technique (QCVT) combined with the Remove and Weigh Technique (RWT) using liquid nitrogen as the condensing agent resulted in a measurement uncertainty of 0. 4 percent regarding the total <b>refrigerant</b> mass in the system. The determination of the lubricant mass distribution was achieved by employing three different techniques-Remove and Weigh, Mix and Sample, and Flushing. To employ the Mix and Sample Technique a device-called the Mix and Sample Device-was built. A method to separate the <b>refrigerant</b> and lubricant was developed with an accuracy-after separation-of 0. 04 grams of <b>refrigerant</b> left in the lubricant. When applying the three techniques, the total amount of lubricant mass in the system was determined to within two percent. The combination of measurement results-infrared photography and high speed and real time videography-provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of <b>refrigerant</b> and lubricant migration during stop-start operation. During the compressor stop period, the primary <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration is caused by, and follows, the diminishing pressure difference across the expansion device. The secondary <b>refrigerant</b> migration is caused by a pressure gradient as a result of thermal nonequilibrium within the system and causes only vapor phase <b>refrigerant</b> migration. Lubricant migration is proportional to the <b>refrigerant</b> mass during the primary <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration. During the secondary <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration lubricant is not migrating. The start-up <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration is caused by an imbalance of the <b>refrigerant</b> mass flow rates across the compressor and expansion device. The higher compressor <b>refrigerant</b> mass flow rate was a result of the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator. The lubricant mass migration during the start-up was not proportional to the <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration. The presence of water condensate on the evaporator affected the <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration during the compressor stop period. Caused by an evaporative cooling effect the evaporator held 56 percent of the total <b>refrigerant</b> mass in the system after three minutes of compressor stop time-compared to 25 percent when no water condensate was present on the evaporator coil. Foam entrainment led to a faster lubricant and <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration out of the accumulator than liquid entrainment through the hole {{at the bottom of the}} U-tube. The latter was observed for when water condensate was present on the evaporator coil because-as a result of the higher amount of <b>refrigerant</b> mass in the evaporator before start-up-the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator ceased before the steady state <b>refrigerant</b> mass distribution was reached...|$|R
50|$|Regeneration: The refrigerant-saturated {{liquid is}} heated, causing the <b>refrigerant</b> to {{evaporate}} out.
