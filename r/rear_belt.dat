500|$|The {{production}} crew took several steps to differentiate the alternate universe {{from the original}} one. In addition {{to the absence of}} a counselor, a [...] "military log" [...] was substituted for a captain's log and a [...] "combat date" [...] was used rather than stardate. The expanded budget allowed the bridge to be entirely redressed, something that would normally be infeasible. Steps replaced ramps on the bridge, and the captain's chair was elevated and made more throne-like. Longer, spartan tables were also substituted for the usual decor in the Ten-Forward lounge. While enlisted crew aboard the darker Enterprise wore variations of the Season 1–2 uniforms, the senior officers wore slightly modified versions of the uniforms introduced in Season 3. The Enterprise-C officers wore costumes from earlier Star Trek feature films due to the expense and time-consuming nature of creating more than a half-dozen or so new uniforms for the episode. Costume designer Robert Blackman's solution to change their appearance was to remove the turtleneck collars underneath the red tunics, as well as the belts, although the <b>rear</b> <b>belt</b> loop remained.|$|E
5000|$|... 4) Since {{the late}} Pliocene, {{the style and}} {{composition}} of volcanism in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt became more diverse. In several areas, volumetrically dominant calc-alkaline rocks are associated with modest volumes of intraplate-like lavas or other potassium rich rocks, accompanied by Quaternary rhyolitic peralkaline rocks. This modern arc consists of a frontal belt dominated by flux and slab melting and a <b>rear</b> <b>belt</b> characterized by the differentiated rocks stated previously. Absent since ~9 Ma, stratovolcanoes began to be created in the last 1 Ma ~100 km behind the volcanic front in the Western Sector, oriented West - Northwest and East - Southeast. In the eastern sector, all stratovolcanoes are found within the volcanic front. One exception {{to the location of}} these stratovolcanoes is the Colima volcanic complex, which is positioned south of the southern tip of the Cocos and Rivera slab tear and is the largest volcanic edifice in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. In addition to stratovolcanoes, monogenetic volcanic fields are also characteristic for this episode, the most prominent being the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} seat belt laws and public {{education}} campaigns on seat belt use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on seat belt use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater seat belt usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to <b>rear</b> seat <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory seat belt use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of seat <b>belt</b> use among <b>rear</b> seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when <b>rear</b> seat <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after <b>rear</b> seat <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of <b>rear</b> seat <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of <b>rear</b> seat <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the <b>rear</b> seat <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported seat <b>belt</b> usage by <b>rear</b> passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine seat belt use. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{study was conducted}} through the analysis of medical reports and crash data from real world accidents. The objective {{was to investigate the}} abdominal injury patterns among car occupants in frontal crashes. The influence of the type of restraint system, the occupant seat, the age and the crash severity was investigated. The results indicate that the risk of abdominal AIS 3 + injuries increased with crash severity and decreased with the introduction of <b>belt</b> retractors. <b>Rear</b> <b>belted</b> passengers were observed to be more likely injured than front belted occupants. The organs injured in frontal crashes for belted occupants were mainly hollow organs especially jejunum, ileum and mesentery...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the use of}} {{seat belts}} for front seat {{passengers}} was made compulsory in 1975, and on April 1 st 1992 the use of <b>rear</b> seat <b>belts,</b> if fitted, became a legal requirement. Since 1968, an annual survey of the presence and use of seat belts on front seats - extended in 1989 to include rear seats - has been conducted in the Netherlands. An evaluation of compliance with the law stipulating the use of <b>rear</b> seat <b>belts</b> was conducted by comparing the observation and surveys carried out in October 1992 and 1991. A significant rise {{in the use of}} <b>rear</b> seat <b>belts,</b> when fitted, was found: from 15 to 31 % in built-up areas and from 12 to 37 % on rural roads. For front seat belts, a small increase was found on town roads, from 62 % to 66 %, while on rural roads the percentage was around 80 % in both years. It was calculated that the use of front and <b>rear</b> seat <b>belts</b> has a great growth potential. It is recommended that information campaigns should promote 'social persuasion', with emphasis on the increased risk of injury sustained by a non-belted occupant and the risk of having a proportion of the damage compensation withheld by the insurance company. In addition, the non-user can inflict injury on other belted occupants, and can therefore be sued for damages either by the victims or by their insurance company. Intensive police enforcement combined with public information sustained over several weeks, followed by a period of enforcement at a lower level of intensity can lead to an increased use of seat belts through habituation...|$|R
