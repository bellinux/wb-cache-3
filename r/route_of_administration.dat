25|$|The {{drug form}} varies by the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the topical <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> sometimes states that both the application location and the pharmacodynamic effect thereof is local.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotal {{reports have}} {{provided}} some information on patterns of methcathinone use. The most common <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> is via nasal insufflation (snorting). Other routes of administration include per os, IV injection and smoking.|$|E

25|$|If defined {{strictly}} {{as having}} local effect, the topical <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> can also include enteral administration of medications that are poorly absorbable by the gastrointestinal tract. One poorly absorbable antibiotic is vancomycin, which is recommended by mouth {{as a treatment}} for severe Clostridium difficile colitis.|$|E
25|$|Intravaginal {{administration}} is a <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> where the substance {{is applied to}} the inside of the vagina. Pharmacologically, it has the potential advantage to result in effects primarily in the vagina or nearby structures (such as the vaginal portion of cervix) with limited systemic adverse effects compared to other routes of administration.|$|E

25|$|Pharmacy {{compounding}} is {{yet another}} application of personalised medicine. Though not necessarily utilizing genetic information, the customized production of a drug whose various properties (e.g. dose level, ingredient selection, <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> etc.) are selected and crafted for an individual patient is accepted as an area of personalised medicine (in contrast to mass-produced unit doses or fixed-dose combinations).|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of progesterone {{are dependent}} on its <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> The drug is approved {{in the form of}} oil-filled capsules containing micronized progesterone for oral administration, termed oral micronized progesterone or OMP. It is also available in the form of vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, topical creams and gels, oil solutions for intramuscular injection, and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection.|$|E
25|$|Oral steroids such as {{prednisolone}} {{are commonly}} used; however, side effects are common, {{and the horse}} may be predisposed to laminitis. Therefore, the use of aerosolised steroids via an equine inhaler are becoming more common. This <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> reduces the dose required, {{and the risk of}} side effects. Originally, beclomethasone was used, but newer compounds are available now, such as fluticasone propionate.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in the <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> including intravenous (into the blood through a vein) and oral administration (through the mouth).|$|R
5000|$|In vivo [...] {{delivery}} of ddRNAi constructs {{has been demonstrated}} using a range of vectors and reagents with different <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> (ROA).|$|R
25|$|Medications may {{be mixed}} into the fluids {{mentioned}} above. Compared with other <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> such as oral medications, the intravenous route {{is the fastest}} way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body. The bioavailability of the IV medication is 100%, unlike oral medications where much of the medication is lost in digestion before entering circulation. Certain types of medications can only be given intravenously, such as when there is insufficient uptake by other <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> such as enterally. Examples include intravenous immunoglobulin and propofol.|$|R
25|$|A study {{performed}} by Maclean and colleagues introduced pure vaporized salvinorin-A to four subjects demonstrated a {{relative lack of}} dysphoric effects and increased presence of dose-related positive effects that contrasts with previous research with kappa agonists such as enadoline, as well as Salvia Divinorum itself. However, this {{could be due to}} the small sample size, the relative psychedelic experience of the subjects, or the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Research is {{underway}} {{to determine if}} risks of estrogen supplement use are {{the same for all}} methods of delivery. In particular, estrogen applied topically may have a different spectrum of side-effects than when administered orally, and transdermal estrogens do not affect clotting as they are absorbed directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver. This <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> is thus preferred in women with a history of thrombo-embolic disease.|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine may be quantitated {{in blood}} or urine to monitor use or abuse, confirm a {{diagnosis}} of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal investigation. There is a significant overlap of drug concentrations in body fluids within the possible spectrum of physiological reactions ranging from asymptomatic to comatose. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} have knowledge of both the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> of the drug and the level of tolerance to opioids of the individual when results are interpreted.|$|E
50|$|Among the <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> the {{preferred}} means of nutrition is, if possible, oral administration. Alternatives include enteral administration (in nasogastric feeding) and intravenous (in parenteral nutrition).|$|R

50|$|Alternative <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> like suppository, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol, transdermal and sublingual {{avoid the}} first-pass effect because they allow drugs {{to be absorbed}} {{directly}} into the systemic circulation.|$|R
25|$|Codeine is {{currently}} {{the most widely used}} opiate in the world, {{and is one of the}} most commonly used drugs overall according to numerous reports by organizations including the World Health Organization and its League of Nations predecessor agency. It is one of the most effective orally administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin. Its strength ranges from 8% to 12% of morphine in most people; differences in metabolism can change this figure as can other medications, depending on its <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|A three-month {{trial of}} an oral dosage regime of a {{commercial}} preparation of glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane was performed in veteran horses with no effect on gait stiffness, with exercise alone {{in the control group}} being effective. The intravenous use of a combination of N-acetylglucosamine, pentosan polysulfate and sodium hyaluronate in horses with surgically-induced osteoarthritis saw improvements in xray changes to the cartilage but not histologically or in biochemical outcomes, suggesting more evidence is needed for this combination and <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sublingual region {{underneath}} {{the front of}} the tongue is an ideal location for the administration of certain medications into the body. The oral mucosa is very thin {{underneath the}} tongue, and is underlain by a plexus of veins. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. This is the only convenient and efficacious <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> (apart from Intravenous therapy) of nitroglycerin to a patient suffering chest pain from angina pectoris.|$|E
50|$|The <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> vary. They may be both {{systemic}} and topical. For example, pseudoephedrine {{is taken}} orally and phenylephrine is topically {{applied to the}} nasal passages or eyes.|$|R
40|$|Literature {{suggests}} that young adult prescription opioid misusers {{who are using}} alternate <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> (e. g., snorting, injecting) may be engaging in sexual and non-sexual HIV risk behaviors. This study examines demographics, substance use, sexual risk behavior, and health and social problems associated with alternate <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> prescription opioids among a sample of young adult prescription opioid misusers. Data are drawn from baseline assessments from a behavioral intervention trial. Eligible participants were ages 18 – 39, and reported recent (past 90 days) heterosexual sex, and recent and regular substance use and attendance at large, recognized local nightclubs. The analyses include 446 racially/ethnically diverse participants. In bivariate regression models, {{compared to those who}} did not, participants reporting alternate <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> (n = 209) {{were more likely to be}} White (p 3 ̆c 0. 025) and report group sex participation history (p = 0. 002), sex with an injection drug user (p = 0. 003), sexual victimization history (p = 0. 003), and severe mental distress (p 3 ̆c 0. 000). White race, group sex participation history, and severe mental distress remained significant in the multivariate model. Alternate <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> prescription opioids are associated with sexual HIV transmission risk behaviors. Early prevention and intervention efforts that address sexual and non-sexual HIV risk behaviors are warranted...|$|R

25|$|Prescription misuse {{has been}} defined {{differently}} and rather inconsistently based on status of drug prescription, the uses without a prescription, intentional use to achieve intoxicating effects, <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> co-ingestion with alcohol, and {{the presence or absence}} of dependence symptoms. Chronic use of certain substances leads to a change in the central nervous system known as a 'tolerance' to the medicine such that more of the substance is needed in order to produce desired effects. With some substances, stopping or reducing use can cause withdrawal symptoms to occur, but this is highly dependent on the specific substance in question.|$|E
25|$|With {{time as a}} {{critical}} aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration. Pharmacokinetics is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> absorption, distribution and metabolism of the medication. A common <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug {{must be able to}} get to the stomach and stay there. In cases of vomiting and nausea this method of administration is not an option. Suppositories can, in some situations, be administered instead. Medication can also be administered through intramuscular injection, or through intravenous injection. The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug solubility, gastrointestinal motility and pH. If a medication is administered orally the amount of food in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption. Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the blood–brain barrier to the brain. With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly. Antipsychotics, especially Haloperidol, as well as assorted benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{drugs can}} produce {{different}} results {{depending on the}} <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration. This can be illustrated {{by the action of}} naloxone (Narcan), an antagonist of opiates such as morphine. Naloxone counteracts opiate action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the opiate.|$|E
40|$|Buprenorphine is {{a potent}} opioid {{analgesic}} used {{in the treatment of}} moderate to severe pain. At higher doses, it has demonstrated potential for treating heroin dependence. This study was undertaken to investigate buprenorphine pharmacokinetics by different <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> at dosages approximating those used in opioid-dependence studies. Six healthy men who were nondependent but who had a history of heroin use were administered buprenorphine in a crossover design study by intravenous (1. 2 rag), sublingual (4. 0 rag), and buccal (4. 0 rag) <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> Plasma samples were collected up to 96 h and assayed for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine by negative chemical ionization tandem mass pectrometry. Plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were analyzed by nonlinear egression analysis with standard noncompartmental methods. Buprenorphine bioavailability by the sublingual and buccal routes was estimated as 51. 4 % and 27. 8 %, respectively, although there was considerable interindividual variability by both <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> The terminal elimination half-lives were longer for the sublingual and buccal routes than for the intravenous route. The extended elimination half-lives may be due to a shallow depot effect involving sequestration of buprenorphine in the oral mucosa. Norbuprenorphine mean peak plasma concentrations were l ss than 1 ng/mL and were highly variable among different <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> and individuals. The terminal elimination half-life of norbuprenorphine was longer than buprenorphine...|$|R
50|$|Different <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> {{estradiol}} produce different {{effects in}} the body {{due to differences in}} the amount of estradiol that is exposed to the intestines and liver as well as different levels of estradiol produced. Oral preparations are not necessarily predictably absorbed, and are subject to a first-pass through the liver, where they can be metabolized, and also initiate unwanted side effects. Therefore, alternative <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> that bypass the liver before primary target organs are hit have also been developed. Parenteral routes including transdermal, vaginal, sublingual, intranasal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous are not subject to the initial liver passage.|$|R
40|$|Although off-label, {{subcutaneous}} (SC) antibiotic {{administration is}} not infrequent, particularly among geriatric and palliative-care patients for whom other <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> are difficult to establish. Subcutaneous ceftriaxone is the most frequently prescribed antibiotic {{and it has been}} approved by some local committees given its favorable pharmacological parameters and relatively low subcutaneous toxicity. Yet pharmacologic and clinical data are lacking. No study has demonstrated non-inferiority <b>of</b> the subcutaneous <b>route</b> in comparison to other parenteral <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability <b>of</b> subcutaneous antibiotic <b>administration</b> given its frequent use in an aging population...|$|R
