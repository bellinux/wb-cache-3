As she began to fall from the first bullet, the second bullet struck her femur, shattering it and knocking her to the ground. Hasan walked up to Munley and kicked her pistol out of reach.|$|E
2500|$|With its {{distinctly}} modernist influence, {{the interior}} styling of the SM is {{as dramatic as}} the exterior. The small oval steering wheel is matched by oval gauges. The manual shift lever 'boot' is a highly stylized chrome gate. The seats are highly adjustable buckets with centre padding composed of many individual 'rolls'.

2500|$|The {{series is}} {{referenced}} in episodes of The Simpsons, primarily detailing the obsession Marge Simpson's sisters (Patty and Selma) {{have with the}} show and their crush on the MacGyver character. The sisters' regular viewing {{of the show is}} an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode [...] "Black Widower". The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village. ("Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.") In another episode, [...] "A Star is Burns", Homer tricks Jay Sherman into insulting MacGyver in front of Patty and Selma; Sherman ends up being hung from the <b>rain</b> <b>gutter</b> by his underpants, and Bart asks [...] "You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?" [...] Anderson himself is an avid fan of The Simpsons, and even provided his voice for an episode of the show titled [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore", which first aired April 9, 2006, where Patty and Selma kidnap Richard Dean Anderson after he admits that he never liked doing MacGyver and only did the show for the money, but eventually gets a thrill out of escaping and annoys them by wanting to do it again and again.|$|E
60|$|But {{now a new}} horror {{presented}} itself, and one indeed {{sufficient to}} startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the cruel pressure of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets. While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the <b>rain</b> <b>gutter</b> which ran along the eaves of the main building. The loss of the eye {{was not so much}} as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting. Such a winking and blinking were never before seen. This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. I was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose. I was presently relieved, however, by the dropping out of the other eye. In falling it took the same direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow. Both rolled out of the gutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them.|$|E
