50|$|In 2006, when high <b>roaming</b> <b>charge</b> rates persisted the Commission {{proposed}} {{to intervene in}} the market by setting maximum rates at which mobile network operators could charge their subscribers. The proposed regulation was approved by the European Parliament and by the Council of Ministers, and came into law in June 2007. It required capping of retail and wholesale voice roaming charges from 30 August 2007, unless a special roaming tariff applied. The maximum prices was set to decrease further in 2008 and 2009. The regulation also required that customers traveling to another member state would receive a text message of the charges that apply for roaming services. Originally the capping measures were introduced on a temporary basis and were due to expire on 30 June 2010.|$|E
40|$|This model {{discusses}} {{mobile network}} operators' (MNOs) incentives {{to invest in}} their network facilities such as new 4 G networks under various regimes of data <b>roaming</b> <b>charge</b> regulation. Given an induced externality of investments (spillovers) due to the roaming agreements it will be shown that MNOs, competing on investments, widely set higher investments for below cost regulation of roaming charges. Otherwise, if MNOs are free to collaborate on investments, they set higher investment levels for above cost roaming charges. Both below- and above cost charges may be preferred from a welfare perspective. Furthermore, the paper discusses e ects of the <b>roaming</b> <b>charge</b> regulation on roaming quality and MNOs' coverage...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a simple two-player game involving a large incumbent and small entrant into a cellular wireless access provider marketplace. The entrant's customers must pay roaming charges. We {{assume that the}} roaming charges are regulated, because if they are dictated by the incumbent then they could be set so high {{so as to be}} a barrier to entry in the marketplace. The game is studied at its Nash equilibrium. A <b>roaming</b> <b>charge</b> is identified that is arguably fair in the sense that revenues for the access providers are proportionate to their infrastructure costs...|$|E
50|$|Since 2007, the roaming {{regulations}} have steadily lowered the maximum <b>roaming</b> <b>charges</b> allowable.

40|$|With the {{acquisition}} of UMTS licenses Mobile Operators (MOs), have often been obliged to deploy 3 G network infrastructures covering at least a given percentage of users by a given date. This paper discusses the rationale for imposing these minimum coverage requirements by regulatory bodies. To that end, a model is built, which studies the incentives for MOs to compete for market share and over coverage within an unregulated environment where MOs {{are assumed to be}} free to enter sharing agreements and to negotiate a reciprocal <b>roaming</b> <b>charge.</b> Within this framework, it is first shown that MOs would deploy their infrastructure to guarantee the coverage of the entire territory (population), but they would avoid any network duplication in order to maximize rents from roaming revenues. It is then discussed whether a minimum coverage requirement is the best policy to reduce these excess rents, or whether alternative measures could be adopted which could serve other goals as well, such as the avoidance of network duplication.

50|$|While {{termination}} {{rates between}} fixed line telecommunication operators frequently amount {{to less than}} US$0.01, mobile termination charges can be significantly higher, especially for international calls. In Europe, the average termination charge for a call varies, ranging from less than 1ct in Austria and Cyprus to much higher charges in Bulgaria. This discrepancy in rates {{has been identified as}} a hindrance to competition among telecom providers in the European Union. Termination rates have also {{played a major role in}} recent regulation to cap the high cost of roaming in the European Union, where customers paid historically on average almost €1.50/minute in <b>roaming</b> <b>charges.</b> Ultimately, <b>roaming</b> <b>charges</b> have been capped at twice termination rates.|$|R
