For example, a greylister can require a successful delivery attempt against a registered triplet to be no earlier than 25 minutes after registration and not later than 4 hours after it. Repeated delivery attempts before the 25 minute period will be ignored with the same 4xx <b>reply</b> <b>code.</b> After 4 hours the triplet will be expired, so delivery attempts will register anew.

Discussion {{and suggestions for}} improvement are requested. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This memo defines a new Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [1] <b>reply</b> <b>code,</b> 521, which one may use to indicate that an Internet host does not accept incoming mail. 1. Motivations Hosts on the Internet have shifted from large, general-purpose hosts to smaller, more specialized hosts. There is {{an increasing number of}} hosts which are dedicated to specific tasks, such as serving NTP or DNS. These dedicated hosts frequently do not provide mail service. Usually, these mailless hosts do not run an SMTP server. Unfortunately, users will occasionally misaddress mail to these hosts. Regular SMTP clients attempting to deliver this misaddressed mail must treat the lack of an SMTP server on the host as a temporary error. They must queue the mail for later delivery, should an SMTP server be started at a later time. This causes the mail to remain queued for days, until it is returned with what is usually a confusing error message. 2. Two complementary solutions Two complementary solutions MAY be implemented to deal with this issue. The first one is to use MX relays to bounce misaddressed mails. The second one is to implement a minimal smtp server on the mailless host to bounce all mails. The choice between the two solutions is site dependent.

Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards " (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 1. Overview There currently is not a standard mechanism for the reporting of mail system errors except for the limited set offered by SMTP and the system specific text descriptions sent in mail messages. There is a pressing need for a rich machine readable status code for use in delivery status notifications [DSN]. This document proposes {{a new set of}} status codes for this purpose. SMTP [SMTP] error codes have historically been used for reporting mail system errors. Because of limitations in the SMTP code design, these are not suitable for use in delivery status notifications. SMTP provides about 12 useful codes for delivery reports. The majority of the codes are protocol specific response codes such as the 354 response to the SMTP data command. Each of the 12 useful codes are each overloaded to indicate several error conditions each. SMTP suffers some scars from history, most notably the unfortunate damage to the <b>reply</b> <b>code</b> extension mechanism by uncontrolled use. This proposal facilitates future extensibility by requiring the client to interpret unknown error codes according to the theory of codes while requiring servers to register new response codes. The SMTP theory of reply codes partitioned in the number space such a manner that the remaining available codes will not provide the space needed. The most critical example is the existence of only 5 remaining codes for mail system errors. The mail system classification includes both host and mailbox error conditions. The remaining third digit space would be completely consumed as needed to indicate MIME and media conversion errors and security system errors. A revision to the SMTP theory of reply codes to better distribute the error conditions in the number space will necessarily be incompatible with SMTP. Further, consumption of the remaining reply-code numbe...|$|E

40|$|Packet {{traces of}} {{operational}} Internet traffic are invaluable to network research, but public sharing of such traces is severely {{limited by the}} need to first remove all sensitive information. Current trace anonymization technology leaves only the packet headers intact, completely stripping the contents; to our knowledge, there are no publicly available traces of any significant size that contain packet payloads. We describe a new approach to transform and anonymize packet traces. Our tool provides high-level language support for packet transformation, allowing the user to write short policy scripts to express sophisticated trace transformations. The resulting scripts can anonymize both packet headers and payloads, and can perform application-level transformations such as editing HTTP or SMTP headers, replacing the content of Web items with MD 5 hashes, or altering filenames or <b>reply</b> <b>codes</b> that match given patterns.

Because individual cells behave as memory channels with Szil&# 225;rd engine attributes, these coding schemes also {{might be used}} to limit, diagnose, and correct mating-signal errors due to noisy intracellular information processing. The present study, therefore, assessed whether heterotrich ciliates effect fault-tolerant signal planning and execution by modifying engine performance, and consequently entropy content of codes, during mock cell-cell communication. Socially meaningful serial vibrations emitted from an ambiguous artificial source initiated ciliate behavioral signaling performances known to advertise mating fitness with varying courtship strategies. Microbes, employing calcium-dependent Hebbian-like decision making, learned to diagnose then correct error syndromes by recursively matching Boltzmann entropies between signal planning and execution stages via power or refrigeration cycles. All eight serial contraction and reversal strategies incurred errors in entropy magnitude by the execution stage of processing. Absolute errors, however, subtended expected threshold values for single bit-flip errors in three-bit <b>replies,</b> indicating <b>coding</b> schemes protected information content throughout signal production. Ciliate preparedness for vibrations selectively and significantly affected the magnitude and valence of Szil&# 225;rd engine performance during modal and nonmodal strategy corrective cycles. But entropy fidelity for all replies mainly improved across learning trials as refinements in engine efficiency. Fidelity neared maximum levels for only modal signals coded in resilient three-bit repetition error-correction sequences. Together, these findings demonstrate microbes can elevate survival/reproductive success by learning to implement classical fault-tolerant information processing in social contexts...|$|R

Research into these uses has focused on typically developing individuals; much less is known about the use of e-mail by exceptional youth. The present study examined the structure and form of e-mail messages sent by adolescents with and without a history of specific language impairment (SLI). Thirty-eight adolescents with a history of SLI and 56 typically developing (TD) peers were assessed on measures of nonverbal abilities, core language skills and literacy skills (reading and spelling). The participants were asked to compose an e-mail reply to a standard e-mail sent by an experimenter. These <b>reply</b> e-mails were <b>coded</b> for linguistic structure, readability and spelling errors. Two adult raters, blind to the participants’ language ability, judged how understandable the e-mails were, how grammatically correct the e-mails were, and also the sender's command of the English language. Adolescents with a history of SLI produced e-mails that were similar to those sent by their TD peers in terms of structure and readability. However, they made significantly more spelling errors. Furthermore, the adult raters considered the messages from participants with a history of SLI to be of poorer standard than those sent by their TD peers. Conclusions & Implications: The findings suggest that the e-mail messages of adolescents with a history of SLI provide indicators of the sender's language and literacy skills.

40|$|Background: There is no {{functional}} {{pharmacovigilance system}} in Cambodia to our knowledge. Mobile phone-based tools, such as {{short message service}} (SMS) text messages, are increasingly used for surveillance purposes. Objective: To pilot-test the FrontlineSMS mobile phone-based tool for notification of adverse events, using Cambodia's only International Vaccination Center at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge as a field site. Methods: People receiving vaccinations, aged over 18 years, and who owned a cell phone were recruited in the study following informed consent. The names and mobile phone numbers of the participants interviewed were entered each day into the FrontlineSMS software. Two days after being vaccinated, participants received an automatically generated SMS text message asking whether any adverse events had occurred. Their SMS reply was number-coded and exported from the software daily to an Excel spreadsheet and examined before being saved. If the participant <b>replied</b> with a <b>code</b> for a severe adverse event (8 or 9), they were automatically advised to consult the nearest doctor. Results: The active surveillance study was conducted over 72 days {{in the spring of}} 2012. Patients agreed to be asked by SMS text message whether unwanted events had occurred after vaccination. Of 1331 persons aged over 18 years referred to the vaccination unit, 184 (13. 8 %) were asked and agreed to participate. When texted for clinical status 48 hours after vaccination, 52 (28. 3 %) participants did not reply, 101 (54. 9 %) sent an immediate SMS reply, and 31 (16. 8 %) sent an SMS reply after additional prompting. Of the initial 184 participants, 132 (71. 7 %) replied. These 132 participants received 135 vaccine doses and 109 (82. 6 %) reported no adverse events, whereas 23 (17. 4 %) reported adverse events, all benign. Conclusions: Notification using an SMS-based text message system is already used in Cambodia for syndromic surveillance in health centers and reporting by health care workers. Our results show that such tools can also be useful for notification by patients or health users in Cambodia, especially in an urban setting. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
