I'm not sartain that I could hold the lumber, even after I got it into the river; for a <b>replevy</b> is a formidable thing in law, I can tell you. One pound sixteen, one-third store-pay, is the utmost farthin' I can offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Suppose so many {{cattle in}} such a pound, and one goes by whose they are not, doth he concern himself? No; he beholds them, and goes his way. But suppose that at his return he should find his own cattle in that pound, would he now carry it toward them as he did unto the other? No, no; he has {{interest}} here, they are his {{that are in the}} pound; now he is concerned, now he must know who put them there, and for what cause too they are served as they are; and if he finds them rightfully there, he will fetch them by ransom; but if wrongfully, he will replevy7 them, and stand a trial at law with him that has thus illegally pounded his cattle. And thus it is betwixt Jesus Christ and his. He is interested in them; the cattle are his own, [...] "his own sheep," [...] (John 10:3,4), but pounded by some other, by the law, or by the devil. If pounded by the law, he delivereth them by ransom; if pounded by the devil, he will <b>replevy</b> them, stand a trial at law for them, and will be, against their accuser, their Advocate himself. Nor can Satan withstand his plea, though he should against them join argument with the law; forasmuch, as has been proved before, he can and will, by what he has to produce and plead of his own, save his from all trespasses, charges, and accusations. Besides, all men know that a man's proper goods are not therefore forfeited, because they commit many, and them too great transgressions-"And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." [...] Now, the strength of this plea thus grounded upon Christ's interest in his people is great, and hath many weighty reasons on its side; as- ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the common}} opinion, the {{provision}} for the immediate acquisition contributes entirely {{to the security of}} transactions. Therefore, both lost and stolen goods which are excluded as the exceptions to the acquisition should be understood as narrowly as possible. But the opinion seems to me to fail to explain why the goods which were swindled or put in charge can not be the exceptions. It is not always true that those who lost their properties or had them stolen were not careless, on the other hand, those who suffered damage from conversions or frauds were careless. So, my conclusion is that all properties which got out of the control of an owner against his will should be <b>replevied.</b> The immediate acquisition is a rule of the presumption of ownership for the presentpossessor, but not a rule of the investment of ownership...|$|R
50|$|In other cases, <b>replevy</b> is used {{to prevent}} damages that may occur from the {{continued}} use of an item, such as a public utility meter. In the case of non-payment of a public utility, a meter is typically left on the premise to allow reconnection should the balance due be paid, or if the person owing the bill sells the premise to another person who does not owe arrears to the utility, however, {{it is possible for}} one to reconnect the device and continue obtaining the commodity in question. In such cases, the utility could seek replevin for the utility meter itself, thereby preventing this practice.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1899 case McGregor v. McGregor, [...] British Columbia Supreme Court justice Irving wrote: “An {{action of}} {{replevin}} may be brought (1) where goods have been wrongfully distrained or (2) where goods have been otherwise, i.e. otherwise than by distress, wrongfully taken or detained. The word ‘wrongfully’ is applicable to both cases. ‘Wrongfully’ ... imports the infringement of some right, and any invasion {{of the civil rights}} of another is in itself a legal wrong, and the appropriate action for the violation of the legal right unconnected with contract is an action for tort. The early history of replevin action in England is traced (as) ... ‘The nature of the complaint in the action was for a tortious taking of the goods. Our British Columbia replevin action, which is wider than the English, gives the right to <b>replevy</b> to the party who could maintain trespass or trover. It is given, as it were, supplementary to, or in aid of, the remedy which those actions afford; but as all three actions, trespass, trover and replevin are classed... as actions of tort, I think the action under our British Columbia statute is for the tortious taking or tortious detention of goods.” ...|$|E

40|$|De acuerdo con Foucault, Kant estableció la misión del filosofar como ontología del presente, sin embargo, al aplicar las lecciones a nuestra era, todo parece indicar que deberíamos abandonar sus aseveraciones llenos de esperanza en la gradual ilustración moral y política de la especie humana, y concluir, con Benjamin, en honor a la memoria de los vencidos, que “cada acto de la civilización es un acto de la barbarie”. O tal vez la distancia entre la escatología racionalista del filósofo de Könisgberg y el {{memorial}} agonista del pensador de Berlín, no es tan amplia, ya que en ambos casos se intenta reivindicar la dignidad humana, en Kant, para que ésta sea posible, en Benjamin para que la indignidad no se repita. //// According to Foucault, Kant {{established the}} mission of philosophizing as ontology of the present, however when applying the lessons to our era everything {{seems to indicate that}} we should abandon his announcements full of hope on the gradual moral and political illustration of human kind and conclude, with Benjamin, after the memory of the defeated that “every act of civilization is an act of barbarity”. Or perhaps the distance between the rationalist scatology of the philosopher of Könisgsberg and the agonistic memorial of the thinker of Berlin is not so large, since in both cases they intend to <b>replevy</b> human dignity, in Kant for the sake of making it possible, in Benjamin for the indignity not to be repeated...|$|E
