In the days of KCN Gowda the infrastructural facilities were not so good and there was struggle for shaping good quality films. For producing color films the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> was not available. Using his strength he was responsible in importing <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> for color film production directly from foreign countries. He took challenges to boost up the quality of films in the Kannada Film Industry.|$|R
50|$|During {{continuous}} contact printing, the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> and {{the negative}} are placed next to one another around the sprocket wheel of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the sprocket wheel (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and cellulose diacetate stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.|$|R

50|$|Adhesives are {{typically}} {{organized by the}} method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden.

5000|$|This {{process begins}} with <b>raw</b> <b>stock,</b> known as billet, and cuts it very roughly to {{shape of the}} final model. In milling, the result often gives the {{appearance}} of terraces, because the strategy has {{taken advantage of the}} ability to cut the model horizontally. Common strategies are zig-zag clearing, offset clearing, plunge roughing, rest-roughing.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} {{to bring the}} tool in rapidly to a [...] "safe" [...] point that {{is close to the}} part—in this case 0.1" [...] away—and then start feeding the tool.

50|$|Visible ink is {{sometimes}} utilized to imprint {{on the edge}} of the film - again in manufacturing - at the time of perforations. The ink, which is not affected by photographic chemicals, is normally printed onto the base surface of the film. The numbers are visible on both the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> (unexposed) and processed (exposed and developed) film. This method is primarily utilized for black & white negative film.|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} scenarios {{in which the}} main cutting function can be called. In every run, one of these cases occurs. The first case is when the free space {{is equal to the}} <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> (W,L) size. From the second iteration and after the cutting procedure, there will be two remainder strips from the stock. The width and length of the upper strip are represented by WRS and LRS, respectively. In every cycle, newly generated strips are placed {{on the top of the}} stack, which forms the second scenario. Conversely, the lower strips are used to produce new items in the third scenario. They will be used until there are no more feasible cuts, which lead to waste items. Then, the control flow will change to the stack items and the pop function will be called. The cutting algorithm continues to run until the control flow reaches the waste items. In a situation where there are no strips and the stack is empty, a new <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> will be used. The above algorithm has been implemented using the C++ language.|$|R
40|$|A new {{methodology}} for interfacing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) based on automatic feature recognition is {{proposed in the}} domain of complex rotationally symmetric parts. The interface system consists of three stages: (1) Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) data translation, (2) polygonal decomposition or splitting, (3) automatic recognition of precedences and features. In the data translation stage, IGES data are transformed to multi-sectional chains of the upperhalf profile of a part and a <b>raw</b> <b>stock.</b> For the <b>raw</b> <b>stock,</b> not only a box shape but the non-rectangular one is also considered. In the polygonal decomposition stage, the removal volume is decomposed into a data structure of a Pseudo-polygon (Pgon). The Pgon data structure based on the surface classification (real, virtual, partial, and embedded) is suggested as a new feature representation scheme. In the automatic recognition stage, the geometric precedence relationship between Pgons is automatically recognized, and then structured globally into a precedence tree form. The feature class and instances are automatically identified from the decomposed Pgons. close 91...|$|R
