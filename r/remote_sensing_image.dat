However, many researchers cannot find and access the ap-propriate <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>images</b> as they needed. In this paper, we proposed an effective approach to integrate {{and share the}} image resources over the Web. Firstly, the image metadata are exposed based on Grid services and the standard metadata specification; secondly, Agent service is introduced to discover and invoke the metadata services dynamically; thirdly, researchers can query and browse or locate the <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>images</b> through the service interface.

In this paper, based on pre-existing web release system, a security web release and visualization scheme of <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>images</b> is proposed. Firstly, user permission control {{is used to}} ensure that users with different permission obtain different quality levels images as well as different images processing function and operating function in Web release system. Secondly, the lightweight encryption method is introduced based {{on the characteristics of}} high-resolution <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>images</b> data and application requirements.

Additionally, the security stocking processing of <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>images</b> is introduced and three-dimensional exaggeration of post-security processing images is showed.

In a <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>image,</b> the pixel on the shady slope receives weak illumination and has a low radiance value, in contrast, the pixel on the sunny slope receives strong illumination and has a high radiance value. For the same object, the pixel radiance value on the shady slope will be different from that on the sunny slope. Additionally, different objects may have similar radiance values. These ambiguities seriously affected <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>image</b> information extraction accuracy in mountainous areas.

50|$|While artistic {{rendition}} lends to subjective {{expression of}} color, Andy Warhol (1928-1987) {{has become a}} culturally significant figure of the modern art movement by creating false color paintings with screen printing techniques. Some of Warhol's most recognizable prints include a replication of Marilyn Monroe, her image based on a film frame from the movie Niagara. The subject was a sex symbol and film noir starlet whose death in 1962 influenced the artist. A series of prints were made with endearment but expose her persona as an illusion through his assembly line style of art production which are non-erotic and slightly grotesque. Using various ink color palettes, Warhol immersed himself {{in a process of}} repetition that serves to compare personas and everyday objects to the qualities of mass production and consumerism. The colors of ink were selected through experimentation of aesthetics and do not correlate to false color rendering of the electromagnetic spectrum employed in <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>image</b> processing.

Funding has been an issue, but at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties-15 (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009, an accord was reached with a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010-2012. Significant work is underway on tools for use in monitoring developing country adherence to their agreed REDD targets. These tools, which rely on remote forest monitoring using satellite imagery and other data sources, include the Center for Global Development's FORMA (Forest Monitoring for Action) initiative [...] and the Group on Earth Observations' Forest Carbon Tracking Portal.
