5000|$|<b>Reprogenetics</b> {{is the use}} of {{reproductive}} and genetic technologies to select and genetically modify embryos with germinal choice technology for the purpose of human enhancement. However, a report by the Hastings Center broadly defined <b>reprogenetics</b> as any [...] "creation, use, manipulation, or storage of gametes or embryos". The term was coined by Lee M. Silver, a professor of molecular biology at Princeton University, in his 1997 book Remaking Eden.|$|E
5000|$|Eugenics {{would have}} {{required}} a continual selection for breeding of the [...] "fit", and a culling of the [...] "unfit" [...] while, according to bioethicist James Hughes, universal access to <b>reprogenetics</b> provided by a welfare state would permit the conversion of all the unfit to the highest genetic level. However, he shares Silver's concern that unequal access to <b>reprogenetics</b> could create a two-tiered society of [...] "GenRich" [...] and [...] "GenPoor", genetically engineered [...] "haves" [...] and [...] "have nots" [...] (see the film Gattaca for a fictional depiction of the latter scenario).|$|E

50|$|According to Silver, {{the main}} {{differences}} between <b>reprogenetics</b> and eugenics, {{the belief in}} the possibility of improving the gene pool which {{in the first half of}} the 20th century became infamous for the brutal policies it inspired, is that most eugenics programs were compulsory programs imposed upon citizens by governments trying to enact an ultimate goal.|$|E

5000|$|The other {{contrast}} {{is that it}} is now known [...] that the concept of genetic purity through eugenics is misguided: this form of genetic purity, insofar as it is meaningful, is effectively inbreeding and results in poor health and infertility while the end result of <b>reprogenetics</b> on the gene pool would be reduced incidence of genetic disease and potentially increased genetic IQ.|$|E
50|$|Silver is {{the author}} of the book Remaking Eden: How Genetic Engineering and Cloning Will Transform the American Family (1998). In the book he takes a {{positive}} view on human cloning, designer babies and similar prospects. In this book he coined the term <b>reprogenetics</b> to describe the prospective fusion of reproductive technologies and genetics, which will allow positive eugenic actions on an individual level.|$|E
5000|$|Skeptics [...] {{think the}} goal of using <b>reprogenetics</b> to {{increase}} genetic IQ is rendered less likely by the very great complexity of the genome with respect to intelligence (half of all genes are expressed somewhere in the brain), {{not to mention the}} environmental influences from conception to adulthood. Although {{research in the area of}} the inheritance of intelligence is still fairly contentious, these findings and others accumulating evidence give support to the idea that there is a finite number of genes that determine general intelligence, and not just separate genes determining individual intellectual capacities such as memory, spatial visualization or verbal skills.|$|E
50|$|In Silver's formulation, <b>reprogenetics</b> {{will involve}} {{advances}} {{in a number}} of technologies not yet achieved, but not inherently impossible. Among these are improvements in interpreting the effects of different expressions of DNA, the ability to harvest large numbers of embryos from females, and a far higher rate of reinsertion of embryos into host mothers. The end result, according to Silver, is that those parents who can afford {{it will be able to}} pick out the genetic characteristics of their own children, which Silver says will trigger a number of social changes in the decades after its implementation. Possible early applications, however, might be closer to eliminating disease genes passed on to children.|$|E
50|$|Liberal {{eugenics}} {{is known}} as new eugenics, consumer eugenics, <b>reprogenetics,</b> or ″designer progeny″. The connotations of liberal eugenics are negative due {{to the history of}} eugenics being associated with dark historical times. According to the Harvard Law Review, the eugenics of the early 20th century were part of a false scientific justification for racism, class-ism, and colonial subjugation falsely concerned with genetic fitness. The new model of eugenics of the 21st century, called liberal eugenics, allegedly advocates for genetic modification including the screening of genes that cause serious disabilities and engineering children to be born with more desirable physical and mental traits. Liberal eugenics is aimed at improving the genotypes of future generations through screening and genetic modification to eliminate undesirable traits.|$|E

In this project, I {{argue that we}} have yet to fully appreciate the political significance of assisted reproductive and genetic technologies. To draw out the political questions raised by <b>reprogenetics,</b> I turn to the phenomenological methods of Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger. Both Arendt and Heidegger's works offer a glimpse at a mode of political thinking that simultaneously resists the urge to master uncertainty {{at the same time it}} allows us to take our bearings in response to an ever-changing world. Insofar as the phenomenon of <b>reprogenetics</b> daily calls into question many of the conceptual distinctions upon which ethical thinking is based, <b>reprogenetics</b> requires that we learn to think without these inherited standards of judgment. Thus, while we need to guard against conservative attempts to stifle scientific progress, we also need to pay greater attention to the ways in which these technologies might alter how human beings think and act together in the public realm...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>reprogenetics</b> {{during the last}} two decades of the XX century has brought a new age of reproduction. The paper surveys different types of <b>reprogenetics</b> in a wider sense, i. e. different assisted reproductive technologies (ART) that include manipulation of female reproductive cell out of a woman's womb. Development of <b>reprogenetics</b> is documented by available quantitative indicators of the number and success of ART procedures in developed countries {{at the beginning of the}} XXI century. Since 1978, when the first baby was born from in vitro fertilization, the number of children born that way has reached 1 % of all children, and in some countries even over 3 %. Moreover, existing documentation is incomplete and does not include all forms of assisted reproduction - in reality, the importance of assisted reproduction is even higher and becomes demographically significant. Hence the paper indicates existing and potential effects of the ART development on the demographic development i. e. on specific demographic aspects of this phenomenon. It also points out the effects on the level of fertility, on the changes of direct fertility determinants, and on the levels of mortality and infant mortality, as well as a new understanding of birth control, the possibility of affecting biological structures, and the changes of the fundaments of marriage and family. Development perspectives of <b>reprogenetics</b> are also being raised in the context of bioethical discussions and indicate ethical dilemmas related to assisted reproduction. Solutions to the dilemmas define the scope of applying new reproductive technologies in the future...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT As {{a feminist}} {{updating}} of Foucauldian analysis, the article {{makes the point}} that ‘the lesbian ’ was not significantly exposed or seriously interpellated by Danish official discourse until the political debate on new reproductive technolo-gies and <b>reprogenetics</b> accelerated {{at the end of the}} 20 th century. In the 1990 s, the debate thus constructed ‘the lesbian ’ not only as an ‘unnatural mother’, but also as heiress to the monstrous figure of the ‘mad scientist ’ whose tampering with the embryo had stirred the political mind in the previous decade. Deeply worried by developments in biotechnology, many politicians felt they should protect the embryo from this sinister scientist, and, subsequently, the innocent child from the monstrous lesbian. Hence, a majority of MPs voted for excluding lesbians and single women from access to assisted reproduction in medical clinics. KEY WORDS child cultural imaginary embryo Foucault ‘mad scientist ’ monsters new reproductive technologies <b>reprogenetics</b> Seen in a historical perspective, lesbians are a very recent ‘invention ’ in official discourses in Denmark. The extreme marginality of ‘the homo-sexual woman ’ in medico-legal discourse has been repeatedly empha-sized by Karin Lützen, a prominent feminist researcher on the history of love between women (Bech and Lützen, 1986 : 113; Lützen, 1986). With ‘male homosexuality ’ as implicit norm, the figure of ‘the homosexual’ appeared as part of medico-legal discourses in Denmark in the late 19 th century (Lützen, 1987). These discourses zealously wove their webs of so-called ‘sexual perversions’, which at one and the same time stigmatized the figure of the gay man and brought him into visible social existence as a sexual subject. ‘The homosexual woman’, in contrast, led a shadowy half-life in these texts. Psychiatrists normally mentioned her only briefl...|$|E
40|$|This paper forms part of {{the feminist}} {{critique}} of the regulatory consequences of biomedicine’s systematic exclusion {{of the role of}} women’s bodies in the development of reprogenetic technologies. I suggest that strategic use of notions of the sacred to decontextualise and delimit disagreement fosters this marginalisation. Here conceptions of the sacred and sacralisation afford a means by which pragmatic consensus over regulation may be achieved, through the deployment of a bricolage of dense images associated with cultural loyalties to solidify support or exclude contradictory elements. Hence an explicit renegotiation of the symbolic order structuring salient debates is necessary to disrupt and enrich the entrenched and exclusionary dominant discourse over reprogenetic regulation. I draw upon previous analyses of strategic rhetoric associated with the regulation of infertility treatment and embryo research in the United Kingdom, the cultural anthropology of biomedicine and feminist ethnographies of <b>reprogenetics</b> to illustrate these claims...|$|E
30|$|In this regard, a {{specific}} project concerning education for bioethics was implemented, addressed to 9 th grade students (mean age 14) who frequented {{public education in}} all schools of the City of Porto, Portugal, in the academic years 2010 / 2011, 2011 / 2012 e 2012 / 2013. This project was born of a partnership between the Department of Bioethics of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, of the Portuguese Association of Bioethics and of the Porto City Council, having been enrolled all schools of the city. “Education for Values and Bioethics” is {{a specific}} training project which aims to help each youth build his/her personal ethics, {{not only in the}} perspective of the group to which he/she belongs, but in a wider form showing the surrounding world. Alerting the student to important ethical dilemmas such as end-of-life decisions, <b>reprogenetics,</b> environmental protection, gender stereotypes and discrimination, and to establish a link between the emergence of rights and correlative duties to those rights may contribute to the promotion of conscious, responsible and participatory citizens. Sensitize and educate the youths were also objectives of this project aiming their active participation in improving their ethical, social, emotional, cognitive and behavioural skills.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the scope and}} limits of reprogenetic choices - {{refering}} to reproductive applications of genetics made in the medical context - is adressed. Through posing four analytical questions concerning who should cecide about what in <b>reprogenetics</b> an analysis of possible answers is made. The method consists of an analysis of texts of ethicists Robertson, Strong, Davis, Murray, Peters and Buchanan et al, chosen to reflect a diversity concerning the scope of reproductive autonomy and what values {{that need to be}} taken into consideration. The most justified position found, concerning a possible policy of reprogenetic choices, is that there are several good reasons for leaving the reprogenetic choices with the parents, foremost since reproduction indeed is central to individuals identity, dignity and meaning of life. There are also good reasons to avoid governmental steering. This for instance since steering risks promoting perfectibilism, which would threaten human dignity. But also the reprogenetic choices cannot be left unrestricted. It is then argued that restrictions of parental reproductive autonomy should serve to protect the childs right to an open future, and that choices that reflect a search for perfectibilism should be cautioned. Autonomous reprogenetic choices should mean qualified choices - where relevant information is given and also an opportunity to make more than one choice is fostered...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{bioethics}} {{presents to}} us major challenges in several fields of knowledge. The ever-increasing technological power {{to interfere with}} the nature of things (including human nature) demands our increasing ethical awareness and considerations. How are we going to respond to these demands? Our proposal is to address this complex issue by revisiting one of the founding myths of Western civilization, that of Prometheus. Among numerous variations of this myth, we will address {{in the first part of}} the paper: Goethe’s poem “Prometheus” (1772), Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (1818), and Franz Kafka’s short piece entitled “Prometheus” (1918). Our understanding of this myth will help us to narrow the pathos involved in the current bioethical dilemmas and give us a chance to reflect on the scope of human actions in the fields of recent scientific-breakthroughs. In the second part of the paper we will consider the implications of the creative power involved in the process of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), which present a version of the post-modern Promethean challenge. The fast development of <b>reprogenetics</b> creates significant concerns dealing with the evolution of our human condition and the erosion of the foundations of the traditional family model. Through the analysis of certain scenarios, in which science, law, and ethics are intertwined, we will at the end revisit an etching of the Spanish painter Francisco Goya, “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters” (1799). The symbolism of Goya’s work is multiple, but we will explore the one most related to the complex relation between bioethics and biopolitics...|$|E
40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) {{is a technique}} associated with assisted reproduction (AR) which is the analysis of genetic material from pre-embryo {{in order to determine}} if it is free of genetic alterations and to transfer it to the uterus of the mother enabling the seed of a healthy baby. To do this project it has done a thorough search, searching many keywords in databases, bibliographic and webgraphy sources and consulting specialists in medical field. To complement the theoretical knowledge acquired stays were performed with Girofiv and <b>Reprogenetics</b> groups. PGD is a technique basically indicated in couples who have sex-linked diseases, monogenic diseases, the search of histocompatible siblings, in numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, in women who have had recurrent abortions or in patients over 35 years where the doctor can suspect the presence of genetic alterations in oocytes. To analyse these situations is usually provided genetic counselling by specialists where all possibilities available to patients are determined. In the PGD it is necessary to obtain oocytes, which are extracted from ovarian puncture with prior hormonal stimulation. Mature oocytes (either from the same patient or donor, which can be cryopreserved) are fertilized in vitro or by intracytoplasmic injection to get the pre-embryos, which are selected to extract one or more cells from a biopsy polar body, blastomere or trophectoderm. The extracted DNA from the cells is analysed by three techniques: PCR, FISH and CGH array. The legislation of this technique is highly influenced by ethical and religious issues. Spain is one of the countries of the European Union and the world that most uses the PGD techniques of RA, having a fairly permissive legislation, always validated by specialized committee. Other European countries have more or less restrictive legislation regarding this technique. Outside Europe, the developed countries which use the DGP usually do not have separate legislation for this technique, and they often regulate it by commissions or from what determines their religio...|$|E
40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Do {{external}} factors affect euploidy in egg donor cycles? SUMMARY ANSWER: The study demonstrates that during human assisted reproduction, embryonic chromosome abnormalities may be partly iatrogenic. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Chromosome abnormalities {{have been linked}} {{in the past to}} culture conditions such as temperature and Ph variations, as well as hormonal stimulation. Those reports were performed with older screening techniques (FISH), or ART methods no longer in use, and the subjects studied were not a homogeneous group. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 1645 donor oocyte cycles and 13 282 blastocyst biopsies from 42 fertility clinics were included in this retrospective cohort study. Samples from donor cycles with PGS attempted between September 2011 and July 2015 were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: PGS cycles from multiple fertility clinics referred to <b>Reprogenetics</b> (Livingston, NJ) that involved only oocyte donation were included in this study. Testing was performed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Ploidy data were analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models with logistic regression using a logit link function considering a number of variables that represent fixed and random effects. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Euploidy rate was associated with the referring center and independent of almost all the parameters examined except donor age and testing technology. Average euploidy rate per center ranged from 39. 5 to 82. 5 %. The mean expected rate of euploidy was 68. 4 %, but there are variations in this rate associated with the center effect. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data set does not include details of the donor selection process, donor race or ethnic origin, ovarian reserve or ovarian responsiveness. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, associations are apparent, however, causality cannot be established. Discrepancies in regard to completeness and homogeneity of data exist due to data collection from over 40 different clinics. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first study to show a strong association between center-specific ART treatment practices and the incidence of chromosome abnormality in human embryos, although the meiotic or mitotic origin of these abnormalities could not be determined using these technologies. Given the widespread applications of ART in both subfertile and fertile populations, our findings should be of interest to the medical community in general as well as the ART community in particular.
