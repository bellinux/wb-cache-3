5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> the concept at first. However, the games {{turned out to be}} a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

25|$|I {{see people}} who write {{characters}} who are loonies and make them convincing and believable, and I envy them tremendously. I don’t <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> them. It’s funny, because I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler.

Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept the help that Nancy, enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At the end of the play, rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land.|$|E
25|$|The French {{victory at}} the Battle of Wagram on 6 July forced the {{commander}} of the Kaiserlich-königliche Hauptarmee Hauptarmee, the main Austrian army, Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, to retreat. In spite of the defeat, the retreat was orderly and very well handled. The French, commanded by Napoleon I, were initially unsure about the exact direction, with reports saying that the Austrians were retreating towards Bohemia, but it was still unclear whether they would retreat using the road to Brünn or the road to Znaim. Other reports from, sent by General Louis-Pierre Montbrun were indicating that the Austrians were actually retreating towards Moravia. Masséna sent scouts towards Krems and the district of Horn and was able to ascertain that the enemy was not retreating in that direction, but he was unable to conclude where they would retreat. It thus took the French {{a few days after the}} battle of Wagram, before they could gather enough intelligence to <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> where the Austrians were going. However, by 8 July, things began to clarify for Napoleon, mainly due to intelligence sent by Auguste de Marmont, commander of XI Corps and the significance of a series of combats fought by elements of Masséna's Corps against the VI Korps under Klenau. These combats, fought at Korneuburg and Stocerau allowed Masséna to inform Napoleon that a large Austrian force was indeed retreating towards Bohemia.|$|E

500|$|Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh.

[...] Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as [...] "stubborn, brave, [...] non-girlie".|$|E
