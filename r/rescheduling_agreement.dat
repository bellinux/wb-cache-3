40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the inference {{about the risk of}} default is very important to the potential creditors in their lending decisions. In the literature, the usual used indicators of sovereign default in a given country (debtor) are either a <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement</b> between the debtor and the creditor or the presence of a credit from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The purpose of this note is to investigate an alternative indicator of a sovereign default that precedes the default itself, and thus could be seen as an early warning signal for policymakers. In this note, debtor countries are considered “defaulted” on sovereign debt if they have a debt <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement</b> with at least one creditor. To address our research question, a panel dataset running from 1970 to 2010 and spanning 186 countries with at least one year of debt accumulation is used. First a Panel Probit model is estimated including all the variables along with the lags of Arrears. Then, in order to explore the role played in countries that have defaulted; we divide the sample into countries with a history of sovereign defaults, and countries with no such history. Further, in order to explore the role played in countries that have defaulted; we divide the sample into countries with a history of sovereign defaults, and countries with no such history. If a country has at least one <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement</b> during the years 1970 - 2010 then the country is considered defaulted and it is included in the “default” subset. To be included in the “no default” subset, the country should not have had any <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement</b> during the aforementioned period. Our results show that debt arrears are not only a good determinant of default as argued in the literature but their lagged arrears can also be used as an early warning signal for sovereign defaults. However, the accumulation of arrears does not automatically trigger a default. Moreover, the likelihood to default rises when the failure to pay debt obligations continues overtime until the actual default occurs after the obligations in the third year are not paid. These results are very crucial to both debtors and creditors. Arrears, consequently, could be used as an inducement for debtors to take preemptive actions to minimize exposure to sovereign default risk. However, even in the case of default, observing arrears will provide ample time for policy makers in debtor countries to take necessary precautionary measures. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|This report compares and {{identifies}} {{two ways}} that Governments can"up-front"the adjustment effort: accumulating reserves; {{and engaging in}} an equity swap. The authors compare these methods with a constant <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement</b> which assumes that no reserves can be accumulated and that tax collections go to the creditors. The paper analyzes the outcome of a"memoryless"rescheduling agreement. The model exhibits two potential Laffer curves effects. In one, the lenders would want to reduce {{the vulnerability of the}} debtor to their sanctions (that is, required taxation). In the other, the debtor would actually prefer less growth than more. The role of reserves is studied and it is determined that their use can improve a country's welfare, over the case of the <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement.</b> The country must, however, be able to commit itself to a tax rate before negotiations start. Otherwise, reserves are useless. Debt-equity swaps are also studied. The outcome - always Pareto - dominates the outcome of the rescheduling equilibrium. Banks always gain a fraction of the country's capital above the share of output that they gain in the rescheduling equilibrium. Thus, banks are relatively less"impatient"than the country to reach a debt-relief agreement.

40|$|A dynamic bargaining-theoretic {{framework}} {{is used to}} analyze multilateral negotiations for rescheduling sovereign debt. The analysis illustrates how various factors, such as the debtor's gains from trade {{and the level of}} world interest rates, affect the relative bargaining power of various parties to a <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreement.</b> If creditor-country taxpayers {{have a vested interest in}} maintaining normal levels of trade with debtor countries, then they can sometimes be bargained into making sidepayments. The benefits from unanticipated creditor-country sidepayments accrue to both lenders and borrowers. But the benefits from perfectly anticipated sidepayments accrue entirely to borrowers. ...|$|E
50|$|When the {{reliance}} on these controls proved to be ineffective the Government adopted a new strategy involving the negotiation of a stabilisation and structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the negotiation of debt <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> with creditor banks and the Paris Club. In the context of these agreements, the Bank, in the early 1990s embarked on a comprehensive programme of financial sector reform geared to liberalise the financial system {{as well as to}} modernise the Bank's prudential and supervisory framework.|$|R
40|$|The IMF {{has become}} {{increasingly}} involved in mediating debt <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> between debtor countries and official creditors through {{its role in the}} Paris Club. This has coincided with increased ‘slippage’ and breakdown of IMF conditionality agreements, and a worsening ‘arrears problem’. After tracing the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s role in Paris Club rescheduling procedures, and drawing on recent experience in Egypt and Sudan, this paper argues that the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s role in existing debt rescheduling procedures undermines its capacity to perform its policy role, and exposes it to default, particularly by most heavily indebted ‘official borrowers’ of Sub‐Saharan Africa.

40|$|Since {{the summer}} of 1982 the banking {{community}} has been faced with an international debt crisis of unprecedented dimensions. The debt <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> that have been negotiated since then involve sums totalling no less than $ 100 billion.

Rainer Erbe examines the question as to what growth effects were associated with external borrowing.

50|$|In 1992, Gabon {{failed to}} settle arrears on its {{bilateral}} debt, {{leading to a}} cancellation of <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its CFA franc by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994-1995 and a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) at near-commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items, over-borrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in 1999 helped growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains.|$|R
50|$|In March 1983, the government, with an {{eye toward}} {{rescheduling}} the external debt, introduced several austerity measures, including a second devaluation of the sucre in two years, this time a 21-percent devaluation of the sucre, a 16-percent rise in the commercial interest rate, and a deceleration of government spending. The government's stabilization program, which included new exchange controls and the reduction of fuel and export subsidies, was unpopular domestically, but it enabled Ecuador to successfully negotiate a new debt repayment schedule with the International Monetary Fund, which also proved willing to grant Ecuador an additional US$107 million in financial assistance. The government, after several months of negotiation, also concluded multiyear <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> with foreign private banks in December 1984 and with the Paris Club (a financial consortium of Western banks and governments) in April 1985. By successfully refinancing nearly all of the public-sector debt, the government narrowly avoided defaulting on payments, and, for the period 1985-89, the external debt service ratio was reduced from 60 percent of export earnings to a manageable 30 percent. From 1985 until the beginning of 1987, Ecuador paid only the interest on its external debt.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s, {{foreign debt}} {{increased}} faster than export earnings. By {{the end of}} the decade, Somalia's debt of 4 billion shillings equaled the earnings from seventy-five years' worth of banana exports (based on 1978 data). About one-third was owed to centrally planned economies (mainly the Soviet Union, US$110 million; China, US$87.2 million; with small sums to Bulgaria and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Another one-third of the debt was owed to countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Finally, one-third was owed to members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (principally Saudi Arabia, US$81.9 million; Abu Dhabi, US$67.0 million; the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, US$34.7 million; Kuwait, US$27.1 million; and smaller amounts to Iraq, Qatar, the OPEC special account, Libya, and Algeria, in that order). Many loans, especially from the Soviet Union, were, in effect, written off. Later, many loan repayments to OECD states were rescheduled. But thanks to the accumulated debt burden, by the 1980s the economy could not attract foreign capital, and virtually all international funds made available to Somalia in <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> came with the provision that international civil servants would monitor all expenditures. As a result of its international debt, therefore, Somalia lost control over its macroeconomic structure.|$|R
5000|$|The Government of Bolivia remains heavily {{dependent}} on foreign assistance to finance development projects. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign creditors, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments {{and most of the}} balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the Paris Club mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian Government has generally achieved the monetary targets set by International Monetary Fund programs since 1987, though economic problems in recent years have undercut Bolivia's normally good track record. <b>Rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> granted by the Paris Club have allowed the individual creditor countries to apply very soft terms to the rescheduled debt. As a result, some countries have forgiven substantial amounts of Bolivia's bilateral debt. The U.S. Government reached an agreement at the Paris Club meeting in December 1995 that reduced by 67% Bolivia's existing debt stock. The Bolivian Government continues to pay its debts to the multilateral development banks on time. Bolivia is a beneficiary of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC debt relief programs, which by agreement restricts Bolivia's access to new soft loans. Bolivia was one of three countries in the Western hemisphere selected for eligibility for the Millennium Challenge Account and is participating as an observer in free trade agreement negotiations.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the role of {{international}} organizations involved in supplying developing countries with capital has changed - not only have they increased their volume of lending, but they have also become catalytic agents stimulating continuing private bank lending to less developed countries. The hesitation of the private banks 'to throw good money after bad money' apparently rests on the evaluation that quite a few developing countries {{will never be able}} to pay back the loans or even the interest on them. In order to persuade private banks to increase their loans, international organizations stress that the current debt crisis is one of illiquidity rather than insolvency - if <b>rescheduling</b> <b>agreements</b> are reached and fresh money is made available to the developing countries, they will eventually be able to service their debt without relying on new loans. Private banks, on the other hand, have begun to judge major debtors as following an explosive debt accumulation path and characterize them as being insolvent in the long run. Economic models can try to point out the crucial characteristics determining whether a country follows a stable, sustainable debt path and is therefore able to eventually pay back foreign debt or an unstable, unsustainable debt path. In this respect, they might explain why the vdebt-cycle hypothesis' (a country first borrows from abroad and later repays the debt with corresponding balance of payments deficits and surpluses; compare World Bank 1985, p. 47) apparently does not apply to quite a few developing countries. This hypothesis rests on the neoclassical production and trade theories and predicts that capital flows to countries or regions where the return to it is high and later leaves these areas, when the built-up capital stock has reduced the marginal productivity of capital. A developing country with a low capital stock first incurs and later repays the debt. This paper surveys models which try to explain why a country might not be able to service and repay its debt as predicted by the debt-cycle hypothesis. Section II provides the reader with a classification of models dealing with indebtedness. Section III analyses different characteristics of non-optimizing models. Results are reviewed in Section IV and the applicability and critique of these models is discussed in Section V...|$|R

The purpose was to know the implementation of fulfillment of creditors’ rights to the fiduciary guarantee value that have capability to conduct it through the loaning agreement between the creditor {{in one hand and}} debtor in other hand. After the agreement was agreed, thus it established an obligation to creditor, i. e. submitting the money agreed to the debtor by rights to reaccept the money from the debtor in time. During both parties conduct their rights and obligation appropriately to the agreement, thus there will not be any case. Ordinarily, a case emerges if the debtor neglects to repay the debt in determined time. It means the debtor in a loaning agreement needs credit in the shape of property, i. e. fiduciary guarantee.
