25|$|Using this {{expression}} {{for the total}} energy of an atom (or ion) {{as a function of}} the shielding constants and effective quantum numbers, Slater was able to compose rules such that spectral energies calculated agree reasonably well with experimental values for a wide range of atoms. Using the values in the iron example above, the total energy of a neutral iron atom using this method is -2497.2 Ry, while the energy of an iron cation lacking a single 1s electron is -1964.6 <b>Ry.</b> <b>The</b> difference, 532.6 Ry, can be compared to the experimental (circa 1930) K absorption limit of 524.0 Ry.|$|E
