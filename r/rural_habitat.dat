Ecological differences between areas of dense human habitation and minimally managed natural habitats were explored across an urban-to-rural gradient of land use in southern New England. These differences were examined through presence/absence and leaf functional traits for a set of invasive species; and urban and rural environmental conditions. Some species were more restricted to particular sites than others along the urbanization gradient, based on introduction history and habitat preference. A priori urban-classified species showed trait values associated with drought tolerance, including higher LWR, greater leaf thickness, higher LDMC and lower SLA. Finally, urban habitats were found to be significantly different from <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Urban soils were more alkaline, and had higher lead concentrations and sand content than <b>rural</b> soils. Urban <b>habitats</b> had more open canopies, impervious surface, patch forests, and induced edge <b>habitats</b> than <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Our findings suggest that urban environmental conditions contribute to an “urban drought island” syndrome and will favor species capable of tolerating drought...|$|R
40|$|Urban areas {{occupy a}} large and growing {{proportion}} of the earth. Such sites exhibit distinctive characteristics relative to adjacent <b>rural</b> <b>habitats,</b> and many species have colonised and now successfully exploit urban habitats. The change in selection pressures {{as a result of}} urbanisation has led to trait divergence in some urban populations relative to their rural counterparts, but studies have generally been local in scale and the generality of differentiation thus remains unknown. The European blackbird Turdus merula is one of the commonest urban bird species in the Western Palearctic, but populations vary substantially in the length of time they have been urbanised. Here we investigate patterns of morphological variation in European blackbirds occupying 11 paired urban and <b>rural</b> <b>habitats</b> across much of the urbanised range of this species and spanning 25 degrees of latitude. First, we assessed the extent to which urban and rural blackbirds are differentiated morphologically and the consistency of any differentiation across the range. Paired urban and rural Blackbird populations frequently exhibited significant morphological differences, but the magnitude and direction of differentiation was site dependent. We then investigated whether the nature of latitudinal gradients in body-size differed between urban and rural populations, as predicted by differences in the climatic regimes of urban and rural areas. Blackbird body-size exhibited strong latitudinal gradients, but their form did not differ significantly between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> The latitudinal gradient in body size may be a consequence of Seebohm's rule, that more migratory populations occurring at high latitudes have longer wings. We conclude that while there can be substantial morphological variation between adjacent urban and rural bird populations, such differentiation may not apply across a species' range. Locality specific differentiation of urban and rural blackbirds may arise if the selection pressures acting on blackbird morphology vary in an inconsistent manner between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Alternatively, phenotypic divergence could arise in a stochastic manner depending on the morphological traits of colonists, through founder effects...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{habitats}} {{differ from}} adjacent natural habitats {{in terms of}} disturbance regimes, light, temperature, rainfall, habitat distribution and resource abundance. Meteorological differences advance and prolong the growing season in urban habitats compared to nearby rural areas. In turn, urban bird populations may potentially start singing earlier, and reproduce earlier and more frequently than rural populations. However, this prediction has previously only been tested with data from single species using single spatial replicates from rural and urban sites. Here we provide the first general (paired urban and rural populations of 54 bird species) and large-scale (a 3800 km long latitudinal gradient across Europe) empirical evidence for longer and earlier singing periods in urban compared to <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Effects of urbanization on start and duration of the singing period (as a proxy for the breeding season) were positively related to size of cities and ecological characteristics of species. Bird species that have been urbanized {{for a long time}} started to sing earlier and had a more extended singing period in urban compared to <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> We also found that the singing period started later and was shorter at higher latitudes. Geographical variation in phenology was related to temperature and rainfall, although differences between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>habitats</b> were not. Differences in duration of singing periods between paired urban and rural sites were as large as latitudinal differences between southern and northern Europe (5, 6 and 28 d for 3 common species, as compared to a mean latitudinal variation of 17. 1 d).

40|$|Urbanization has {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} {{reproduction}} and other ecological and behavioural traits of many living organisms, including birds. In migrant birds, survival and reproductive output {{is influenced by the}} (mis) synchronization of arrival with the availability of resources. Many recent studies have shown that arrival timing is related to temperatures en-route and at destination. Because urban areas are "heat islands", with higher temperatures that influence earlier vegetation and invertebrate development, this should favour earlier arrival of migrant birds to cities rather than to rural areas. In this paper, we analysed differences between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>habitats</b> in mean dates and trends of first arrival dates of 18 species of migratory bird species in western Poland during 1983 - 2010. For many individual species, and overall, mean first arrival date was significantly earlier in rural areas than in urban areas (significant for 11 species). However, the trend towards earlier first arrival dates was stronger in urban areas for 15 of the 18 species (significantly stronger in four species). Consequently, arrival dates in urban areas are fast approaching, or have now matched or passed those in rural areas.

We also found a positive association between the proportion of saturated fatty acids and laying date, and a negative association between the proportion of ?- 6 PUFA and clutch size.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of species are excluded from human-dominated landscapes, but some species persist and appear to thrive, despite facing challenges they would not encounter in less disturbed habitat. Corticosteroid (cort) secretion may {{play a significant role}} in enabling an animal to cope with urban breeding habitat because it helps mediate physiological and behavioral responses to environmental challenges. Here we present tests of 3 hypotheses relating to cort secretion in urban animals: 1) environmental challenges vary between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>habitat,</b> as reflected in differing levels of cort secretion in animals breeding in these habitat types, 2) there are fitness correlates associated with variation in cort levels within populations, and 3) parasite load is one of the mechanistic links between variation in cort levels and reproductive success.

To assess the fitness correlates of variation in hormone levels, we monitored seasonal reproductive success in one urban population and found that baseline corticosterone levels were predictive of female, but not male, reproductive success: females with higher corticosterone fledged fewer offspring. Data do not suggest a direct relationship between corticosterone levels and fitness and instead indicate an indirect relationship between hormone secretion, territory quality, body condition, and reproductive success.

40|$|International audienceBird populations {{exposed to}} {{different}} extrinsic conditions often {{differ in the}} responsiveness of the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and thus in corticosterone response that individuals mount when facing stressful events. However, the contribution of genetic variation to among-individual variability in HPA axis responsiveness across different environmental conditions is poorly understood. Melanin-based coloured types provide reliable phenotypic markers of alternative genotypes underlying stress coping styles. Large variations in melanin-based colouration are heritable in feral pigeons. We tested whether melanin-based colouration is associated with variation in corticosterone stress response in feral pigeons. To this end, we examined how corticosterone response varies both within and between differently coloured individuals across different environmental conditions. Differently coloured individuals produced different stress-induced corticosterone levels {{in relation to their}} environmental conditions: dark pigeons exhibited a higher corticosterone when originating from <b>rural</b> <b>habitats,</b> while this was not observed in pale pigeons. This suggests that among-population variation in stress response is higher in dark pigeons, this variation possibly reflecting adjustment and/or (epi) genetic adaptation to environmental conditions. In addition, corticosterone response increased with the degree of melanin-based colouration in pigeons originating from <b>rural</b> <b>habitats</b> but not in pigeons originating from more urbanized populations, resulting in the coexistence of alternative stress responses in some populations, but not in others.

A total of 438 larval habitats containing Aedes spp. immature stages were surveyed. We evaluated the characteristics of larval habitats and analyzed the field distribution of Aedes spp. throughout Mayotte using generalized linear models. Artificial containers used for water storage were significantly more productive for Ae. albopictus immature stages than for Ae. aegypti ones. Most of natural larval habitats collected were colonized by Ae. aegypti, and it was also the most common Aedes species encountered in <b>rural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Conversely, Ae. albopictus greatly predominated in urban and suburban habitats and during the dry season. Ae. lilii was uncommon and occurred preferentially in leaf axillae and dead leaves on the ground. Ae. albopictus has rapidly colonized the inhabited areas of Mayotte. A displacement of Ae. aegypti populations by Ae. albopictus populations in urban areas might be happening. The increasing urbanization seems to greatly favor the presence of the invasive species.
