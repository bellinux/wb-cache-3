40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} an opposing buoyancy force {{on the performance of}} an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> in the doorway which separates a warm indoor environment from the cold exterior. Such an opposing buoyancy force arises for example if a downwards blowing <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is heated. We conducted small-scale experiments using water, salt and sugar solutions as the working fluids. The effectiveness curve of a downwards blowing <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> {{as a function of the}} deflection modulus was measured for situations in which the initial density of the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> was less than both the indoor and the outdoor fluid density, which corresponds to the case of a heated curtain.

We also discuss the question whether it is more energy efficient to use a heated <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> or an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> operating at room temperature. Based on our experimental results we conclude that a heated <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is likely to be less energy-efficient. Further, we propose a theoretical model to describe the dynamics of the buoyant <b>air</b> <b>curtain.</b> Numerical results obtained from solving this model corroborate our experimental findings.

However, the transverse velocity profile showed a larger amount of diffusion. The re-sults indicated that the floor vent did not properly capture the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> flow, resulting in entrainment of the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> flow into the cabin.

Entrainment of ambient <b>air</b> into the <b>curtain</b> by shear layer mixing contributes to both the sensible and the latent heat load on the cases. In order to reduce this entrainment, {{a closer look at}} the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is undertaken here. Particle Image Velocimetry was used to examine idealized <b>air</b> <b>curtains</b> of various Reynolds and Richardson numbers. The <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> entrainment was seen to be dominated by eddies that engulfed ambient air into the <b>air</b> <b>curtain.</b> For the isothermal (Ri= 0) curtains, it was observed that the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> dynamics and entrainment were not sensitive to Reynolds number variation between Re= 3800 and Re= 8500. At low air velocities (Re= 1500), the curtain was found to detach, leading to extremely high entrainment rates. Variations in Richardson number of the curtain affected the flow at the curtain inlet most dramatically, where the acceleration of gravity caused the curtain to neck inwards. The overall thermal entrainment was shown to reduce with reducing Reynolds number, implying that a reduction in <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> entrainment could be achieved by reducing the air velocity of the curtain, as long as <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> integrity is maintained.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{measured}} effectiveness of an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> device at different jet velocities against a three-dimensional (3 -D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> device was not as wide as the entrance and had a geometry that encouraged 3 -D flow. By carefully setting up the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> an effectiveness of 0. 71 was achieved compared to the initial value of only 0. 31 as set by the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> device installer. The 3 -D CFD model predicted the infiltration through the entrance with no <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> to an accuracy of within 20 - 32 %. The predicted effectiveness, E, of the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> at different jet velocities was 0. 10 - 0. 15 lower than measured. The shape of the effectiveness curve against jet velocity was well predicted. CFD has shown that the flow from this <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> cannot be considered as 2 -D. The central part of the jet is deflected away from the cold store by the Coanda effect caused by the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> device's fan body.

The tested arrangements include single- and twin-jet <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> systems with and without air return ducts. Jet opening ratios equal to 10 and 20 are considered, with air discharge velocities ranging from I to 10 m/s. The facility and the experimental approach used in this work are described and justified in many details. Results are presented in terms of leakage flow rates. Information is also provided about relevant air change rates and system time constants. The global efficiency of an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is greatly improved by the adjunction of an air recirculation circuit due to enhanced system stability. A critical jet exit velocity corresponding to transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime of the channel flow inside the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> diffuser was found. For discharge velocities larger than this critical velocity an asymptotic behaviour is observed for every <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> tested. At the lower nozzle exit velocities, the non-recirculated twin-jet system exhibits a weird behaviour. Unexpectedly, {{the results show that}} a single jet with a given opening ratio may perform better than a twin-jet of same height with a lower opening ratio. However, the results show that the performance of an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is much dependant of the conditions under which this <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is operated demonstrating therefore that great care should be exercised in any attempt of comparison.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to increase the understanding of the air-curtain physics and entrainment through a systematic parametric study. Experiments were conducted using flow visualization, cinematic Particle Image Velocimetry and thermo-couple measurements at various locations in the flow cycle. These techniques were used to investigate various effects including variations in: air jet width, velocity profile of the jet, velocity of the jet, temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> and to the ambient air and geometry of the display case (e. g. fully-stocked configuration with backflow perforations vs. an idealized wall jet). Thermal entrainment and velocity distributions were obtained for several test conditions to understand these effects. The <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> was found to be highly turbulent at the inlet. Hence, the observed <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> dynamics were found to be largely different from previous wall-jet experiments and simulations which employed laminar inflow conditions. The results indicated that the entrained mass flow rate was found to reduce nearly linearly with decreasing Reynolds number (jet velocity), but the effect of product heat flux would need to be taken into account before lower velocity levels can be recommended. In addition, the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> entrainment was found to reduce when decreasing the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> width and/or using a stepped profile instead of a uniform profile. However, increasing the Richardson number tended to increase mixing which somewhat unexpected since negative-buoyancy effects were thought to act as a stabilizer. As such, the increased mixing was attributed to modifications in the downstream velocity profile shape, where decreased jet temperatures led to increasing necking effects, which subsequently increased the velocity gradients and thus led to more mixing of the <b>air</b> <b>curtain.</b> With respect to geometry, the fully stocked configuration with perforations open was found to give the minimum entrainment of all configurations studied, even less than that from the solid-wall configuration.
