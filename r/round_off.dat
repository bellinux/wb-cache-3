5|$|Zimbabwe {{played in}} the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July. Pat McKillop scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before Pat Davies, Linda Watson and Chase each added one more to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before {{the final round of}} matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona begin {{start off}} {{the season with}} the {{traditional}} curtain raiser, the Supercopa de España, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3–1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on {{the opening day of}} the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 {{for the third time in}} a row to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> a very successful season.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with his}} musical studies in Paris, the young saxophonist {{was invited to}} play in the trio of drummer Tony Rabeson and trumpeter Eric Le Lann with whom he first played in Duc des Lombards in 1998.

Long time studio engineer David Beevers had {{become part of}} the on-stage line-up controlling the sequencers from behind his deck of twin Apple Macintoshes. Oakey further recruited multi-instrumentalist Nic Burke, then aged 21, who he had seen playing in Sheffield, to play electric guitar and keytar.

Since then he has dominated that event, retaining his title at the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark and winning the floor title as well. Drăgulescu no longer competed in all six events, which had given him more time to focus on those he still trained.|$|E

30|$|Each of {{the four}} {{algorithms}} consists of three steps: node mapping, link mapping and definition of paths for transfer of the required images. For each step two procedures defines: how to round the real values off to binary ones and when such <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> should take place. In node mapping, the first procedure defines which variable will be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1 since only one Xn,m,ican be set to 1 for each virtual node m. The second procedure determines whether or not all the other variables values should be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1. There are two options {{for each of these}} two procedures with their combinations defining the four different algorithms proposed.|$|R
25|$|After safely {{making it}} to the lunch interval, the home side slipped to 23/4 in five overs, Malcolm bowling aggressively in a spell of 3–13. Mark Waugh and Blewett {{contrived}} to hold out for another hour, before Lewis (4–24) and Tufnell took further wickets. Healy (51 not out) did his best to marshal the tail, batting for two and a quarter hours and with Fleming, batting until well into the final hour, but Lewis eventually trapped the latter leg-before, and Malcolm (4–39) finished the job off by picking up McIntyre as well to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> an England victory.|$|E
25|$|Middlesbrough {{produced}} {{their worst}} away {{performance of the}} season thus far against Fulham, as they slumped to a 3–0 defeat. Julio Arca was lucky not to be red-carded for a late over-the-top challenge on Andy Johnson, earning only a yellow card. Jimmy Bullard got the opening goal after Turnbull could only parry Bobby Zamora's shot. Next, {{for the third time}} in three games, a penalty decision went against Boro, as Tony McMahon was adjudged to have handled the ball after the ball struck his arm from close range. Turnbull guessed the right way but was unable to save Danny Murphy's penalty kick. Clint Dempsey got the third to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> Fulham's win.|$|E
25|$|Even though Azarenka {{attended}} the Player's Party in Miami for the 2013 Sony Open Tennis, she {{withdrew from the}} tournament moments before her first match with American up-and-comer Madison Keys, because she hadn't recovered fully from her right ankle injury.

In the 2013 French Open, as the third seed, she reached the semifinal before being defeated by Maria Sharapova who ended the tournament as runner-up. However, {{it was a huge}} improvement made on her weakest-surface. She is making huge strides to become a better clay-court player.|$|E

25|$|Altogether, {{there were}} 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close {{relation}} conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and {{the cycles of}} the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented {{the number of days}} that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1 days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no <b>round</b> <b>off</b> was allowed.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer {{he was a}} {{right-handed}} opening batsman and got {{few opportunities}} to represent Victoria {{because they had a}} prolific pair in Bill Woodfull and Bill Ponsford. In the four first-class matches that he was picked in, two of them in the Sheffield Shield, it was as a middle order batsman. He made the most of his chance in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1926/27 when he scored 220 of Victoria's 552 first innings runs. Mitchell then dismissed Tasmanian Alfred Watson twice with the ball and also took three catches to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> a good all round performance. His only other wicket at first-class level had come on his debut against New Zealand and was All Blacks rugby player Charlie Oliver. Despite Mitchell's efforts in the Tasmania match, he wasn't picked for Victoria ever again.|$|E
25|$|At {{the base}} of the skull, the quadratojugal bears two branches, one {{pointing}} forwards and one upwards; they are roughly perpendicular to each other, unlike Lufengosaurus (angle of 45°), Yunnanosaurus (angle of 60°), and Jingshanosaurus (angle of 110°). Above the quadratojugal, the quadrate has two articulating condyles, a subtriangular one facing outward and a more rounded one facing inwards; the latter condyle is placed closer to the bottom, like Lufengosaurus and Yunnanosaurus but not Plateosaurus. At the back of the skull, between the parietals and supraoccipitals, there is a prominently developed postparietal fenestra; the supraoccipital itself slopes forwards at its bottom end so as to <b>round</b> <b>off</b> {{the base of}} the skull.
