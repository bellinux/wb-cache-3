40|$|The {{stability}} {{characteristics of}} the like-doublet injector were defined over the range of OME chamber pressures and mixture ratios. This was accomplished by bomb testing the injector and cavity configurations in solid wall thrust chamber hardware typical of a flight contour with fuel heated to <b>regenerative</b> <b>chamber</b> outlet temperatures. It was found that stability in the 2600 - 2800 Hz region depends upon injector hydraulics and on chamber acoustics...|$|E

The injector {{is intended to}} be evaluated during a series of pressure-fed test firings using a water-cooled calorimeter chamber and a milled-slot <b>regenerative</b> <b>chamber.</b> Combustion efficiency, combustion stability, ignition and injector face heat transfer assessments were made for candidate injector body and pattern design approaches. This evaluation resulted in baselining an oxidizer post type manifold with a 60 element platelet coaxial swirler injector pattern. An axial acoustic resonator cavity was created at the injector/chamber interface...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{efficiency}} of a <b>regenerative</b> <b>chamber</b> {{for a glass}} furnace mainly relies on the thermo-fluid dynamics of air and waste gas alternatively flowing through stacks of refractory bricks (checkers) determining the heat recovery. A numerical approach could effectively support the design strategies {{in order to achieve}} {{a deeper understanding of the}} current technology and hopefully suggest new perspectives of improvement. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) scheme for the regenerator is proposed, where the real geometry of the solid phase is modelled as a porous solid phase exchanging heat with the gas stream. Satisfactory data fitting proved the reliability of the present approach, whose applications are proposed in the last section of this study, to confirm how such a CFD modelling could be helpful in improving the overall energy efficiency of the regeneration chamber...|$|E
40|$|Analyses and {{experimental}} studies were {{performed with the}} OF 2 (F 2 /O 2) /B 2 H 6 propellant combination over a range in operating conditions to determine suitability for a space storable pressure fed engine configuration for an extended flight space vehicle configuration. The regenerative cooling mode selected for the thrust chamber was explored in detail {{with the use of}} both the fuel and oxidizer as coolants in an advanced milled channel construction thrust chamber design operating at 100 psia chamber pressure and a nominal mixture ratio of 3. 0 with a 60 : 1 area ratio nozzle. Benefits of the simultaneous cooling as related to gaseous injection of both fuel and oxidizer propellants were defined. Heat transfer rates, performance and combustor stability were developed for impinging element triplet injectors in uncooled copper calorimeter hardware with flow, pressure and temperature instrumentation. Evaluation of the capabilities of the B 2 H 6 and OF 2 during analytical studies and numerous tests with flow through electrically heated blocks provided design criteria for subsequent <b>regenerative</b> <b>chamber</b> design and fabrication...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two years NASA's Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) project has {{developed}} Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies and design tools aimed at reducing the costs and manufacturing time of regeneratively cooled rocket engine components. High pressure/high temperature combustion chambers and nozzles must be regeneratively cooled to survive their operating environment, causing their design fabrication to be costly and time consuming due to the number of individual steps and different processes required. Under LCUSP, AM technologies in Sintered Laser Melting (SLM) GRCop- 84 and Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF 3) Inconel 625 have been significantly advanced, allowing the team to successfully fabricate a 25 k-class <b>regenerative</b> <b>chamber.</b> Estimates of the costs and schedule of future builds indicate cost reductions and significant schedule reductions will be enabled by this technology. Characterization of the microstructural and mechanical properties of the SLM-produced GRCop- 84, EBF 3 Inconel 625 and the interface layer between the two has been performed and indicates the properties will meet the design requirements. The LCUSP chamber is to be tested with a previously demonstrated SLM injector in order to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and demonstrate the capability of the application of these processes. NASA is advancing these technologies to reduce cost and schedule for future engine applications and commercial needs...|$|E

Liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) are transported from the fuel tanks to the combustion chamber by means of turbopumps, which themselves are driven by an expansion of warm and highly compressed gasous hydrogen in the turbines.

40|$|Regenerative {{peripheral}} nerve interfaces {{have been proposed}} as viable alternatives for the natural control of robotic prosthetic devices. However, sensory and motor axons at the neural interface are of mixed sub-modality types, which difficult the specific recording from motor axons and the eliciting of precise sensory modalities through selective stimulation. Here we evaluated {{the possibility of using}} type specific neurotrophins to preferentially entice the regeneration of defined axonal populations from transected {{peripheral nerve}}s into separate compartments. Segregation of mixed sensory fibers from dorsal root ganglion neurons was evaluated in vitro by compartmentalized diffusion delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), to preferentially entice the growth of TrkA+ nociceptive and TrkC+ proprioceptive subsets of sensory neurons, respectively. The average axon length in the NGF channel increased 2. 5 -fold compared to that in saline or NT- 3, whereas the number of branches increased threefold in the NT- 3 channels. These results were confirmed using a 3 D “Y”-shaped in vitro assay showing that the arm containing NGF was able to entice a fivefold increase in axonal length of unbranched fibers. To address if such segregation can be enticed in vivo, a “Y”-shaped tubing was used to allow regeneration of the transected adult rat sciatic nerve into separate compartments filled with either NFG or NT- 3. A significant {{increase in the number of}} CGRP+ pain fibers were attracted toward the sural nerve, while N- 52 + large-diameter axons were observed in the tibial and NT- 3 compartments. This study demonstrates the guided enrichment of sensory axons in specific <b>regenerative</b> <b>chambers,</b> and supports the notion that neurotrophic factors can be used to segregate sensory and perhaps motor axons in separate peripheral interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Reusable {{thrust chamber}} and {{injector}} concepts were evaluated {{for the space}} shuttle orbit maneuvering engine (OME). Parametric engine calculations were carried out by computer program for N 2 O 4 /amine, LOX/amine and LOX/hydrocarbon propellant combinations for engines incorporating regenerative cooled and insulated columbium thrust chambers. The calculation methods are described including the fuel vortex film cooling method of combustion gas temperature control, and performance prediction. A method of acceptance of a regeneratively cooled heat rejection reduction using a silicone oil additive was also demonstrated by heated tube heat transfer testing. Regeneratively cooled thrust chamber operation was also demonstrated where the injector was characterized for the OME application with a channel wall <b>regenerative</b> thrust <b>chamber.</b> Bomb stability testing of the demonstration chambers/injectors demonstrated recovery for the nominal design of acoustic cavities. Cavity geometry changes were also evaluated to assess their damping margin.

40|$|In recent years, renewed {{interest}} {{in the development of}} unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led {{to a wide range of}} interesting applications in reconnaissance and surveillance. In these missions, the noise produced by propeller-driven UAVs is a major drawback, which can be partially solved by installing an electric motor to drive the propeller. While the evolution of high performance brushless motors makes electric propulsion particularly appealing, at least for small and medium UAVs, all electric propulsion systems developed to date are penalized by the limited range and endurance that can be provided by a reasonably sized battery pack. In this paper we propose a hybrid propulsion system based on a recently developed ultramicro gas–turbine (UMGT), which can be used to power an electric generator, providing a significant range and (or) mission time extension. The UMGT is undergoing operational testing in our laboratory, to identify the most suitable configuration and to improve performance: a new compact <b>regenerative</b> combustion <b>chamber</b> was developed and several tests are being carried out to reduce its weight and size so as to increase, all other things being equal, the vehicle payload. This paper aims to propose a high endurance UAV, by a preliminary configuration selection and aerodynamic study of its performanc...|$|R
40|$|This CFD {{study is}} devoted to the {{characterization}} and the analysis of the flow field and heat loads evaluation in oxygen/methane liquid rocket engines. Thanks to CFD we obtain a compromise between details and experimental cost and it is possible a full scale engine analysis as support to the engine design phase. Our work is focused on the heat flux evaluation, hot gas and on flame structure in a thrust chamber. The importance of flame position leads to a study of mesh refinement of post tip. As consequence, a small recirculation zone near the post tip is identified and is studied to guarantee a stable flame also in term of position in the chamber. Also three large recirculation zones of hot gases are located in the combustion chamber and their presence assures, near the walls and the plate, the presence of high heat fluxes. We considered the usage of EOSs and a preliminary analysis was realised before the CFD simulations. Simple test cases are simulated and used to identify the best numerical strategy employ. Finally, we reproduced a simulation of the DEMO a <b>regenerative</b> cooled <b>chamber</b> LOX/methane, obtaining by combustion process simulation the heat flux at the chamber and nozzle walls...|$|R
40|$|The {{regenerative}} cooling limits (maximum chamber pressure) for 02 /hydrocarbon gas generator and staged combustion cycle rocket engines over a thrust range of 89, 000 N (20, 000 lbf) to 2, 669, 000 N (600, 000 lbf) for a reusable life of 250 missions were defined. Maximum chamber pressure limits were first determined {{for the three}} propellant combinations (O 2 /CH 4, O 2 /C 3 H 8, and O 2 /RP- 1 without a carbon layer (unenhanced designs). Chamber pressure cooling enhancement limits were then established for seven thermal barriers. The thermal barriers evaluated for these designs were: carbon layer, ceramic coating, graphite liner, film cooling, transpiration cooling, zoned combustion, and a combination {{of two of the}} above. All fluid barriers were assessed a 3 percent performance loss. Sensitivity studies were then conducted to determine the influence of cycle life and RP- 1 decomposition temperature on chamber pressure limits. Chamber and nozzle design parameters are presented for the unenahanced and enhanced designs. The maximum <b>regenerative</b> cooled <b>chamber</b> pressure limits were attained with the O 2 /CH 4 propellant combination. The O 2 /RP- 1 designs relied on a carbon layer and liquid gas injection chamber contours, short chamber, to be competitive with the other two propellant combinations. This was attributed to the low decomposition temperature of RP- 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to high {{temperatures}} and pressures in the thrust <b>chamber,</b> <b>regenerative</b> cooling along with film cooling {{is one of}} the basic requirements for safe operation. This is ensured by controlling the rate of heat transfer from the walls of chamber through the coolant flow rate. For optimum performance of thrust chamber using efficient combustion, specific heat transfer rates through the nozzle section are required to guarantee the structure integrity of the chamber. Analytical procedures for the thermal design of thrust chambers are fairly limited and designers have to rely on empirical relationships and/or computational methods to calculate the heat transfer rates. Experimental correlations are usually used to predict heat transfer through the internal wall however the exact mechanism of heat transfer is not fully understood. Here a comparison of analytical and empirical approaches has been made for a simplified geometry consisting of two concentric shells. The simplified geometry allows direct application of analytical approach and provides a test ground for the empirical approaches. Results for heat flux and hot side wall temperatures are also compared with a coupled numerical simulation using commercial software Fluent. While estimations for cooling fluid outlet temperature and temperature of outer wall of coolant shell are also compared with the experimental data. The comparison indicates that the analytical method for the heat transfer calculation matches the numerical simulations and experimental data reasonably well...|$|R
40|$|Rocket {{combustion}} chambers {{are subject to}} extremely high thermal loads. To protect the chamber walls from these loads, an efficient cooling is necessary. As a highly effective cooling mechanism, transpiration cooling promises advantages over conventional regenerative and active cooling techniques like film cooling. In combination with porous ceramic matrix composites (CMC), longer durability due to low coefficient of thermal expansion, lower manufacturing costs and possible weight reductions are possible, all while retaining the performance of <b>regenerative</b> cooled combustion <b>chambers.</b> One parameter determining {{the effectiveness of this}} cooling mechanism, is the exhalation characteristic of the coolant from the porous surface. Measurements of this characteristic are shown for a carbon fibre reinforced carbon (C/C) and single free jets. For C/C it is shown, that possible defects like blocked pores or delaminations can be detected by measuring the dynamic pressure of the outflow. Furthermore, it is shown, that the exhalation characteristic for C/C is dependent on the through flow direction. The derivation of mass flow through the sample from these measurements reveals an quantitative overestimation of the velocity distribution. By simulating the measurement, it is shown, that one important aspect is the spatial integration of the measured values over the sensor area. But it is also shown, that this effect is not enough to explain the overestimation and additional effects need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|Improved liquid {{rocket engine}} cycles were {{proposed}} and analyzed via comparison with existing staged combustion and gas-generator cycles. The key {{features of the}} proposed cycles are regenerative cooling of thrust chamber by oxygen and subsequent use of this oxygen for driving one or two oxygen pumps. The fuel pump(s) are driven in a conventional manner, for example, using a fuel-rich gas-generator cycle. Comparison with staged combustion cycle based on oxygen-rich pre-burner showed {{that one of the}} proposed semi-expander cycles has a specific impulse only on 0. 4 % lower while providing much lower oxygen temperature, more efficient tank pressurizing system and built-in roll control. This semi-expander cycle can be considered as a more reliable and cost-effective alternative of staged combustion cycle. Another semi-expander cycle can be considered as an improvement of gas-generator cycle. All proposed semi-expander cycles were developed as a derivative of thrust <b>chamber</b> <b>regenerative</b> cooling performed by oxygen. Analysis of existing oxygen/kerosene engines showed that replacing of kerosene regenerative cooling with oxygen allows a significant increase of achievable specific impulse, via optimization of mixture ratio. It is especially the case for upper stage engines. The increasing of propellants average density can be considered as an additional benefit of mixture ratio optimization. It was demonstrated that oxygen regenerative cooling of thrust chamber is a feasible and the most promising option for oxygen/kerosene engines. Combination of oxygen regenerative cooling and semi-expander cycles potentially allows creating the oxygen/kerosene propulsion systems with minimum specific impulse losses. It is important that such propulsion systems can be fully based on inherited and well-proven technical solutions. A hypothetic upper stage engine with thrust 19. 6  kN was chosen as a prospective candidate for theoretical analysis of the proposed semi-expander cycles. The newly-developed software RECS was used for the comparative analysis of engine cycles...|$|R
