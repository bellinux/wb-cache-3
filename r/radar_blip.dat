2500|$|The T-39 {{crossed the}} border into East Germany. Within five minutes, two blips {{appeared}} near the American jet. For 11 minutes, <b>radar</b> <b>blips</b> indicated the three planes were moving eastward, then two blips suddenly veered west and the third blip disappeared. American personnel monitoring the T-39's flight could not determine what had happened, although it was later reported that residents in Vogelsberg, [...] from the border, had heard machine-gun and cannon fire and had witnessed the plane crash. The incident {{is believed to have}} occurred at 15:14 hours.|$|R
50|$|With lower-flying, slower aircraft, {{recognizing}} and tracking an aircraft by its <b>radar</b> <b>blips</b> was a straightforward process. Consider an antenna that spins once every ten seconds detecting a target aircraft moving at 1000 km/h, typical for early jet bombers. With every scan the aircraft will have moved almost three kilometers (1000 km/h = 278 m/s). On a display showing radar's entire 300 km radius this represents movement of only 0.5% across the display's face (600 km diameter), producing a tiny line segment {{between the two}} dots that is easy for an operator to interpret as an aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|... 24 June 1943: Lieutenant Reese {{and crew}} {{disappeared}} while on convoy patrol 700 mi northeast of Argentia. Reese had reported a <b>radar</b> <b>blip</b> and came {{through a very}} heavy overcast to investigate. No further messages were received. On {{the next day in}} clear weather, three huge icebergs were seen in the area. The squadron learned from this incident that when investigating an isolated <b>radar</b> <b>blip</b> in bad weather, always allow a five-degree offset on the radar scope until a visual contact is obtained.|$|E

We will call it the Langevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric, and we can call this notion of distance radar distance [...] "in the small".|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Aberdeen Press and Journal writer Nic Outterside wrote a {{piece on}} US stealth {{technology}} in Scotland. Citing confidential 'sources', he alleged RAF/USAF Machrihanish in Kintyre, Argyll to be a base for Aurora aircraft. Machrihanish's almost -long long runway makes it suitable for high-altitude and experimental aircraft with the fenced-off coastal approach making it ideal for takeoffs and landings to be made well away from eyes or cameras of press and public. [...] 'Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick', Outterside says, 'also tracked fast-moving <b>radar</b> <b>blips.</b> It was claimed by staff that a [...] "hypersonic jet was the only rational conclusion" [...] for the readings.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Albert M. Chop, {{the press}} {{spokesman}} for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport and, due to security concerns, denied several reporters' requests {{to photograph the}} radar screens. He then joined the radar center personnel. By this time (9:30 p.m.) the radar center was picking up unknown objects in every sector. At times the objects traveled slowly; at other times they reversed direction and moved across the radarscope at speeds calculated at up to 7,000 mph. At 11:30 p.m., two U.S. Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington. Captain John McHugo, the flight leader, was vectored towards the <b>radar</b> <b>blips</b> but saw nothing, despite repeated attempts. However, his wingman, Lieutenant William Patterson, did see four white [...] "glows" [...] and chased them. He later said that [...] "I tried {{to make contact with}} the bogies below 1,000 feet. I was at my maximum speed...I ceased chasing them because I saw no chance of overtaking them." [...] According to Albert Chop, when ground control asked Patterson [...] "if he saw anything", Patterson replied [...] "'I see them now and they're all around me. What should I do?'...And nobody answered, because we didn't know what to tell him."After midnight on July 27, Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book's liaison at the Pentagon, and Lieutenant John Holcomb, a United States Navy radar specialist, arrived at the radar center at National Airport. During the night, Lieutenant Holcomb received a call from the Washington National Weather Station. They told him that a slight temperature inversion was present over the city, but Holcomb felt that the inversion was not [...] "nearly strong enough to explain the 'good and solid' returns" [...] on the radarscopes. Fournet relayed that all those present in the radar room were convinced that the targets were most likely caused by solid metallic objects. There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but this was a common occurrence and the controllers [...] "were paying no attention to them." [...] Two more F-94s from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled during the night. One pilot saw nothing unusual; the other pilot saw a white light which [...] "vanished" [...] when he moved towards it. Additionally, [...] "civilian planes flying into Washington reported seeing strange glowing objects in places where the radar was getting blips." [...] As on July 20, the sightings and unknown radar returns ended at sunrise.|$|R
5000|$|Among the {{witnesses}} who supported Samford's explanation was {{the crew of}} a B-25 bomber, which had been flying over Washington during the sightings of July 26-27. The bomber was vectored several times by National Airport over unknown targets on the airport's radarscopes, yet the crew could see nothing unusual. Finally, as a crew member related, [...] "the radar had a target {{which turned out to}} be the Wilson Lines steamboat trip to Mount Vernon... the radar was sure as hell picking up the steamboat." [...] Air Force Captain Harold May was in the radar center at Andrews AFB during the sightings of July 19-20. Upon hearing that National Airport's radar had picked up an unknown object heading in his direction, May stepped outside and saw [...] "a light that was changing from red to orange to green to red again...at times it dipped suddenly and appeared to lose altitude." [...] However, May eventually concluded that he was simply seeing a star that was distorted by the atmosphere, and that its [...] "movement" [...] was an illusion. At 3 a.m. on July 27, an Eastern Airlines flight over Washington was told that an unknown object was in its vicinity; the crew could see nothing unusual. When they were told that the object had moved directly behind their plane, they began a sharp turn to try to see the object, but were told by National Airport's radar center that the object had [...] "disappeared" [...] when they began their turn. At the request of the Air Force, the CAA's Technical Development and Evaluation Center did an analysis of the radar sightings. Their conclusion was that [...] "a temperature inversion had been indicated in almost every instance when the unidentified radar targets or visual objects had been reported." [...] Project Blue Book would eventually label the unknown Washington <b>radar</b> <b>blips</b> as false images caused by temperature inversion, and the visual sightings as misindentified meteors, stars, and city lights. In later years two prominent UFO skeptics, Dr. Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University, and Philip Klass, a senior editor for Aviation Week magazine, would also argue in favor of the temperature inversion/mirage hypothesis. In 2002 Klass told a reporter that [...] "radar technology in 1952 wasn't sophisticated enough to filter out many ordinary objects, such as flocks of birds, weather balloons, or temperature inversions." [...] The reporter added that [...] "UFO proponents argue that even then seasoned controllers could differentiate between spurious targets and solid, metallic objects. Klass disagrees. It may be that 'we had two dumb controllers at National Airport on those nights'...Klass added that the introduction of digital filters in the 1970s led to a steep decline in UFO sightings on radar." ...|$|R

50|$|Overworked {{air traffic}} {{controller}} Jack Chester (Candy) is given four paid weeks off {{as an alternative to}} being fired after nearly causing a mid-air collision on the job and having an outburst over {{what turned out to be}} a fly covering a <b>radar</b> <b>blip.</b> He uses this time off to take his wife Sandy and children Jennifer, Bobby, and Laurie on a summer vacation from the Atlanta area to the Gulf Coast resort town of Citrus Cove, Florida, where they are beset by a never-ending barrage of problems. First they are bumped out of the front of the line of an upscale seafood restaurant in favor of arrogant local sailing champion Al Pellet, who becomes Jack's main nemesis throughout the film. Then the family misreads the address, moves into the wrong house, and are forced to leave in the middle of the night, ending up in a decrepit shack on a public beach with a constant stream of beach-goers tromping through. Jack then receives a leg injury that prevents him from spending time with his family.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's natural frequency might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the interrogator. When the radar operator pressed a button on their console, the interrogator began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the radar unit. The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the <b>radar's,</b> causing the <b>blip</b> to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead of stretching the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|R
