25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that an {{interstellar}} mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate). On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now. Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those who leave at the minimum, whereas those who leave after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum.|$|E

I say possible, but not practicable, because at present properly surveyed routes, landing grounds and adequate supplies of petrol and spare parts do not exist. Given those things, that journey could be done now in the time I have stated. This tremendous change in the range of human activities involves changes in the conditions of our political life that we are only beginning to work out to their proper consequences to-day.|$|E

50|$|In elution mode, solutes {{are applied}} to the column as narrow bands and, at low concentration, move down the column as {{approximately}} Gaussian peaks. These peaks continue to broaden as they travel, {{in proportion to the}} square root of the distance traveled. For two substances to be resolved, they must migrate down the column at sufficiently different rates to overcome the effects of band spreading. Operating at high concentration, where the isotherm is curved, is disadvantageous in elution chromatography because the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> then depends on concentration, causing the peaks to spread and distort.|$|E

50|$|Supersonic {{travel is}} a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> {{of an object}} that exceeds {{the speed of sound}} (Mach 1). For objects {{traveling}} in dry air of a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) at sea level, this speed is approximately 343 m/s, 1,125 ft/s, 768 mph, 667 knots, or 1,235 km/h. Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5) are often referred to as hypersonic. Flights during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object, such as the ends of rotor blades, reach supersonic speeds are called transonic. This occurs typically somewhere between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.23.|$|E

The distance that ships of any type may travel will not precede more than eight hexes away from a populated planet that is owned by the same player; this limitation can be rescinded by research.|$|E

50|$|The first road {{locomotives}} {{started to}} emerge from the St Nicholas works in the late 1870s, with 14 engines specifically designed for the job of road haulage produced between 1878 and 1890. Following the changes to the Locomotive Act and Locomotive on Highways in 1896 the market for Road Locomotives expanded considerably. Charles Burrell & Sons Road Locomotives were slightly modified versions of their general-purpose engines to allow for faster <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> over long journeys. A general-purpose engine was designed to spend much of its life stationary, powering belt-driven equipment, whereas a road locomotive was constantly on the move, therefore subtle design differences were needed. These modifications included stronger drive shafts, gears and wheels; additional water-carrying capacity; generally a canopy was fitted; solid flywheels and additional platework around the engine's cylinder motion.|$|R
