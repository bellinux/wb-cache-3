5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic <b>rain</b> <b>showers,</b> accompanied by sustained winds of 20–25mph (32–40km/h) and gusts to 35mph (55km/h). In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to 9.2inches (235mm) {{of rain in}} 24hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island. Although the storm passed just 70miles (110km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6inches (15mm) of rain due to its small size.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. The session was held in dry weather conditions but dark clouds meant that there was a risk of further <b>rain</b> <b>showers.</b> With limited dry running in the final practice session grip, levels rose as qualifying progressed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} in the afternoon; heavy <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first quarter was scoreless, but Navy scored a {{touchdown}} on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near {{the end of the}} second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an interception at midfield, and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning field goal. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued standby signal No. 1 as Soudelor {{neared the}} region on July11. The {{following}} day, the signal {{was raised to}} strong wind No. 3 due {{to the possibility of}} landfall near the region. The signal was lowered back to No. 1 later that day before they were all canceled early on July12. The emergency response system was put at level four water-disaster in preparation for torrential rainfall from Soudelor. A red alert was also declared for the affected regions. Torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were inundated with flood waters. In Hong Kong, outer bands of Soudelor produced squally <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> on July11. About 20 trees reportedly fell within Hong Kong, one of which struck a mini bus terminal. The direct economic loss to china was estimated at about RMB 1.71billion, ($5.4 million 2009 USD).|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} was forecast to reach maximum strength as {{a tropical storm}} before weakening, and only the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's hurricane model predicted it to attain hurricane status. However, low amounts of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored further intensification. After being previously removed from the primary thunderstorm activity, the circulation became situated beneath a persistent area of deep convection. It is estimated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on September 15. The storm quickly developed banding features—spiral <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> of convection—as its convection formed into a central area of deep convection. These were all signs for further development, and Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 16. By September 17, the hurricane had finished an eyewall replacement cycle, meaning its original eye {{was replaced by a}} larger, better defined eye. As a result, it quickly intensified and attained major hurricane status. With a 23mile (37km) wide eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops, Kenneth strengthened to reach peak sustained winds of 135mph (215km/h), a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on September 18 about 1725miles (2790km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw him {{trying to get back}} to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point {{on his way to a}} new fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in the last part of the lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers set a time, albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at all during the session.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to safety}} {{issues such as}} aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions.

If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if {{more than half of the}} scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the inland}} areas can have summer {{temperatures}} over 100°F, the cold {{waters of the}} Pacific Ocean moderates coastal temperatures {{to an average of}} 60°F. The extreme vertical rise of the mountains create intense <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> (called orographic, meaning terrain-induced), caused by the lifting of storms as they approach the steep topography. The watersheds are flooded regularly as a result. There are weather anomalies here also; less coastal fog than other coastal parts of the state, and the prevailing wind is from the northeast-east instead of westerly.|$|E
25|$|After rookie orientation, a brief <b>rain</b> <b>shower</b> {{closed the}} track from 4:00 p.m. to 4:33 p.m. A total of 15 drivers {{completed}} 480 laps Saturday without incident.|$|R

The two games were interrupted multiple times by <b>rain</b> <b>showers.</b> The Padres won the first game, and led in the second, but lost in a come-from-behind victory for the Phillies in the tenth inning on an RBI single by Phillies closing pitcher Mitch Williams. The second game ended with an estimated 6,000 fans at the ballpark.|$|E
25|$|A squall is a sudden, sharp {{increase}} in wind speed that is usually associated with active weather, such as <b>rain</b> <b>showers,</b> thunderstorms, or heavy snow. Squalls refer {{to an increase in}} the sustained winds over a short time interval, as there may be higher gusts during a squall event. They usually occur in a region of strong mid-level height falls, or mid-level tropospheric cooling, which force strong localized upward motions at {{the leading edge of the}} region of cooling, which then enhances local downward motions just in its wake.|$|E

25|$|Pail closets, outhouses, and cesspits {{were used}} to collect human waste. The use of human waste as {{fertilizer}} was especially important in China and Japan, where cattle manure was less available. However, most cities {{did not have a}} functioning sewer system before the Industrial era, relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> to wash away the sewage from the streets. In some places, waste water simply ran down the streets, which had stepping stones to keep pedestrians out of the muck, and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.|$|E
25|$|While the {{appearance}} on Monday of some 18,000 was reasonable enough, given both the <b>rain</b> <b>showers</b> occurring {{early that morning}} and the large parade held downtown during the afternoon, neither the two days of the Labor Day meet nor the July 4 weekend races had come near to equaling the Memorial Day turnout. While potential explanations for the decline included the high heat of summer and {{the women of the}} city making family holiday plans that did not include automobile racing, one of the most likely, they reasoned, was an overabundance of the very events they exhibited: too many races had diluted turnout down to only those most interested in the sport.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bridge to}} cross the river was erected in 1867 by James Paterson, {{allowing}} for expansion {{on both sides of}} the river. Throughout the history of Charlton, the Avoca River has been known for its spontaneous flooding after heavy <b>rain</b> <b>showers,</b> resulting in many floods that often surrounded the town or on rare occasions flooded the town. Levee banks were constructed to their present levels in the 1950s, however parts of the town were flooded in September 2010. Minor flooding occurred again in December 2010, with the highest ever recorded flood level inundating the town in January 2011, with some homes within the town having more than 3 feet of water above floor level.|$|E
