[...] For each of these levels, Gee specifies key elements (present in the latter four learning principles): carefully prioritized information, relevant and applicable facts, {{and a set of}} <b>related</b> <b>skills</b> with which to construct strategies in a safe and authentic context.|$|E
2500|$|Tobacco {{and alcohol}} {{are the most}} common {{substances}} that elderly people get a dependence on or misuse. The next-most-common substance that elderly people develop a drug dependence to or misuse is benzodiazepines. Drug-induced cognitive problems can have serious consequences for elderly people and can lead to confusional states and [...] "pseudo-dementia". About 10% of elderly patients referred to memory clinics actually have a drug-induced cause that most often is benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines have also been linked to an increased risk of road traffic accidents and falls in the elderly. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines are still not fully understood in the elderly or any age group. Long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with attentional and visuospatial functional impairments. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead to improved alertness and decreased forgetfulness in the elderly. Withdrawal led to statistical significant improvements in memory function and performance <b>related</b> <b>skills</b> in those having withdrawn successfully from benzodiazepines, whereas those having remained on benzodiazepines experienced worsening symptoms. People having withdrawn from benzodiazepines also felt their sleep was more refreshing, making statements such as [...] "I feel sharper when I wake up" [...] or [...] "I feel better, more awake", or [...] "It used to take me an hour to fully wake up." [...] This suggests that benzodiazepines may actually make insomnia worse in the elderly.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{the sport}} {{psychologist}} is multifaceted. One element of this role is in using <b>relating</b> <b>skills.</b> This aspect has received little detailed attention in the sport psychology literature. In study I of the thesis, the roles of researcher and consultant were combined in an applied project with junior dlite archers. Findings from study I included using both task and ego-oriented (Duda, 1996) forms of elicitation in baseline assessment, adapting a performance profile (Butler, 1989) to be archery-specific and emphasising transfer of skills to help in other life domains. Reflections of the consultant's role included questioning the training involved in the <b>relating</b> <b>skills</b> of applied sport psychologists in the UK. A key consideration was dealing with 'issues {{not directly related to}} sport/performance' that were raised in consultations. The perceived prevalence and impact of these issues were examined further in study 2 by assessing the perceptions of athletes and other practitioners. The findings confirmed that these issues are raised in consultations and have a perceived impact on athletes' training and competition performances. Various <b>relating</b> <b>skills</b> (including counselling skills) were highlighted as important to the {{role of the}} sport psychologist. The terminology used by respondents required clarification on practitioners' understanding of these terms in order to address further the role of <b>relating</b> <b>skills</b> for sport psychologists. Study 3 explored practitioners' use of <b>relating</b> <b>skills,</b> their understanding of various relating terms, perceptions of the importance of counselling skills and implications for the training of sport psychologists via focus group methodology. A definition of 'interaction' was developed to complement the unique qualitative analysis of data from the focus groups. Many themes emerged which included the importance of listening and interpersonal skills to the role of applied sport psychologists. Perceptions of different types of counselling existed and most of the practitioners possessed <b>relating</b> <b>skills</b> based on their ‘craft' knowledge (McFee, 1993), this was contrasted with a notion of sport psychologists being 'formal' helpers (Egan, 1998) with 'professional' knowledge (Sch 6 n, 1983). There was a lack of clarity and diverging perceptions from the groups on various aspects of <b>relating</b> <b>skills</b> that sometimes caused underlying tensions to emerge. In conclusion, an integrated model of 'helping' for applied sport psychologists was presented which included the notion of adapting approaches and giving 'appropriate responses' based on a foundation of core <b>relating</b> <b>skills</b> developed from professional and craft knowledge. At the end of this thesis the researcher reflects on her conceptual and methodological journey, a route that encompassed different writing styles and legitimisation criteria. This journey includes a notion of development both as a researcher and consultant and in using different methodological and philosophical perspectives that were appropriate to the research questions...|$|R
