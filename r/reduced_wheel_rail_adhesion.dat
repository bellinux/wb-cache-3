The ability of an 'adhesion-hauled' locomotive to draw a train was much questioned at this time, as {{it was thought that}} the friction between a smooth iron <b>wheel</b> and the <b>rail</b> would be inadequate. Some designers, such as Blenkinsop with his Salamanca thought that a system of geared teeth would be necessary. Stephenson believed that, provided a good contact could be maintained between <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail,</b> frictional <b>adhesion</b> alone would be adequate.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear in the railway field is of {{fundamental}} importance to the safe and cost effective operation of the railways. Twin disc wear testing is used extensively for studying wear of <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> materials. The University of Huddersfield twin disc rig {{was used in this}} paper to examine the effect of surface conditions on <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear measurement under a range of wheel/rail contact conditions, with and without contaminants. This work focuses on an investigation of the effect of dry, wet, and lubricated conditions and the effect of contaminants such as sand on <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear. The <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear measurements were carried out by using a replica material and an optical profilometer that allows measurement of wear in difficult location with high accuracy. The results have demonstrated the rate at which both water and oil <b>reduce</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear. Scratches and other damage were seen on the <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> surfaces after the addition of sand and consequently both <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear damage rates increased under these conditions.

40|$|The work {{shows the}} use of a scaled roller rig to {{validate}} a real time wheel-rail contact code developed to study the <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>adhesion</b> and the wear evolution. The code allows the profiles to change at each time step in order {{to take into account the}} material loss due to the wear process. The contact code replicates a testing machine composed of a roller rig with a prototype of a single suspended wheelset pressed onto it with a variable load. In order to generate the tangential forces, responsible for the wear process during the tests, the roller rig has independent rollers powered by electric motors and a dedicated control. The first motor is moved at the reference speed, while the second one produces a traction/braking torque that generates a specific longitudinal creepage that is controlled during the test. The system also allows measurement of specific kinematical quantities and forces that are elaborated by the real-time code in order to produce numerical results for comparison with the experimental ones. In this way the contact algorithm can be validated and optimized referring to experimental data directly measured in real time. This approach can be applied both to the determination of wheel-rail adhesion and to the wear process. The test rig is also equipped with a laser profilometer that allows measurement of the <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> profiles with a very high accuracy. The initial profiles measured on the rig are used by the contact algorithm, where the wear model, based on Archard's method, is implemented, to estimate the profile evolution during the test. After a certain period of time the profiles are re-scanned and compared with the results of the simulation in order to adjust the wear rat...|$|R
50|$|Allowed CD is set {{below the}} value that would be allowed based on safety in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear and to reduce the rate of {{degradation}} of geometry of ballasted track. Choice of design CD will be less constrained by passenger comfort {{in the case of}} vehicles that have tilting capability. One historical approach to determining safe cant deficiency was the requirement that the projection to the plane of the track of the resultant of the centrifugal and gravitational forces acting on a vehicle fall within the middle third of the track gauge. Contemporary engineering studies would likely use vehicle motion simulation including cross wind conditions to determine margins relative to derailment and rollover.|$|R
40|$|The {{traction}} control in modern electric and diesel electric locomotives has allowed rail operators to utilise high traction adhesion levels without undue {{risk of damage}} from uncontrolled wheel spin. At the same time, some locomotive manufacturers have developed passive steering locomotive bogies to <b>reduce</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> wear and further improve locomotive adhesion performance on curves. High locomotive traction loads in curving are known to cause the loss of steering performance in passive steering bogies. At present there are few publications on the curving performance of locomotive steering with linkage bogies. The most extreme traction curving cases of low speed and high adhesion for hauling locomotives have not been fully investigated, with effects of coupler forces and cant excess being generally ignored. This paper presents a simulation study for three axle bogie locomotives in pusher and pulling train positions on tight curves. The simulation study uses moderate and high traction adhesion levels of 16. 6 % and 37 % for various rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed, showing forced steering bogies to have considerable advantages over self steering bogies. Likewise it is shown that self steering bogies are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As the required traction <b>adhesion</b> approaches the <b>rail</b> friction coefficient, steering performance of all bogies degrades and yaw of the bogie frame relative to the track increases. Operation with excess cant and tensile coupler forces are both found to be detrimental to the wear performance of all locomotive bogies, increasing the bogie frame yaw angles. Bogie frame pitching is also found to have significant effect on steering, causing increased performance differences between bogie designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adhesion}} {{in the field}} of rail transport represents an ability of tractive force transmission between <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail.</b> <b>Adhesion</b> characteristics is a property of tangential forces transmission between <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> and represents the dependence of tractive force T or adhesion coefficient μ on creep velocity w, or, divided by speed of travel, dependence on relative creep s. The ascending branch of adhesion characteristics is of great importance and acts as one of significant input parameters to drive regulation systems. It is needed to determine value of initial steepness (cTs or cμs) which is defined as an increment of tractive force or adhesion coefficient, respectively, related to a small increment of relative creep. Knowledge on the descending branch is no less important. Thorough understanding of related phenomena and limits of both parts of adhesion characteristics enables an effective exploitation of vehicle tractive and braking abilities. A theoretical model of the adhesion mechanism is briefly presented in the introduction to this paper. Following, description of a test stand of a tram wheel driven by a synchronous motor is given, as well as description of experiments conducted by the authors at it. Attention is paid to results of experimental research concerning identification of parameters of the ascending and the descending branch of adhesion characteristics. The paper summarizes this results and compares results of authors‘ own experiments to it...|$|R

Many factors have an influence on the adhesion process for these surfaces (e. g., environment, pollution, parameters and conditions of railway vehicle service, track, etc.). The paper focuses on different modelling aspects. Experimental investigation on the process of friction in the contact zone wasperformed. The data obtained were used to create a mathematical model. The adhesion, which is dependent on load from the <b>wheel</b> to the <b>rail,</b> temperature, friction conditions in the contact zone and wheel slip, was calculated.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} and the most important problems of the railway industry is wear. In some cases, the <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear is severe enough to spread to the adjacent rail profiles and damage the adjacent rail lines. It is noteworthy that the most destructive factor causing <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear, which can be significant and have negative consequences, is dynamic instability which is common to rail vehicles. Hence, different types of wear mechanisms, causes and the importance of preventing the emergence of any of them are fully examined. Identification of and reduction in the phenomenon, which can create the permanent deformation of the <b>rails,</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>wheel</b> life, <b>reduce</b> safety, increase maintenance time of the vehicle and thus reduce productivity and increase costs, require a good understanding of the wear mechanisms of the <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail.</b> This study investigated the phenomenon of the interaction between <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear, including influencing factors such as friction, adhesion, abrasive and ways to reduce these phenomena in contact such as lubrication were also introduced.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, {{substantial}} improvements were made to rail infrastructure worldwide. This was necessary to accommodate the ever increasing transportation demand and requirements. Nowadays, trains are required to transport heavier loads and to travel at higher speeds. One of the major improvements was achieved {{by the development of}} the off-flange curving bogie designs to <b>reduce</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear. Off-flange designs include passive steering and actively controlled steering. The development and implementation of self-steering bogies on locomotives was promoted in the early 1980 ’s by two major locomotive manufacturers. Up to date, thousands of these locomotives, with built-in self-steering bogies, have been manufactured and taken into service (Swenson, 1999). Most self-steering bogies have mechanical linkage systems to steer the wheel sets. As an alternative to the mechanical linkage system, the DCD Group (a South African manufacturer of rail and mining equipment) initiated the development of a Passive Hydraulic Steering (PHS) system. First PHS prototype systems, developed by DCD, have proven that huge wear reduction possibilities exist on both, <b>rails</b> and <b>wheels.</b> In addition the prototype systems also significantly decreased noise and vibration levels when negotiating tight corners (Swenson & Scott, 1996 and DCD Rolling Stock, 2012). However, existing prototype solutions require further improvements and development for optimisation. To be able to identify and implement improvements, the need exists to perform modelling and testing of the systems to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} operation and suitability of a complete unit. The aim of this research project is thus, to mathematically model an existing prototype PHS system and validate the model with data from experiments and tests. This model can then be used in order to improve and optimise performance, cost and reliability of the system, before mass production is considered. A literature survey was conducted, focusing on general <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear mechanisms, techniques to improve <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> life and on existing techniques for modelling the hydraulics and multi-body dynamics of locomotive systems. The literature survey was followed by extensive laboratory tests on component basis, a quarter PHS system and on the full PHS system. From these tests all parameters needed for the characterisation of the PHS and the mathematical model were determined. These tests also provided data for the validation of the PHS model. Finally, a mathematical model of the PHS system was successfully generated and validated. This model can now be used in a multi-body dynamic locomotive simulation to evaluate its effectiveness. The results and findings of the literature survey, experiments and modelling are reported on and discussed in this report.

40|$|<b>Wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear is a {{significant}} issue in railway systems. Accurate prediction of this wear can improve economy, ride comfort, prevention of derailment and planning of maintenance interventions.

However, prediction of <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear is still a great challenge for railway engineers and operators. The aim {{of this paper is to}} predict <b>wheel</b> wear and <b>rail</b> wear using an artificial neural network. Nonlinear Autoregressive models with exogenous input neural network (NARXNN) have been developed for <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear prediction.
