5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, {{it has been argued that}} Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E

Having thus--as far as we understand military matters--both its flanks covered and its rear protected, its position was one which we ourselves consider very comfortable.|$|R

5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V.

5|$|Russell {{is careful}} to {{indicate}} that his support for nationalisation <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assumption {{that it can be}} accomplished under the auspices of a robust democracy, and that it may be safeguarded against statist tyranny. If either condition fail, then nationalisation is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that nationalisation – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E
5|$|Sitric {{married an}} unnamed sister of Æthelstan in 926. Historians {{generally}} describe her as Æthelstan's only full sister, but Maggie Bailey {{points out that}} this <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> late testimony of William of Malmesbury, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no such distinction when recording her marriage to Sitric. William did not know her name, but traditions first recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century identify her as Saint Edith of Polesworth. The truth of his identification is debated, but regardless of her name {{it is likely that}} she entered a nunnery in widowhood. According to some late sources, such as the chronicler John of Wallingford, Amlaíb Cuarán was the son of Sitric and this West Saxon princess.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the stone}} taken from the castle was used to {{construct}} the mid-eighteenth-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, {{was said to have}} been built on castle foundations up to 4m (12ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old foundation wall. It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.|$|E

5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The only {{remaining}} {{parts of the}} medieval castle left today is the 10 metre (33feet) high motte, which <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highest point in the city, and some fragments of the surrounding earthworks. It {{is open to the}} public daily with no admission fee, and offers views over the historic buildings of the city. Both the motte and earthworks are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The site of the castle bailey and the 19th century prison is now occupied by the Cambridgeshire County Council's headquarters at Shire Hall, built in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E

5|$|Gernot Wilhelm saw no {{ground for}} Richter's {{assumption}} concerning {{the identification of}} the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports this assumption, and the Shattiwaza treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately in the treaty. It is a fact that Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no reason to suspect that Idanda ascended the throne {{as a result of the}} war. Jacques Freu likewise rejected Richter's hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.|$|E
5|$|In the four-armed form, a {{right hand}} holds a parashu (axe) and another makes an abhaya mudra (gesture of reassurance), {{or one of}} the right arms is {{slightly}} bent and <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E

The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E

5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always been {{somewhat}} loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and litigant from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the legal authorities recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E
5|$|After Wilfrid's {{return to}} Northumbria in about 658, Cenwalh, King of Wessex, {{recommended}} Wilfrid to Alhfrith, Oswiu's son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy. Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father's rule, {{and the most}} likely heir to his father's throne as his half-brothers were still young. Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, formed around a group of monks from Melrose Abbey, followers of the Irish monastic customs. Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs; Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled. Wilfrid introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into Ripon, claiming {{that he was the}} first person in England to make a monastery follow it, but this claim <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Vita Sancti Wilfrithi and does not say where Wilfrid became knowledgeable about the Rule, nor exactly what form of the Rule was being referred to. Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by Agilbert, Bishop of Dorchester in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex. Wilfrid was a protégé of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop. The monk Ceolfrith was attracted to Ripon from Gilling Abbey, which had recently been depopulated {{as a result of the}} plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there. Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
