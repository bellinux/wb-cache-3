5000|$|Two central {{interests}} of Wade's research program are population structure and epistasis. Interactions at {{the population and}} genetic levels are often non-additive. Thus, explaining and predicting many genetic and evolutionary phenomena in nature <b>require</b> <b>understanding</b> non-additive causal effects. As Richard Lewontin wrote, [...] "context and interaction are of the essence". In effect, Wade has found extensive empirical support, in the laboratory and in the field, for Sewall Wright's Shifting balance theory. Through significant mathematical modeling, Wade has also shown that Wright's theory is robust and explanatorily powerful. Wade's results, in concert with work by David Sloan Wilson, helped rekindle interest in group selection in the biological community.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{graduate}} student, Saxe demonstrated that a brain region {{known as the}} right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is specifically activated by ‘theory of mind’ tasks that <b>require</b> <b>understanding</b> the mental states of other people. [...] She continues to study this brain region, and has recently demonstrated that rTPJ is involved in moral judgments; in a task where subjects hear stories and evaluate the permissibility of the characters’ behavior, disruption of the rTPJ causes subjects to place less weight on the character’s intentions, and greater weight on the actual outcomes of their actions. [...] Individuals with autism show a similar pattern of responses, suggesting a possible role for rTPJ in the etiology of autism.|$|E

50|$|The yellow-headed amazon, yellow-naped amazon, orange-winged amazon, and turquoise-fronted amazon {{are some}} of the amazon parrot species which are {{commonly}} kept as pets. Amazon parrots, together with macaws and the African grey parrot, are all known for their exceptional vocal abilities, playfulness, and dexterity with their feet. Well-trained parrots can be loyal companions, and they can live for 50 years or sometimes more in captivity. However, some amazons - even well-trained ones - can become aggressive, possibly during mating season. To maintain health and happiness, pet parrots require much more training than domesticated animals such as dogs or even cats. They <b>require</b> <b>understanding,</b> manipulative toys, and rewards for good pet-like behavior, or they can develop quite aggressive behaviors. They have a strong, innate need to chew, thus require safe, destructible toys.|$|E
