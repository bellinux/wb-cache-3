25|$|Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a <b>routing</b> <b>protocol</b> for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a {{link state}} routing (LSR) {{algorithm}} and {{falls into the}} group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008).|$|E
25|$|Building a MANET {{is still}} {{untested}} under the OLPC's current configuration and hardware environment. Although one {{goal of the}} laptop {{is that all of}} its software be open source, the source code for this <b>routing</b> <b>protocol</b> is currently closed source. While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these options is yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless chip set and owner of the current meshing protocol software, will make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question. As of 2011, it has not done so.|$|E
25|$|OSPF was {{the first}} widely {{deployed}} <b>routing</b> <b>protocol</b> that could converge a network in the low seconds, and guarantee loop-free paths. It has many features that allow the imposition of policies about the propagation of routes {{that it may be}} appropriate to keep local, for load sharing, and for selective route importing more than IS-IS. IS-IS, in contrast, can be tuned for lower overhead in a stable network, the sort more common in ISP than enterprise networks. There are some historical accidents that made IS-IS the preferred IGP for ISPs, but ISP's today may well choose to use the features of the now-efficient implementations of OSPF, after first considering {{the pros and cons of}} IS-IS in service provider environments.|$|E

30|$|VANET is a {{secondary}} class of mobile ad hoc network (MANET) {{that uses the}} capabilities of new generation wireless networks for vehicles [20 – 22]. <b>Routing</b> <b>protocols</b> have been widely discussed in the literature regarding MANET, which were originally produced with a fixed or minimal node speed and a random topology, such as the random waypoint model. However, vehicles generally adhere to predicable routes and on road lanes, which allows them to travel at extremely high speeds. Accordingly, <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> of MANETs are not suitable for VANETs. Therefore, VANETs require new types of <b>routing</b> <b>protocols.</b> VANET <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> are classified into topology-based, position-based, cluster-based, geocast-based, multicast-based, and broadcast-based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols.</b> This section focuses on two types of <b>routing,</b> topology-based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> and position-based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols.</b>|$|R

[...] ASBRs typically also run an exterior <b>routing</b> <b>protocol</b> (e.g., BGP), or use static routes, or both. [...] An ASBR is used to distribute routes received from other, external ASs throughout its own autonomous system. An ASBR creates External LSAs for external addresses and floods them to all areas via ABR. Routers in other areas use ABRs as next hops to access external addresses. Then ABRs forward packets to the ASBR that announces the external addresses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wireless {{sensor network}} {{consists}} {{of thousands of}} tiny nodes. The nodes in network are directly connected. <b>Routing</b> <b>protocols</b> are used to discovering and maintaining route in network. There are mainly three types of <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> i. e. proactive, reactive and hybrid. They are further classified in flat based, hierarchical based and location based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols.</b> In this paper we discuss location based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols.</b> Here we briefly discuss existing <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> their advantages and disadvantages and also open research issue on them...|$|R
30|$|In position-based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols,</b> the {{location}} of all nodes and their neighboring nodes are determined through positioning devices such as GPS. Such protocols {{do not need to}} maintain routing tables or share information related to valid network links with their neighboring nodes. Routing decisions are made utilizing the information obtained from a GPS device. Better performance results are exhibited by these <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> as the route maintenance phase between the source and the destination is eliminated. The three categories of position-based <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> include non-delay-tolerant network (non-DTN) <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> [13, 18, 25, 26], delay-tolerant network (DTN) <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> [27], and hybrid <b>routing</b> <b>protocols</b> [28].|$|R

2500|$|As a {{link state}} <b>routing</b> <b>protocol,</b> OSPF {{establishes}} and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an adjacency database. Two OSPF routers are neighbors {{if they are}} members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information – the only packets they exchange are Hello packets. [...] OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if {{at least one of them}} is Designated Router or Backup Designated Router (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.|$|E
