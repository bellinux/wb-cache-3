40|$|In this paper, the recoil {{loops of}} SmCo 6. 6 Nb 0. 4 nanoflakes {{prepared}} by the surfactant-assisted {{high energy ball milling}} (SA-HEBM) were systematically studied. The <b>recoil</b> <b>loop</b> openness was observed in both the aligned and non-aligned samples. Reversible and irreversible portions of the demagnetization process derived from the <b>recoil</b> <b>loop</b> were also investigated. For both the aligned and non-aligned samples, reversible portion (▵mrev) is too small to determine the coercivity. Irreversible portion (▵mirrev) shows similar tendency, i. e. increasing slowly at low reverse field and then growing up rapidly after a critical field (nucleation field Hno). The demagnetization process can be described as following: the reversible demagnetization is dominant when the applied reverse field is lower than 8 kOe, under which the irreversible nucleation also occurs. The reverse domain walls are pinned by the grain boundaries until the reverse field is larger than 8 kOe. With increasing field, the pinning effects are weakened and the rapid reversible demagnetization starts. Finally, the demagnetization process is accomplished. The values of ΔM in the Henkel plots are totally opposite for the aligned and non-aligned SmCo 6. 6 Nb 0. 4 nanoflakes...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic Mn-Al-C (Ni) magnets are {{potential}} substitutes for Alnico 5 and 8. The limited machinability of the alloy {{and the fact}} that it is cobalt-free made it particularly interesting. The low Curie point and the costly warm extrusion process needed for grain orientation are drawbacks. The objective of this study was a detailed magnetic characterization of the material for possible use in electric machinery. The principal subjects of the study were the largest extruded bars presently available, of 31 mm diameter.

40|$|Hot-deformed Nd-Fe-B magnets with {{a larger}} maximum energy product at higher {{operating}} temperature are desirable {{in a wide range}} of applications but are very challenging to realize in a common "single phase" structure. Here, we show the macroscopic structural design in hot-deformed magnets by using two kinds of melt-spun powders with/without heavy rare earth. Higher coercivity with a remarkably improved maximum energy product is obtained in the separated multilayer magnet. We find that the multilayer structure can improve the c-axis alignment of platelet-shaped grains in each layer and propose the possible interlayer's long-range magnetic interaction explaining the <b>recoil</b> <b>loop</b> open of designed magnets, coupled with visible field-induced domain evolution. This experimental approach reveals exciting applications of structural design in ultrafine-grained hot-deformed magnets. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} behaviour of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) z ribbons with z = 7. 0 and 7. 5 is investigated. The Henkel plots {{indicate that}} there is a strong intergrain exchange coupling (IGEC) effect in these ribbons. It is the IGEC that results in the phenomena of the interaction domains and remanence enhancement in the ribbons at room temperature. The contributions of IGEC and dipolar interaction to irreversible magnetization have been analysed to explain the phenomenon of open <b>recoil</b> <b>loops.</b> Due to the difference of the intensity of the IGEC, the magnetization changes with the component of the Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) z ribbons...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new method based on the first-order-reversal-curve (FORC) diagram to extract the intrinsic (microscopic) switching-field distribution (SFD) of perpendicular recording media (PRM). To demonstrate {{the viability of the}} method, we micromagnetically simulated FORCs for PRM with known SFD and compare the extracted SFD with the SFD obtained by means of two different methods that are based on <b>recoil</b> <b>loops,</b> too, which however rely on mean-field approximations and assumptions on the shape of the SFD.

40|$|Atomic {{interdiffusion}} between FePt and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles in annealed FePt-based nanocomposite magnets {{has been}} studied by means of structural and magnetic characterizations. The {{results show that the}} Fe 3 Pt phase is formed during the annealing only when the mass ratio x of Fe 3 O 4 /FePt is larger than 1 / 20. When x � 1 / 20, only FePt single phase is formed. It is interesting to find that the coercivity of the annealed samples increases with a small addition of Fe 3 O 4 before the formation of the Fe 3 Pt phase. This magnetic hardening behaviour indicates that the composition of the FePt phase can be further adjusted via the post annealing process. The characteristic of <b>recoil</b> <b>loops</b> and Henkel plots also give evidence for the transition from single-phase FePt magnets to nanocomposite magnets with the addition of Fe 3 O 4.

40|$|Ultrahigh {{coercivity}} of hot-deformed Nd-Fe-B magnets {{was obtained}} by low melting point PrNd-Cu alloys diffusion process. The coercivity was largely increased from 15. 35 to 27. 30 kOe. Magnetic isolation by nonmagnetic phases should be the primary explanation for the enhancement of coercivity. High susceptibility of the recoil loops at low field indicated that magnetic domain wall motion within grains was easy, while a near-zero reversible susceptibility of recoil loops implied that domain wall strong pinning at grain boundaries was dominant at higher field in initial magnetization process. Open recoil loops were also obtained in the infiltrated magnets and disappeared when the external field exceeded about 16 kOe lightly higher than the coercivity of the magnet without diffusion process. The inhomogeneous distribution of infiltrated phases {{that led to the}} grains aggregation and single grains with softer and harder magnetic characteristics, respectively, may be the primary reason for the phenomenon. The stray field produced by isolated single grains plays a critical role in the magnetization behavior. A phenomenological model for the magnetization reversal was built to interpret the open recoil loops in a <b>recoil</b> <b>loop</b> process. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnets (PMs) are {{essential}} to an amazing variety of current and future devices, causing widespread interest in improving PM performance. A promising approach to improving PM performance is exchange-coupling between hard and soft magnetic phases. Exchange-coupling {{has been shown to}} improve the energy product of nano-composite magnets, compared to their single phase counterparts. This dissertation presents a simple and scalable material engineering route that produces exchange-coupling in nano-composite PMs. Notably, no rare-earth (RE) or precious metals are used. The composites are ferrite based. In one system, SrFe 12 O 19 is used as the hard phase and Fe 3 O 4 as the soft phase. In the second system SrFe 12 O 19 is the hard phase while Co is the soft phase, leading to oxide/metal nano-composites. In order to maximize the beneficial effect of exchange-coupling, a fine degree of mixing between the hard and soft phases is required. In order to achieve well intermixed phases at the nano-scale, soft phase precursor is precipitated on SrFe 12 O 19 flakes through heterogeneous precipitation by decomposition of urea. The soft phase precursor is reduced and core-shell hard/soft magnetic composite is synthesized. A clear processing window is established to control composition. This requires temperatures high enough to reduce the soft phase precursor, yet low enough to keep the hard/soft interphase reaction free, producing a hard/soft ratio that maximizes the energy product. The resulting nano-composite powder outperforms the energy product of pure hard phase, SrFe 12 O 19 by 37 %. The energy product of hard/soft magnetic nano-composite powder is further improved by applying a similar synthesis route to a SrFe 12 O 19 /Co composite (Co replacing Fe 3 O 4 as the soft phase). In order to optimize microstructure and composition ratio, the amount of Co precipitated on SrFe 12 O 19 is varied by controlling precipitation time and precipitation SrFe 12 O 19 :Co ratio. Synthesizing optimized SrFe 12 O 19 /Co composite powder leads to an energy product improvement of 162 % compared to pure SrFe 12 O 19 powder. Bulk dense nano-composite materials have been difficult to synthesize due to grain growth attributed from slow heating rates of traditional sintering techniques. High processing temperatures leads to high density, minimizing property diluting porosity. However, a thermodynamically favored reaction at elevated temperatures deprives the composite of improved magnetic properties. Core-shell SrFe 12 O 19 /Co nano-composite powders are processed into bulk samples through Current Activated Pressure Assisted Densification (CAPAD). Relatively high processing pressure and heating rates are taken advantage of during CAPAD and a processing window that leads to high density, as well as reaction free samples is established. The result is oxide/metal nano-composites, which {{would not have been possible}} though traditional sintering. The processing route developed produces bulk SrFe 12 O 19 /Co composite material with a 70 % improvement in energy product compared to the bulk SrFe 12 O 19.

40|$|The {{development}} of Mn-Al-C permanent magnets is reviewed. The general {{properties of the}} material are discussed and put into perspective relative to alnicos and ferrites.

40|$|Magnetization {{reversal}} {{mechanism is}} found to vary with cellular structures by a comparative study of the magnetization processes of three (Sm, Dy, Gd) (Co, Fe, Cu, Zr) (z) magnets with different cellular structures. Analysis of domain walls, initial magnetization curves and <b>recoil</b> <b>loops</b> indicates that the morphology of cellular structure has {{a significant effect on}} the magnetization process, besides the obvious connection to the difference of domain energy density between cell boundary phase (CBP) and main phase. The magnetization of Sample 2 (with a moderate cell size and uniformly continuous CBPs) behaves as a strong coherence domain-wall pinning effect to the domain wall and lead to a highest coercivity in the magnet. The magnetization of Sample 1 (with thin and discontinuous CBPs) shows an inconsistent pinning effect to the domain wall while that of Sample 3 (with thick and aggregate CBPs) exhibits a two-phase separation magnetization. Both the two cases lead to lower coercivities. A simplified model is given as well to describe the relationships among cellular structure and magnetization behavior. (C) 2017 Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, Pt- 3 Co {{alloy film}} is {{produced}} using a sputtering system. To understand the reversal {{mechanism of the}} Pt- 3 Co alloy film, the <b>recoil</b> <b>loops</b> from the major hysteresis loop have been measured. The reversible magnetization M-rev dependence of the irreversible magnetization M-irr exhibits a minimum when M-irr is slightly larger than zero, which is the characteristic of a material that contains domain walls bowing during reversal caused by localized pinning due to dipolar fields for the films. By analyzing the linear dependence of the coercivity on the anisotropy field at different temperatures, {{the strength of the}} local dipolar fields N-eff,N- which influences the creation of the reversed magnetic nucleus, is estimated. We found a positive value of N-eff, which indicates that reversal process is favored,by dipolar fields. It is also supposed that the dipolar fields originated from irregular local random anisotropy caused by residual stress, cavities, or inclusions, may be effective sources of pinning in the reversal process, and may strongly affect the coercivity of the film...|$|R
40|$|The Sm 2 Co 17 -based magnets {{are known}} for their large maximum energy product (BH) max and high {{temperature}} operation. A series of recent studies has been focused on the composition adjustment of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) 7. 5 - 8. 5 magnets to optimize them for high temperature applications. In these magnets the desired magnetic properties are obtained after a long and complicated heat treatment which is required to develop the proper microstructure with the well known cellular/lamellar feature. The microstructure consists of Th 2 Zn 17 -type structure (S. G. R- 3 m) cells rich in Fe, cell boundaries of CaCu 5 -type structure (S. G. P 6 /mmm) rich in Cu and the Zr-rich "Zphase" lamellae, superimposed on the cellular structure perpendicularly to the hexagonal c-axis. The coercivity is generally attributed to a pinning type mechanism: due to the difference in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the domain wall energy of the 2 : 17 and 1 : 5 phases, the domain walls are pinned at the 1 : 5 phase cell boundaries. In this thesis there have been prepared and studied new magnetic materials, based on Sm-Co compositions with boron, which are characterized by very high coercive field at room and higher temperatures without the need of a long heat treatment. New compounds have been produced mainly as melt spun nanostructured ribbons, by using the melt-spinning technique, and as bulks, by using the arc-melting technique. A bulk precipitation hardened sample has been also studied. Crystal structure analysis revealed new aspects about the structure of Z-phase. On the same sample a viscosity analysis has been performed at room temperature and the domain wall width has been calculated. In detail, nanostructured/nanocomposite melt spun ribbons with Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Zr 0. 04 Bx) 7. 5, με x= 0. 005, 0. 01, 0. 015 and Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 Bx) 7. 5, με x= 0. 005, 0. 01, 0. 015, 0. 025, 0. 03, 0. 04, 0. 05 stoichiometries have been prepared by the melt-spinning technique in the range of wheel velocity 5 to 70 m/sec. The bulk samples have been produced by arc-melting of Sm, Co, Fe, Cu, Zr and Fe 3 B metals. The nanostructured magnetic melt spun ribbons with boron, are characterized by very high coercive fields while their microstructure is completely different than the well known cellular/lamellar microstructure. The coercive field is associated with the ultrafine microstructure and strong exchange coupling between the “hard-hard” and “hard-soft” nanograins. Structural and magnetic properties have been studied on melt spun ribbons as a function of cooling rate, stoichiometry and annealing conditions. Rietveld analysis revealed that the main phase of as spun ribbons is 1 : 7 while after annealing above 750 οC transforms to 2 : 17 and 1 : 5. In most of the cases a small amount of fcc-Co has been found mostly {{on the surface of the}} ribbons. As spun ribbons have very high coercive field iHc with the greatest value to be 38 kOe at room temperature while the reduced remanence mr is over 0. 7. The annealed ribbons Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 B 0. 04) 7. 5 at 39 m/sec have coercive field of about 5 kOe at 400 οC. The temperature variation does not deteriorate the coercive field. The ribbons Sm(Co 0. 69 Fe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 B 0. 05) 7. 5 at 40 m/sec after annealing at 850 οC for 10 min have high coercive field (16 kOe) and maximum energy product of 7. 9 MGOe at room temperature. The as spun ribbons Sm(Co 0. 725 Fe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 B 0. 015) 7. 5 at 70 m/sec at 327 οC has (ΒΗ) max = 4. 4 MGOe at reversed field of 1. 4 kOe while Br is 5. 6 kG. After demagnetization factor correction, by using Νd~ 0. 555, the (ΒΗ) max is ~ 9. 1 MGOe at 2. 4 kOe, which is very high. Magnetic induction Br, at the same temperature, is 6. 8 kG. At 377 οC, the (ΒΗ) max is 3. 2 MGOe at 1. 4 kOe and Br is 5. 1 kG. After demagnetization factor correction, Νd~ 0. 555, (ΒΗ) max is ~ 8. 8 MGOe at 2. 4 kOe while Br is 7. 4 kG. These unique values are for the first time observed on not annealed or short time annealed nanostructured ribbons or powders. The precipitation hardened bulk sample with boron Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04) 7. 5 has the well known celluler/lamellar microstructure with cell size of about 70 nm and lamella density of 0. 06 nm- 1. By analyzing the x-ray diffraction patterns by using the Rietveld method, the thermomagnetic curves and the selected area diffraction by using TEM, the 1 : 5, 2 : 17 R and 6 : 23 phases were found Σ. Σ. Μακρίδης – Διδακτορική διατριβή vi to be the characteristic crystal structures. The 6 : 23 structure has been proposed for the first time to be the structure type of the lamellar phase. Hysteresis loops have been traced in the range of 4. 2 K to 850 K. The magnetization fluctuations have also been studied as a function of time at room temperature under constant reversed field while <b>recoil</b> <b>loops</b> have been traced at the same fields. As a result, magnetic viscosity constants, fluctuation fields and thermal activation volumes have been calculated on the reversed field values. On the coercive field, the activation volume is V*= 4 ? 10 - 19 cm 3 at 300 Κ. The domain wall width at the coercive field is close to 8 nm. As the temperature decreases from 250 Κ (Ηc~ 20 kOe) to 4. 2 Κ (Ηc~ 50 kOe), the demagnetization curve has a characteristic small step due to the weaker exchange coupling between the phases. The coercive field has normal temperature dependence with Hc= 8 kOe at 700 K. The magnetic viscosity study on the isotropic sample in parallel with the Rietveld analysis on the diffraction pattern is an original investigation. For the first time phase percentages of 1 : 5, 2 : 27 and 6 : 23 have been calculated while 6 : 23 has been identified as the structure of lamellar phase. ...|$|R
