40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{over the past decade}} find that US {{monetary}} policy generates asymmetric effects on regional economies. These studies further find that the variation in industry composition across US regions is a key reason for these regional effects of monetary policy. One implication from these findings is that should a US <b>region</b> <b>undergo</b> a major <b>restructuring</b> of its economy that region would likely find its response to monetary policy shocks to change as well. This possibility is explored in this article by examining the regional effect of monetary policy shocks during and after the dramatic economic transformations of the American South in the twentieth century...|$|R

Central {{focus is on the}} links between local‐ area poverty, industrial structure and racial/ethnic composition, and the spatial and temporal dimensions of the linkages. During the study period, the <b>region</b> <b>underwent</b> significant industrial <b>restructuring</b> and dramatic change in racial/ethnic concentration. Using newly developed statistical methods for spatial‐temporal regression, we explore hypotheses related to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the complex relationship between poverty, industrial structure, and race/ethnicity.

40|$|University {{researchers}} are now {{considered by many}} as key actors {{in the building of}} knowledge economies in their regions, as universities are assumed to be important engines of regional economic well-being. Yet within the academy not all faculty are accepting of these roles for their institutions, for a variety of reasons. We measure faculty attitudes towards their universities being involved in (a) assisting regional economic development and (b) the commercialization of knowledge more generally using web-based surveys. Then using secondary data from a variety of sources, we attempt to explain the variation in attitudes among faculty in terms of: (i) individual attributes and professional experiences, (ii) scholarly disciplinary of the faculty member, (iii) institutional characteristics of their respective university, and (iv) regional economic conditions. Using ordered logit models, we test to see if faculty view a distinction in appropriateness of universities assisting economic development versus appropriateness of the commercialization of knowledge, whether there are differences between U. S. and EU faculty in their attitudes towards each type of activity, and whether faculty in <b>regions</b> <b>undergoing</b> industrial <b>restructuring</b> or in economic distress have more favorable attitudes towards each activity. Results to-date indicate that faculty have more favorable attitudes towards their universities assisting regional economic development compared to commercialization of knowledge, that universities individual and disciplinary variables are more important than institutional and regional economic variables, and that there are strong similarities in attitudes between U. S. and EU faculty attitudes, but with a few interesting exceptions. ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} {{the divorce}} rate in the Czech Republic after the year 1989. The first chapter {{is devoted to the}} definition of basic terms. Divorce is the legal dissolution of marriage during the life of spouses. Divorce is the dissolving of the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law. Divorce is a social phenomenon reflecting the family stability, there is a transformation of traditional behavioural patterns, moral criteria and economic incentives. Since 1989 till present {{the divorce rate}} in the Czech Republic is at a high level. The second chapter of the theoretical part evaluates the development and current situation of divorce rate in our country. It is divided into three subsections: Influencing factors of divorce, causes of divorce and divorce rates in Europe. The aim of this diploma thesis is the evaluation of the development of causes of the divorce in the Czech population, capturing the specifics of the development of divorce in the new socio - economic conditions after 1989. With regard to the objective of the diploma thesis I set three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Compared with other EU countries in the Czech Republic the divorce rate persists at a high level after 1989. Hypothesis 2 : The divorce rate varies by region in the Czech Republic. It is the highest in <b>regions</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>restructuring</b> of the economy, with high unemployment rate and social problems. Hypothesis 3 : The divorce rate is high in big cities and on the contrary low in traditional, predominantly, rural regions with a stable population. I conducted a quantitative research in the form of data analysis. The main source of the data was the Czech Statistical Office and Eurostat. I have analysed and compared the data which reveal the divorce rate in the Czech Republic and the EU in 2011 and the development of divorce from the year 1989. The data were analysed by correlation and spatial analysis and to compare the data I used the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results show that the divorce rate in the Czech Republic in comparison with other EU countries after 1989 remains at a high level. Crude divorce rate since 1989 is around 3. 0 divorces per 1000 inhabitants, which represents one of the highest divorce rates among EU countries. The divorce rate in the Czech Republic {{was one of the few}} demographic processes that were the least affected by the economic and social transformations after 1989. According to the results of the data analysis for the year 2011 I have verified, that the divorce rate in the Czech Republic is territorially differentiated, varies in different regions, cities and rural areas. High crude divorce rate is in districts <b>undergoing</b> <b>restructuring</b> of the economy and as a result there is a high rate of unemployment and social problems are emerging. The highest divorce rate in 2011 was in Česká Lípa. Conversely, the lowest crude divorce rate is the less populated districts, with a stable population and a high proportion of religious people. In 2011, the lowest crude divorce rate was in the district of Jihlava. Religion had the most statistically significant effect on the divorce rate. In districts with a higher proportion of religious people the crude divorce rate is lower than in districts with a lower proportion of religious people...|$|R

40|$|We analyze a large {{database}} {{collected from}} newspaper articles that report on major episodes of corporate restructuring in Japan between 1981 and 2007. By linking this database with financial data on public firms, we identify {{changes in the}} likelihood that a distressed <b>undergoes</b> <b>restructuring,</b> as well as in some measures adopted during restructuring. We find that the way distressed Japanese firms are restructured has changed during this period. The likelihood that a large distressed firm with high levels of debt <b>undergoes</b> <b>restructuring</b> has declined. Those firms that <b>undergo</b> <b>restructuring</b> continue to adopt more aggressive measures in terms of layoffs and cutbacks than other distressed firms, suggesting that "restructuring", when it happens, involves real adjustments. Banks continue to be important for firms with a clearly identified main bank, and the main bank is more likely to push for more drastic reductions in debt and bank loans than other entities leading a restructuring event...|$|R
