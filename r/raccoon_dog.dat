40|$|Carcasses of red foxes (n= 256) and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (n= 253) were {{collected}} throughout Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania (north-east Germany) between August 2004 and January 2007. Frequency of occurrence (FO) and biomass share (BS) were estimated for fifteen and seven food categories, respectively. Diet analyses indicate that both canids are omnivorous and pursue opportunistic feeding strategies. Small mammals (BS= 31. 2, FO= 38. 7) and vegetable matter (BS= 51. 3, FO= 63. 1) {{were the most}} important food resources for red foxes and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs,</b> respectively. Interspecies differences were recorded for vegetable matter, small mammals and insects. While red foxes mostly feed on voles, <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> consumed mice and shrews as often as voles. However, unlike red foxes, <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> did not use small mammals intensively all year round. Only <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> preyed on amphibians. There were no differences in carrion consumption between red foxes (BS= 21. 2) and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (BS= 18. 2). Both red foxes (FO= 8. 4) and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (FO= 8. 0) scavenged on wild boar. Moreover, there was evidence that two red foxes foraged on <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and vice versa. Mean annual interspecies diet overlap indices were high. We found clear competition for carrion year-round. The diets determined for <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and red foxes were quite similar and a similar food niche breadth was recorded.

5|$|Japan {{has nine}} forest {{ecoregions}} which reflect {{the climate and}} geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese <b>raccoon</b> <b>dog,</b> the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. <b>Raccoon</b> <b>dog</b> is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of Giardia genotypes {{was investigated in}} 18 <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and 80 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on one farm. To demonstrate Giardia cysts, fresh and trichrome stained smears were microscopically screened. Two molecular markers were used for Giardia genotyping: a fragment of the beta-giardin gene and a fragment of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene. All faecal samples obtained from red foxes were negative. [i]Giardia[/i] cysts were identified only in 2 of the 18 <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs.</b> The result of genotyping and phylogenetic analysis showed that the G. duodenalis from both <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> belonged to the D assemblage. This finding of a new animal reservoir of G. duodenalis canids-specific genotypes is important in order to eliminate the risk of infecting other animals bred for fur.

40|$|A {{survey was}} done {{in an attempt to}} {{investigate}} the epidemiological status of Echinococcus multilocularis in red foxes and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> in Otaru city from June to September 1999. Sixty-seven red foxes (Vulpes vulpes schrencki) and 13 <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (Nyctereutes procyonoides albus) were captured, and postmortem examinations were conducted with them. Thirty-eight red foxes (56. 7 %) and 3 <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (23. 1 %) were found to be infected with E. multilocularis. The total biomass of E. multilocularis in all infected red foxes and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> were 2, 817, 000 and 1, 515 worms, respectively. Nine of the infected red foxes harboring more than 100, 000 worms accounted for 90. 6 % of the total biomass. No significant differences in the prevalence were observed between male and female, and juvenile and adult. However, the worm burden was higher in juvenile than in adult foxes. In one of the infected <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs,</b> mature worms and eggs of E. multilocularis were found in the intestine and fecal sample, respectively. This result suggested that the <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> are probably playing a small role in the egg contamination of the environment. The validity of coproantigen ELISA for diagnosis of foxes was confirmed by comparing the results of autopsy, egg examination and coproantigen ELISA using rectal fecal samples...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 15 red foxes, 15 <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs,</b> 15 {{domestic}} dogs and 15 domestic cats were each infected with 20, 000 protoscolices of Echinococcus multilocularis. At 35, 63, and 90 days post inoculation (dpi), five animals from each group were necropsied and the worm burdens determined. The highest worm burdens in foxes (mean of 16, 792) and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (mean of 7930) {{were found at}} 35 dpi. These declined to a mean of just 331 worms in foxes and 3213 worms in <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> by day 63 with a further decline to 134 worms in foxes and 67 worms in <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> by day 90. In dogs, {{there was no significant}} difference between worm burdens recovered at days 35 (mean of 2466) and day 90 (mean of 1563), although reduced numbers were recovered on day 63 (mean of 899). In cats, worms were found in four animals 35 dpi (mean of 642), in three at 63 dpi (mean of 28) and in two at 90 dpi (mean of 57). Faecal egg counts were determined at 3 day intervals from 25 dpi. A mathematical model of egg excretion dynamics suggested that the mean biotic potential per infected animal was high in foxes (346, 473 eggs); <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> (335, 361 eggs) and dogs (279, 910 eggs) but very low for cats (573 eggs). It also indicated that approximately 114, 42 and 27 eggs per worm were excreted in the faeces of <b>dogs,</b> <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and foxes, respectively. The fecundity of worms in cats was low with an average of less than one egg per worm. The peak levels of coproantigen were detected earlier in foxes and <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> than in dogs. Eggs recovered from foxes, <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs resulted in massive infections in experimental mice. However, metacestodes did not develop from eggs originating from infected cats. It is concluded that foxes, <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs are good hosts of E. multilocularis. In contrast, the low worm establishment, the very few excreted eggs and the lack of infectivity of eggs strongly indicate that cats play an insignificant role in parasite transmission...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and red foxes are well-adapted hosts for Trichinella spp. The aims of {{this study}} were to {{estimate}} Trichinella infection prevalence and biomass and to investigate which Trichinella species circulated in these indicator hosts in Estonia. Methods From material collected for evaluating the effectiveness of oral vaccination program for rabies eradication in wildlife, samples from 113 <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and 87 red foxes were included in this study. From each animal, 20  g of masseter muscle tissue was tested for the presence of Trichinella larvae using an artificial digestion method. The Trichinella larvae were identified to species level by multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. Results The majority of tested animals were infected with Trichinella spp. The parasite species identified were T. nativa and T. britovi. The apparent infection prevalence was 57. 5 % in <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and 69. 0 % in red foxes, which were higher than previous estimates. In addition, the larval burden had also increased in both hosts. We estimated that in 2011 – 2012, the Trichinella spp. biomass was more than 15 times higher in <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and almost two times higher in red foxes than in 1992 – 2000 (based on mean larval burden), and almost 20 times higher in <b>raccoon</b> <b>dogs</b> and almost five times higher in red foxes than in 2000 – 2002 (based on median larval burden).
