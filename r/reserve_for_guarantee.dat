40|$|MPLS-Based Best-Effort Traffic Engineering Jerapong Rojanarowan 120 Pages Directed by Dr. Henry L. Owen The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a multipath traffic engineering framework for best-effort traffic in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks so as to deliver more equal shares of bandwidth to best-effort users as compared to the traditional shortest-path algorithm. The proposed framework is static and the input to the traffic engineering algorithm is restricted to network topology. Performance evaluation of this framework is conducted by simulation using ns- 2 network simulator. In a multi-service capable network, some portion of the bandwidth is <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>guaranteed</b> services and the leftover portion is dedicated to best-effort service. This research examines the problem of traffic engineering for the remaining network bandwidth that is utilized by best-effort traffic where demands are not known a priori. This framework will result in making the limited available best-effort traffic bandwidth more equitably shared by the best-effort flows over a wide range of demands. Traditional traffic engineering research has not examined best-effort traffic. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract — A {{number of}} schemes have been {{proposed}} for providing differentiated QoS in optical burst-switched (OBS) networks. Most existing schemes {{are based on a}} relative QoS model in which the service requirements for a given class of traffic are defined relative to the service requirements of another class of traffic. In this paper, we propose an absolute QoS model that provides an upper-bound guarantee on the loss probability <b>for</b> the <b>guaranteed</b> traffic. We describe two mechanisms <b>for</b> providing loss <b>guarantees</b> at OBS core nodes: an early drop mechanism, which probabilistically drops non-guaranteed traffic, and a wavelength grouping mechanism, which <b>reserves</b> wavelengths <b>for</b> <b>guaranteed</b> traffic. It is shown that combining these two mechanisms outperforms other approaches in providing loss guarantees, while also reducing the loss for non-guaranteed traffic. We then discuss admission control and resource provisioning for OBS networks, and propose a path clustering technique to further improve the network throughput. We develop analytical loss models for the different proposed approaches and verify the results by simulation...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} capacity and complexity of semiconductor technology, current design for System-on-Chip (SoC) faces big challenges from many aspects, such as Deep SubMicron (DSM) Effects, Global Synchrony, Communication Architecture, etc. Network-on-Chip (NoC) is an emerging achievement {{in recent years to}} tackle with the crisis of communications within large VLSI systems implemented on a single silicon chip. The way to schedule the traffic flows between different modules such as processor cores, memories and specialized intellectual property(IP) blocks became a important problem in NoC research. This thesis presents a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) virtual circuit based strategy that minimizes resource usage by exploiting routing flexibilities offered by modern NoCs. In previous work, scheduling solutions however have two major limited factors. Firstly, they often do not consider all the flexible routings of NoCs; and on the other hand, make bandwidth reservations <b>for</b> throughput/latency <b>guaranteed</b> connections that are unnecessarily conservative. In our project, to illustrate the first point, we use a Breadth-first Search (BFS) with Branch and Bound routing scheme to explore all the candidate paths with minimum length. For the second point, we proposed a TDM approach that not <b>reserves</b> bandwidth <b>for</b> <b>guaranteed</b> servic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{framework}} for integrated scheduling of continuous media (CM) and other applications. The framework, called ARC scheduling, consists of a rate-controlled on-line CPU scheduler, an admission control interface, a monitoring module, and a rate adaptation interface. ARC scheduling allows threads to <b>reserve</b> CPU time <b>for</b> <b>guaranteed</b> progress. It provides firewall protection between threads such that the progress guarantee to a thread is independent of how other threads actually make scheduling requests. Rate adaptation allows a CM application to adapt its rate to changes in its execution environment. We have implemented the framework as an extension to Solaris 2. 3. We present experimental results which show that ARC scheduling is highly effective for integrated scheduling of CM and other applications in a general purpose workstation environment. ARC scheduling is {{a key component of}} an end system architecture we have designed and implemented to support networking with quality of service guarantees. In particular, it enables protocol threads to make guaranteed progress.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} life insurance products to have emerged in recent years in the Romanian insurance market has been the unit-linked contract. Unit-linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. A unit-linked life insurance has two important components: protection and investment. The protection component refers to the insured sum in case of the occurrence of insured risks and the investment component refers to the policyholders’ account that represents the present value of the units from the chosen investment funds. Due to the financial instability caused by the Global Crisis and the amplification of market competitiveness, insurers from international markets have started to incorporate guarantees in unit-linked products. So a unit- linked life insurance policy with an asset value guarantee is an insurance policy whose benefit payable on death or at maturity consists of the greater of some guaranteed amount and the value of the units from the investment funds. One {{of the most}} challenging issues concerns the pricing of minimum death benefit and maturity benefit guarantees and the establishing of proper <b>reserves</b> <b>for</b> these <b>guarantees.</b> Insurers granting guarantees of this type must estimate the cost and include the cost in the premium. An important component of the activity carried out by the insurance companies is the investment of the premiums paid by policyholders in various types of assets, in order to obtain higher yields than those guaranteed by the insurance contracts, while providing the necessary liquidity for the payment of insurance claims in case of occurrence of the assumed risks. So the guaranteed benefits can be broadly matched or immunized with various types of financial assets, especially with fixed-interest instruments. According to Romanian legislation which regulates the unit-linked life insurance market, unit-linked life insurance contracts pass most of the investment risk to the policyholder and involve no investment risk for the insurer. Although the Romanian legislation authorizes the Romanian insurers to offer unit-linked contracts without investment guarantees, this research provides a proposal of a theoretical and empirical basis for pricing the unit-linked insurance contracts with incorporated investment guarantees...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{performance}} has improved year by year. As a result, multimedia applications can be executed {{on a computer}} simultaneously. However multimedia applications sometimes can not provide a good service because multimedia applications compete with themselves to get computer resources. For this reason, computer resources need to be <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> multimedia applications to provide a good service. Besides, {{there are a lot}} of service applications that consist of multi process. Thus multi process need to be a unit of resource reservation to provide a service of appropriate quality. We call multi process a process group. In this paper, we propose execution that is a unit of processor time assignment. In addition we propose a mechanism <b>for</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> processing time of process groups by executions. 1...|$|R
40|$|QoS is {{essential}} in MANET to satisfy the communication constraints. Due to the fully mobile infrastructure and limited resources provided by the MANETs, qos techniques need to optimize the scarce resource. To meet the qos requirements of the applications, multicast routing protocols are required to construct the routes, with the qos being guaranteed. Previous qos routing/multicast routing protocols adopted some algorithms, {{but it does not}} guarantee that an admitted application receives the resources that were available from the network. So we propose a new protocol QoS-MAODV that extends MAODV with the qos support using the architecture of two–layered qos model (2 Lqos). QoS-MAODV makes use of network layer metrics for the path discovery to balance the routing load and the consumption of resources. The application layer metrics is then used for the selection of the path based on the qos state of the path and the application requirements. Also the network resources is <b>reserved</b> and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>for</b> an admitted application using the diffserv architecture proposed for Internet. Simulation results show that the performance has been enhanced and the qos constraints have been satisfied when compared with MAODV. Key words...|$|R

These differences stem from the distinct environments in which FHA and PMIs operate, including the particular accounting principles and statutory provisions that they must follow.

The generation of revenue, to recover costs and provide profit, and the multiple type of services offered will require that new pricing policies be implemented.

The policy is based on a set of specific criteria, and the charges for any channel are based on the resources <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> use by the channel. This reservation charge is based on the type of service requested, the time of day during which the channel exists, and the lifetime of the channel. We argue that the traditional resources are not sufficient to determine a fair reservation charge for a channel offering guaranteed delay bounds, and we introduce the notion of a delay resource in our charging formula.
