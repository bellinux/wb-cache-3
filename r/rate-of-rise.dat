50|$|Each type of heat {{detector}} has its advantages, and it cannot {{be said that}} one type of {{heat detector}} should always be used instead of another. If one were to place a <b>rate-of-rise</b> heat detector above a large, closed oven, then every time the door is opened a nuisance alarm could be generated due to the sudden heat transient. In this circumstance the fixed threshold detector would probably be best. If a room filled with highly combustible materials is protected with a fixed heat detector, then a fast-flaming fire could exceed the alarm threshold due to thermal lag. In that case the <b>rate-of-rise</b> heat detector may be preferred.|$|E
50|$|When {{regeneration}} {{is complete}} the cryopump will be roughed to 50μTorr (50 microTorr), isolated, and the <b>rate-of-rise</b> (ROR) will be monitored {{to test for}} complete regeneration. If the ROR exceeds 10μTorr/min the cryopump will require additional purge time.|$|E
50|$|A short-line-fault TRV is {{characterized}} by a <b>rate-of-rise</b> that is proportional to the slope of current at the time of interruption and therefore to the amplitude of the short-circuit current : , where Z is the surge impedance of the line.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rate-of-Rise</b> (ROR) heat {{detectors}} {{operate on a}} rapid rise in element temperature of 12° to 15°F (6.7° to 8.3°C) increase per minute, irrespective of the starting temperature. This type of heat detector can operate at a lower temperature fire condition than would be possible if the threshold were fixed. It has two heat-sensitive thermocouples or thermistors. One thermocouple monitors heat transferred by convection or radiation while the other responds to ambient temperature. The detector responds when the first sensing element's temperature increases relative to the other.|$|E
50|$|A short-line-fault is a {{fault that}} occurs {{on a line}} a few hundred meters to several {{kilometers}} down the line from the circuit breaker terminal. As shown on Figure 5, the TRV is characterized, in its initial part, by a steep <b>rate-of-rise</b> due to a high-frequency oscillation produced by travelling waves that travel {{on the line with}} positive and negative reflections at the circuit breaker terminal and at the fault point, respectively. The superposition of these travelling waves gives the voltage profiles on the line shown on Figures 6 to 14 with, on the horizontal axis, the circuit breaker terminal position on the left and the short-circuit point on the right.|$|E
50|$|Allowing for a {{grandfather}} clause {{that did not}} require schools to retrofit to a new standard if they already met previous regulations, the school legally complied {{with the state of}} Illinois and city of Chicago fire codes of 1958 and was generally clean and well-maintained; nonetheless, several fire hazards existed. Each classroom door had a glass transom above it, which provided ventilation into the corridor but also permitted flames and smoke to enter once heat broke the glass. The school had one fire escape. The building had no automatic fire alarm, no <b>rate-of-rise</b> heat detectors, no direct alarm connection to the fire department, no fire-resistant stairwells, and no heavy-duty fire doors from the stairwells to the second floor corridor. At the time, fire sprinklers were primarily found in factories or in new school construction, and the modern smoke detector did not become commercially available until 1969.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} when {{there is little or}} no primary {{resistance}} and little or no switch resistance, the increase of the magnetizing current Im is a [...] "linear ramp" [...] defined by the formula in the first paragraph. In {{the case when}} there is significant primary resistance or switch resistance or both (total resistance R, e.g. primary-coil resistance plus a resistor in the emitter, FET channel resistance), the Lp/R time constant causes the magnetizing current to be a rising curve with continually decreasing slope. In either case the magnetizing current Im will come to dominate the total primary (and switch) current Ip. Without a limiter it would increase forever. However, in the first case (low resistance), the switch will eventually be unable to [...] "support" [...] more current meaning that its effective resistance increases so much that the voltage drop across the switch equals the supply voltage; in this condition the switch is said to be [...] "saturated" [...] (e.g. this is determined by a transistor's gain hfe or [...] "beta"). In the second case (e.g. primary and/or emitter resistance dominant) the (decreasing) slope of the current decreases to a point such that the induced voltage into the secondary is no longer adequate to keep the switch closed. In a third case, the magnetic [...] "core" [...] material saturates, meaning it cannot support further increases in its magnetic field; in this condition induction from primary to secondary fails. In all cases, the rate of rise of the primary magnetizing current (and hence the flux), or the <b>rate-of-rise</b> of the flux directly in the case of saturated core material, drops to zero (or close to zero). In the first two cases, although primary current continues to flow, it approaches a steady value equal to the supply voltage Vb divided by the total resistance(s) R in the primary circuit. In this current-limited condition the transformer's flux will be steady. Only changing flux causes induction of voltage into the secondary, so a steady flux represents a failure of induction. The secondary voltage drops to zero. The switch opens.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{comparison}} of rotational energy loss measurements in the same non-oriented Fe–Si laminations carried out by two laboratories Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Torino, Italy and Wolfson Centre for Magnetics (WCM) in Cardiff, United Kingdom. The measurements were performed on disk samples at magnetizing frequencies between 5 and 200 Hz with controlled circular flux density loci ranging between 0. 2 and 1. 9 T. Energy loss was measured applying both the fieldmetric and the <b>rate-of-rise</b> of temperature methods. The latter, exploiting the rate of rise of temperature under quasi-adiabatic conditions, is conveniently adopted on approaching magnetic saturation. Results from the two laboratories agree well up to 1. 4 T, despite the different physical principles of the fieldmetric vs. <b>rate-of-rise</b> of temperature methods and the different size of sample and measuring areas. The <b>rate-of-rise</b> of temperature method {{seems to be the}} natural approach at high induction values...|$|E
40|$|DC urban light railway {{systems are}} used as public {{transportation}} systems in many towns worldwide. In these systems, short circuit currents are often similar, both in steady state magnitude and in <b>rate-of-rise,</b> to normal operation currents. In order to properly set the protection relays, to obtain short circuit discrimination and to avoid nuisance trippings, {{it is important to}} analyse short circuit and normal operation current patterns. This paper presents the results of measurement campaigns performed for this purpose on the tram network of Turin, in Northern Italy...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a grounding system can be predicted by using either the electrical equivalent circuit models or electromagnetic computation. Despite its advantages over the latter, the equivalent circuit model fails to accurately predict the behavior under transient conditions due {{to the absence of}} two key factors, namely: 1) the current <b>rate-of-rise</b> and 2) soil ionization. This paper proposes a method to enhance the performance of the equivalent circuit model by taking into consideration of both mentioned factors. It is discovered that by using the proposed method, the estimated values of and of the equivalent circuit model are improved. The computed inductance dynamically changes with the change in the lightning current parameters, thus improving its accuracy for all current <b>rate-of-rise</b> conditions. The soil ionization effect is implemented as recommended by CIGRE, and this further improves the accuracy of the model. As a result, the voltage response of the model becomes more accurate and comparable to the electromagnetic computation results. Another important feature of the proposed model is that it can be directly applied or connected to power system equipment. Thus, an accurate grounding system effect on the transient performance of key power equipment, such as surge arresters, can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Space flight {{by means}} of wormholes is {{described}} whereby the traditional rocket propulsion approach can be abandoned {{in favor of a}} new paradigm involving the manipulation of spacetime. Maccone (1995) extended Levi-Civita’s 1917 magnetic gravity solution to the Morris and Thorne (1988) wormhole solution and claimed that static homogeneous magnetic/electric fields can create spacetime curvature manifesting itself as a traversable wormhole. Furthermore, Maccone showed that the speed of light through this curvature region is slowed by the magnetic (or electric) induced gravitational field there. Maccone’s analysis immediately suggests a way to perform laboratory experiments whereby one could apply a powerful static homogeneous magnetic field in a vacuum, thereby creating spacetime curvature, and measure the speed of a light beam through it. Magnetic fields employed in this scenario must achieve magnitudes> 10 10 Tesla in order for measurable effects to appear. Current magnetic induction technology is limited to static fields of ~ several x 10 3 Tesla. However, destructive chemical (implosive/explosive) magnetic field generation technology has reached peak <b>rate-of-rise</b> field strengths of ~ 10 9 Tesla/s. It is proposed that this technology be exploited {{to take advantage of the}} high <b>rate-of-rise</b> field strengths to create and measure spacetime curvature in the lab...|$|E

In {{order to determine}} the <b>rate-of-rise</b> of Very Fast Transient Overvoltage (VFTO) in a 550 kV GIS, simulations are carried out using EMTP-RV. Each component of the GIS is modeled by distributed line model and lumped model based on equivalent circuits. The various switching conditions according to closing point-on-wave and trapped charge are simulated, and the results are analyzed.

40|$|The {{cooldown}} will {{be immediately}} preceded by two trial pump downs; the insulating vacuum and the detector volume. The insulating vacuum {{must be established}} to a level below 10 {sup - 4 } MM Hg to minimize the conduction heat load. The detector, aka cryostat, vacuum pump down {{must be able to}} reproduce the ultimate and <b>rate-of-rise</b> (ROR) values demonstrated in the clean room. It is anticipated, barring newly generated problems, it will take a few days to accomplish both of these tasks once the construction is complete, even though there has been incidental scavenger vacuum pumping.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and performance}} of wicks for vertical flat heat pipe applications produced by compression of nickel foams has been investigated. The permeabilities and the effective pore radii for the wicks were estimated from <b>rate-of-rise</b> experiments, using the model fluid heptane. The porosities of the wicks were measured using isopropanol. The results, which are new and of vital importance for optimum use of such wicks, show that the permeabilities and the effective pore radii are in the upper range for heat pipe use. The joining pressure required during the sintering of the wicks was determined, and {{it was discovered that}} the nickel foams turned hydrophilic during the sinterin...|$|E
40|$|Details of a {{simulated}} lightning effects test facility for testing live and inert missiles, motors, and explosive components are described. The test facility {{is designed to}} simulate the high current, continuing current, and high <b>rate-of-rise</b> current components of an idealized direct strike lightning waveform. The Lightning Test Facility was in operation since May, 1988, and consists of: 3 separate capacitor banks used to produce the lightning test components; a permanently fixed large steel safety cage for retaining the item under test (should it be ignited during testing); an earth covered bunker housing the control/equipment room; a charge/discharge building containing the charging/discharging switching; a remotely located blockhouse from which the test personnel control hazardous testing; and interconnecting cables...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{the maximum}} <b>rate-of-rise</b> of the action {{potential}} (Vmax) {{as a measure of}} the sodium conductance in excitable membranes is invalid. In the case of membrane action potentials, Vmax depends on the total ionic current across the membrane; drugs or conditions that alter the potassium or leak conductances will also affect Vmax. Likewise, long-term depolarization of the membrane lessens the fraction of total ionic current that passes through the sodium channels by increasing potassium conductance and inactivating the sodium conductance, and thereby reduces the effect of Vmax of drugs that specifically block sodium channels. The resultant artifact, an apparent voltage-dependent potency of such drugs, is theoretically simulated for the effects of tetrodotoxin on the Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon...|$|E
40|$|The {{lifetime}} of an atom trap is often {{limited by the}} presence of residual background gases in the vacuum chamber. This leads to the lifetime being inversely proportional to the pressure. Here we use this dependence to estimate the pressure and to obtain pressure <b>rate-of-rise</b> curves, which are commonly used in vacuum science to evaluate the performance of a system. We observe different rates of pressure increase in response to different levels of outgassing in our system. Therefore we suggest that this is a sensitive method which will be useful in applications of cold atom systems, in particular where the inclusion of a standard vacuum gauge is impractical.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{simultaneous}} mechanical reflex {{responses of the}} longitudinal muscle (LM) and circular muscle (CM) layers of the guinea-pig ileum following mucosal stimulation and distension in vitro. Dissection techniques were used to prevent mechanical interaction between the LM and CM layers both oral and anal to a stimulus site. All graded stimuli produced graded contractions of both the LM and CM orally and anally to the stimulus. Contractions occurred synchronously in the LM and CM and under no circumstances were inhibitory responses recorded in either muscle layer, {{despite the presence of}} ongoing cholinergic tone in both the LM and CM. Contractions were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1. 6 μm). Local brush stroking of the mucosa evoked a peristaltic wave which readily conducted distally over 13 cm, without the presence of fluid in the lumen. No descending relaxation was observed. Apamin (300 nm) disrupted evoked peristaltic waves and significantly increased the <b>rate-of-rise</b> of the LM and CM contractions anal to a stimulus, and the LM oral to a stimulus. Nω-nitro-L-arginine (100 μm), a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, had no overall significant effect on the characteristics of the LM and CM contractions, although on occasion an enhancement in their peak amplitude was noted. It is suggested that the guinea-pig ileum does not conform to the ‘law of the intestine’ as postulated by Bayliss & Starling (1899). Rather, local physiological stimulation of the ileum elicits a contraction both orally and anally to a stimulus, which occurs synchronously in both the CM and LM layers. Apamin-sensitive inhibitory neurotransmission modulates the <b>rate-of-rise</b> of the anal contraction of the CM, possibly to generate distal propulsion...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the prediction of}} time to operation of sprinklers, {{as well as the}} response of heat detectors to changing fire conditions. The discussion concentrates on devices having a heat-sensitive element which operates at a preset temperature, though <b>rate-of-rise</b> devices are also mentioned. I NTRODUCTION The time which elapses between ignition and the operation of a sprinkler or fire detector has a cru-cial bearing on fire losses of both property and life. A quantitative assessment of fire hazard requires therefore that some prediction be made of the likely time to operation of such devices. Fire detectors (including sprinklers) respond either to some property of the fire itself or of the gases produced. Prediction of the time to opera-tion requires that an estimate be made of th...|$|E

40|$|The {{measured}} {{electric field}} intensities of 161 lightning strokes in 39 flashes which occurred between 1 and 35 km from an observation point at Kennedy Space Center, Florida during June and July of 1971 have been analyzed {{to determine the}} lightning channel currents which produced the fields. In addition, typical channel currents are derived and from these typical electric fields at distances between 0. 5 and 100 km are computed and presented. On {{the basis of the}} results recommendations are made for changes in the specification of lightning properties relative to space vehicle design as given in NASA TMX- 64589 (Daniels, 1971). The small sample of lightning analyzed yielded several peak currents in the 100 kA range. Several current rise-times from zero to peak of 0. 5 microsec or faster were found; and the fastest observed current <b>rate-of-rise</b> was near 200 kA/microsec.

40|$|The test {{sequence}} was to measure electric and magnetic fields induced inside a redesigned solid rocket motor case when a simulated lightning discharge strikes an exposed top hat cover simulator. The {{test sequence}} was conducted between 21 June and 17 July 1990. Thirty-six high <b>rate-of-rise</b> Marx generator discharges and eight high current bank discharges were injected onto three different test article configurations. Attach points included three locations {{on the top}} hat cover simulator and two locations on the mounting bolts. Top hat cover simulator and mounting bolt damage and grain cover damage was observed. Overall electric field levels were well below 30 kilowatts/meter. Electric field levels ranged from 184. 7 to 345. 9 volts/meter and magnetic field levels were calculated from 6. 921 to 39. 73 amperes/meter.

40|$|We {{investigated}} adaptive neural {{control of}} precision grip forces during object lifting. A model is presented that adjusts reactive and anticipatory grip forces {{to a level}} just above that needed to stabilize lifted objects in the hand. The model obeys priciples of cerebellar structure and function by using slip sensations as error signals to adapt phasic motor commands to tonic force generators associated with output synergies controlling grip aperture. The learned phasic commands are weight and texture-dependent. Simulations of the new curcuit model reproduce key aspects of experimental observations of force application. Over learning trials, the onset of grip force buildup comes to lead the load force buildup, and the <b>rate-of-rise</b> of grip force, but not load force, scales inversely with the friction of the gripped object.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and performance}} of wicks for flat heat pipe applications produced by sintering a filamentary nickel powder has been investigated. Tape casting {{was used as an}} intermediate step in the wick production process. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to study the burn-off of the organic binder used and to study the oxidation and reduction processes of the nickel. The wicks produced were flat, rectangular and intended for liquid transport in the upwards vertical direction. <b>Rate-of-rise</b> experiments using heptane were used to test the flow characteristics of the wicks. The wick porosities were measured using isopropanol. The heat transfer limitation constituted by the vapour static pressure and the capillary pressure was discussed. The influence on wick performance by using pore former in the manufacturing was studied. When Pcap/Psat > 1, the use of a pore former to increase the wick permeability will always improve the wick performance. When Pcap/Psat < 1, it was shown that if the effective pore radius and the permeability increase with an equal percentage the overall influence on the wick capacity is negative. A criterion for a successful pore former introduction is proposed and the concept of a pore former evaluation plot is presented...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular Cl {{activity}} (aiCl), and intracellular pH (pHi) {{were measured}} in isolated sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres using a liquid ion exchanger Cl-selective micro-electrode {{and a glass}} recessed-tip, pH-selective micro-electrode. Removal of external Cl (glucuronate substituted) produced a fall in aiCl from about 20 to about 4 mmol/l: the residual level is probably caused by intracellular interference on the Cl-sensitive electrode. Re-exposure of the fibre to increased levels of external Cl produced, in the steady state, increased levels of aiCl. The dependence of steady-state aiCl upon external Cl activity, aoCl, was roughly hyperbolic with 50 % recovery occurring at an aoCl of about 9. 5 mmol/l. At all levels of external Cl tested, Cl was accumulated to a level much higher than that predicted for passive electrochemical equilibrium. Exposure of a Cl-depleted fibre to various levels of external Cl produced an exponential rise with time in aiCl. The initial <b>rate-of-rise</b> in aiCl {{was estimated to be}} a saturating function of aoCl, with a half-maximal effect occurring at an aoCl of about 33 mmol/l. The <b>rate-of-rise</b> was about 10 -fold greater than that predicted from constant-field theory using published values for PCl, the Cl permeability coefficient. Steady-state aiCl was essentially insensitive to changes in external HCO 3 concentration, [HCO 3]o, if these changes were made at a constant external pH, pHo, i. e. when a reduction in [HCO 3]o was accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in the partial pressure of CO 2, PCO 2. In contrast, if PCO 2 was maintained constant, then a change in [HCO 3]o (thus producing a change in pHo) resulted in an inverse change in aiCl. This change in aiCl was also accompanied by a change in pHi: when aiCl increased, pHi decreased and vice versa. The anion-exchange inhibitor, DIDS (4, 4 -diisothiocyanato-stilbene disulphonic acid) abolished the effect on aiCl of changes in [HCO 3]o and pHo (at constant PCO 2). Furthermore DIDS reduced the influence of pHo upon pHi. Both the fall of aiCl in Cl-free solution and the subsequent reuptake of Cl following re-exposure to Cl-containing solution were slowed by a reduction in [HCO 3]o (constant pHo, reduced PCO 2). Both reuptake and wash-out of Cl were saturating functions of [HCO 3]o with half-maximal effect occurring at an [HCO 3]o of 1 - 1. 3 mmol/l. The reuptake of Cl was little affected by removal of external Na (bis, 2 -hydroxy ethyl, dimethyl ammonium substituted). The reuptake of Cl was unaffected by amiloride (1 mmol/l) but slowed by piretanide (1 mmol/l). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E

Gas species, injected quantity Q, delivery time, t inj, <b>rate-of-rise</b> and intrinsic and added impurities {{are found to}} affect the attributes and “disruption mitigation ” efficacies of the resulting fast plasma shutdowns. With sufficient Q and t inj < ~ 2 ms, all species provide fast (within � ~ 3 ms), more-or-less uniform radiative dissipation of the 0. 7 -MJ plasma thermal energy and fast but benign current decays with reduced vacuum vessel vertical force impulse.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{leak test}} system for tritium shipping containers {{has been developed}} at Westinghouse Savannah River Co. (WSRC). The leak detection system employs a computer controlled helium detector which allows an operator to enter key information when prompted. The software for controlling the tests and the equipment apparatus were both designed and manufactured at the Savannah River Technology Center within WSRC. Recertification Test: Every twelve months, the pressure vessel portion of the shipping container itself must undergo a rigorous recertification leak test. After an empty pressure vessel (shipping container) is assembled, it is placed into one of six stainless steel belljars for helium leak testing. The belljars are fashioned in row {{much the same as}} assembly line arrangement. Post-load Test: A post-load leak test is performed upon reservoirs that have been filled with tritium and placed inside the shipping containers mentioned above. These leak tests are performed by a <b>rate-of-rise</b> method where the area around the shipping container seals is evacuated, valved off from the vacuum pump, and then the vacuum pressure is monitored over a two-minute period.

V. source; (iii) the thermal ageing at higher temperatures (namely, 100, 130 and 150 °C) and; (iv) the thermo-hygro ageing under salt rain. The aim of such a study is to identify suitable organic materials that could be intended for the conception {{of a new generation of}} piercing connectors that will be used on overhead covered cables. Regarding BDV tests, used polymers cover (i) thermoplastics (namely, polyamide 6, polyamide 66, polyarylamide, polycarbonate, high density polyethylene and polyphenylene sulfide); and (ii) unfilled/fireproofed EPDM rubbers. The obtained results clearly show that {{breakdown voltage}} (BDV) with spherical electrodes exhibits the highest values. It is also evidenced that the connection to the H. V. source and the influence of the electrode dimension to the BDV value is significant. Results show that the spherical-pyramidally capped point electrodes exhibit higher BDV than that for the spherical-cylindrical ones for PA 66 / 50 PC/ 40, PARA/ 50 and HDPE. Furthermore, thermal ageing affects seriously BDV of EPDM based materials while polyphenylene sulfide is less damaged due to its highest thermal stability. As concerns thermo-hygro ageing, the moisture absorption is responsible for the significant BDV decrease of polyamide materials (PA 6 / 50 and PA 66 / 50) ...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes is a {{major risk}} factor for stroke. However, the {{molecular}} mechanisms involved in cerebral artery dysfunction found in the diabetic patients are not completely elucidated. In cerebral artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs), spontaneous and local increases of intracellular Ca 2 + due {{to the opening of}} ryanodine receptors (Ca 2 + sparks) activate large conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) channels that generate spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs). STOCs have a key participation in the control of vascular myogenic tone and blood pressure. Our goal was to investigate whether alterations in Ca 2 + spark and STOC activities, measured by confocal microscopy and patch-clamp technique, respectively, occur in isolated CASMCs of an experimental model of type- 2 diabetes (db/db mouse). We found that mean Ca 2 + spark amplitude, duration, size and <b>rate-of-rise</b> were significantly smaller in Fluo- 3 loaded db/db compared to control CASMCs, with a subsequent decrease in the total amount of Ca 2 + released through Ca 2 + sparks in db/db CASMCs, though Ca 2 + spark frequency remained. Interestingly, the frequency of large-amplitude Ca 2 + sparks was also significantly reduced in db/db cells. In addition, the frequency and amplitude of STOCs were markedly reduced at all voltages tested (from 250 to 0 mV) in db/db CASMCs. The latter correlates with decreased BK channel b 1 /a subunit ratio found in db/db vascular tissues. Taken together, Ca 2 + spark alterations lead to inappropriate BK channels activation in CASMCs of db/db mice and this condition is aggravated by the decrease in the BK b 1 subunit/a subunit ratio which underlies the significant reduction of Ca 2 + spark...|$|E
