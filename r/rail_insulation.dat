40|$|DC {{electrified}} traction {{systems are}} a {{potential source of}} stray current, that may corrode {{both internal and external}} structures and installations. The stray current intensity depends on several factors (traction current, <b>rail</b> <b>insulation,</b> concrete mat and piers resistance), that are accounted for in the proposed model. Moreover, the effect of a uniform or multi-layer soil model is considered, showing the differences and the impact on the countermeasures with respect to a uniform soil model simplifying approach...|$|E
40|$|Butt joints {{are used}} widely in bridge girders, and rails when simple or moment {{resistant}} connections are required between steel members. The butt joints are some times applied to accommodate thermal movement in rails and bridge girders. Those types of joints {{are not considered}} in this paper. The structural behaviour of the butt joints has a significant influence over the structural integrity. Ju et al [1] carried out a detailed 3 D finite element analysis of bolted steel joints {{with a view to}} investigating the applicability of linear elastic fracture mechanics to such joints under loading that cause plastic deformation. Lazzarin et al [2] carried out a large number of experiments on bolted aluminium joints with a view to examining the effect of the geometry and environmental factors on the fatigue behaviour and failure mode. They concluded that the fatigue behaviour of the bolted aluminium joints was closely aligned to the behaviour of welded aluminium structures. Typically in most structural connections, the main structural plate is thicker than the cover plates that cover the dry butt joint [3, 4, 5]. However, in rail joints, in particular where rails are joined to achieve electrical insulation (achieved by the insertion of electrical insulating material between the rails), the rail web is thinner than the cover plates (known as 'joint bars'). The importance of the integrity of this type of joint may be visualised from the role they play in signalling and train location systems that are vital in the safety of railway operation. As the joint consists of insulating materials whose properties under service conditions (confinement, thermal loads and impacts) are not known and uses glue of highly nonlinear properties, {{it is very difficult to}} examine the structural integrity of the rail joint in its "as-designed" condition. Furthermore, there is very little work reported on rail joints although such joints significantly affect ride quality, increase dynamic/impact loading and deteriorate the rail surface with the continuous passage of wheel loading [6]. As rail joint is a complex problem, detailed analysis of various parts of the body constituting the rail joint is necessary. Therefore, simplification has been made in the analysis of glued insulated rail joint by breaking the complex problem into a number of simple problems. This paper describes one of the simple idealisations of the rail joint problem. A three-dimensional finite element model was employed to simulate and investigate the structural behaviour of the butt joint subjected to biaxial stress field generated by inplane flexure. Elasto-plastic material model was used for the main plates whilst all other components were assumed to remain elastic throughout the loading history. A two-step non-linear analysis was performed. In the first step, the bolts were pre-stressed with a pre-defined level of tension, which were allowed to relax a portion of the tensile strain due to the deformability of the underlying joint-bars and the structural plates. On attaining equilibrium, the assembly was subjected to in-plane bending that generated biaxial stress fields as the second step. As glue is used between the plates and joint bars in the <b>rail</b> <b>insulation</b> connection, tie constraints were considered and applied on contact surfaces between the plates and joint bars in the simulations. Similarly glued connection between the surfaces of nuts and joint bars was also simulated by perfect tie constraints. The tie constraints were used between each of the nodes on the slave surface to the master surface...|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the <b>rail's</b> electrical <b>insulation,</b> a move that would later make them unusable for rail service.|$|R
40|$|Running rails used as {{a return}} {{conductor}} and ungrounded scheme have been widely adopted in DC traction power systems. Due to the longitudinal resistance of running <b>rails</b> and <b>insulation</b> resistance of rail-to-ground, {{there will be a}} potential rise between running rails and the ground when return current flows through the running rails, which is known as rail potential. At present, abnormal rise of rail potential exists widely in DC traction power systems. The present rail potential model still cannot simulate and explain the abnormal rail potential in the system. Based on the analysis of power distribution with multiple trains running in multiple sections, a dynamic simulation model of rail potential in the whole line is proposed. The dynamic distribution of rail potential and stray current in DC traction power systems when multiple trains run in multiple sections is analyzed, and the impact of traction current distribution on rail potential is evaluated. Simulation results show that the abnormal rise of rail potential during the dynamic operation of the system can be evaluated effectively...|$|R
40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{experience}} a much shorter fatigue life than continuous rail sections, especially IRJs located in heavy haul rail corridors. IRJs {{are one of}} the most critical components of the rail system since their failure can lead to multiple catastrophic consequences, including; malfunctioning of the track signalling system due to metal contact across the insulating rail gap and, in cases where joints are damaged at the fishplate or rail bolt holes, derailment of railway vehicles. A literature review on the topic revealed that these joints suffer from a wide range of damage, predominately resulting from either the gradual accumulation of metal under plastic flow across the railhead in the vicinity of the rail end post, or rail end spalling and/or <b>rail</b> end post <b>insulation</b> damage. Other failure modes relate to problems with fishplates/joint bar and rail bolt holes. These include: fishplate cracking, delamination of fishplates, bolt looseness and bolt hole cracking. Therefore, IRJs are regarded as high-risk component and are maintained via expensive maintenance programs requiring high standards. Every year rail operators around Australia and the world install tens of thousands of rail joints, due to their early failure, or the risk of failure of either the signalling system and/or the structural track integrity. For the Australian heavy haul rail industry, the economic costs of IRJ maintenance are very high. In this study, approaches to both advanced characterisation of IRJ damage and to improving IRJs service lifetimes were investigated. Damage accumulation in the vicinity of the joint was characterised by advanced metallographic (optical microscopy, SEM and TEM) and neutron diffraction techniques. In the early stage of the project, surface hard facing was selected as a potential approach to improving IRJ lifetimes, and surface clad rail samples were produced and studied via simulation testing and testing of ex-service rails. The initial hard facing experiments involved comparison of the performance of ex-service laser clad IRJ samples (431 stainless steel cladding produced by Jarvie Engineering Private Limited) with that of uncoated IRJ samples manufactured from normal head hardened 60 kg grade rail. The results indicated IRJ lifetimes can be improved by a hard facing of rail ends. Follow-up investigations were performed using both robots TIG MMAW hard facing deposition approach, and experimentation with a choice of cladding metal and geometry of the hard-face rail surface. Experimentation included advanced metallography and electron microscopy, and limited wear testing of cladding materials. Full-scale wheel on track rig testing was also performed on both coated and uncoated samples, which involves cyclic rolling contact loading on railhead surface was the main objective to investigate the railhead damage. It was concluded that ferritic type commercial hard facing alloys, and maraging steels, appear good candidate materials for hard facing by weld deposition in the vicinity of IRJs. They also appear more suitable than the initial 431 stainless steel used in the laser cladding experiments as deleterious effects of thermal contraction during cooling are less in the ferritic alloys. It was also concluded and that geometry of the hard facing profile should include a steep angle of hard facing with the rail surface where it intersects the top surface of the rail head. Neutron diffraction analysis of ex-service IRJs revealed significant stress evolution in the vicinity of the top surfaces of the rail ends abutting the insulating gap. This distribution is characterised by a compressive layer of approximately 5 mm deep and a counterbalanced tensile layer located 5 - 15 mm at the sub-surface region. It exceeded the distribution along the continuous rail. Residual stresses analysis for the laboratory rig tested rail ends revealed similar characteristic to those found in ex-service rail ends. However, in contrast to the ex-service rail ends, the stress distributions in the test rig samples were slightly different and this difference was attributed to the localization of wheel load under the particular test conditions. A separate neutron diffraction examination of residual stresses near bolt-holes across ex-service IRJ fishplates revealed a stress evolution characterised by both compressive and tensile stresses, extended in a 900 and 450 angles to the longitudinal plane. The later results were consistent with a common observation of fishplate fracture originating at bolt holes at 450 to the running rail surface...|$|R
