5|$|When Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 {{without having}} named a successor, the fledgling Qing state faced a {{possibly}} serious crisis. Several contenders—namely Nurhaci's second and eldest surviving son Daišan, Nurhaci's fourteenth and fifteenth sons Dorgon and Dodo (both born {{to the same}} mother), and Hong Taiji's eldest son Hooge—started to vie for the throne. With his brothers Dodo and Ajige, Dorgon (31 years old) controlled the Plain and Bordered White Banners, Daišan (60) {{was in charge of}} the two <b>Red</b> <b>Banners,</b> whereas Hooge (34) had the loyalty of his father's two Yellow Banners.|$|E

25|$|<b>Red</b> <b>banners</b> were {{installed}} at one station encouraging some travellers {{to abandon their}} travel plans and {{nearly half a million}} of them cancelled their trips after lengthy waits. Xinhua reported that 11million migrant workers in the Guangdong area received ticket refunds. Most of the rail service resumed on 31 January but heavy fog on 3 February caused further delays particularly in Hunan. The lengthy delays occasionally caused clashes between travellers, police and soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, {{following}} the stunning {{defeat of the}} French Army by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War, French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the Paris Commune. The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army, with much bloodshed. The original <b>red</b> <b>banners</b> of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new Soviet government {{with one of the}} original Commune banners; it was placed (and is still in place) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, next to his open coffin.|$|E
25|$|The pyre was sixty metres high, {{square in}} shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was {{decorated}} with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with <b>red</b> <b>banners</b> filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths {{in the middle and}} at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament. It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander's own death.|$|E

25|$|For some, {{this feeling}} was {{confirmed}} when in September 1918 the War Precautions Act {{was extended to}} prohibit the flying of red flags, considered {{a symbol of the}} trade union movement, but also associated with Bolshevism. By November the war had ended, but the War Precautions Act remained in effect. The unemployment rate in Brisbane was more than 14% and many returning servicemen were unable to secure employment. Amidst growing unrest among Russian emigres, trade unionists and other socialist elements, concerns about political and social agitation amongst conservative elements of society grew. These concerns existed across Australia, but it was in Queensland, where there was a sizeable Russian population, that the concerns were largely focused. The situation seemed to worsen throughout November and December 1918 as a number of socialist demonstrations were held. In November, Peter Simonoff, who was seen as one of the main agitators, was arrested in Melbourne, having previously been banned from public speaking in Queensland in September. Following Simonoff's sentencing, in January 1919 a demonstration against the continued operation of the War Precautions Act was carried out at William Street, and was attended by over a thousand people singing socialist songs and carrying <b>red</b> <b>banners.</b>|$|E
500|$|One of Dorgon's first {{orders in}} the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire {{northern}} part of Beijing {{to give it to}} Bannermen, including Han Chinese Bannermen. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners east, the <b>Red</b> <b>Banners</b> west, and the Blue Banners south. This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which [...] "each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass." [...] Despite tax remissions and large-scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups. Agricultural land outside the capital was also marked off (quan 圈) and given to Qing troops. Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords. This transition in land use caused [...] "several decades of disruption and hardship." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1919, Vergniaud {{was among}} the ships {{stationed}} off Sevastopol as an Allied deterrent to Soviet forces who were encroaching on the city during the Russian civil war. Despite Allied support, the city's White Russian forces were in a seemingly hopeless position, and in April 1919 the French naval high command ordered the ships to evacuate. Rejecting this, {{the commander of the}} Second Squadron, Vice-Admiral (vice-amiral) Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet, attempted to have his forces intervene in the fighting, only to have a mutiny erupt on several of his ships. War-weary sailors demanded to return home and the ensuing standoff culminated in a mass shooting of sailor demonstrators. Fifteen people were wounded, but only one died, a sailor from Vergniaud. The battleship's crew had thus far remained neutral in the conflict but quickly joined the ranks of the most radical mutineers, unfurling <b>red</b> <b>banners</b> in support of the Bolshevik forces. The four-day stalemate ended in a victory for the sailors: the ships withdrew from the Black Sea and Vergniaud returned to France. The ship departed on 29 April, towing the merchant ship [...] to Constantinople.|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} the Unity Convention some 500 members and sympathizers of the WAA marched to the White House, their line of march watched by 100 police officers. The marchers, parading under <b>red</b> <b>banners,</b> called for launch of a new $6 billion work-relief program, with David Lasser and four {{other members of the}} {{national}} committee granted a 30-minute audience with Presidential secretary Marvin McIntryre. Following the meeting Lasser declared to the press his growing dissatisfaction with President Roosevelt, who he felt was sacrificing the interests of the unemployed to the expediencies of his 1936 reelection campaign. [...] "We told [...] that we were tired of Mr. Roosevelt's promissory notes, always being renewed and renewed again, with indefinite dates," [...] Lasser declared.|$|E

Right away in the committee rooms they began to organize the demonstration for the evening with lantern slides and speeches and they arranged for a huge bouquet to be presented to Bagshaw on the platform by four little girls (all Liberals) all dressed in white.|$|E

6000|$|A few rude cairns were erected on {{the crest}} of the pass, covered with wands, <b>red</b> <b>banners,</b> and votive offerings of rags. I found a fine slab of slate, inscribed with the Tibetan characters, [...] "Om Mani Padmi hom," [...] which Meepo allowed me to take away, as the reward of my exertions. The ridge is wholly formed of angular blocks of white gneissy granite, split by frost.* [It was not a proper granite, but a highly {{metamorphic}} felspathic gneiss, with very little mica; being, I suspect, a gneiss which by metamorphic action was almost remolten into granite: the lamination was obscure, and marked by faint undulating lines of mica; it cleaves at all angles, but most generally along fissures with highly polished undulated black surfaces. The strike of the same rock near at hand was north-west, and dip north-east, at various angles.] There was no snow on the pass itself, but deep drifts and glaciers descended in hollows on the north side, to 17,000 feet. The rounded northern red shoulder of Kinchinjhow by Cholamoo lake, apparently 19,000 feet high, was quite bare, and, as I have said, I ascended Donkia to upwards of 19,000 feet before I found the rocks crusted with ice,* [Snow, transformed into ice throughout its whole mass: in short, glacial ice in all physical characters.] and the ground wholly frozen. I assume, therefore, that 19,000 feet at this spot is not below the mean level at which all the snow melts that falls on a fair exposure to the south: this probably coincides with a mean temperature of 20 degrees. Forty miles further north (in Tibet) the same line is probably at 20,000 feet; for there much less snow falls, and much more melts in proportion.* [Two secondary considerations materially affecting the melting of snow, and hence exerting a material influence on the elevation of the snow-line, appear to me never to have been sufficiently dwelt upon. Both, however, bear directly upon the great elevation of the snow-line in Tibet. From the imperfect transmission of the heating rays of the sun through films of water, which transmit perfectly the luminous rays, it follows that the direct effects of the rays, in clear sunshine, are very different at equal elevations of the moist outer and dry inner Himalaya. Secondly, naked rock and soil absorb much more heat than surfaces covered with vegetation, and this heat again radiated is infinitely more rapidly absorbed by snow (or other white surfaces) than the direct heat of the sun's rays is. Hence, at equal elevations the ground heats sooner, and the snow is more exposed to the heat thus radiated in arid Tibet, than in the wooded and grassed mountains of Sikkim.] From the elevation of about 19,300 feet, which I attained on Donkia, I saw a fine illustration of that atmospheric phenomenon called the [...] "spectre of the Brocken," [...] my own shadow being projected on a mass of thin mist that rose above the tremendous precipices over which I hung. My head was surrounded with a brilliant circular glory or rainbow.* [Probably caused by spiculae of ice floating in the atmosphere, the lateral surfaces of which would then have an uniform inclination of 60 degrees: this, according to the observations of Mariotte, Venturi, and Fraunhoefer being the angle necessary for the formation of halos.] ...|$|E
