5|$|The geology of {{the town}} {{comprises}} bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent Quaternary drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a cap of clay-with-flints on the western edge {{of the town}} around Poundbury, alluvium in the river's floodplain, and several narrow <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town's northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division {{entered the}} line in the quiet Lunéville sector in February 1918. On 26 February, MacArthur and Captain Thomas T. Handy {{accompanied}} a French trench raid in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the French VII Corps, Major General Georges de Bazelaire, decorated MacArthur with the Croix de guerre. Menoher recommended MacArthur for a Silver Star, which he later received. The Silver Star Medal was not instituted until 8 August 1932, but small Silver Citation Stars were authorized to be worn on the campaign <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> those cited in orders for gallantry, similar to the British mention in despatches. When the Silver Star Medal was instituted, it was retroactively awarded to those who had been awarded Silver Citation Stars. On 9 March, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the 168th Infantry. This time, his leadership was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Cross. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men carrying their gas masks but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He recovered in time to show Secretary Baker around the area on 19 March.|$|E

25|$|The service core {{projects}} {{from the}} rear (northern side) of the tower with walls of painted concrete with off-form-patterned panels. The core fenestration is minimal, contrasting with the ample glazing of the adjacent northern elevation of the tower. The east and west elevations of the core have long, narrow <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> windows with high sills, and the north elevation has a column of small windows with a high sill and a spandrel panel of quartz aggregate.

25|$|In Article 3 of the Law on the National Arms, Flag and Anthem (Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales) also {{describes}} {{that the}} national flag can be decorated with a special tie called a corbata (cravat). The corbata is composed of a bow, two <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> different length and both ribbons are attached with a golden tassel called fringe. The corbata {{is placed on the}} top of the flag at the point where the truck is, and the colours of the corbata match that of the national flag. Organizations and political parties can adopt their own corbatas, such as the National Action Party (PAN), which uses a white corbata with blue fringes.|$|E
25|$|Sodium amalgam {{containing}} 2–6% sodium (prepared by {{the treatment}} of <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> sodium metal with mercury(0)) is the most commonly employed reagent for the reductive desulfonylation and reductive elimination processes. Disodium hydrogen phosphate is used to buffer the solution at a pH of 7–8, meaning that base-labile functionality is stable under the reduction conditions. Reductions employing aluminum amalgam (prepared by immersion of aluminum foil into a 2% aqueous solution of HgCl2) often require higher temperatures than the corresponding sodium amalgam reactions. Mercury and mercury compounds are poisonous and teratogenic, and should be used only in a properly functioning chemical fume hood. Mercury cannot be destroyed {{but it can be}} removed from aqueous solutions by using ion-exchange resins or by amalgamation with iron.|$|E

25|$|Surprisingly few artists {{used the}} spray gun {{technique}} to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used spray painting techniques include Jules Olitski, {{who was a}} pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen's use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The Colour (bandiera di guerra) for army units (other than cavalry) is {{a square}} {{version of the}} {{national}} tricolour in silk, 99cm × 99cm. It is mounted on a pike 2.2 m long, made of wood covered with green velvet and decorated with ornate brass nails arranged in a spiral. The pike is topped by a 35cm high finial consisting of an ornate gilt brass spearhead chased with a five pointed star and the monogram RI (for Repubblica Italiana), which is in turn mounted atop a gilt brass ball on which is the name and date of establishment of the unit. The pike is adorned with two silver cords 67cm long, each with a 10cm long silver tassel and a blue silk cravat 8cm × 66cm with an 8cm silver fringe at each end, to which the unit's decorations are pinned, the <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> the decorations overlapping so that the medals hang down the cravat.|$|E
25|$|May the 7th {{found the}} {{battalion}}, minus Company B, at Leutasch and Ober Leutasch, Austria. Company B was in Moserne and later moved to Telfs. Here the battalion {{was able to}} rest. On 12 May, General McAuliffe pinned Silver Stars on Captain Walter S. Smith, 1st Lt. Serreo S. Nelson and Lt Christopher J. Sturkey, while his staff pinned the <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> the Distinguished Unit Citation on members of the 3rd Platoon of Company C. Officers and men had passes and furloughs until early July when the unit was alerted to move. On the 10th they were ordered to move to Marseilles, France. Here it was found the battalion was to be broken up and the men sent to service units, but after General McAuliffe and others had intervened, the orders were changed and the battalion awaited orders to ship to the Pacific or be assigned to occupation duties in Europe. But, {{the war in the}} Pacific ended too and on 10 September 1945, the battalion received orders to return to Germany. On the 25th, the battalion CP was established at Hofheim with the companies occupying nearby towns. They remained on occupation duty until early 1946 when they were ordered to return to the U.S. The 614th was deactivated on January 31, 1946, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics also}} praised Current's guitar {{work on the}} album, with Richards writing that his riffs [...] "come ripping from his {{amplifier}} like sunbeams through a smog of distortion". Writing for Spin, Chuck Eddy wrote that Current's guitar chords [...] "soar Byrds-like or surf Ventures-like out of melodic stomps that seem basic, but aren't". K.

500|$|The courtrooms {{vary from}} {{as large as}} [...] to as small as [...] and are in a pear-shaped design. Designs for the courtrooms were partly based on the courtrooms of the Bordeaux Law Courts in France. The jury box is {{recessed}} and does not resemble a traditional jury box. The courtrooms feature <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> wood panels on the walls in rooms that narrow as they reach the bench at the front. The wood is primarily cherry with walnut accents. Natural light is let into the courtrooms from small opening in the walls. Videoconferencing {{is available in the}} courtrooms.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} is seven stories tall and fills nearly {{one half of}} a city block. The [...] wide by six-story tall triumphal arch motif of the State Street façade has been journalistically compared to the l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris. [...] The central arch-headed window adapts the familiar motif of Borromini's false-perspective window reveals of {{the top floor of}} Palazzo Barberini, Rome. The coat of arms of the Balaban and Katz chain—two horses holding <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> 35mm film in their mouths outlined by a border of film reels—is set inside a circular Tiffany stained glass window inside the arch. [...] The exterior of the building is covered in off-white architectural terracotta supplied by the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company with Neo-Baroque stucco designs by the McNulty Brothers.|$|E

2500|$|Albert Vogel sr. {{used the}} poem The death of Kleopatra from A <b>ribbon</b> <b>of</b> poems during his {{performances}} in 1907. In May 1912 {{the text of}} the poem Midnight was put to music by J.P.J. Wiertz for the national singing contest of the Royal National Singing School in The Hague. A newspaper called A <b>ribbon</b> <b>of</b> poems in 1912 as a bad example for then contemporairy poets who tried to write their own A <b>ribbon</b> <b>of</b> poems. On the other hand: when Dutch poet Pieter Cornelis Boutens celebrated his 60th birthday in 1930, Het Nieuws van de Dag voor Nederlands-Indië wrote: Boutens is a poet as not many {{can be found in a}} country that since half a century is experiencing [...] "a <b>ribbon</b> <b>of</b> poems".

Each {{of the top three}} floors have two courtrooms; two for the judges of federal district court, two for magistrate judges of the court, and two for the bankruptcy court, with these courtrooms spread out amongst the pavilions; two per pavilion and all on the third floor. Chambers for the judges are located above the courtrooms and include a seventh chamber for a visiting judge. On the same level as the judge's chambers are two law libraries for the court. The three floors featuring the courtrooms are joined {{to the rest of the}} building via the [...] tall atrium. Located on the second floor is the jury assembly room, which when not in use by the court is used as exhibit and meeting space.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Judith Farr {{notes that}} Dickinson, during her lifetime, [...] "was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, {{than as a}} poet". Dickinson studied botany {{from the age of}} nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead. During her lifetime, she {{assembled}} a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound herbarium. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the Linnaean system. The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun. Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered [...] "carpets of lily-of-the-valley and pansies, platoons of sweetpeas, hyacinths, enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> peony hedges and drifts of daffodils in season, marigolds to distraction—a butterfly utopia". In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she [...] "could inhabit the Spice Isles merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but [...] "they valued the posy more than the poetry".|$|E
500|$|Davis had enlisted Cosey {{to provide}} his music with {{sounds from the}} {{electric}} blues and Jimi Hendrix, whose use of distortion and the E-flat tuning was shared by Cosey. According to Charles Shaar Murray, he evoked the guitarist's echoic, free jazz-inspired solos while Lucas performed {{in the manner of}} Hendrix's more lyrical rhythm and blues songs; Cosey's guitar was separated to the left channel and Lucas' to the right on Agharta. Jazz scholar Stuart Nicholson wrote that Davis utilized his guitarists in a way which realized the [...] "waves of harmonic distortion" [...] Hendrix had explored in his own music. In Murray's view, the album invoked his influence on the trumpeter more explicitly than any other of his records; Nicholson considered it to be the [...] "closest approximation" [...] to the music they could have recorded together. Davis veered from succinct and expressive solos to unsentimental wails, which suggested he was still mourning Hendrix's 1970 death, Murray surmised. That year, Davis had started playing with a wah-wah pedal affixed to his trumpet in order to emulate the register Hendrix achieved on his guitar. By the time of the concert, the trumpeter had developed what Philip Freeman described as [...] "a new tone, the wiggly, shimmering <b>ribbons</b> <b>of</b> sound that are heard on Agharta", where his wah-wah processed solos often sounded frantic and melancholic, like [...] "twisted streams of raw pain".|$|E
