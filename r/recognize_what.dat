25|$|Frequently, victims may not <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} to them was rape. Some may remain in denial for years afterwards. Confusion {{over whether or not}} their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes. The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.|$|E
25|$|Interventions include {{supporting}} {{foster parents}} {{to learn to}} help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child's distress and to understand the child's signals, especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing {{as a consequence of}} their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships. Foster carers are taught to <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> such children actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need. Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.|$|E

25|$|Language {{development}} and processing begins before birth. Evidence {{has shown that}} there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud {{during the last few}} weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

The director researched people who were dying young, and learned from doctors and caregivers that such patients find new ways of coping.

Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question. The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths. Poniewozik said it led to the episode's [...] "theme of community—that is, that not all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> they have in common. Everyone ... can feel like an outsider on prom night." [...] VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which [...] "has mostly been absent in season two", and noted that [...] "Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion." ...|$|E

New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term. The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, {{about the possibility of}} her nomination. On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009. On May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, [...] "I had my [...] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally." [...] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her. She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.
