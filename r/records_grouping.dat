[[abstract]]The {{aim of the}} present study is to analyse the highly cited papers from India. The Science Citation Index Expanded database was used to retrieve the related bibliographic <b>records.</b> <b>Grouping</b> and reclassification of institutions with misspellings and variants have been done. The most productive institutions, collaborating partners and Y-index of the contributing authors were examined. Results revealed that all the highly cited papers from India did not receive citations in the early years after publication. Co-authored (or international collaboration) papers received more citation impact than single-authored ones. USA was the preferred collaborative partner for international collaboration. The Indian Institutes of Technology, CSIR organizations, and Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru were the leading Indian institution...|$|E
40|$|Data mining discouvers {{interesting}} {{information from}} a data set. Mining incorporates different methods and considers different kinds of information. Granulation is an important aspect o f mining. The data sets can be extremely large with multiple kinds of data in high dimensionality. Without granulation, large data sets often are computationally infeasible; and, the generated results may be overly fine grained. Most available algorithms work with quantitative data. However, many data sets contain a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data. Our goal is to group records containing multiple data varieties: quantitative (discrete, continuous) and qualitative (ordinal, nominal). Grouping based on different quantitative metrics can be difficult. Incorporating various qualitative elements is not simple. There are partially successful strategies {{as well as several}} differential geometries. We expect to use a mixture of scalar methods and soft computing methods (rough sets, fuzzy sets), as well as methods using other metrics. To cluster whole records in a data set, i t would be useful to have a general similarity metric or a set of integrated similarity metrics that would allow record to record similarity comparisons. There are methods to granulate data items belonging to a single attribute. Few methods exist that might meaningfully handle a combination of many data varieties in a single metric. This paper is an initial consideration of strategies for integrating multiple metrics in the task of granulating <b>records.</b> <b>GROUPING</b> RECORDS TOGETHER Granulation helps data mining accomplish: association rule discouvery, classification, partitioning, clustering, and sequence discouvery. Without granulation, large data sets often are computationally infeasible; and, the generated results may be overly fine grained...|$|E
