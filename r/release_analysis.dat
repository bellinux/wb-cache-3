50|$|The data is {{presented}} to the user with {{a strong emphasis on}} the relation to curated background information and underlying evidence that led to the observation of a terminus, its modification or proteolytic cleavage. In brief the protein information, its domain structure, protein termini, terminus modifications and proteolytic processing of and by other proteins is listed. All information is accompanied by metadata like its original source, method of identification, confidence measurement or related publication. A positional cross correlation evaluation matches termini and cleavage sites with protein features (such as amino acid variants) and domains to highlight potential effects and dependencies in a unique way. Also, a network view of all proteins showing their functional dependency as protease, substrate or protease inhibitor tied in with protein interactions is provided for the easy evaluation of network wide effects. A powerful yet user friendly filtering mechanism allows the presented data to be filtered based on parameters like methodology used, in vivo relevance, confidence or data source (e.g. limited to a single laboratory or publication). This provides means to assess physiological relevant data and to deduce functional information and hypotheses relevant to the bench scientist. In a later <b>release</b> <b>analysis</b> tools for the evaluation of proteolytic pathways in experimental data have been added.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reinvestigate the <b>release</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure, which is traditionally conducted using a laboratory Denver cell, and to develop a modified process that can be used for all froth flotation technologies. Recent studies have found that the separation performance achieved by multiple stage cleaning and, in some cases, single stage cleaning using column flotation is superior to the performance achieved by the traditional release procedure. These findings are a result of the advanced flotation mechanisms provided by column flotation, which will be incorporated into a modified <b>release</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure developed in this study. A fundamental model of an open column has been developed which incorporates the effects of system hydrodynamics, froth drop-back, selective and non-selective detachment, operating parameters, feed solids content, and feed component flotation kinetics. Simulation results obtained during this reporting period indicate that the ultimate separation that can be achieved by a column flotation process can only be obtained in a single cleaning stage if the detachment mechanism in the froth phase is highly selective, which does not appear to occur in practice based on experimental results. Two to three cleaning stages were found to be required to obtain the ultimate performance if non-selective detachment or kinetic limiting conditions are assumed. this simulated finding agrees well with the experimental results obtained from the multiple stage cleaning of an Illinois No. 5 seam coal using the Packed-Column. Simulated results also indicate that the separation performance achieved by column flotation improves with increasing feed solids content after carrying-capacity limiting conditions are realized. These findings will be utilized in the next reporting period to modify the traditional <b>release</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure...|$|E

The increased demands on efficiency and emissions will put high demands on future engine control. Future engine concepts, for ex-ample the HCCI engine concept might crave cylinder pressure based Closed-Loop Combustion Control (CLCC). The analysis of cylinder pressure is a relatively computationally expensive task {{that is difficult to}} implement in existing engine controllers due to the real time demands. This paper describes an approach to obtain such a high speed heat <b>release</b> <b>analysis.</b> The de-scribed system could act as a platform for further feedback control experiments. An experi-mental setup is put together. The heat release algorithm is then developed using MATLAB and SIMULINK.

The per-formance of the developed algorithm/system is examined in a simulated engine environment.
