5|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan beat David Gilbert 10–7 in {{the first}} round. After the match, he refused to attend a {{mandatory}} press conference, and also <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the tournament broadcasters, the BBC. He received a formal warning from World Snooker, and was advised that further breaches of contract would lead to fines. In the second round, he lost 12–13 to Barry Hawkins, his first loss against Hawkins in 14 years and {{only the second time}} in 13 years that he had failed to reach the World Championship quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it until {{towards the end of}} his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Kagame {{warned the}} {{committee}} and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day, the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back; Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in Kigali. An interim government was set up but Kagame <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to it, believing {{that it was just}} a cover for Bagosora's rule. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF-controlled areas.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April, as the {{genocide}} started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned {{the interim government}} and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day FAR forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the isolated troops in Kigali. Kagame <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the interim government, believing {{that it was just}} a cover for Bagosora's rule, and not committed to ending {{the genocide}}.

5|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the AESC was {{the most}} prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if {{in the way of}} his objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were for the betterment of South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology. The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party for the rest of his career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time; a significant number of them <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard {{and other}} MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC; {{they wanted the}} MCC to state {{publicly}} that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed {{that it would have}} been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him afterwards. Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain. Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.|$|E

5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than a week}} later, Carpenter {{announced}} he would not travel to the club's Spring training site in Jupiter, Florida and instead remain in St. Louis, fearing {{he could be a}} distraction. At a press conference that same day, he said he still holds out hope of pitching in 2013, and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about retirement. On February 22, the team placed Carpenter on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E

Having found a small American flag in Vouza's loincloth, the Japanese tied him to a tree and tortured him for information about Allied forces. Vouza was questioned for hours, but <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> He was then bayoneted in both of his arms, throat, shoulder, face, and stomach, and left to die.|$|E

25|$|After Schultz's death, it was {{discovered}} {{that he and his wife}} had never gone through an official marriage ceremony, and the possible existence of another wife emerged with the discovery of letters and pictures of another woman and children among his effects at the hotel where he was staying in Newark. This was never resolved, as his common-law wife <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it and the mystery woman never came forward. Two other women also called at the morgue to receive his effects, but their identities were never established. Though he was estimated to be worth $7million when he died, no trace of the money was ever found.|$|E
25|$|Sheringham's {{first season}} at Old Trafford was {{difficult}} - although he scored 14 goals in all competitions {{he failed to}} meet expectations as the 1997–98 season ended without the league title. Towards {{the end of the}} season, during a game at Bolton Wanderers, an incident occurred that furthered the animosity with fellow striker Andy Cole. When Bolton scored, Sheringham blamed Cole, his strike partner and Cole then <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him. The breakdown in their relationship was never resolved, and reputedly they never spoke again. This had started three years previously in 1995 when Sheringham had snubbed Cole as the latter came on to make his international debut.|$|E
25|$|By 1880, {{the members}} of the X Club had {{prominent}} positions within the scientific community, and the club was highly regarded, but it was beginning to fall apart. In 1883, Spottiswoode died of typhoid and at the same time, according to Spencer, only two of the remaining eight members of the X club were in good health. Attendance at meetings began to dwindle and by 1885, Frankland and Lubbock urged for the election of new members. There was a difference of opinion on the matter and it was eventually dropped. In 1889, a rift emerged in the group when Huxley and Spencer had an argument over land nationalisation policies and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with one another.|$|E

25|$|Supposedly {{given to}} The Guardian by a Televisa employee. The document's {{authenticity}} was never possible to confirm– however dates, names, and events largely coincide. Televisa <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the documents, and denied {{a relationship with}} the PRI or its presidential candidate, saying that they had provided equal media coverage to all parties. Televisa published an article supposedly showing discrepancies in The Guardian documents and denying accusations. Televisa covered the protests of Yo Soy 132 in detail.Televisa, the largest media network in the Spanish-speaking world, owns around two-thirds of the programming on Mexico's TV channels. In Mexico, newspaper readership is low and research on the Internet and cable TV is largely limited to the middle classes; consequently, the country's two major television networks – Televisa and TV Azteca – exert a significant influence in national politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the elections, about {{one third of the}} {{electorate}} had not yet made up their minds, resulting in polls giving strongly varying indications. For this reason campaigning continued on election day itself. An aspect of this was tactical voting, with SP telling PvdA voters that a strong SP would force PvdA to form a left-wing coalition, VVD saying something similar to CDA voters concerning a right-wing coalition, PvdA and CDA saying they needed to be strong to prevent the other party from forming or dominating a coalition and ChristianUnion saying it has the best cards to participate in any coalition. Shortly before the elections, PvdA leader Bos showed himself more interested in the much talked about left-wing coalition of PvdA, SP and GroenLinks (possibly with ChristenUnie), which he had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about for months.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November, Rau <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the {{psychologist}} and, on 6 November, {{was scheduled for}} an assessment by a psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Fruckacz, who recommended that she be taken to a hospital. He could not make a certain diagnosis, but he believed that schizophrenia was a possibility, along with a personality disorder. A psychiatrist from Glenside Mental Health Service, a campus of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, was told about Anna's behaviour, and said that her problems were behavioural, and not mental-health related. The Rural and Remote Mental Health Service (RRMHS) offered a videoconference, but Baxter officials instead wanted Anna {{to be admitted to}} a hospital, because they believed that she would not cooperate with a video assessment. On 17 November, the RRMHS took Anna off the waiting list for hospital treatment, without informing officials at Baxter, who believed that their request was still being considered.|$|E
