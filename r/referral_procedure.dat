40|$|Aims and objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of an education programme and screening and referral tool designed for cardiac nurses to facilitate depression screening and <b>referral</b> <b>procedures</b> for patients with coronary heart disease. Background: There is a high prevalence of depression in patients with coronary heart disease that is often undetected. It is important therefore that nurses working with cardiac patients are equipped with the knowledge and skills to recognise the signs and symptoms of depression and refer appropriately. Design: A qualitative approach with purposive sampling and semi-structural interviews was implemented within the Donabedian ‘Structure-Process-Outcome’ evaluation framework. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 cardiac nurses working in a major metropolitan hospital six weeks post-attending an education programme on depression and coronary heart disease. Thematic data analysis was implemented, specifically adhering to Halcomb and Davidson 2 ̆ 7 s (2006) pragmatic data analysis, to examine nurse knowledge and experience of depression assessment and referral in an acute cardiac ward. Results: The key findings of this study were that the education programme: (1) increased the knowledge base of nurses working with cardiac patients on comorbid depression and coronary heart disease, and (2) assisted in the identification of depression and the referral of ‘at risk’ patients. Conclusions: Emphasis was placed on the translational significance of educating cardiac nurses about depression via the introduction of a depression screening and referral instrument designed specifically for use in the cardiac ward. As a result, participants found they were better equipped to identify depressive symptoms and, guided by the screening instrument, to confidently instigate <b>referral</b> <b>procedures.</b> Relevance to clinical practice: Much complexity lies in caring for cardiac patients with depression, including issues such as misdiagnosis.

40|$|Curriculum-based {{measurement}} of academic performance {{is an alternative}} to traditional refer-ral and assessment models in psychoeducational evaluation. This study contrasted a screening and <b>referral</b> <b>procedure</b> that used weekly measure-ment of performance in reading, spelling, and written expression with a traditional teacher-re-ferral procedure. Students referred by the 2 methods were compared with respect to referral rate, cognitive functioning, achievement level, social behavior, sex differences, and identifica-tion as learning disabled. The number of students referred through curriculum-based measurement {{was similar to the}} number referred by teachers. In addition, the results indicated that academic achievement was almost the sole criterion used in teacher referral, although teacher-referred stu-dents {{were more likely to be}} rated as behavior problems. Finally, students referred through weekly achievement measurement were as likely to have an aptitude-achievement discrepancy as were students referred by teachers. The role of bias in referral and identification decisions in special education cur-rently receives much attention. Significant factors that influence the referral proc-ess include student characteristics, placement-team decision-making practices, in-stitutional constraints, and external pressures. Several kinds of pupil characteristics differentially affect teacher-pupil interac-tions and diagnostic outcomes. Socioeconomic status of students significantly af-fects teacher prediction of pupil performance (Miller, McLaughlin, Haddon, & Chansky, 1968). Teacher predictions also have been shown to be affected by sex of student (Jackson & Lahaderne, 1967; Schlosser & Algozzine, 1979).

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the outcomes of marketing authorisation applications via the mutual recognition and decentralised procedures (MRP/DCP) and assess determinants of licensing failure during CMDh referral procedures. METHODS: All MRP/DCP procedures to the Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures-human (CMDh) during the period from January 2006 to December 2013 were analysed. Reasons for starting referral procedures were scored. In addition, a survey under pharmaceutical companies was performed to estimate the frequency of licensing failure prior to CMDh referrals. RESULTS: During the study period, 10392 MRP/DCP procedures were finalized. Three hundred seventy-seven (3. 6 %) resulted in a <b>referral</b> <b>procedure,</b> of which 70 (19 %) resulted in licensing failure, defined as refusal or withdrawal of the application. The frequency of CMDh referrals decreased from 14. 5 % in 2006 to 1. 6 % in 2013. Of all referrals, 272 (72 %) were resolved through consensus within the CMDh, the remaining 105 (28 %) were resolved at the level of the CHMP. Most referrals were started because of objections raised about the clinical development program. Study design issues and objections about the demonstration of equivalence were most likely to result in licensing failure. An estimated 11 % of all MRP/DCP procedures resulted in licensing failure prior to CMDh referral. CONCLUSION: Whereas the absolute number of MRP/DCP procedures resulting in a referral has reduced substantially over the past years, no specific time trend could be observed regarding the frequency of referrals resulting in licensing failure. Increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via the MRP/DCP...|$|E
