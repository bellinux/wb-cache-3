40|$|Through {{measurements}} from 82 test chips, {{each with}} a state <b>retention</b> <b>block</b> of 8192 flip-flops, implemented using 65 -nm design library, we demonstrate that state integrity of a flip-flop is sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation. It has been found at 25 ?C that First Failure Voltage (FFV) of flip-flops varies from die to die, ranging from 245 -mV to 315 -mV, with 79 % of total dies exhibiting single bit failure at FFV, while the rest show multi-bit failure. In terms of temperature variation, {{it has been found}} that FFV increases by up to 30 -mV with increase in temperature from 25 ?C to 79 ?C, demonstrating its sensitivity to temperature variation. This work proposes a PVT-aware state-protection technique to ensure state integrity of flip-flops, while achieving maximum leakage savings. The proposed technique consists of characterization algorithm to determine minimum state retention voltage (MRV) of each die, and employs horizontal and vertical parity for error detection and single bit error correction. In case of error detection, it dynamically adjusts MRV per die to avoid subsequent errors. Silicon results show that at characterized MRV, flip-flop state integrity is preserved, while achieving up to 17. 6 % reduction in retention voltage across 82 -dies...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether {{the timing of}} presentation of tones while practicing a serial reaction time task affects retention. Design: Thirty-eight young adults practiced 4 different 12 -sequence aiming tasks. There was one control condition without a tone and three experimental conditions in which a tone was presented; i. e., a tone could appear before the next target onset, at the next target onset, or after the next target onset. Sequence learning for each condition was assessed with a <b>retention</b> <b>block</b> in which no tones were presented. Performance changes {{as compared to the}} control condition were analyzed to assess if acquisition and/or learning was affected by the presentation of the tones. Results: Tone condition affected mainly reaction time. It was shown that if a tone was presented 150 ms before displaying the next target in the sequence the reaction time of the aiming movement decreased significantly. Furthermore, it was shown that tone onset 150 ms before target presentation and tone onset at target presentation resulted in a benefit during acquisition after block 5 and 6 respectively. However, the benefit disappeared during retention, because none of the tone conditions showed differential performance as compared to the control condition. Conclusions: Timing of tones affects the acquisition of serial reaction time tasks, but it does not alter learning. It is suggested that this pattern of findings supports the notion that tones result in a non-specific activation of the motor system, which affect immediate performance but not learning...|$|E
40|$|Transcranial {{random noise}} {{stimulation}} (tRNS) {{is a form}} of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) that has been shown to increase motor performance in simple motor tasks. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the influence of tRNS on motor skill acquisition and learning in a complex, modified golf putting task in young adults. Twenty-four (n = 12 per group) healthy young adult males were allocated to either a tRNS group or a SHAM stimulation group. Both groups performed 6 trials of the golf putting task in a baseline testing block, followed by 4 practice blocks of 15 trials. The practice blocks were followed by a post-testing block (6 trials) that was performed five minutes after the last practice block, and a retention testing block (6 trials) that was performed 24 hours later. For the practice blocks, subjects performed the golf putting task for 20 minutes in combination with either tRNS or SHAM stimulation. tRNS or SHAM stimulation was applied to the motor cortex with the stimulating electrode centered over the motor hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The primary dependent variables were endpoint error and endpoint variance, whereas the putter face angle relative to ball path at impact and forward swing time were selected as secondary dependent variables. For the practice blocks, the dependent variables were analyzed by two-factor repeated measures ANOVAs: 2 group (real tRNS, SHAM) x 4 Block. For the testing blocks, the dependent variables were analyzed by two-factor repeated measures ANOVAs: 2 group (real tRNS, SHAM) x 3 Test (BASELINE, POST and RETENTION). The results indicted that there were no significant differences in endpoint error or endpoint variance between the tRNS and SHAM groups for the practice blocks. However, there was a significant reduction in endpoint error between blocks 1 and 3 (P = 0. 20), and a significant reduction in endpoint variance between blocks 1 and 3, and 1 and 4 (P = 0. 011 and 0. 039, respectively). For face angle relative to path, there was a iv significant group x block interaction, but the post-hoc tests failed statistical significance. Forward swing time remained invariant across all of the practice blocks. For the testing blocks, endpoint error was significantly reduced in both groups between the baseline block and the post-test block (P = 0. 000), but there was no difference between groups. Similarly, endpoint variance was not different between groups, but decreased significantly for both groups between the baseline block and the post-test block, and between the baseline block and <b>retention</b> <b>block</b> (P = 0. 000 and 0. 018, respectively). Face angle relative to path was significantly more closed for both groups in the post-test block comparison to the baseline block (P = 0. 012) and more opened in the <b>retention</b> <b>block</b> when compared to post-test block (P = 0. 028). Forward swing time was not different between groups or between any of the testing blocks. These findings suggest that tRNS influenced the execution of this motor task, but this influence did not occur in a manner that lead to an improvement in motor skill acquisition or motor learning in the current task conditions...|$|E

40|$|The present studies {{examined}} the effects of basolateral amygdala (BLA) lesions induced prior to or after context-footshock training on 48 -h memory, using several retention measures. In experiment 1, male Sprague-Dawley rats with bilateral BLA lesions (NMDA, 12. 5 mg/mL, 0. 2 μL) were given footshock training in one compartment of a two-compartment alley. Rats were habituated to the alley and 24 h later were given two footshocks in the shock compartment. Retention was tested 48 h later, using latency to enter the shock compartment and time spent freezing as measures of memory. Two days later, they were tested again and received a footshock on each re-entry of the shock compartment prior to remaining in the safe compartment for 200 consecutive seconds. The BLA lesions did not <b>block</b> <b>retention</b> as assessed by freezing or number of re-entries of the shock compartment. In experiment 2, no prior habituation was given, and only one footshock was used for the training. BLA lesions did not <b>block</b> <b>retention,</b> as indicated by latencies to enter the shock compartment on a 48 -h test or by number of entries of the shock compartment. Experiment 3 {{examined the}} effects of the GABAA agonist muscimol infused into the BLA prior to the 48 -h retention test.

40|$|Evidence that protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors induce amnesia {{in a variety}} of species and learning paradigms indicates that the consolidation of newly acquired information into stable memories requires the synthesis of new proteins. Because extinction of a response also requires acquisition of new information, extinction, like original learning, would be expected to require {{protein synthesis}}. The present experiments examined the involvement of protein synthesis in the hippocampus in the extinction of a learned fear-based response known to involve the hippocampus. Rats were trained in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task in which they received footshock after stepping from a small platform to a grid floor. They were then given daily retention tests without footshock. The inhibitory response (e. g., remaining on the platform) gradually extinguished with repeated testing over several days. Footshock administered in a different context, instead of a retention test, prevented the extinction. Infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (80 μg) into the CA 1 region of the hippocampus (bilaterally) 10 min before inhibitory avoidance training impaired retention on all subsequent tests. Anisomycin infused into the hippocampus immediately after the 1 st <b>retention</b> test <b>blocked</b> extinction of the response. Infusions administered before the 1 st retention test induced a temporary (i. e., 1 day) reduction in <b>retention</b> performance and <b>blocked</b> subsequent extinction.

40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique {{in which a}} very weak electrical current {{is applied to the}} scalp to either increase (anodal stimulation) or decrease (cathodal stimulation) the excitability of a selected brain region, most commonly the motor cortex. tDCS is a promising intervention that can modulate cortical excitability, enhance motor learning, and improve motor function in healthy subjects, older adults, stroke patients, Parkinson’s disease, and in other cognitive and motor disorders. Recently, cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) has started to be examined using similar protocols as existing ones used in studies of tDCS applied to the motor cortex and has been able to improve performance in simple arm movement tasks in young and old adults. This study was is set out to evaluate the influence that c-tDCS has on accuracy and variability of a complex, multi-joint throwing task in younger adult population. A total of 24 (n = 12 per group) healthy young adult males were allocated to either a c-tDCS group or a SHAM stimulation group. Each subject participated in two experimental sessions (practice session, retention session) performed on consecutive days. In the first session (practice session), subjects performed the throwing task in a baseline testing block, followed by 6 practice trial blocks. The practice blocks were followed by a post-testing block. For the practice blocks only, subjects performed the throwing task for 25 minutes in combination with either c-tDCS or SHAM stimulation. In the second session (retention session), subjects perform a <b>retention</b> test (1 <b>block</b> of trials of the throwing task) 24 hours after the practice session to quantify the magnitude of motor learning experienced by the two groups. The primary dependent variable was the endpoint error, whereas the endpoint variance was selected as the secondary dependent variable. For the test blocks, the dependent variables were analyzed by two-factor repeated measures ANOVAs: 2 Group (c-tDCS, SHAM) x 3 Test (BASELINE, POST, RETENTION). For the practice blocks, the dependent variables were analyzed by two-factor repeated measures ANOVAs: 2 Group (c-tDCS, SHAM) x 6 Block (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). For the endpoint error in the test blocks, {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups of subjects for any of the testing blocks. However, independent of group, endpoint error was significantly lower for the post-test block compared with the baseline test block (P = 0. 004). Furthermore, endpoint error was similar between the <b>retention</b> test <b>block</b> and the baseline test block. Finally, the difference in endpoint error between the <b>retention</b> test <b>block</b> and the post-test block barely failed statistical significance (P = 0. 063). For the practice blocks, the results indicated that there were no significant differences in endpoint error between the c-tDCS and SHAM groups (P = 0. 148). Furthermore, endpoint error was not different for any of the practice blocks, which indicated that endpoint error did not decrease significantly with practice. For the endpoint variance in the test blocks, there was a significant (P = 0. 034) GROUP x TEST interaction. Conversely, the post hoc analysis shows that the interaction came close, but missed statistical significance (P = 0. 107 and P = 0. 067) for lower endpoint variance in the c-tDCS group compared with the SHAM group for the post test <b>block</b> and <b>retention</b> test <b>block,</b> respectively. However, the difference between the groups for the baseline test was not significant (P = 0. 824). For endpoint variance in the practice blocks, the results indicated that there were no significant differences between the c-tDCS and SHAM groups (P = 0. 152). Furthermore, endpoint variance was not different for any of the practice blocks, which indicated that endpoint variance did not decrease significantly with practice.

On this basis, percolation rules and blocking characteristics of suspension in heterogeneous reservoir were investigated. It is showed that suspension injection could remarkably reduce the permeable ratio and improve the heterogeneity significantly. Low-speed and low-viscosity injection could achieve shallow profile control, and high-speed and high-viscosity injection could achieve deep profile control. Adjusting the injection rate or viscosity of carrying fluid slug {{at the right time}} to make the particle retention concentration profile in thief zones and the water-flood front keep consistent could achieve dynamic profile control. For the reservoirs without a good interlayer, the optimum injection rate and viscosity of carrying fluid were chosen based on the connectivity of layers, and in the reservoirs with good interlayers the injection rate and viscosity should be lowered appropriately under the field permitting conditions. When the suspension concentration was constant, the instantaneous fractional flow of high permeable layer first decreased sharply and then ramped up with the increasing injection volume. Initial percolation coefficient is the basis of a high utilization of suspension and a good result in profile control.

40|$|Unlike other {{currently}} available progestogens, drospirenone (DRSP) has a pharmacological profile, which closely mimics that of endogenous progesterone, most notably potent anti-aldosterone and anti-androgenic effects. Consequently, DRSP, {{when combined with}} 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), offsets E 2 -related water and sodium <b>retention</b> by <b>blocking</b> the mineralocorticoid receptor. This review evaluates the potential benefits offered by DRSP as the progestin component of HRT with respect to its anti-aldosterone activity, which translates into positive effects on body weight and blood pressure in clinical trials of continuous, combined E 2 /DRSP in post-menopausal women. In a 1 -year, large-scale, randomised, controlled trial, E 2 1 mg/DRSP 2 mg significantly decreased mean body weight by 1. 2 kg versus baseline (P = 5. 5 meq/L) irrespective of concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and co-morbid diabetes mellitus. In summary, as well as effectively treating climacteric symptoms, DRSP 2 mg combined with E 2 I mg has shown positive effects on body weight and blood pressure in clinical trials, most likely due to DRSP's anti-aldosterone properties. This combination may therefore offer an alternative therapeutic option with additional benefits beyond current HRT agents for symptomatic post-menopausal women. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Sequence {{comparison}} {{suggests that a}} C-terminal extension (CTE) includes a potential transmembrane domain as in some membrane-type (MT) -MMPs. Having noticed that MMP- 27 was barely secreted, we investigated its subcellular localization and addressed CTE contribution for MMP- 27 retention. Intracellular MMP- 27 was sensitive to endoglycosidase H. Subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy evidenced retention of endogenous MMP- 27 or recombinant rMMP- 27 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with locked exit across the intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Conversely, truncated rMMP- 27 without CTE accessed downstream secretory compartments (ERGIC and Golgi) and was constitutively secreted. CTE addition to rMMP- 10 (a secreted MMP) caused ER <b>retention</b> and <b>blocked</b> secretion. Addition of a PKA target sequence to the cytosolic C-terminus of transmembrane MT 1 -MMP/MMP- 14 led to effective phosphorylation upon forskolin stimulation, but not for MMP- 27, excluding transmembrane anchorage. Moreover, MMP- 27 was protected from digestion by proteinase K digestion. Finally, MT 1 -MMP/MMP- 14 but neither endogenous nor recombinant MMP- 27 partitioned in the detergent phase after Triton X- 114 extraction, indicating that MMP- 27 is not an integral membrane protein.

40|$|Transport and {{retention}} behavior of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was studied in mixtures of negatively charged quartz sand (QS) and positively charged goethite-coated sand (GQS) {{to assess the}} role of chemical heterogeneity. The linear equilibrium sorption model provided a good description of batch results, and the distribution coefficients (KD) drastically increased with the GQS fraction that was electrostatically favorable for retention. Similarly, retention of MWCNTs increased with the GQS fraction in packed column experiments. However, calculated values of KD on GQS were around 2 orders of magnitude smaller in batch than packed column experiments {{due to differences in}} lever arms associated with hydrodynamic and adhesive torques at microscopic roughness locations. Furthermore, the fraction of the sand surface area that was favorable for retention (Sf) was much smaller than the GQS fraction because nanoscale roughness produced shallow interactions that were susceptible to removal. These observations indicate that only a minor fraction of the GQS was favorable for MWCNT retention. These same observations held for several different sand sizes.

The present study examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats the effects of systemically administered corticosterone on retrieval of memory for inhibitory avoidance training. Corticosterone (3. 0 mg/kg, s. c.) injected 30 min before retention testing, 48 h after training, significantly impaired retention performance, as compared to vehicle treatment, of rats tested in the training context. In contrast, corticosterone administration did not impair retrieval when rats were tested for retention in a different context. Corticosterone did also not impair retention performance of rats given a mild-intensity footshock that resulted in only weak, non-contextual memory. These findings strongly suggest that corticosterone selectively impaired retrieval of contextual information associated with the training context.

Hyaluronan oligosaccharides {{have been shown to}} inhibit several tumor cell types via disrup- tion of receptor-hyaluronan interaction. However, few studies have addressed hyaluronan with respect to osteosarcoma. In this study, we examined the ef- fects of exogenously added hyaluronan oligosaccha- rides on tumorigenicity of murine osteosarcoma cells, LM- 8, and human osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells, MG- 63. Moreover, the critical size of oligomers needed to inhibit malignant properties was defined. Fluorescent hyaluronan oligosaccharides accumu- lated both on the surface of cells and in the cyto- plasm, and this <b>retention</b> was <b>blocked</b> by pretreat- ment with an anti-CD 44 monoclonal antibody. Hyaluronan octasaccharides significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis as defined by cell proliferation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans- ferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays, respectively. Octasaccharides also abrogated functional cell-associ- ated matrices and significantly reduced the retention of endogenous hyaluronan. Further, octasaccharide treatment affected an inhibition of cell motility as well as cell invasiveness. Pretreatment of the cells withanti-CD 44 antibodyreducedtheantitumoreffect of the octasaccharides. In vivo, intratumoral injection of hyaluronan octasaccharides reduced the hyaluronan accumulation in local tumors, resulting in significant suppression of the formation of distant lung metastasis.

40|$|Emotional {{enhancement}} of memory by noradrenergic mechanisms is well-described, but the long-term {{consequences of such}} enhancement are poorly understood. Over time, memory traces are thought to undergo a neural reorganization, that is, a systems consolidation, during which they are, at least partly, transferred from the hippocampus to neocortical networks. This transfer {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in episodic detailedness. Here we investigated whether norepinephrine (NE) administration into the basolateral amygdala after training on an inhibitory avoidance discrimination task, comprising two distinct training contexts, alters systems consolidation dynamics to maintain episodic-like accuracy and hippocampus dependency of remote memory. At a 2 -d retention test, both saline- and NE-treated rats accurately discriminated the training context in which they had received footshock. Hippocampal inactivation with muscimol before retention testing disrupted discrimination of the shock context in both treatment groups. At 28 d, saline-treated rats showed hippocampus-independent retrieval and lack of discrimination. In contrast, NE-treated rats continued to display accurate memory of the shock-context association. Hippocampal inactivation at this remote <b>retention</b> test <b>blocked</b> episodic-like accuracy and induced a general memory impairment. These findings suggest that the NE treatment altered systems consolidation dynamics by maintaining hippocampal involvement in the memory. This shift in systems consolidation was paralleled by time-regulated DNA methylation and transcriptional changes of memory-related genes, namely Reln and Pkmzeta, in the hippocampus and neocortex. The findings provide evidence suggesting that consolidation of emotional memories by noradrenergic mechanisms alters systems consolidation dynamics and, as a consequence, influences the maintenance of long-term episodic-like accuracy of memory...|$|R

Brudevold and Steadman 9 determined spectrographically the native Sn levels in enamel. Radioactive Sn (II), as " 13 Sn with a half life of 112 days, was used by Meckel' 0 to determine Sn <b>retention</b> in <b>blocks</b> of enamel worn in a dental appliance. To complement these procedures, all of which have some limitations for general use in the evaluation of topical SnF 2 procedures, studies were initiated to determine the optimum conditions for the determination of Sn in enamel and dentin by use of atomic absorption spectroscopy. These conditions could then be related to procedures for...|$|R
40|$|Organic fouling and {{its effects}} on trace organic {{retention}} by three nanofiltration (NF) membranes were investigated in this study. An accelerated fouling condition was achieved with foulant cocktail containing humic acids in background electrolyte solution. The effects of membrane fouling on the separation process was delineated by comparing theretention values of clean and fouled membranes and relate them to the membrane pore size as well as physicochemical characteristics of the trace organics. Fouling was more severe for the more open pore size TFC-SR 2 and NF 270 membranes as compared to the tighter NF 90 membrane. Results reported here indicate that retention of trace organics by NF membranes was governed by steric hindrance, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. However, steric hindrance (or size exclusion) appears to be the most prevalent mechanism controlling not only trace organic retention but also the membrane fouling process as well as the effects of fouling on <b>retention.</b> Pore <b>blocking</b> was a major reason for the more severe fouling by the loose nanofiltration TFC-SR 2 membrane as compared to the NF- 270 and NF- 90 membranes which had smaller membrane pore size. Considerable increase in retention of trace organicsby the TFC-SR 2 membrane under fouled conditions was probably attributed to pore blocking, which was a dominating fouling mechanism for this loose NF membrane. While retention increase due to pore blocking was probably limited to only the TFC-SR 2 membrane, retention of hydrophobic trace organics was enhanced under fouled conditions by all threemembranes. This enhancement in retention of the hydrophobic trace organics could be explained by the formation of a fouling layer which reduced hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic trace organics and the membrane surface, hence reducing diffusional transport across the membrane...|$|R
40|$|BCR {{signaling}} pathway inhibitors such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and fostamatinib (respective inhibitors of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, PI 3 Kd, and spleen tyrosine kinase) represent a significant therapeutic advance in B cell malignancies, including chronic lympho-cytic leukemia (CLL). These drugs are distinctive in increasing blood lymphocytes while simultaneously shrinking enlarged lymph nodes, suggesting anatomical redistribution of CLL cells from lymph nodes into the blood. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. In this study, {{we showed that}} the egress receptor, sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) receptor 1 (S 1 PR 1), was expressed at low levels in normal germinal centers and CLL lymph nodes in vivo but became upregulated on normal B cells and, to a variable and lesser extent, CLL cells following in vitro incubation in S 1 P-free medium. Spontaneous recovery of S 1 PR 1 expression on normal B and CLL cells was prevented by BCR cross-linking, whereas treatment of CLL cells with idelalisib increased S 1 PR 1 expression and migration toward S 1 P, the greatest increase occurring in cases with unmutated IgH V region genes. Intriguingly, ibrutinib and fostamatinib {{had no effect on}} S 1 PR 1 expression or function. Conversely, chemokine-induced migration, which requires integrin activation and is essential for the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes as well as their <b>retention,</b> was <b>blocked</b> by ibrutinib and fostamatinib, but not idelalisib. In summary, our results suggest that different BCR signaling inhibitors redistribute CLL cells from lymph nodes into the blood through distinct mechanisms: idelalisib actively promotes egress by upregulating S 1 PR 1, whereas fostamatinib and ibrutinib may reduce CLL cell entry and retention by suppressing chemokine-induced integrin activation.

40|$|Epidural {{analgesia}} {{is often}} considered optimal postoperative analgesia for certain surgical procedures. Ropivacaine {{is a new}} local anesthetic that is less toxic than its homologue, bupivacaine. Epidural infusions usually comprise a local anesthetic, an opioid, {{or a combination of}} the two to improve analgesic efficacy and reduce unwanted side effects. All 210 patients undergoing lower abdominal or lower extremity surgery received epidural analgesia infusions at 7 mL/hour, 105 with 0. 1 % ropivacaine and 105 with 0. 1 % ropivacaine plus 1 μg/mL fentanyl. Pain score and side effects (hypotension, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, paresthesia, urinary <b>retention</b> and motor <b>block)</b> were measured at 0, 0. 5, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours. There was no statistical difference in patient profile between the groups. Pain relief scores were similar in the two groups in the first hour after the drugs were given. However, pain relief was significantly better in the ropivacaine/fentanyl group after the first hour and this difference lasted for the remaining time. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups during 24 hours of assessment. In conclusion, the quality of analgesia was significantly improved by the addition of fentanyl 1 μg/mL to ropivacaine...|$|R
40|$|Current {{society has}} to deal with major {{challenges}} related to our constantly increasing population of older adults. Since motor performance generally deteriorates at older age, research investigating the effects of different types of training on motor improvement is particularly important. Here, we tested the effects of contextual interference (CI) while learning a bimanual coordination task in both young and older subjects. Both age groups acquired a low and high complexity task variant following either a blocked or random practice schedule. Typical CI effects, i. e. better overall performance during acquisition but detrimental effects during <b>retention</b> for the <b>blocked</b> compared with the random groups, were found for the low complexity task variant in both age groups. With respect to the high complexity task variant, no retention differences between both practice schedules were found. However, following random practice, better skill persistence (i. e. from end of acquisition to retention) over a one week time interval was observed for both task complexity variants and in both age groups. The current study provides clear evidence that the effects of different practice schedules on learning a complex bimanual task are not modulated by age...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability {{is crucial}} to the urban zones, {{especially}} related to the water management, which is vulnerable to flood occurrence. This research applies the procedure contemplated by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) to determine the generated volumes when the impervious areas can exceed the drainage capacity of existing pluvial water networks. Several computational simulations were developed for the current scenario of an existing basin in Lisbon. Using CivilStorm software from Bentley Systems (Bentley EMEA, Bentley Systems International Limited, Dublin, Ireland), it enabled the evaluation of the volumes of flood peaks and the hydraulic behavior of a small hydrographic basin in the continuation of an urbanization process, considering the modification of its superficial impervious parts and the growth of the urbanized area. Several measures are suggested to solve the limited capacity of the existing drainage system. This study analyzes the efficiency of the application of constructive measures, pondering the viability of their effectiveness, individually and combined. The option that best minimizes the effects of the urbanization is the combination of different structural measures, in particular <b>retention</b> ponds, storage <b>blocks,</b> ditches and specific drainage interventions {{in some parts of the}} network...|$|R
40|$|Intra-amygdala {{infusion}} of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (CNQX) prior to testing impairs inhibitory avoidance retention test performance. Increased training attenuates the impairing effects of amygdala lesions and intra-amygdala infusions of CNQX. The {{objective of the}} present study was to determine the effects of additional training on the impairing effects of intra-amygdala CNQX on expression of the inhibitory avoidance task. Adult female Wistar rats bilaterally implanted with cannulae into the border between the central and the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala were submitted to a single session or to three training sessions (0. 2 mA, 24 -h interval between sessions) in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task. A retention test session was held 48 h after the last training. Ten minutes prior to the retention test session, the animals received a 0. 5 -µl {{infusion of}} CNQX (0. 5 µg) or its vehicle (25 % dimethylsulfoxide in saline). The CNQX infusion impaired, but did not <b>block,</b> <b>retention</b> test performance in animals submitted to a single training session. Additional training prevented the impairing effect of CNQX. The results suggest that amygdaloid non-NMDA receptors may not be critical for memory expression in animals given increased training...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} at the chromatographic {{critical condition}} has drawn much attention as an attractive characterization method of block copolymers {{since it has}} been proposed that {{a part of a}} polymer chain becomes "chromatographically invisible" at this condition, which would permit the characterization of individual blocks. A critical condition for a polymer species has been commonly established by use of mixed-solvent systems. It is not easy, however, to reproduce the critical condition since the retention of polymers depends very sensitively on the solvent composition and purity. Furthermore, the preferential sorption of a component in a mixed solvent may cause an additional problem. Therefore, the use of a single solvent is highly desirable to improve the reproducibility as well as the repeatability. In this study, a single-solvent critical condition for polyisoprene was established with 1, 4 -dioxane and C 18 bonded silica as the mobile and stationary phases, respectively. At this condition, the "chromatographic invisibility" of polystyrene-polyisoprene diblock copolymers was critically examined and it was found that a rigorous chromatographic invisibility was not achieved and the <b>retention</b> of the <b>block</b> copolymers was affected by the length of the blocks under the critical condition. Some other chromatographic applications using the single-solvent system are also reported. open 323...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist D,L- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid (AP 5) into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) on the formation and expression of memory for inhibitory avoidance. Adult male Wistar rats (215 - 300 g) were implanted under thionembutal anesthesia (30 mg/kg, ip) with 9. 0 -mm guide cannulae aimed 1. 0 mm above the BLA. Bilateral infusions of AP 5 (5. 0 µg) were given 10 min prior to training, immediately after training, or 10 min prior to testing in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task (0. 3 mA footshock, 24 -h interval between training and the retention test session). Both pre- and post-training infusions of AP 5 <b>blocked</b> <b>retention</b> test performance. When given prior to the test, AP 5 did not affect retention. AP 5 did not affect training performance, and a control experiment showed that the impairing effects were not due to alterations in footshock sensitivity. The results suggest that NMDA receptor activation in the BLA {{is involved in the}} formation, but not the expression, of memory for inhibitory avoidance in rats. However, the results do not necessarily imply that the role of NMDA receptors in the BLA is to mediate long-term storage of fear-motivated memory within the amygdala...|$|R
40|$|The chain {{architecture}} {{dependence of}} the <b>retention</b> behavior of <b>block</b> copolymers in the temperature gradient interaction chromatography (TGIC) and liquid chromatography at the critical condition (LCCC) was investigated. For the purpose, polystyrene (PS) /polybutadiene (PB) diblock (SB), SBS triblock, and BSB triblock copolymers were prepared by sequential anionic polymerization and further fractionated by reversed-phase TGIC to obtain a set of the block copolymers with high purity, narrow distribution, and matched block length. In the TGIC separation with C 18 bonded silica stationary phase and a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 CN mobile phase, retention of the three block copolymers with matched molecular weight and composition shows a significant architecture effect: SBS elutes significantly earlier while BSB or SB elute later at similar retention volume. It indicates that the polymer-stationary phase interaction is less effective for the PB block located at {{the middle of the}} chain than the blocks located at the chain end. In LCCC separation at the critical condition for PB block, SBS is eluted early while SB and BSB were eluted later at the same retention time. Therefore, triblock copolymer with an invisible middle block behaves differently from those having invisible end block(s). This behavior is consistent with the theoretical prediction by Guttman et al. open 383...|$|R
40|$|The {{cortical}} cytoskeleton is a {{dense network}} of filamentous actin (F-actin) that {{participates in the}} events associated with secretion from neuroendocrine cells. This filamentous web traps secretory vesicles, acting as a <b>retention</b> system that <b>blocks</b> the access of vesicles to secretory sites during the resting state, and it mediates their active directional transport during stimulation. The changes in the cortical cytoskeleton that drive this functional transformation have been well documented, particularly in cultured chromaffin cells. At the biochemical level, alterations in F-actin are governed by the activity of molecular motors like myosins II and V and by other calcium-dependent proteins that influence the polymerization and cross-linking of F-actin structures. In addition to modulating vesicle transport, the F-actin cortical network and its associated motor proteins also influence the late phases of the secretory process, including membrane fusion {{and the release of}} active substances through the exocytotic fusion pore. Here, we discuss the potential interactions between the F-actin cortical web and proteins such as SNAREs during secretion. We also discuss the role of the cytoskeleton in organizing the molecular elements required to sustain regulated exocytosis, forming a molecular structure that foments the efficient release of neurotransmitters and hormones. © 2012 Elsevier Inc [...] Peer Reviewe...|$|R
