We have previously identified two new <b>reaction</b> <b>channels</b> on each <b>reaction</b> surface, except for reactions involving dimethyl ether [J. Phys. Chem. A, 2001, 105, 1185]. The previously unreported <b>reaction</b> <b>channels</b> involve H₂ elimination following the initial formation of an association complex.

The H₂-elimination channels are slightly disfavored upon reaction of singlet silylene with methanol and ethanol, but become the preferred <b>reaction</b> <b>channels</b> with trifluoromethanol as the reaction partner. For reactions involving singlet germylene with water and with methanol, the ACT analyses predict that the H₂-elimination channels will occur in preference to 1, 2 H-atom migration.
