25|$|The first {{discovery}} of a stable nitroxide radical was made in 1959. Since then, they have been developed as a versatile class of organic oxidants, both in the stoichiometric and catalytic mode. A single-electron oxidation of the nitroxide radical produces a highly electrophilic oxoammonium species, which serves as the active oxidizing agent. Although pre-formed N-oxoammonium salts may be used stoichiometrically for oxidations, these have largely been replaced by catalytic methods that use a cheaper terminal oxidant, such as sodium hypochlorite or bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB). Nitroxide <b>radical</b> <b>species</b> used are either 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) or derivatives thereof. Examples of oxoammonium-based oxidations are shown below.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor that distinguishes different radiation types {{from one another}} is the linear energy transfer (LET), which is {{the rate at which}} the radiation loses energy with distance traveled through the absorber. Low LET species are usually low mass, either photons or electron mass species (β particles, positrons) and interact sparsely along their path through the absorber, leading to isolated regions of reactive <b>radical</b> <b>species.</b> High LET species are usually greater in mass than one electron, for example α particles, and lose energy rapidly resulting in a cluster of ionisation events in close proximity to one another. Consequently, the heavy particle travels a relatively short distance from its origin.|$|E
25|$|Color and {{temperature}} of a flame {{are dependent on}} the type of fuel involved in the combustion, as, for example, when a lighter is held to a candle. The applied heat causes the fuel molecules in the candle wax to vaporize. In this state they can then readily react with oxygen in the air, which gives off enough heat in the subsequent exothermic reaction to vaporize yet more fuel, thus sustaining a consistent flame. The high temperature of the flame causes the vaporized fuel molecules to decompose, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals, and these products then react {{with each other and with}} the oxidizer involved in the reaction. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in some of the transient reaction intermediates such as the Methylidyne radical (CH) and Diatomic carbon (C2), which results in the emission of visible light as these substances release their excess energy (see spectrum below for an explanation of which specific <b>radical</b> <b>species</b> produce which specific colors). As the combustion temperature of a flame increases (if the flame contains small particles of unburnt carbon or other material), so does the average energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame (see Black body).|$|E

2500|$|According to Blough & Zepp, {{superoxide}} {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10−12 M in the open ocean and up to 2×10−10M in coastal areas. [...] The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water. In marine systems, superoxide most often acts as a one-electron reductant, but it can also serve as an oxidant and may increase the normally slow oxidation rates of environmental compounds. [...] Superoxide is very unstable, with between 50 and 80% of its concentration of anions spontaneously disproportionating to hydrogen peroxide. [...] At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×104 – 4.5×105 L mol−1sec−1 in seawater. [...] The dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase with a rate constant on the order of 2×109 L mol−1sec−1. As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and dissolved organic matter, any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species. As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron. This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient. [...] As a charged <b>radical</b> <b>species,</b> superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane. [...] Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions. [...] Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320nm.|$|E
