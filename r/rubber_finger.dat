40|$|SUMMARY A {{disposable}} {{version of}} the pudendal nerve stimulator using flexible printed circuit (FPC) technology has been developed and manufactured in our department. Evaluation of this instrument against the standard is reported. In 1984 Kiff and Swash ' {{were the first to}} describe pudendal nerve stimulation in investigation of the pathophysiology of idiopathic (neurogenic) faecal incontinence. Their technique was developed from that of electro ejaculation described by Brindley, 3 for patients with impotence caused by paraplegia. The original device consisted of a <b>rubber</b> <b>finger</b> stall with two stimulating electrodes mounted on the tip and two recording electrodes mounted at the base. Though a fairly reliable instrument, it required disinfection in glutaraldehyde solution between patients and prolonged drying to prevent shorting of the electrodes. A modified and more reliable version of this reuseable type of pudendal nerve stimulator was developed in our department and is used by a number of anorectal physiology units in this country and overseas. The main drawback with this device is that it needs thorough cleaning between subjects, to prevent cross infection. Using the techniques used in the manufacture of flexible printed circuits we have developed a disposable pudendal nerve stimulator of the design shown in Figure 1. The electrodes are mounted in the same relative positions as in the reuseable model and are of the same dimensions. The flexible printed circuits terminals from the new stimulator are connected to the EMG machine by a reuseable lead by means of a quick release clip, which can be engaged and disengaged easily by a single Addressc % or corresponicec Mr Rogcrs.,D. pt(o.

40|$|Poultry {{products}} are {{popular due to}} their healthier image compared to red meats. However, the {{products are}} susceptible to contamination by many spoilage microorganisms and pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yesinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas spp. and Escherichia coli. In New Zealand (NZ), foodborne outbreaks caused by S. aureus infections may be uncommon but serious. S. aureus can grow {{in a wide range}} of pH, temperature and salt concentrations. Some strains of S. aureus can produce heat-resistant enterotoxins, while others may be methicillin-resistant which can result in hospital-linked and community-linked infections. Raw (fresh) and frozen poultry products have been associated with S. aureus contamination in many countries. The common contamination sources of S. aureus in poultry products have been linked to poor hygiene of food handlers, processing equipment and skins of live chickens. The aim of this project was to identify potential contamination sources of products and processing equipment by S. aureus from a selected processing plant to the farm in Auckland, New Zealand. Poultry meat samples were collected from Final Products, Frozen Mechanically Separated Meat (MSM), Frozen Skin, Frozen Skin-on Breast Fillet (SO BF) (further processing plant), Fresh MSM, Fresh Skin, Fresh SO BF (secondary processing plant). Swab samples were collected from the MSM conveyor, inside the Mechanically Deboning Machine (MDM), the Skinner Conveyor (secondary processing plant), <b>Rubber</b> <b>Fingers</b> in Pluckers (primary processing plant), skin and nostrils of live chicken at the farm. Viable cell counts of S. aureus were enumerated using Petrifilm™ Staph Express Count Plate to determine the contamination level of the samples. Isolates of S. aureus was confirmed by Gram-stain and coagulase-positive test. Six main sampling sites were selected for further investigation which comprised final products, Fresh MSM, Fresh Skin, Fresh SO BF, <b>Rubber</b> <b>Fingers</b> and live chickens. Ten representative S. aureus isolates grown on Petrifilms were randomly selected from samples of each of the six main sampling sites. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) were then used to detect the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxins and identify sequence types of the sixty S. aureus isolates, respectively. eBURST was used to identify the relatedness of the sequence types. Also, the contamination sources of S. aureus in the samples were traced based on the sequence types of the sixty isolates. In the further processing plant, all final product samples (n= 36) were contaminated with S. aureus. Frozen MSM had the highest contamination level ranging from 2. 00 ± 1. 02 to 2. 50 ± 0. 48 Log 10 CFU/g. Similarly, S. aureus in Fresh MSM from the secondary processing plant contained the highest S. aureus cell counts (1. 79 ± 0. 25 to 2. 85 ± 0. 51 Log 10 CFU/g), followed by Fresh SO BF (1. 85 ± 0. 56 to 2. 33 ± 0. 50 Log 10 CFU/g) and Fresh Skin (1. 72 ± 0. 60 to 2. 15 [1. 67, 3. 37] Log 10 CFU/g). In primary processing, <b>Rubber</b> <b>Fingers</b> in Plucker 1 had the highest level of S. aureus (2. 46 ± 0. 50 Log 10 CFU/swab). S. aureus counts of chicken skin ranged from 1. 00 [0. 79, 1. 48] to 1. 36 ± 0. 45 Log 10 CFU/swab, while nostrils contained 1. 00 [0. 85, 1. 48] to 1. 59 ± 0. 70 Log 10 CFU/swab. Cell counts of live chicken increased with the age (first, third, sixth week) of the chicken. Eight different types of enterotoxin genes (seg, sei, seh, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo) were identified. Of the 60 S. aureus isolates, 59 were positive for at least two different staphylococcal enterotoxins. Six different sequence types were identified (ST 5, ST 2594, ST 101, ST 83, ST 398, ST 1). Sequence types of isolates that had at least five identical loci were assigned to a single clonal complex (CC). In this study, ST 5, ST 83 and ST 2594 belonged to CC 5 with ST 5 being the clonal ancestor. MSM had the highest S. aureus contamination level due to cross-contamination inside the MDM, therefore, a proper hygiene and regular cleaning routine inside the MDM is recommended. The results suggested that the sources of S. aureus contamination in the final poultry products could be Fresh MSM, Fresh Skin, Fresh SO BF (secondary processing), <b>Rubber</b> <b>Fingers</b> in the Pluckers (primary processing) and live chickens at the farm. Chicken skin from live chickens at farm was most likely the origin of contamination of final products and equipment by S. aureus. Since not all the identified strains that colonised on the live chickens were traced back to the final products, further investigations on other potential contamination sources such as gloves and knifes used at the processing plant, feeders and drinkers at the farm are recommended...|$|R
50|$|The AVANTIX Mobile {{system was}} {{designed}} for the Sema Group plc by Printer Systems Limited this included the technique of printing and encoding the magnetic stripe at the same time, the Z-fold ticket pack and the electronic control system with interface to a Casio PDA. The AVANTIX Mobile housing was designed, developed and engineered by Hyphen Design Ltd, of London. Particular design and engineering challenges were a tamper-resistant PDA retention and ejection mechanism, and a secure loading door latch, to prevent the device spilling ticket stock or batteries if dropped onto concrete from a height of 1.5M. Hyphen Design also developed a cartridge design for holding Z-fold or fan-fold ticket stock. With the horizontally mounted cartridge, a stack of 3 or five {{or more of the}} fan-fold stock could easily be drawn into the print head and jam it. The solution was a pad of fine silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>fingers,</b> stuck to the top and bottom internal surfaces of the cartridge, to provide just enough grip on the uneven ticket stack, without putting too much load on the print head.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a model for analyzing the design of an automated live-bird transfer system (LBTS) developed at Georgia Tech. One of the most fundamental tasks in the automated transferring is to design and control a grasping system that is capable of accommodating a specified range of objects without causing damage. However, unlike grasping in robotic research that focuses on dexterous manipulation of a single object, repetitive transfer of live objects in a production line requires continuous grasping at high-speed. This thesis research investigates the use of rotating fingers (capable of undergoing large deflections) to cradle live birds on a moving conveyor for subsequent handling. As compared to fingers with multiple active joints, flexible fingers have many merits, for they are lightweight and have no relative individually moving parts. Their ability to accommodate a limited range of varying sizes, shapes, and the natural reactions of some objects makes <b>rubber</b> <b>fingers</b> an attractive candidate for use as graspers in a high-speed production setting. However, the advantages of flexible fingers are seldom exploited for grasping because of the complex analysis involved in the design. In order {{to reduce the number of}} birds and hardware/software design configurations to be tested, a good understanding of the object dynamics throughout the grasping process is necessary. In this thesis, a quasi-static model has been developed for predicting the contact force between a moving object and a rotating finger. The model has been validated with the experimentally measured data and the computed results using finite element (FE) methods. Finally, an illustrative application of the validated model has been demonstrated in the design of a rotating hand used in the automated LBTS. As illustrated in the simulation results, the computed contact forces can be used as a basis for predicting potential bruises on the bird that may be caused by the rotating fingers. The analytical model presented in this paper provides a rational basis for optimizing the design of the grasping system and developing a controller for a high-speed transfer system. It is expected that the analysis presented here can be readily extended to other dynamic systems involving the use of flexible beams. Ph. D.
