5000|$|The term [...] "desiccant dryer" [...] {{refers to}} a broad class of dryers. Other terms {{commonly}} used are <b>regenerative</b> <b>dryer</b> and twin tower dryer, {{and to a lesser}} extent adsorption dryer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{duty of the}} {{desiccant}} is {{to bring}} the pressure dew point of the compressed air to a level in which the water will no longer condense, or to remove as much water from the compressed air as possible. A standard dew point that is expected by a <b>regenerative</b> <b>dryer</b> is −40 °C (−40 °F); this means that when the air leaves the dryer there is as much water {{in the air as}} if the air had been [...] "cooled" [...] to −40 °C (−40 °F). Required dew point is dependent on application and −70 °C is required in some applications. Many newer dryers come equipped with a dew dependent switching (DDS) which allows for the dryer to detect dew point and shorten or lengthen the drying cycle to fulfill the required dew point. Oftentimes this will save significant amounts of energy {{which is one of the}} largest factors when determining the proper compressed air system.|$|E

This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the diagnosis done by the compressed air in the yogurt plant Sigma Alimentos, at its facility in Cartago Costa Rica. The reason for its issue was given at the request of Maintenance, specifically for the manager Yogurt Plant; that raised the need to know {{the current state of the}} compressed air system and evaluate whether its capacity is required to meet the demand for compressed air, provided by the equipment installed in the yogurt plant. Diagnosis includes: lifting the plane of the net installed compressed air; check speeds, diameters and pressure drops in the pipe sections where most usurious or equipment are located; the ability of air storage tank and selection of compressors, filters and <b>regenerative</b> air <b>dryer.</b> In addition, improvements will be made to the compressed air, such as changing the type of pipe material of steel to the antileak Smartpipe or Transair and some type of pipe diameters that exceeded a loss greater load is proposed 3 % of the absolute pressure of the system.
