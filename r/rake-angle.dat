40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{sensitivity}} of frequency dispersion effects to the form of initial surface elevation of seismic tsunami source. We vary such parameters of the source as rupture depth, dip-angle and <b>rake-angle.</b> Some variations in magnitude and strike angle are considered. The fully nonlinear dispersive model on a rotating sphere is used for wave propagation simulations. The main feature of the algorithm is the splitting of initial system on two subproblems of elliptic and hyperbolic type, which allows implementation of well-suitable numerical methods for them. The dispersive effects are estimated through differences between computations with the dispersive and nondispersive models. We consider an idealized test with a constant depth, a model basin for near-field tsunami simulations and a realistic scenario. Our computations show that the dispersion effects are strongly sensitive to the rupture depth and the dip-angle variations. Waves generated by sources with lager magnitude {{may be even more}} affected by dispersion...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{scientific}} {{effort is}} being {{devoted to the}} study of nanoscale interface aspects such as thin-film adhesion, abrasive wear and nanofriction at surfaces by using the nanoscratching technique but there remain immense challenges. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3 D) model is suggested for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experimental verification of nanoscratching initiated from nano-indentation, carried out using atomic force microscope (AFM) indenters on Al-film/Si-substrate systems. Hybrid potentials such as Morse and Tersoff, and embedded atom methods (EAM) are taken into account {{together for the first time}} in this MD simulation (for three scratching conditions: e. g. orientation, depth and speed, and the relationship between forces and related parameters) in order to determine the mechanisms of nanoscratching phenomena. Salient features such as nanoscratching velocity, direction and depth- as well as indenter shape- and size-dependent functions such as scratch hardness, wear and coefficient of friction- are also examined. A remarkable conclusion is that the coefficient of friction clearly depends upon the tool <b>rake-angle</b> and therefore increases sharply for a large negative angle. 1...|$|E
30|$|We use a multi-time-window linear waveform-inversion {{procedure}} (e.g., Hartzell and Heaton, 1983) {{in which}} the moment-release distribution is discretized in both space and time. For discretization in space, we divide the fault plane into 39 in the strike direction and into 19 in the down-dip direction (making a total of 741 subfaults over an area of 12 km × 12 km). We use 8 smoothed ramp functions {{with a duration of}} 16 s separated by 8 -s intervals to represent the slip history of each subfault. The triggering front of the first-time-window propagates at a constant velocity, and the multi-time-window analysis allows a variable rupture velocity and slip duration in an inverted rupture model by weighted time windows. To suppress instability or excessive complexity, a smoothing constraint is introduced to reduce differences in moment release values close in space. The smoothing constrained parameter used in the inversion was determined to choose the solution with a total slip which agrees with that expected from the geodetic data (e.g. 24 m at off coast of Miyagi, by Sato et al., 2011). Non-negative constraints (Lawson and Hanson, 1974) to limit the <b>rake-angle</b> variation are also adopted. The rake angles are allowed to vary within 45 ° centered at 90 °. We use the first time window triggering velocity (FTWTV) as 2.5 km/s, and the rupture velocity will be discussed in Section 4.|$|E
30|$|We then {{attempt to}} model the mainshock CMT {{solution}} as {{a combination of the}} two double-couple moment tensors found for the F 1 and F 2 faults. We searched the best combination of the two moment tensors, varying the dip- and <b>rake-angles</b> and the moment ratio, keeping the strike of the F 1 and F 2 fault to be 345 ° and 60 °, respectively. That’s because the fault-strike is the best constrained parameter. A combination of two moment tensors (F 1 : strike[*]=[*] 345 °, dip[*]=[*] 50 °, rake[*]=[*] 85 °, Mw 5.3; F 2 : strike[*]=[*] 60 °, dip[*]=[*] 80 °, rake[*]=[*] 160 °, Mw 5.5) closely resembles the mainshock CMT solution (Fig.  4 b).|$|R
