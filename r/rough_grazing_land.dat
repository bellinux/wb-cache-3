50|$|Keep Ireland Open is a {{voluntary}} campaign organisation established to promote {{access to the}} Irish countryside and walkways. Founded in 1994, its current chairman is former Green Party TD, Roger Garland. The group believes Irish legislation protecting rights-of-way and access to recreational use of land is inadequate and minimal. It consists of combination of individual members and various outdoors and environmental groups; including the Irish Ramblers, An Óige, all of the Scout and Guide Associations, the United Farmers Association, Irish Wildlife Trust, Association of Irish Riding Clubs, Federation of Local History Society and numerous other walking groups. It claims that the Republic of Ireland {{has one of the}} poorest records of protecting walking routes in Europe and that it is heavily influenced by farmers' lobby groups that resist further legislation. The organisation states freedom to roam over <b>rough</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land,</b> a network of well-maintained rights-of-way in lowland areas and minimisation of barbed-wire fencing in mountain areas, as its aspirations. Keep Ireland Open has also been involved in several individual access disputes around the country, in Wicklow, Cork, Sligo, Donegal and many other areas. These include groups such as the Free the Old Head of Kinsale campaign which campaign actively for restoration of public access where it was previously enjoyed.|$|E

40|$|In the {{semi-arid}} tropics, communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> {{provide a}} livelihood {{for millions of}} people. However, it is highly threatened by overgrazing and continuous land degradation and, as a result, proper management is important to improve the livelihood of the people. This study investigated the effectiveness of exclosures established on communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> to restore soil properties and identified the relationship among soil properties, site and vegetation characteristics, and exclosure age. A space-for-time substitution approach to detect changes in soil properties following the establishment of exclosures on communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> was used. Replicated (n? 3) 5 -, 10 -, and 15 -year-old exclosures were selected and paired, each exclosure with an adjacent communal <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> All exclosures showed higher soil organic matter (OM), total soil nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) than the adjacent <b>grazing</b> <b>lands.</b> The increases in soil properties between exclosures and <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> in the 0 - to 0. 2 -m depth varied between 58 and 101 % for OM, from 54 to 108 % for N, from 26 to 128 % for P, and from 18 to 28 % for CEC over the <b>grazing</b> <b>lands.</b> Soil properties in exclosures and <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> showed significant (p< 0. 05) correlations with biomass and vegetation cover indicating that vegetation restoration {{is a key to}} restore degraded soils through exclosure establishment. Establishing exclosures on communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> can be effective in restoring the degraded soils in the semi-arid lowlands of Ethiopia. However, further studies are required on the ecological and economic benefits of future exclosures, as expansion of exclosure could cause grazing pressure on the remaining communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{livestock}} sector contributes considerably {{to global}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHG). Here, for the year 2007 we examined GHG emissions in the EU 27 livestock sector and estimated GHG emissions from production and consumption of livestock products; including imports, exports and wastage. We also reviewed available mitigation options and estimated their potential. The focus of this review is on the beef and dairy sector since these contribute 60 % of all livestock production emissions. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the role of land use and land use change (LULUC) and carbon sequestration in grasslands. GHG emissions of all livestock products amount to between 630 and 863 Mt CO 2 e, or 12 – 17 % of total EU 27 GHG emissions in 2007. The highest emissions aside from production, originate from LULUC, followed by emissions from wasted food. The total GHG mitigation potential from the livestock sector in Europe is between 101 and 377 Mt CO 2 e equivalent to between 12 and 61 % of total EU 27 livestock sector emissions in 2007. A reduction in food waste and consumption of livestock products linked with reduced production, are the most effective mitigation options, and if encouraged, would also deliver environmental and human health benefits. Production of beef and dairy on grassland, as opposed to intensive grain fed production, can be associated with a reduction in GHG emissions depending on actual LULUC emissions. This could be promoted on <b>rough</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> where appropriate...|$|E
40|$|A walkover {{survey was}} carried out from the 20 th to the 21 st of February 2014 to inspect a {{landslide}} at High Lossit, Mull of Kintyre, Scotland [NR 62655, 19980]. The subsidence and ground deformation associated with the landslide affected an area of approximately 12 000 sq m of <b>rough</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land,</b> bordering coastal cliffs, and causing minor damage to stone walls and fencing. The reported landslide occurred within the boundary of a larger, pre-existing landslide that probably occurred following deglaciation of the area during the Late Devensian. The original landslide had an estimated area of 40 000 sq m and likely occurred by rotational failure or sliding of deeply weathered basalt of the Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation, forming a mass movement deposit comprising angular blocks of bedrock in a matrix of gravelly clay within an area bound by a 5 to 30 m high back-scarp. The recently reported landslide (with an area of approximately 12 000 sq m) is classified as a dominantly translational slide within the older landslide deposit, with rotation {{at the head of}} the landslide, developing into a translational slide in the main body and toe. The landslide is developed in a north to north-west facing slope, in gently north-east dipping basalt of the Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation. The cause of the recent slope failure is likely due to a combination of driving forces including excessive water ingress after prolonged heavy rainfall, and existing slope instability due to the high slope angle and presence of large blocks of heavily weathered and altered basalt. The slope has a history of instability, reflected in the pre-existing scarp of the post-Late Devensian landslide and there is evidence for active soil movement prior to the recent slip recorded by offset of a stone wall at the foot of the recent slip. Large Post-Late Devensian landslips have been identified in numerous coastal locations around the Mull of Kintyre. The causes of these large landslips are poorly understood, but in the High Lossit area, intense weathering of basalts and local faulting in addition to over-steepening of the slope through glacial erosion may have been contributing factors to slope instability soon after deglaciation. Further assessment, including detailed geological mapping, would be required to properly understand the effect of the highly weathered and altered basalt on the ground stability and to develop the ground model. To assess for likelihood of future movement, a hydrogeological study of the site would also be required as the drainage of the affected field has been altered following the landslide...|$|E
