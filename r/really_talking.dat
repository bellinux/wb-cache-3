500|$|Mike Marqusee {{has written}} at length on the {{conflicts}} in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He {{suggests that the}} song is probably self-referential: [...] "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that [...] "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' and talking about other people, I was <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about nobody but me." ...|$|E
500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, as we see with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic {{song about}} growing old" [...] {{according}} to singer Gruff Rhys. In {{an interview with}} British newspaper The Daily Telegraph Rhys discussed the song {{in the context of}} parent record Rings Around the World. The band abandoned the idea of making a [...] "save the world" [...] concept album as they reasoned that [...] "when people talk about saving the world they're <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about saving humans. The reality is that humans are the problem". [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] expands on this idea with Rhys stating that the song is about the extinction of the human race: [...] "maybe we'll all die but the world'll still be here, even if it's a dark, singed piece of rock flying around the sun". The track was recorded in 2000 at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E

500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E

2500|$|It's {{impossible}} {{to translate the}} issue of the greed of Wall Street into one demand, or two demands. We're talking about a democratic awakening...you're talking about raising political consciousness so it spills over all parts of the country, so people can begin to see what's going on through a set of different lens, and then you begin to highlight what the more detailed demands would be. Because in the end we're <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about what Martin King would call a revolution: A transfer of power from oligarchs to everyday people of all colors. And that is a step by step process.|$|E
2500|$|Child was a {{favorite}} of audiences {{from the moment of}} her television debut on public television in 1963, and she was a familiar part of American culture and the subject of numerous references, including numerous parodies in television and radio programs and skits. Her great success on air may have been tied to her refreshingly pragmatic approach to the genre, [...] "I think you have to decide who your audience is. If you don’t pick your audience, you’re lost because you’re not <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> to anybody. My audience is people who like to cook, who want to really learn how to do it." ...|$|E

Keys told MTV News Canada that the song [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> {{about the way}} that in relationships, the way that so many things are around {{you all the time}} to try to distract you. And even though people may talk and say whatever they may want to say, but then no one can {{get in the way of}} this." [...] Keys said that it was a song that [...] "just wrote itself". It was one of the last songs written for the album.|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you. Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> to the ladies. The song is really special to me, and I love that song." [...] The collaboration began when Bow Wow was talking with producer Jermaine Dupri about the song and how he suggested on getting Omarion to appear on the track.|$|E
2500|$|Verna is the matriarch of the Sawyer family. According to Taylor, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to Leatherface was <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> {{with the}} directors. When {{they told me}} they wanted to do something that was a cross between Terrence Malick, like Badlands, and The Virgin Suicides, I thought 'I'm there' because what I love is this stuff that's happening with people pushing a genre as far as they could push it and it's exciting to me." [...] Taylor chose to concentrate more on Verna's maternal instincts for her family than her murderous ways, with the character having a denial or compartmentalization about her motherhood and the murder. The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 2006 Mbeki {{said in an}} {{interview}} with SABC television that Zimbabwe had missed a chance to resolve its political crisis in 2004 when secret talks to agree on a new constitution ended in failure. He claimed that he saw a copy of a new constitution signed by all parties. The job of promoting dialogue between the ruling party and the opposition was likely made more difficult by divisions within the MDC, splits to which the president alluded when he stated that the MDC were [...] "sorting themselves out." [...] In turn, the MDC unanimously rejected this assertion. (MDC-Mutambara Faction's) secretary general Welshman Ncube said [...] "We never gave Mbeki a draft constitution – unless it was ZANU PF which did that.

2500|$|Selig's {{testimony}} {{on the subject}} has been contradictory. [...] In 2005, Selig told reporters, [...] "I never even heard about them [...] until 1998 or 1999. [...] I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. [...] It wasn't until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion." [...] But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: [...] "In 1994, before anybody was <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. [...] As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game." [...] During the 1988 ALCS, Oakland's Jose Canseco had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of [...] "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids." [...] Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, [...] "People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again." ...|$|E
