50|$|The {{relationship}} between BDSM {{and the law}} changes significantly from nation to nation. It is entirely dependent on the legal situation in individual countries whether the practice of BDSM has any criminal relevance or legal consequences. Criminalization of consensually implemented BDSM practices is usually not with explicit reference to BDSM, but results {{from the fact that}} such behavior as spanking or cuffing someone could be considered a breach <b>of</b> personal <b>rights,</b> which in principle constitutes a criminal offense. In Germany, Netherlands, Japan and Scandinavia, such behavior is legal in principle. In Austria the legal status is not clear, while in Switzerland some BDSM practices can be considered criminal. Spectacular incidents like the US scandal of People v. Jovanovic and the British Operation Spanner demonstrate the degree to which difficult grey areas can pose a problem for the individuals and authorities involved.

The Act gives to children 12 years and older a host <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> relating to reproductive health, including access to contraceptives and to information on sexuality and reproduction, and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> to HIV/AIDS testing and treatment [1]. These rights reflect growing concern over the need to prevent HIV in the country’s youth. South Africa has {{the highest number of}} persons living with HIV in the world [3]. Persons aged 15 – 24 account for 34 % of all new HIV infections and have an HIV prevalence of 10. 3 % [4, 5]. A critical challenge for HIV prevention efforts in adolescents is to ensure that these newly guaranteed reproductive health rights are realized. For youths in South Africa, access to condoms is limited. Barriers to access include substantial travel time and cost of travel to sites of condom distribution [6], the fact that government clinics distributing free condoms are usually closed when students are out of school, the judgmental and often hostile attitude of providers, and the cost of condoms in shops [7]. One way to increase condom access for adolescents is to make condoms available in schools. This is a socially divisive approach. Some believe availability of contraception will encourage sexual activity [8]. Others cite the early age of sexual debut [9, 10] and the futility of HIV prevention education that emphasizes condom use without providing sexually active youth with access to condoms [11]. Reflecting these tensions, South African government policy is unclear, The Policy Forum allows health policy makers around the world to discuss challenges and opportunities for improving health care in their societies...|$|R

As the legal arena is currently revising laws concerning <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>consent</b> among the mentally retarded, it is essential that determinations of mental competency follow national standards in order to delineate clearly any instance of sexual abuse.

The paper contributes to the existing literature by focusing not on clients' views but, rather, by elucidating how different cadres of health workers view and practice the human <b>rights</b> principles <b>of</b> informed <b>consent</b> and opting out, that are reflected in Uganda's HIV testing policies. By investigating the roles and responsibilities of community counsellors, post-test counsellors, and midwives, we illustrate how the practice of counselling in PMTCT is influenced by two hegemonic discourses: the health of a child should be protected, and the health worker knows best. As a result, a directive form of counselling in PMTCT settings, with its focus on the health of the baby, silences women's right to opt out of HIV tests...|$|R

The scope of information is generally regulated. However, the physician is obliged to estimate each patient's need {{and the ability to}} receive information. Treatment can have desired results only with patients' compliance. Apart from being patient <b>right,</b> giving <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> to medical treatment is also his/her legal duty, the fulfillment of which is expected prior to beginning of treatment.

It cannot be the subject of claim, nor can it be coercively enforced. For this reason, consent to medical treatment, {{as well as the other}} subsidiary duties of patients, is named duty of the patient in his own interest.

40|$|This thesis chiefly {{discusses}} {{ethical and}} legal issues connected with a lawful, ethical medical measure under the Statute for Palliative Care and the current legal system - "terminal palliative sedation," and analyzes ethical and legal questions associated with medical decisions concerning {{the final stage of}} life and terminal palliative sedation. The chief focus of the paper is on the "rule of double effect. " The thesis begins with a longitudinal historical discussion of the development of end-of-life medicine and issues causing dispute. The next section contains a horizontal comparison of legal systems and a legal analysis of end-of-life medical decisions; this discussion proceeds from the level of the American constitution, entry to the legal level, and finally grafting {{to the level of the}} relationship between doctor and patient (contract). Particular attention is paid to doctors'' duties of interpretations and patients'' <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent,</b> and exceptions involving special situations. Furthermore, the paper further investigates the constitution theory of the dignity of the human person enshrined in the Continental legal system (primarily the German system), followed by a retrospective of and look forward to efforts to realize this theory in Taiwan''s end-of-life medical practice, including repeated pondering over the country''s "safeguarding the right to life" versus the patient''s "relinquishment of protection <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to life," and the concept of "medical paternalism" versus the "patient''s autonomy. " The focus of ethical analysis in the paper is on whether "palliative sedation" complies with the ethical "rule of double effect". After surveying the historical origins, element analysis, and supporting and opposing views concerning this principle, the thesis briefly discusses the author''s views. In summary, the thesis attempts to demonstrate that terminal palliative sedation is consistent with medical principles and is ethically and legitimate. It is hoped that the discussion in this thesis will give doctors a correct perception of palliative sedation, and will support and provide terminal patients with more options, so that patients, with their doctors'' professional assistance, can make the best end-of-life decisions. 本論文主要討論在安寧緩和醫療條例及現行法制中，一項合法、合乎倫理的醫療措施—「終末鎮靜」的倫理與法律議題。並將與「終末鎮靜」相關的生命末期醫療決定之倫理與法律問題做分析，而主要聚焦於「雙重效果原則」。首先從歷史縱剖面，談生命末期醫療的歷史發展與爭議產生因素。次就橫向即比較法制，論生命末期醫療決定的法律分析，分別從美國憲法層次，入於法律層次，最後植根於醫病關係（契約）位階，尤其是據此而生之醫師說明義務與病患同意權及特殊情況下之例外。另併從大陸法制（以德國為主）之人性尊嚴憲法理論加以探討，末則回歸並期待能落實於我國終末醫療實務面向，反覆於國家對「生命權的保障」與病人對「生命權保障的放棄」及「醫主」思維與「病人自主權」間來回思辯。倫理分析之重點則置於用來檢驗「終末鎮靜」是否符合倫理之「雙重效果原則」。從其歷史起源、要件分析，乃至贊成與反對此一原則意見之爭點整理，並略述本文之看法。總之，本論文嘗試論證終末鎮靜是合乎醫學學理與倫理的醫療正當且合法之行為。並希望藉由本文之討論促使醫師對於「終末鎮靜」醫療有更為正確之認知，能支持並提供終末病人更多選項，讓病人在醫師專業協助下，為自己做出最佳的生命末期抉擇。封面 [...] 1 書名頁（中文） [...] 2 書名頁（英文） [...] 3 審核頁 [...] 4 授權頁 [...] 5 誌謝辭 [...] 6 中文摘要 [...] 7 英文摘要 [...] 8 簡目 [...] i 詳目 [...] iii 第一章 序論 [...] . 1 第一節 研究動機與目的 [...] . 1 第二節 研究方法 [...] . 5 第三節 研究範圍與限制 [...] . 7 第四節 本文架構 [...] . 9 第二章 終末醫療的基本概念與爭議 [...] 11 第一節 基本概念 [...] 11 第二節 歷史沿革與發展 [...] 23 第三節 重視終末醫療自決權的目的及利益 [...] 34 第三章 終末醫療法律分析 [...] 37 第一節 憲法上基礎 [...] 39 第二節 法律上基礎 [...] 54 第三節 權利衝突的衡平與協調 [...] 72 第四章 從雙重效果原則論終末鎮靜之倫理分析 [...] 83 第一節 概論 [...] 85 第二節 歷史起源 [...] 85 第三節 倫理原則分析 [...] 87 第四節 案例運用 [...] . 103 第五章 結論 [...] . 117 參考文獻 [...] 121 附錄 [...] 128 索引 [...] 14...|$|R
