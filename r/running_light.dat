25|$|METRO began <b>running</b> <b>light</b> rail service (METRORail) on January 1, 2004. Currently {{the track}} runs {{approximately}} 13 miles (20.8km) from Downtown Houston to the Texas Medical Center and Reliant Park Southbound {{and to the}} Northline Mall Northbound. METRO operates an extensive park-and-ride bus system to serve many of Houston's outlying suburban areas. Most of the park-and-ride buses run in barrier-separated high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lanes that provide direct service from park-and-ride parking lots to major employment destinations. Prior {{to the opening of}} METRORail, Houston was the largest city in the United States without a rail transit system.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} Class 24 to be {{withdrawn}} was in November 1967 when a fire broke out on D5051 while it was working a train of empty coal wagons in Scotland. The damage was too severe {{for it to be}} repaired, and it was cut up at Inverurie in August 1968. It had lasted exactly 8 years. The second Class 24 {{to be withdrawn}} was also as the result of an accident in Scotland, this time at Castlecary. In this case D5122, <b>running</b> <b>light</b> engine, hit a stationary DMU at about , the impact and subsequent fire bending the main frames and completely destroying the No.2 end. The accident happened on 9 September 1968 but despite being withdrawn the same month, the locomotive was not finally cut up until March 1971. A total of 14 Class 24s were withdrawn and scrapped without receiving their TOPS number.|$|E
500|$|Monitor {{was soon}} in trouble {{as the storm}} {{increased}} in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts. Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon Monitor {{was hit by a}} squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white <b>running</b> <b>light</b> atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers, Acting Master Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking, and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that {{as soon as they were}} on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the [...] towline with a hatchet. At 11:30p.m. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump; but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water. After all steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a bucket brigade, but to no avail.|$|E
40|$|Daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> {{increase}} visual {{contrast between}} vehicles and their background, improving their noticeability and detectability. Seven countries require motor vehicles to have lights on during all daytime periods [...] Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Studies from {{these and other}} countries have generally indicated that daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> use is associated with small to moderate reductions in multiple-vehicle daytime crashes, especially those involving vehicles approaching from the front or side. There is evidence also that initial positive effects of daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> do not dissipate over time, that is, there is little support for novelty or habituation effects. The bulk of {{the evidence suggests that}} <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> do not lead to increases in collisions involving pedestrians and pedalcyclists, allaying concerns that there would be negative consequences of making these road users relatively less conspicuous. Most of the studies have been conducted in countries located at latitudes that are to the north of most of the continental United States and that have longer twilight periods and generally lower ambient illumination. The concern has been expressed that <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> may lose their effectiveness in countries located at lower latitudes, such as the United States, because the lights will provide less of a contrast. General Motors Corporation and some other manufacturers are now providing <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> on new models with higher intensities than are used in Scandinavian countries. Findings in <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> studies suggest that their effect in the United States will be positive, and their introduction provides an opportunity to determine the effect. The costs of <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> are low, so even modest crash reductions would be cost effective...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 April 2009, Baffin Strait was {{involved}} with a collision with the car carrier Jasmine Ace while both vessels were anchored in Singapore. [...] A severe squall moved into the area while Jasmine Ace was taking fuel. [...] The squall caused the ship to drag its anchor. [...] The car carrier drifted downwind, causing its starboard quarter to strike Baffin Strait starboard side. [...] As a result, Baffin Strait anchor also began to drag, and the crew dropped a second anchor to hold the ship. [...] The two ships were [...] "married for several minutes", during which time the Jasmine Ace started her engine. [...] The Baffin Strait damage included [...] "disfigured" [...] steel on the starboard bulwark and damage to the starboard <b>running</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A [...] {{section of}} rail track was damaged near Kaiapoi {{and there was}} lesser track damage at Rolleston and near Belfast. As a precaution, state rail {{operator}} KiwiRail shut down the entire South Island rail network after the earthquake, halting some 15 trains. Two locomotives <b>running</b> <b>light</b> (i.e. without any carriages or wagons) {{came to a stop}} just 30metres short of a major buckle in the line. After inspection, services south of Dunedin and north of Kaikoura recommenced at 10:30am that day. The Main South Line, linking Christchurch with Dunedin, was given the all-clear and reopened, albeit with a 40km/h speed restriction north of Ashburton, just after 6:00pm to allow emergency aid, including [...] of drinking water, to be railed into Christchurch. By the afternoon of Monday 6 September, the entire South Island rail network had reopened {{with the exception of the}} Main North Line between Rangiora and Addington. Freight was shuttled by road between the two points, while the TranzCoastal was replaced with a coach service.|$|E

2500|$|METRO began <b>running</b> <b>light</b> rail service (METRORail) on January 1, 2004. Currently, {{the track}} is rather short â€” about 22.7 miles (20.6km) from Northline Transit Center Station through {{downtown}} Houston to the Texas Medical Center and Reliant Park, and lines from downtown to the East End and the University of Houston/Lower 3rd Ward. Still, {{the system is}} traveled by about 61,000 people daily, giving it the second-highest ridership per track mile in the nation. [...] The Uptown Light Rail Line has been converted to a BRT Line and began construction in the late 2nd quarter of 2016. The BRT Line will run between the former NW Mall (which {{is in the process}} of redevelopment) and the WestPark TC. METRO's various forms of public transportation still do not connect multiple suburbs to the inner city (defined by the 610 loop), causing Houstonians to rely on the automobile as a primary source of transportation. [...] The problem is one due the lack of a central metropolitan area transportation authority, primarily due to a few suburban counties refusing to cooperate with METRO. [...] For example, there are multiple coach bus services that run into downtown Houston. METRO is in the late planning stages of the US 90 Commuter line which will service the Ft Bend County and SW Harris County suburban region. Prior to the opening of METRORail, Houston was the largest large major city in the United States without a rail transit system.|$|E
2500|$|On December 31, 1862, a storm hit seas off Cape Hatteras, and Monitor, {{under tow}} by Rhode Island.

Then a stiff slope, tree-clad, and long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent green area of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a clump of lacerating brambles, with beast tracks through it. Behind them the chase trailed out and scattered, with Uya ever at their heels.
