50|$|Raphidopalpa foveicollis, the <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Chrysomelidae. It is a foliar pest {{of members of the}} Cucurbitaceae, {{particularly}} the pumpkin.|$|E
50|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.The <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> (Raphidopalpa foveicollis) is a serious pest of cucurbits, especially the pumpkin, which it can defoliate.Cucurbits are susceptible to diseases such as bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.), fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E

50|$|Adult <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetles</b> feed on {{the foliage}} and flowers of the host plants; {{seedlings}} may be destroyed by heavy attacks and young plants may be severely affected. Several beetles may cluster on a single leaf, leaving other leaves untouched. The beetles feed between the veins, often cutting and removing circular discs which they then eat. The larvae tunnel into the roots, which become swollen, discoloured and distorted, and the plant may die.|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study the eco-biology and management of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> (Aulacophora foveicollis Lucas) on Indian snap melon during 2011 and 2012 in different areas of Punjab. Ten landraces of Indian snap melons were screened out {{on the basis of}} population and damage infestation of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> Aulacophora foveicollis during cropping season 2011. Maximum population (8. 06) and infestation (15. 46 %) was recorded in landrace SHW. However minimum population (5. 56) and infestation (10. 63 %) was recorded in landrace BHW. In another experiment synthetic insecticides (carbaryl, imidacloprid, bifenthrin) were also evaluated. Carbaryl dust was most effective minimum population (3. 63) and infestation (7. 56 %) was recorded in this treatment, however, maximum population (3. 91) and infestation (8. 85) was recorded in in plot treated with Imidacloprid. In Botanical screening, minimum population and infestation was recorded in plot treated with Neem seed kernel extract 4. 31, 9. 1, respectively. In mechanical control screening minimum population (5. 82) and infestation (13. 06) recorded in plots treated using Yellow Sticky Traps. Host plant susceptibility indices was also calculated maximum susceptibility was recorded in landrace SHW (12 %) and minimum in BHW (8 %). Data of different physical and biochemical characters of various landraces of Indian snap melon were observed. Effect of these physical and biochemical plant characters was evaluated in relation to population and infestation caused by <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> Physical plant characters like Leaf Area and Leaf Sheath Thickness were calculated varying significantly among different landraces while Moisture contents (%) and Hair Density were non-significant when compared. Bio-chemical plant characters including Nitrogen (%), Phosphorous (%), Potassium (%), Carbohydrate (%), Iron (%), Cu (%), Zinc (%) were recorded significant while factors like Fat (%), Mg (%) and Total Minerals (%) were non-significant among different landraces. Impact of Leaf Area (cm 2), Leaf Sheath Thickness (Âµm), Moisture Contents (%), Nitrogen (%), Carbohydrate (%), Cu (%), Zinc (%) was recorded positive to population and infestation of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> However, the impact of Phosphorous (%) and Potassium (%) contents had a negative impact on the population infestation of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> Effect of weather factors (temperature and rainfall) on the population dynamics of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was also worked out. Effect of temperature on the population was calculated positive while the impact of temperature on the infestation cannot be calculated because it depends on crop stage and leaf density. Whereas, the effect of rainfall on the population of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was calculated negative. Maximum population (13. 16) of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was observed during 1 st week of May afterward it goes on declining and maximum infestation (20. 36 %) was recorded on 1 st date of observation as minimum density of leaves was present at that time. Mean population and infestation caused by <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> against different treatments was recorded. Minimum population and infestation was recorded in treatment no. 7 (carbaryl + neem + yellow sticky traps) in all districts.

The present study was conducted to find out the host suitability of <b>red</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> Aulacophora foveicollis (Lucas) among different cucurbit hosts in the Laboratory and Field Laboratory of the Department of Entomology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh. This study was investigated with a view to explore a resistant host to this pest. The experiment was laid out in the completely randomized design (CRD) and Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) in laboratory and field respectively with five replications. Three cucurbit hosts such as sweet gourd (Var. BARI Sweet gourd 1), bitter gourd (Var. Hybrid Nepali) and bottle gourd (Var. Kajla) were selected to conduct this research work. Host suitability was determined depending on the average number of beetles present per plant in field. But in the laboratory host suitability was measured following force feeding and choice feeding bioassays. In the field at three different stages of the plant the highest number of beetle per plant was observed on the sweet gourd and the lowest number was found on bitter gourd. Similarly both in force feeding and choice feeding bioassays the highest leaf feeding was observed on sweet gourd and the lowest leaf feeding was determined on the bitter gourd.

The crude protein content for the analysed botanical mixtures ranged between 9. 07 - 18. 18 % DM, and crude fiber between 10. 41 - 30. 83 % DM. The amino acid profile of the mixture AFC 4 revealed a content of limiting essential amino acids required for laying hens: lysine 5. 719 % CP, methionine 1. 058 % CP and threonine 4. 415 % CP. The highest content of lutein and zeaxanthin was found in the mixture AFC 4 (66. 659 mg/ 100 g), which also had the highest amount of vitamin E (640. 93 mg/kg).
