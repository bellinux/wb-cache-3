40|$|Knaysi, Georges (Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.). Further {{observations}} on the spodogram of Bacillus cereus endospore. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 453 – 455. 1965. —Endospore spodograms of Bacillus cereus C 3 were examined in dark contrast by use of the phase microscope with oil-immersion objectives. When the spodograms were mounted in air, their central part, or core, appeared bright; when mounted in water or oil, the central part appeared dark. The {{central part of the}} normal, unincinerated spore appeared bright in air and water, but dark in oil. This indicated that whether a body appears bright or dark when observed with the phase microscope does not depend only on its <b>refringence</b> relative to that of its surround, but also on its thickness and on the magnitude of the difference between its refractive index and that of its surround. Present observations showed that, contrary to a previous conclusion, mineral matter is more highly concentrated in the core than at the periphery of the endospore...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Regeneration therapy using adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (ADSC) has been {{proposed}} {{in the treatment of}} skin aging. Myofibroblast plays a relevant role in the organization of the extracellular matrix of the damaged skin. A natural extract was derived from the eggs of the mollusk Cryptomphalus aspersa (e-CAF) that seems to play a role on skin repair. We have investigated the potential effects of e-CAF in the differentiation of ADSC. Materials and methods. ADSC were cultured in the absence or presence of e-CAF (50 and 200 [*]μg/mL) for 24 hours and 7 days. Real-time cell assay, morphological, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR techniques were used to evaluate the cell culture and expression of αSMA, collagen I, and tropoelastin. Results. e-CAF induced significant reduction in the rate of growth of ADSC from 24 hours to 7 days of culture. e-CAF also induced bigger sizes, higher levels of cytoplasmic <b>refringence</b> and complexity, and a more polyhedral morphological changes in the cultured ADSC. The protein and mRNA expression of αSMA was significantly increased in e-CAF-cultured ADSC. Conclusion. e-CAF promotes ADSC differentiation to myofibroblasts and should be considered as a potential agent for the prevention and treatment of skin aging...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study and}} compare the {{appearance}} of hairs from patients with Chédiak-Higashi and Griscelli-Prunieras syndromes under light and polarized light microscopy. METHOD: Hairs from 2 Chédiak-Higashi and 2 Griscelli-Prunieras patients were obtained and examined under normal and polarized light microscopy. RESULTS: Under light microscopy, hairs from Chédiak-Higashi patients presented evenly distributed, regular melanin granules, larger than those seen in normal hairs. Under polarized light microscopy, shafts exhibited a bright and polychromatic <b>refringence</b> appearance. In contrast, hair from Griscelli-Prunieras patients, under light microscopy, exhibited bigger and irregular melanin granules, distributed mainly near the medulla. Under polarized light microscopy, shafts appeared monotonously white. CONCLUSION: Light microscopic examination of hair shafts of patients with Chédiak-Higashi or Griscelli-Prunieras syndrome reveals subtle differences that are useful in identifying both disorders, but not in distinguishing between them. We provide evidence that polarized light microscopy of hair shafts, an approach {{that has not been}} previously described, aids in differentiating between these syndromes. We propose hair study by polarized light microscopy as a helpful complementary diagnostic method for differential diagnosis between CHS and GPS, especially when the more sophisticated molecular studies are not available...|$|E
40|$|We have {{conducted}} a systematic {{study on the}} effects of post rubbing annealing on the relaxation of rubbing-induced birefringence of polystyrene. It is found that annealing at T-o only affects the relaxation up to T-o + T-Lag, where T-Lag is proportional to the logarithm of the annealing time t(A). A theoretical model based on the distribution of relaxation times due to the individual <b>refringence</b> elements is proposed. To remove its contribution to the net birefringence each element must overcome an energy barrier E = (317 + 1. 17 xi) X 10 (3) J/mol, and therefore must have a characteristic relaxation time tau which depends on temperature T and a barrier height which ranges from 340. 4 kJ/mol to 445. 7 kJ/mol. The relaxation of birefringence is expressed by the equation NB(T,t) = integral(o) (infinity) N(xi) e(-t/tau(T,xi)) d xi, in which both the relaxation time tau(T,xi) and the distribution function N(xi) can be extracted from experimental data. The predictions of the model agree well with all the experimental results presented in this work. The differences and similarities of the relaxation of birefringence with respect to the physical aging of quenched PS are discussed. In particular, similarities in terms of the general temperature lag phenomena are noted...|$|E
