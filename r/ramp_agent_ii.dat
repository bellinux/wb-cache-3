FedEx had over 100 employees—customer service representatives, <b>ramp</b> <b>agents,</b> couriers, semi-drivers and jet aircraft and vehicle maintenance workers. <b>Ramp</b> <b>agents</b> worked evening or early morning shifts, loading and unloading the aircraft, feeder planes and trucks.

50|$|<b>Ramp</b> <b>agents</b> {{work in a}} {{hazardous}} environment, and receive annual training on safety and proper ways {{to work in an}} airport environment. Training is often provided by the particular company or airline, and usually involves mandatory training by the Federal Aviation Administration and the specific airport management. Hearing tests are usually required upon employment, since working near aircraft engines can strain the eardrums, and have long-term effects. Some <b>ramp</b> <b>agents</b> eventually have back problems from working in enclosed spaces inside an aircraft's cargo compartment, or loading cargo incorrectly.|$|R
50|$|Four {{young men}} passing {{by on the}} highway {{discovered}} the wreckage of Flight 317 at around 7:15 p.m., approximately 10 minutes after the crash, but the crash was not noticed within the airport for several minutes afterward. After the air traffic controller sent his last transmission to the flight, he attended to other duties. Some time later, after an Air East <b>ramp</b> <b>agent</b> asked if the controller had been communicating with the flight, the controller tried without success to reestablish communications with the flight. The Air East <b>ramp</b> <b>agent</b> then got {{into his car and}} began a search of the airfield. As he drove along the runway, he encountered a young man, one of the four passers-by who'd found the wreckage, who informed him that a plane had crashed {{near the end of the}} runway. The <b>ramp</b> <b>agent</b> drove back to the terminal and informed the controller, who notified the police department. The first rescue vehicle arrived on the scene at around 7:55 p.m.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to [...] "pushing" [...] an aircraft from the terminal gate (with a [...] "push back" [...] or [...] "tow motor") to position it for engine start and eventual taxi, baggage handlers also may tow aircraft {{to and from}} another gate or to a [...] "remote" [...] or RON ("remain over night") parking area. There will be a mechanic in the flight deck 'riding the brakes', who communicates with ATC ground control (for movement clearance), and operates the APU ("auxiliary power unit"), brakes, lights; the agent will operate the tow-tractor. This applies only to the [...] "Non-Movement Area" [...] of the airport, {{the part of the}} airport <b>ramp</b> where <b>ramp</b> <b>agents</b> can operate. <b>Ramp</b> <b>agents</b> cannot operate within the Movement Area, reserved for aircraft and emergency equipment, which is controlled by the Air Traffic Control Tower. In some union-negotiated airlines or stations this job could also be done by the baggage handler.|$|R
5000|$|The {{people working}} on the ramp, {{typically}} seen loading bags, {{are referred to as}} [...] "ramp agents". Inter alia, they must ensure that arriving aircraft are unloaded promptly. The <b>ramp</b> <b>agents</b> will also load departing aircraft. They must sometimes account for the baggage loaded into each compartment to ensure proper weight and balance, although this job is often the responsibility of flight operations staff.|$|R

Six other carriers competed against Mesa: Air Midwest, Sun West Airlines, Pioneer Airlines, Trans-Colorado Airlines, Airways of New Mexico, and JetAire. As fare wars erupted between the carriers, Mesa was able to survive due to its low cost structure. It performed maintenance in house, many of Mesa's employees performed multiple duties: pilots and mechanics doubled as gate <b>agents</b> and <b>ramp</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Airline {{ground crew}} members include: {{airframe}} and powerplant technicians, avionics technicians, <b>ramp</b> <b>agents,</b> customer service agents, and flight dispatchers. Ground crew members {{are responsible for}} clearing the runway and gate area of any debris or garbage, {{in order to prevent}} foreign object damage by an object being sucked into an engine. The crew visually inspects the tarmac and removes any items found; this is typically called a [...] "FOD walk" [...] and is done prior to an aircraft's arrival and departure.|$|R

The unmarked {{cardboard}} boxes, {{stored for}} weeks on a parts rack, were {{taken over to}} SabreTech's shipping and receiving department and left {{on the floor in}} an area assigned to ValuJet property.Step 3. Continental Airlines, a potential SabreTech customer, was planning an inspection of the facility, so a SabreTech shipping clerk was instructed to clean up the work place. He decided to send the oxygen generators to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta and labelled the boxes [...] "aircraft parts". He had shipped ValuJet material to Atlanta before without formal approval. Furthermore, he misunderstood the green tags to indicate [...] "unserviceable" [...] or [...] "out of service" [...] and jumped {{to the conclusion that the}} generators were empty.Step 4. The shipping clerk made up a load for the forward cargo hold of the five boxes plus two large main tires and a smaller nose tire. He instructed a co-worker to prepare a shipping ticket stating [...] "oxygen canisters - empty". The co-worker wrote, [...] "Oxy Canisters" [...] followed by [...] "Empty" [...] in quotation marks. The tires were also listed.Step 5. A day or two later the boxes were delivered to the ValuJet <b>ramp</b> <b>agent</b> for acceptance on Flight 592. The shipping ticket listing tires and oxygen canisters should have caught his attention but didn't. The canisters were then loaded against federal regulations, as ValuJet was not registered to transport hazardous materials. It is possible that, in the <b>ramp</b> <b>agent's</b> mind, the possibility of SabreTech workers sending him hazardous cargo was inconceivable ...|$|R
