5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent <b>review</b> <b>article</b> found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>review</b> <b>article,</b> J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E

5|$|On January 5, 1993, , a bill {{to reduce}} the salary of the Treasury Secretary from $148,400 to $99,500 (the pre-1989 level), passed by a voice vote in the Senate and by the House on January 6. On January 19, President George H.W. Bush signed a bill {{enacting}} a temporary Saxbe fix so that Senator Lloyd Bentsen could move from the Senate {{to take the job}} of Treasury Secretary during the newly elected Clinton administration. S.J. RES. 1 (1993), which canceled emolument increases for the remainder of Bentsen's term, a term set to expire at noon on January 3, 1995, had been passed by both Houses without objection. However, in a law <b>review</b> <b>article,</b> University of Minnesota Law School Professor Michael Stokes Paulson rejected the Bentsen fix as unconstitutional. In 1994, President Bill Clinton received approval to use a Saxbe fix to appoint United States Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell to the Supreme Court, but Mitchell withdrew his name from consideration for reasons unrelated to his eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Preventing Aβ {{aggregation}} is {{a promising}} method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature <b>review</b> <b>article.</b> In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used {{the results of this study}} to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specimens}} {{referred to}} Heterodontosaurus include the front {{part of a}} juvenile skull (SAM-PK-K10487), a fragmentary maxilla (SAM-PK-K1326), a left maxilla with teeth and adjacent bones (SAM-PK-K1334), {{all of which were}} collected at the Voyizane locality during expeditions in 1966-1967, although the first was only identified as belonging to this genus in 2008. A partial snout (NM QR 1788) found in 1975 on Tushielaw Farm south of Voyizane was thought to belong to Massospondylus until 2011, when it was reclassified as Heterodontosaurus. South African palaeontologist Robert Broom discovered a partial skull, possibly in the Clarens Formation of South Africa, which was sold to the American Museum of Natural History in 1913, as part of a collection that consisted almost entirely of synapsid fossils. This specimen (AMNH 24000) was first identified as belonging to a sub-adult Heterodontosaurus by Sereno, who reported it in a 2012 monograph about the Heterodontosauridae, the first comprehensive <b>review</b> <b>article</b> about the family. This review also classified a partial postcranial skeleton (SAM-PK-K1328) from Voyizane as Heterodontosaurus. However, in 2014, Galton suggested it might belong the related genus Pegomastax instead, which was named by Sereno based on a partial skull from the same locality. In 2005, a new Heterodontosaurus specimen was found in a streambed near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape Province; it was the most complete individual known to date, but the rocks around it were too hard to fully remove. The specimen was therefore scanned at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2016, to help reveal the skeleton, and aid in future research of its anatomy and lifestyle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Review</b> <b>articles</b> are a {{means of}} {{summarizing}} the potentially vast volume of research on a topic.

Overall, the methodological quality of the <b>review</b> <b>articles</b> was poor, {{with none of the}} reviews providing information on the method of locating primary research studies or the inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting primary studies. None of the reviews included a critical appraisal of the methodological quality of the primary studies. Less than half of the reviews stated a focused research question, explored possible reasons for differences in the results of primary studies, discussed the generalizability of results, or proposed directions for future research. There is a need to improve the methodological quality of <b>review</b> <b>articles</b> on microbial food safety interventions {{if they are to be}} of use in policy and decision making...|$|R
