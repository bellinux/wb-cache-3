5000|$|Many {{instances}} of forgetting are often accounted to the interference from heightened accessibility of other, associated information in memory. Researchers have described how interference may explain RIF {{in a number}} of ways. For instance the theory of blocking suggests that because practiced words are more easily remembered at test, they may occupy a [...] "response channel" [...] in memory and effectively prevent unpracticed-related words in memory from being remembered. Unpracticed-unrelated words would be less affected by this blocking effect because retrieval of practiced words would not block items from different categories. [...] Other theories such as resource diffusion and <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> are similar to blocking. These theories describe retrieval processes as a finite set of resources that cannot be distributed adequately enough to unpracticed-related items at test.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between long-term decrements of the acoustic startle response in rats {{and the development}} of freezing behavior during habituation training was examined. Freezing behavior developed over the initial trials of habituation training, and the rate of long-term <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> was found to be inversely related to the development of freezing. Manipulations (neurological or behavioral) that either educed the level of freezing or retarded its development promoted startle <b>response</b> <b>decrements.</b> In Experiment 1, rats receiving dectrolytic lesions of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray demonstrated both accelerated long-term startle <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> and retarded evelopment offreezing behavior. In Experiment 2, preexposure tothe startle apparatus (i. e., latent inhibition) accelerated long-term startle decrements and inhibited development of freezing. In Experiment 3, exposure to the startle apparatus following initial habituation training (i. e., extinction) reduced both freezing behavior and startle response ampli-tudes. The results are discussed in terms of the influence of Pavlovian fear conditioning on long-term habituation of the acoustic startle response. Pavlovian fear conditioning has long been known to influ-ence the amplitude of the acoustic startle response in rats...|$|R

However, a direct relationship between performance and right hemisphere activity has not been established. Here, we show that patients with left frontal lesions and partially recovered aphasia learn, at a normal rate, a novel word retrieval task that requires the damaged cortex. Verbal learning is accompanied by specific <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> in right frontal and right occipital cortex, strongly supporting the compensatory role of the right hemisphere. Furthermore, responses in left occipital cortex are abnormal and not modulated by practice. These findings indicate that frontal cortex is a source of top-down signals during learning...|$|R

While the schedules operated for separate response keys, they were not available concurrently. During one condition, each response was punished with electric shock. During the other condition, shocks were delivered independently of responding. The punishment suppressed responding but the free shocks did not. However, when allowed to choose, the pigeons preferred the condition associated with the lowest rate of shock {{regardless of whether or}} not the shock was dependent on responding. In general, shocks exerted their greatest effect on whichever response had the greatest influence on shocks. In this respect, punishment is instrumental in suppressing behavior and the properties of punishment are symmetrical to those of reinforcement. This empirical symmetry dictates a corresponding conceptual symmetry in terms of a positive law of effect accounting for response increments and a negative law accounting for <b>response</b> <b>decrements...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{decrement}} in {{the probability}} of eliciting a response is observed {{during the course of}} repetitive stimulation in many response systems of both metazoa and protozoa. Those forms of metazoan <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> called habituation have recently been characterized behaviorally. In the studies reported here, the <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> of the contractile protozoan, Stentor coeruleus, to repeated mechanical stimulation was systemically characterized to provide a comparison with metazoan habituation. This change in response probability was closely approximated by a negative exponential function after the first few stimuli. Animals responded to parametric variations of stimulus amplitude, interstimulus interval and retention period in a manner paralleling that observed in metazoa. However, neither interpolated large amplitude mechanical stimuli nor suprathreshold electrical stimuli produced dishabituation in Stentor though these stimuli are among the most effective dishabituating stimuli for metazoan tactile response systems. Behavioral analysis of the <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> proceeded on the assumption that Stentor contains receptor and effector mechanisms only. Since the <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> was not correlated with a change in responsiveness to electrical stimuli, the ability of the animal to contract appears to be unaltered by the process producing the <b>response</b> <b>decrement.</b> On the other hand, weak mechanical prestimuli were found to increase the rate of the <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> which suggests that a process of receptor adaption is operative...|$|E

40|$|The Drosophila giant fiber jump-and-flight escape {{response}} {{is a model}} for genetic analysis of both the physiology and the plasticity of a sensorimotor behavioral pathway. We previously established the electrically induced giant fiber response in intact tethered flies {{as a model for}} habituation, a form of nonassociative learning. Here, we show that the rate of stimulus-dependent <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> of this neural pathway in a habituation protocol is correlated with PKG (cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase) activity and foraging behavior. We assayed <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> for natural and mutant rover and sitter alleles of the foraging (for) gene that encodes a Drosophila PKG. Rover larvae and adults, which have higher PKG activities, travel significantly farther while foraging than sitters with lower PKG activities. <b>Response</b> <b>decrement</b> was most rapid in genotypes previously shown to have low PKG activities and sitter-like foraging behavior. We also found differences in spontaneous recovery (the reversal of <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> during a rest from stimulation) and a dishabituation-like phenomenon (the reversal of <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> evoked by a novel stimulus). This electrophysiological study in an intact animal preparation provides one of the first direct demonstrations that PKG can affect plasticity in a simple learning paradigm. It increases our understanding of the complex interplay of factors that can modulate the sensitivity of the giant fiber escape response, and it defines a new adult-stage phenotype of the foraging locus. Finally, these results show that behaviorally relevant neural plasticity in an identified circuit can be influenced by a single-locus genetic polymorphism existing in a natural population of Drosophila...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the standard acoustic startle habituation paradigm contains the elements of Pavlovian fear conditioning was tested. In a potentiated startle response paradigm, a startle stimulus and a light conditioned stimulus (CS) were paired. A startle stimulus then was tested alone or following the CS. Freezing behavior was measured toindex conditioned fear. The startle response was potentiated on CS trials, and rats froze more in CS than in non-CS periods. In Experiment I, response to a previously habituated, weak startle stimulus was potentiated. In Experiment 2,response to the same stimulus used as the unconditioned stimulus (US) in training was potentiated. This CS-potentiated response retarded the course of <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> over training sessions as compared with an explictly unpaired control group. Conditioned fear is a standard feature of this habituation paradigm, serves to potentiate the startle response, and provides an associative dimension lacking in the habituation process per se.

Few studies have investigated neural mechanisms underlying language recovery in severe aphasia patients, who are typically viewed as having a poor prognosis for language recovery. Although test-retest reliability is routinely demonstrated during collection of language data in single-subject aphasia research, this is rarely examined in fMRI studies investigating the underlying neural mechanisms in aphasia recovery. The {{purpose of this study}} was to acquire fMRI test-retest data examining semantic decisions both within and between two aphasia patients.

40|$|Habituation – the <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> to repetitively {{presented}} stimulation - {{is a basic}} cognitive {{capability and}} suited to investigate development and integrity of the human brain. To evaluate the developmental process of auditory habituation, the current study used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory habituation, dishabituation and stimulus specificity in children and adults and compared the results between age groups. Twenty-nine children (Mage = 9. 69 years, SD &# 177; 0. 47) and 14 adults (Mage = 29. 29 years, SD &# 177; 3. 47) {{participated in the study}} and passively listened to a habituation paradigm consisting of 100 trains of tones which were composed of five 500 Hz tones, one 750 Hz tone (dishabituator) and another two 500 Hz tones, respectively while focusing their attention on a silent movie. Adults showed the expected habituation and stimulus specificity within-trains while no <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> was found between trains. Sensory adaptation or fatigue as a source for <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> in adults is unlikely due to the strong reaction to the dishabituator (stimulus specificity) and strong mismatch negativity responses. However, in children neither habituation nor dishabituation or stimulus specificity could be found within-trains, <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> was found across trains. It can be speculated that the differences between children and adults are linked to differences in stimulus processing due to attentional processes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we aimed to develop a {{habituation}} paradigm that allows the investigation of <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> and response recovery and examine its applicability for measuring the habituation of the visually evoked responses (VERs) in neonatal and fetal magnetoencephalographic recordings. Two paradigms, one with a long and one with a short inter-train interval (ITI), were developed and tested in separate studies. Both paradigms consisted of a train of four light flashes; each train being followed by a 500 Hz burst tone. Healthy pregnant women underwent two prenatal measurements and returned with their babies for a neonatal investigation. The amplitudes of the neonatal VERs in the long-ITI condition showed within-train <b>response</b> <b>decrement.</b> An increased response to the auditory dishabituator was found confirming response recovery. In the short-ITI condition, neonatal amplitude decrement could not be demonstrated while response recovery was present. In both ITI conditions, the response rate of the cortical responses was much lower in the fetuses than in the neonates. Fetal VERs in the long-ITI condition indicate amplitude decline from the first to the second flash with no further decrease. The long-ITI paradigm might be useful to investigate habituation of the VERs in neonates and fetuses, although the latter requires precaution...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of Hullian drive theory, it is not {{difficult}} to account for the rela-tively poorer performance of high drive subjects when the correct response is nondominant, or the superior perform-ance of high drive subjects in some instances when the correct response is dominant. The relationship E^-E 2 = {^(H^-Hz) ] yields the prediction that increased drive (£>), by multiply-ing differences in habit strength (H), leads to an increase in the difference between the reaction potential (£) of the primary response and the reac-tion potentials of competing responses. 2 When the dominant tendency is cor-rect, higher drive will favor the occur-rence of correct responses, and when the dominant tendency is incorrect, higher drive will detract from perform-ance because the probability that oscil-lation will bring the E of the dominant incorrect response below that of the correct response is decreased. A more difficult problem is posed by the occurrence of decrements in the performance of a dominant response related to increased drive. Drive re-lated <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> have been noted in two types of situations: with very strong drive levels, and also with high habit strength and less extreme drive levels.

40|$|The syncarid {{crustacean}} Anaspides tasmaniae rapidly flexes its free thoracic and abdominal {{segments in}} response to tactile stimulation of its body. This <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> but recovers in slightly more than one hour. The fast flexion is evoked by single action potentials in the lateral of two large diameter fibres (40 /im) which lie {{on either side of}} the cord. The lateral giant fibre is made up of fused axons of 11 neurones, one in each of the last 5 thoracic and 6 abdominal ganglia. The soma of each neurone lies contralateral to the axon. Its neurite crosses that of its counterpart in the commissure and gives out dendrites into the neuropile of each hemi-ganglion. The lateral giant neurone receives input from the whole body but fires in response only to input from the fourth thoracic segment posteriorly. Both fibres respond with tactile stimulation of only one side. Since neither current nor action potentials spread from one fibre to the other, afferents must synapse with both giant neurones.

Both species were presented {{with a total of}} 100 auditory stimuli, divided into four blocks of 25 stimuli. By means of wavelet denoising, single-trial ERPs were established in both humans and rats. The auditory ERPs were characterized by the presence of two positive and two negative waves in both humans and rats, albeit with different latencies in the two species (P 1, N 1, P 2, and N 2). The results showed decreased amplitudes within blocks for the N 1, P 2, and N 2 components in humans and for the N 1 and P 2 components in rats. Decreased amplitudes across blocks were found for the N 2 component in humans and for the P 2 and N 2 components in rats.

40|$|Continuous {{presentation}} of an olfactory stimulus causes a decrement of the chemotaxis response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. However, {{the differences between the}} learning process of habituation (a readily reversible decrease in behavioral response) and other types of olfactory plasticity such as adaptation (a decrement in response due to sensory fatigue, which cannot be dishabituated) have not been addressed. The volatile odorant diacetyl (DA) was used within a single paradigm to assess the distinct processes of olfactory adaptation and habituation. Preexposing and testing worms to 100 % DA vapors caused a chemotaxis decrement that was not reversible despite the {{presentation of}} potentially dishabituating stimuli. This DA adaptation was abolished in worms with an odr- 10 mutation (encoding a high-affinity DA receptor on the AWA neuron), even though naive chemotaxis remained unaffected. Conversely, DA adaptation remained intact in odr- 1 mutants (defective in AWC neuron-mediated olfactory behavior), even though naive chemotaxis to DA decreased. Surprisingly, exposure to vapors of intermediate concentrations of DA (0. 01 % and 25 %) did not cause worms to exhibit any <b>response</b> <b>decrement.</b> In contrast to preexposure to high DA concentrations, preexposure to low DA concentrations (0. 001 %) produced habituation of the chemotaxis response (a dishabituating stimulus could reverse the <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> back to baseline levels).

Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction has been shown with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS). Subclinical NMJ dysfunction may also occur.

Patients with acute OP poisoning were enrolled. NMJ function, muscle power and tendon reflexes were assessed at discharge and six weeks after exposure. NMJ function was assessed with exercise modified supramaximal slow RNS of the median nerve. Results: There were 68 patients and 71 controls.

40|$|Neurons {{in primary}} visual cortex exhibit several {{nonlinearities}} in their responses to visual stimuli, including <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> to repeated stimuli, contrast-dependent phase advance, contrast saturation, and cross-orientation suppression. Thalamocortical synaptic depression has been implicated in these phenomena but has not been examined directly in visual cortex in vivo. We assessed depression of visual thalamocortical synapses in vivo using 20 – 100 Hz trains of electrical stimuli delivered to the LGN. Cortical cells receiving direct input from the LGN, identified by short latency and low jitter of LGN-evoked PSPs, showed moderate reductions in PSP amplitude during the fastest trains. Cells receiving indirect input from the thalamus via other cortical excitatory neurons show a marked reduction in PSP amplitude during a train, which could be explained either by synaptic depression in corticocortical synapses or by an inhibition-mediated suppression of the firing of their afferents. Reducing spontaneous activity in the LGN (by retinal blockade) unmasked additional depression at the thalamocortical synapse but only for the first stimulus in the train. That is, the first PSP was increased in amplitude relative to the unblocked condition, but subsequent responses were essentially unchanged. Thus, the synapses are maintained at significant levels of depression by spontaneous activity.

40|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} in humans partly relates to inappropriate overvaluation of reward-associated stimuli. Hence, {{it is desirable}} to develop methods of behavioral modification that can reduce stimulus value. Here, we tested whether one kind of behavioral modification—the rapid stopping of actions {{in the face of}} reward-associated stimuli—could lead to subsequent devaluation of those stimuli. We developed a novel paradigm with three consecutive phases: implicit reward learning, a stop-signal task, and an auction procedure. In the learning phase, we associated abstract shapes with different levels of reward. In the stop-signal phase, we paired half those shapes with occasional stop-signals, requiring the rapid stopping of an initiated motor response, while the other half of shapes was not paired with stop signals. In the auction phase, we assessed the subjective value of each shape via willingness-to-pay. In 2 experiments, we found that participants bid less for shapes that were paired with stop-signals compared to shapes that were not. This suggests that the requirement to try to rapidly stop a <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> stimulus value. Two follow-on control experiments suggested that the result was specifically due to stopping action rather than aversiveness, effort, conflict, or salience associated with stop signals. This study makes a theoretical link between research on inhibitory control and value.

40|$|Many {{studies of}} the neural {{mechanisms}} of learning have focused on habituation, a simple form of learning in which a <b>response</b> <b>decrements</b> with repeated stimulation. In the siphon-elicited siphon withdrawal reflex (S-SWR) of the marine mollusk Aplysia, the prevailing view is that homosynaptic depression of primary sensory afferents underlies short-term habituation. Here we examined whether this mechanism is also utilized in habituation of the tail-elicited siphon withdrawal reflex (T-SWR), which is triggered by an independent, polysynaptic afferent pathway that converges onto the same siphon motor neurons (MNs). By using semi-intact preparations in which tail and/or siphon input to siphon MNs could be measured, we found that repeated tail stimuli administered {{in the presence of}} a reversible conduction block of the nerves downstream of the tail sensory neurons (SNs) completely abolished the induction of habituation. Subsequent retraining revealed no evidence of savings, indicating that the tail SNs and their immediate interneuronal targets are not the locus of plasticity underlying T-SWR habituation. The networks closely associated with the siphon MNs are modulated by cholinergic inhibition. We next examined the effects of network disinhibition on S-SWR and T-SWR habituation using an Ach receptor antagonist d-tubocurarine. We found that the resulting network disinhibition disrupted T-SWR, but not S-SWR, habituation. Indeed, repeated tail stimulation in the presence of d-tubocurarine resulted in an initial enhancement in responding. Lastly, we tested whether habituation of T-SWR generalized to S-SWR and found that it did not. Collectively, these data indicate that (1) unlike S-SWR, habituation of T-SWR does not involve homosynaptic depression of SNs; and (2) the sensitivity of T-SWR habituation to network disinhibition is consistent with an interneuronal plasticity mechanism that is unique to the T-SWR circuit, since it does not alter S-SWR...|$|R

Lateral peak forces greater than 2 g {{were defined as}} responses (i. e., all responses above the measurement threshold). Different, higher force requirements were used to define criterion responses (a subclass of all responses) that exceeded the requirement and produced a reinforcer. The reinforcer was sweetened, condensed milk, delivered upon response termination. All mice were exposed to two ascending series of criterion force requirements (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 g). Increasing the force requirement initially decreased criterion response rates, but criterion response rates recovered with continued exposure, except at the 32 -g requirement. Response rates for all measured responses initially increased with increasing force requirements, but then decreased with continued exposure. The second exposure series produced more stable response rate changes than the first series. The time-integral of force (area under the force–time curve for individual responses, which is proportional to energy expenditure for each response) increased {{with the increase in}} the force requirement. The C 57 BL/ 6 J inbred strain generated average force output similar to CD- 1 outbred stock mice trained on the same force requirements. C 57 BL/ 6 J inbred strain mice differed from CD- 1 mice in initial response rates (for all responses above threshold) and had lower response rates at the 16 and 32 g requirements resulting in lower total force output. These data show for both mice types that increased force requirements resulted in increased overall responding (all measured responses), which contradicts a punishment interpretation of criterion <b>response</b> <b>decrements.</b> C 57 BL inbred mice showed individual differences comparable to the outbred CD- 1 stock. C 57 BL/ 6 mice did not maintain responding as well at the higher force requirements, which may be due to their small body size and weight, compared to the larger and heavier CD- 1 mice...|$|R
40|$|Seven rats {{were trained}} to stable {{performance}} levels on either Fixed Ratio 47, Variable Ratio 47, Variable Interval 1 -min, or Fixed Interval 1 -min schedules of food reinforcement. Subjects were then tested for sensitivity to vestibular stimulation from rotation, using an ascending method of limits technique with increments in velocity of one revolution per minute every 5 min. Centrifugal forces were minimized by locating the test chamber over the axis of rotation. Response rates decreased in all subjects {{as a function of}} increasing rotation speed. In addition, characteristic differences in the patterns of <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> were found between subjects on ratio and on interval schedules. Repeated tests indicated high intra-subject reliability in sensitivity to rotation. Similarities of these data to “motion sickness” phenomena in other species were noted. It is suggested that this behavioral approach provides a sensitive and quantifiable technique for assessing the effects of vestibular stimulation in animals...|$|E
40|$|Several {{theories}} of hippocampal function have suggested {{a role for}} the hippocampus in contextual memory retrieval. However, these theories are based on studies using permanent pretraining lesions, which confound {{the role of the}} hippocampus in learning with its role in retrieval. We argue that an alternative methodology is required to assess the role of the hippocampus in memory retrieval processes. This alternative methodology involves temporary inactivation of the hippocampus in Pavlovian paradigms that lend themselves to an examination of retrieval. An example of this approach is considered in a Pavlovian fear-conditioning paradigm. We examined the influence of hippocampal inactivation on the context-specific expression of latent inhibition, a <b>response</b> <b>decrement</b> displayed when excitatory conditioning is preceded by non-reinforced presentations of a to-be-conditioned stimulus. Reversible inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus prior to retrieval testing eliminated the context-specific expression of latent inhibition. The nature of the hippocampal role in retrieval processes is discussed in the light of these data. © 2000 Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|During postembryonic {{development}} of the cricket, {{the total number of}} filiform hair sensilla in the cereal sensory system increases approximately 40 -fold. In addition, individual receptor hairs grow in size, changing the transducer properties of the sensilla and, thereby, the information transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) by the sensory neurons. Interneurons MGI and 10 - 3 receive monosynaptic inputs from these sensory neurons and send outputs to anterior ganglia. We show that, in spite of the changes in the periphery, the response properties of these interneurons are relatively constant during development. The two interneurons differ in their frequency response, intensity response and rate of <b>response</b> <b>decrement.</b> Their respective response properties are conserved during the postembryonic period. The results suggest that systematic rearrangement of the sensory neuron-to-interneuron synapses {{plays an important role in}} maintaining a constant output of this sensory system to higher centers of the CNS during maturation of the cricket...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement was {{introduced}} for responses normally treated as errors in signal-detection procedures. The first experiment used a standard two-response discrete-trial procedure with no reinforcement for errors. Results showed that rats altered their response biases but maintained constant sensitivity to visual signals when reinforcement probabilities varied, {{and that their}} sensitivity depended on the physical difference between signals, {{in accordance with the}} predictions of signal-detection theory. Experiment II, with rats, and Experiment III, with pigeons, demonstrated that sensitivity decreased in this procedure when reinforcement was scheduled for errors with the signals held constant, despite independence of overall number of reinforcers and sensitivity. Experiment IV, with rats, replicated the decrease in sensitivity in a continuous procedure employing only one <b>response.</b> The <b>decrements</b> in sensitivity were similar across Experiments II, III, and IV, and accorded well with earlier research. Thus, contrary to a fundamental assumption of signal-detection theory, estimates of sensitivity are not always invariant with respect to the outcomes of responding, but depend on relative reinforcement of correct responses...|$|R
40|$|Response {{to color}} in {{projective}} tests has been postulated to be {{a measure of}} emotional stability. This is so for the Rorschach test (Rorschach, 1942) and for Human Figure Drawings (Hammer, 1980). It was therefore expected {{that there would be}} consistency in response to color across these two projective tests. ^ In the present study the Rorschach Prognostic Rating Scale and Rorschach variables that have been postulated to be reflective of emotional reactivity and control were looked at as to their relationship to the drawing variables of Naglieri 2 ̆ 7 s DAP scoring system and a disturbance indicator list compiled from the literature. It was hypothesized that: low Rorschach Prognostic Rating Scale scores, high number of color shock indices, lower than would be expected Rorschach variables of M, Sum C, FC, CF, C + Cn, Lambda, D, Adjusted D, Affective ratio, high negative color <b>responses,</b> <b>decrement</b> in form level on chromatic cards, less M in relation to Sum C and less FC in relation to CF + C + Cn would each be associated with decrease in Naglieri scores and an increase in disturbance indicators on the chromatic drawings. Color choices were also looked at. ^ Rorschach protocols and pencil and crayon drawings of same and opposite sex figures were obtained from 46 children ages 7 - 12. Ten sets of achromatic and colored pencil drawings were also obtained from children within the same age group. Results of ANOVA reveals a main effect for difference in performance between achromatic and crayon drawings, as measured by Naglieri scores and disturbance indicators, in the expected direction, significant at least at the. 01 level. Some interactions with Rorschach variables were found. Naglieri scores and the Rorschach Prognostic Rating Scale were not correlated. T tests found a significant increase at the. 01 level in disturbance indicators and no difference in Naglieri scores on the colored pencil drawings. ^ It is suggested that the Naglieri scale may be more a measure of cognitive development and less sensitive to emotional states. It is further suggested that future researchers may use a drawing scale measure of constriction rather then one of global disturbance. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{documents}} and analyzes three pricing {{practices that are}} common to the retail food industry: quantity surcharges, downward price rigidity and nine-ending pricing. Quantity surcharges happen when food retailers assign higher unit prices to larger packages. Downward price rigidity means that the retailers' <b>response</b> to wholesale <b>decrements</b> is less than proportional than to wholesale increments. Nine-ending pricing refers {{to the practice of}} setting the rightmost digit of a price at nine. The findings on the quantity surcharge practice reveal its usage is significant and persistent. The analysis indicates that food retailers may use this strategy to price discriminate among different types of consumers...|$|R
