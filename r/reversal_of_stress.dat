We have reported previously that in adult male rats, acute behavioural stress impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) but enhances long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA 1 region. In this study we report {{that the effects of}} stress on LTP and LTD were reversed when animals were introduced into a novel ‘stimulus-rich’ environment immediately after the stress. Novelty exploration-induced <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> effects was prevented when the animals were given the NMDA receptor antagonist d-(−) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid, the cholinergic antagonist atropine and the protein phosphatase (PP) 2 B inhibitors cyclosporin A and cypermethrin, but not the α 1 -adrenergic antagonist prazosin, the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or the PP 1 / 2 A inhibitor okadaic acid, respectively before being subjected to the novel environment. In addition, the ability of novelty exploration to reverse the stress effects was mimicked by a direct application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol. Exposure to the novel environment following stress was accompanied by the activation of both PP 2 B and striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of the cholinergic system and, in turn, the triggering of an NMDA receptor-mediated activation of PP 2 B to increase STEP activity appear to mediate the novelty exploration-induced reversal of stress-related modulation of hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity...|$|E
40|$|Optical, electrical, and {{microstructural}} {{effects of}} Ar ion bombardment and Ar incorporation on thermally evaporated Ag and Al thin films were investigated. The {{results show that}} as the momentum supplied to the growing films by the bombarding Ar ions per arriving metal atom increases, refractive index at 632. 8 nm increases and extinction coefficient decreases, lattice spacing expands, grain size decreases, electrical resistivity increases, and trapped Ar increases slightly. In Ag films, stress reverses from tensile to compressive; in AI films compressive stress increases. In both films, the change in optical constants {{can be explained by}} variation in void volume. The <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> from tensile to compressive in Ag films requires a threshold level of momentum. The increase in electrical resistivity is related to the increase in the void fraction, decrease in the grain size, and increase in trapped Ar in both types of films. Many of these properties correlate well with the momentum transferred, suggesting that the momentum is an important physical parameter in describing the influence of ion beams on growing thin films and determining the characteristics of thin metal films prepared by ion-assisted deposition (IAD). With a low energy ion beam, the Ar concentration in IAD Ag films was negligible. When the bombarded film thickness was less than 5 nm, the electrical resistivity of IAD Ag films tended to decrease slightly from that of the non-IAD film. Using the Bruggeman effective medium theory, a formula for the void fraction at any given wavelength was derived. We investigated optical properties, stoichiometry, chemical bonding states, and structure of aluminum oxynitride thin films prepared by reactive ion-assisted deposition. Variations of optical constants and chemical bonding states are related to the stoichiometry. We found that our amorphous aluminum oxynitride film is not simply a mixture of aluminum oxide and nitride but a compound. A rugate filter using a step-index profile of aluminum oxynitride films was fabricated by nitrogen ion beam bombardment of a growing Al film with backfilled oxygen pressure as the sole variable. The effects of ultrasound-assisted deposition (UAD) on the optical properties of ZrO₂, Ta₂O₅, and MgF₂ films were investigated. UAD is likely to induce oxygen and fluoride deficiencies in oxide and fluoride films and increase the packing density of films...|$|E

These two solutions were developed in greater detail: A plane, oval concentric track resp. a straight track with two ramps. Between the two ramps a bogie is running up and down. The first proposal represents a horizontal layed oval track with very small return curves and sufficient long stright test sections. By the second proposal a bogie is running up and down on a test-section. The acceleration and delay followed on the two rampes at both sides of the track. Before a test the bogie is pulled up a ramp in a height for a specific velocity. Disconnecting the bogie the test stars.

The most important case <b>of</b> such <b>stresses</b> in structural work is in the end posts and end top and bottom chords of a draw span truss.

The effect repeated tension and compression have in lowering the elastic limit or ultimate strength of the material must be determined by trial.

Plants grown with 50 µM Cd showed increased superoxide and H 2 O 2 accumulation and lipid peroxidation together with increased activity of 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) and ethylene production and inhibition of photosynthesis and growth. Application of 1 mM SO 42 − or 200 µL L− 1 ethephon (ethylene source) influenced photosynthetic and growth performance equally in {{presence or absence}} of Cd. However, their combined application synergistically improved photosynthetic performance more in presence of Cd and reduced oxidative stress (lower superoxide and H 2 O 2 accumulation) by decreasing ethylene and glucose sensitivity with the increase in cysteine and methionineand a non-proteinogenic thiol (reduced glutathione; GSH) contents. The central role of ethylene in potentiating S-mediated <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> Cd-induced oxidative <b>stress</b> was evident with the use ethylene action inhibitor, norbornadiene (NBD).

Plants receiving combined treatment of NO plus excess-S showed well-developed thylakoid membrane and properly stacked grana lamellae under salt stress, while the chloroplasts from salt-stressed plants had disorganized thylakoids. Moreover, the leaves from the NO and excess-S treated plants exhibited lower superoxide ion accumulation under salt <b>stress,</b> induced activity <b>of</b> ATP-sulfurylase (ATPS), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) and optimized NO generation that helped in minimizing oxidative stress.

These findings indicated that NO influenced photosynthesis under salt stress by regulating oxidative stress {{and its effects on}} S-assimilation, an antioxidant system and NO generation.

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{fractures}} in plutons has been ascribed to differential stress resulting from regional tectonics, magmatic emplacement, crystallization, and cooling. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> {{and hence the}} evolution of fractures in plutons, controls the timing and spatial distribution of fluid flow and alteration. Quantitative data on fracture orientation, density, vein width, and alteration systematically obtained from the 70 -m. y. -old Diamond Joe stock, west-central Arizona, {{were used to determine}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and fractures within the stock during its crystallization. The dome-shaped chamber of the predominantly quartz monzonite stock is 8 km in diameter. Regional east-northeast compression produced the north-northwest crustal dilation necessary for the ascent and emplacement of the stock. Two-dimensional models using analytic solutions for stress in elastic media indicate that the prominent radial fractures within the stock developed in response to magma pressure, contraction, and regional stress. Most fractures formed by tensile failure during cooling, although magma pressure led to shear failure near the center. Deflection of radial fractures away from the east-northeast axis of the pluton at increasing distances from the center indicates north-northwest and east-northeast orientation of regional maximum and minimum principal stress, respectively, during crystallization. Apparently, north-northwest-trending uplift {{in the vicinity of the}} pluton led to a shallow local <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> principal <b>stress</b> after magma emplacement. Theoretical strain estimates show a correlation with high fracture densities and abundant alteration along the north-northwest axis and the pluton margins. Zones of fracture selvage K-feldspar+quartz, muscovite+K-feldspar+quartz, and muscovite+chlorite+quartz alteration are concentric about the center of the stock and extend a short distance into the surrounding host rocks. Younger sericite+K-feldspar, argillic, and carbonate alteration occurs locally. Mineral equilibria and fluid inclusion data indicate low hydrothermal temperatures (< 150 °C) near the center of the stock and higher temperatures (200 °C- 400 °C) near the margins.

There was a significant displacement of the PV curve downwards {{and to the right}} in all five, with increased lung compliance (Cl stat) in two.

Previous studies have reported a significant rebalancing of the leaf proteome via the jasmonate signalling pathway, associated with ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) depletion and the up-regulation of stress-related proteins. As expected, leaf proteome alterations were observed 7 days post-MeJA treatment, associated with lowered RuBisCO pools and the induction of stress-inducible proteins such as protease inhibitors, thionins and chitinases.

However, many of the phenomena commonly used to infer recent uplift may as well be a consequence of climate change and sea-level fall.

On <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the flow, if the strain, γ, is smaller than about 500 units, the damping <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> oscillations is reversed; this correlates with an outward radial migration of twist walls. When γ > 500, disclinations nucleate and spoil the reversibility <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> damping...|$|R

Intake of alcohol depends on numerous genetic and environmental factors. Stress has long been thought to influence the alcohol drinking in humans. Forced swimming in laboratory animals has been widely used as a model <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> to study the physiological changes and {{the capacity of the}} organism in response to stress. Aim: 1. To assess the effect <b>of</b> forced swimming <b>stress</b> on seminal fluid profile, Serum testosterone level, Testicular lipid peroxidation levels. 2. To assess the effect of Vitamin E on stress induced changes. Method: Adult male albino rats weighing 200 – 220 g, aged 12 - 15 weeks were used in this study. The animals were randomly divided into four groups of 6 animals each. Group 1 (control) received distilled water, Group 2 (Forced Swimming Stress) received distilled water Group 3 : subjected to Forced Swimming stress with 20 % alcohol intake p. o. Group 4 : Swimming stress with 20 % alcohol treated with Vitamin E(200 mg/kg/day orally). The following parameters were studied in all groups 1. Body weight. 2. Sperm count Motility and Life /death Ratio (SLDR). 3. Serum Testosterone 4. Testicular Malondialdehyde level (MDA). Results: Forced swimming stress caused loss in body wt, reduction in sperm count, motility and SLDR in sperm analysis, reduction in serum testosterone and increase testicular MDA levels compared to control. All the changes were statistically significant. When alcohol was added along with forced swimming it caused further loss in body wt, sperm count, motility and SLDR, serum testosterone level and slightly further increase in MDA levels. These observations were also statistically significant. In case of group IV in which Vitamin E was administered long with stress with alcohol it showed a trend <b>of</b> <b>reversal</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and alcohol induced change (Group III) exhibited by gain in body wt, increase sperm count, motility and SLDR, serum testosterone and decrease in MDA level. All the results were statically significant except serum testosterone. Conclusion: Force swimming indicates that swimming is an effective model for producing stress in albino rats. The stress induced changes were further accentuated by addition of ethyl alcohol. However Vit E treatment reverses the effect <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and alcohol...|$|R

40|$|Background-—This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that type 2 diabetes restricts multipotency of db/db mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), promotes their terminal differentiation into adipocytes rather than endothelial cells, thereby promotes adipocytic infiltration into ischemic muscles, and reduces their capacity to participate in postischemic neovascularization. Methods and Results-—To test this hypothesis, we transplanted MSCs from db/db or wild-type (WT) mice into WT recipients after induction of hind limb ischemia. WT recipients of db/db MSCs demonstrated adipocyte infiltration of ischemic muscle and impaired neovascularization; WT recipients of WT MSCs showed no intramuscular adipocyte infiltration and had significantly enhanced neovascularization (P< 0. 05; n= 6). Confocal microscopy showed {{that the percentage of}} MSCs that differentiated into an adipocyte phenotype was greater and into an endothelial cell was less in WT recipients transplanted with db/db MSCs than those transplanted with WT MSCs (P< 0. 05; n= 6). In vitro, db/db MSCs exhibited greater oxidant stress, greater adipocyte differentiation, and less endothelial differentiation than WT MSCs, and these differences were reversed by treatment with N-acetylcysteine or Nox 4 siRNA (P< 0. 05; n= 6). Insulin increased Nox 4 expression, oxidant stress, and adipocyte differentiation in WT MSCs, and these insulin-induced effects were reversed by Nox 4 siRNA (P< 0. 05; n= 6). <b>Reversal</b> <b>of</b> db/db MSC oxidant stress by in vivo pretreatment with Nox 4 siRNA before transplantation reversed their impaired capacity to augment postischemic neovascularization. Conclusions-—Type 2 diabetes–induced oxidant stress restricts the multipotency of MSCs and impairs their capacity to increase blood flow recovery after the induction <b>of</b> hind-limb ischemia. <b>Reversal</b> <b>of</b> MSC oxidant <b>stress</b> might permit greater leverage of th...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation {{is used to}} study the flow field around an infinitely long circular cylinder rotating in fluid with no outer boundary. Wall shear stresses and normal pressure fluctuations are considered with reference to flat, non-rotating geometries to help identify any flow field differences introduced by Coriolis forces. In the present case, Coriolis forces are experienced only by the turbulence field. The dominant effect is to decrease the streamwise turbulent velocity level relative {{to the other two}} components. A consequential effect is that the two components <b>of</b> wall shear <b>stress</b> fluctuations become almost equal and spectra for streamwise and spanwise wall shear stress fluctuations become almost identical. This is a distinctly different behaviour from that of non-rotating flat plate and straight pipe flows. Instantaneous wall shear stress fluctuations indicate a near wall flow structure similar to that of other boundary layers with sweeps and ejections. No flow <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> wall shear <b>stress</b> are indicated. A good correlation of the wall shear stresses and the turbulent kinetic energy exists for y(+) < 10. Budgets <b>of</b> Reynolds normal <b>stress</b> components illustrate the role played by Coriolis forces in the production and redistribution of turbulence energies. Wall pressure fluctuations are found to be of much larger spatial extent than velocity fluctuation scales while the probability density distribution of pressure fluctuations is almost Gaussian but does display a Reynolds number effect for skewness and Kurtosis. The ratio of rms pressure fluctuations to mean streamwise wall shear stress follows closely that for flat plate boundary layer and channel flows. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
