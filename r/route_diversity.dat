This fact is especially unfortunate considering the vast <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> which is inherently present in the global Internet graph. Therefore, we propose Inter-Domain <b>Route</b> <b>Diversity</b> (IDRD) as an overlay mechanism which enables efficient, backwards compatible and incrementally deployable introduction of <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> in the Internet.

40|$|Recent {{works on}} {{modeling}} the Internet topology [8, 9] have highlighted how {{the complexity of}} relationships be-tween Autonomous Systems (ASes) can not be oversimpli-fied without sacrificing accuracy in capturing route selec-tion. Such a shortcoming can mislead the understanding, hence the prediction, of the BGP (Border Gateway Proto-col) behavior. In particular, models that assume an AS to be an atomic entity fail to account for <b>route</b> <b>diversity,</b> in-formally defined as the selection within a single AS of mul-tiple routes to the same destination prefix. Internet topol-ogy models are usually built out of BGP data collected by remote vantage points. Thus, {{in this paper we}} aim at ex-tracting and characterizing the <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> that can be measured using such dataset. Towards this goal, we devise a methodology to compute <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> from a continuous stream of collected BGP messages. The analysis of our results shows that (i) ac-counting for the BGP dynamics allows to extract much more diversity than from a static snapshot of the Internet rout-ing configuration; (ii) <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> observed for an AS is strongly related to its location in the customer-provider hi-erarchy; (iii) the distribution of <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> over ASes is unlikely to be biased by the specific choice of the collection system, while the number of prefixes exhibiting route diver-sity can depend on both number and location of the vantage points. ...|$|E

If {{any of them}} were disrupted, it would impact not only the individual metro line but also the whole metro network.

In the event of incidents, metro managers can make use of this information to reroute passengers to minimize the impact of disruptions. This paper aims to develop a <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> index to address two questions: "how many reasonable routes are there for passengers between any two stations in normal operations or {{in the event of a}} disruption?" and "which stations are most vulnerable (i. e., the largest impact to the overall metro network when they are disrupted) ?"

40|$|Abstract—Two main issues {{affect the}} {{existing}} routing metrics for cognitive radio ad hoc networks: i) {{they are often}} based on heuristics, and thus {{they have not been}} proved to be optimal; ii) they do not account for the <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> effects, and thus they are not able to measure the actual cost of a route. In this paper, an optimal routing metric for cognitive radio ad hoc networks, referred to as OPERA, is proposed. OPERA is designed to achieve two features: i) Optimality: OPERA is optimal when combined with both Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford based routing protocols; ii) Accuracy: OPERA exploits the <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> provided by the intermediate nodes to measure the actual end-to-end delay, by taking explicitly into account the unique characteristics of cognitive radio networks. A closedform expression of the proposed routing metric is analytically derived for both static and mobile networks, and its optimality is proved rigorously.

40|$|Abstract – Thanks to {{the large}} {{buffering}} time of off-line streaming applications, erasure resilient Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes can improve the reliability of communication particularly well. However real-time streaming puts hard restrictions on the buffer size making FEC inefficient for combating long link failures on single path <b>routes.</b> Path <b>diversity</b> is orthogonal to buffering and permits real-time streaming to also benefit from application of FEC. We introduce a capillary routing algorithm offering layer by layer {{a wide range of}} multi-path routing topologies starting from a simple solution and evolving toward reliable routing patterns with highly developed path diversity. The friendliness of a multi-path routing pattern is rated by the overall amount of FEC redundancy required for combating the non-simultaneous failures of all links of the communication footprint. We rated the friendliness of a dozen of capillary routing layers, built on several hundreds of network samples obtained from a random walk Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET). The overall requirement in redundant FEC codes decreases substantially as the spreading of the routing grows. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of {{communication}} reliability and diversity in multi-hop wireless networks. Our aim {{is to develop a}} new network model that better takes into account the fading nature of the wireless physical layer. To that end, we use the outage probability model for a fading channel to develop a probabilistic model for a wireless link. This model establishes a relationship between the link reliability, the distance between communicating nodes and the transmission power. Applying this probabilistic model to a multi-hop network setting, we define and analyze the end-to-end route reliability and develop algorithms for finding the optimal route between a pair of nodes. The relationship between the reliability of the optimal route and the consumed power is studied. The idea of <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> is introduced as a way to improve the end-to-end route reliability by taking advantage of the wireless broadcast property, the independence of fade state between different pairs of nodes, and the space diversity created by multiple relay nodes along the route. We give analytical results for the improvements due to <b>route</b> <b>diversity</b> in some simple network topologies.

This paper summarizes {{the results of}} recent studies on the phylogeography and conservation genetics of animals (20 taxa of beetles, butterflies, reptiles and rodents) and flowering plants (18 taxa) of such, "steppic" habitats in Eastern Central Europe. Most species show a similar phylogeographic pattern: relatively high genetic similarity within regional groups of populations and moderate-to-high genetic distinctiveness of populations from currently isolated regions located in the studied area. This distinctiveness of populations suggests a survival here during glacial maxima, including areas north of the Bohemian Massif-Carpathians arc. Steppic species generally do not follow the paradigmatic patterns known for temperate biota (south-north “contraction–expansion”), but to some extent {{are similar to those}} of arctic-alpine taxa. There are three main groups of taxa within Eastern Central Europe that differ in their contemporary distribution pattern, which may reflect historical origin and expansion <b>routes.</b> Present <b>diversity</b> patterns of the studied steppic species suggest that they share a unique genetic signature and distinct assemblages exist in each of the now isolated areas rich in steppic habitats. At least some of these areas probably act as present “interglacial refugia” for steppic species. This study strongly supports the need to protect steppic species throughout their entire ranges in the region, as the continuous destruction of steppic habitats in some areas may lead not only to the disappearance of local populations, but also to the extinction of unique evolutionary units...|$|R

Short-term atmospheric elevated CO 2 exposure {{has been shown}} to create major shifts in C flow <b>routes</b> and <b>diversity</b> of the active soil-borne microbial community. Long-term increases in CO 2 have been hypothesized to have subtle effects due to the potential adaptation of soil microorganism to the increased flow of organic C. Here, we studied the effects of prolonged elevated atmospheric CO 2 exposure on microbial C flow and microbial communities in the rhizosphere. Carex arenaria (a nonmycorrhizal plant species) and Festuca rubra (a mycorrhizal plant species) were grown at defined atmospheric conditions differing in CO 2 concentration (350 and 700 ppm) for 3 years. During this period, C flow was assessed repeatedly (after 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years) by C- 13 pulse-chase experiments, and label was tracked through the rhizosphere bacterial, general fungal, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities. Fatty acid biomarker analyses and RNA-stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP), in combination with real-time PCR and PCR-DGGE, were used to examine microbial community dynamics and abundance. Throughout the experiment the influence of elevated CO 2 was highly plant dependent, with the mycorrhizal plant exerting a greater influence on both bacterial and fungal communities. Biomarker data confirmed that rhizodeposited C was first processed by AMF and subsequently transferred to bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil. Over the course of 3 years, elevated CO 2 caused a continuous increase in the C- 13 enrichment retained in AMF and an increasing delay in the transfer of C to the bacterial community. These results show that, not only do elevated atmospheric CO 2 conditions induce changes in rhizosphere C flow and dynamics but also continue to develop over multiple seasons, thereby affecting terrestrial ecosystems C utilization processes.
