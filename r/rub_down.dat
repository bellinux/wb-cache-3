60|$|After a good <b>rub</b> <b>down,</b> in dry pyjamas, I was {{scarcely}} {{back in my}} bunk with the Mind of Primitive Man before me, when the stampede over my head was repeated. I waited for the second rush. It came, and I proceeded to dress.|$|E

60|$|The {{captain had}} some towels under the little forward deck, and I gave myself a good <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> and dressed. Then I {{went to look}} at my prize. No wonder it was heavy. It had a young rock, a foot long, fast to its root.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I was {{up before}} daylight. I have {{a change of}} clothes in my saddlebag, and shall be glad to put them on. Will you order your man to give my horse a good <b>rub</b> <b>down,</b> and let him have a hot mash. How far am I from Ghent now?" ...|$|E
60|$|Next day Cashel rose early, {{went for}} a walk, paid extra {{attention}} to his diet, took some exercise with the gloves, had a bath and a <b>rub</b> <b>down,</b> and presented himself at Regent's Park at three o'clock in excellent condition. Expecting to see Bashville, he was surprised when the door was opened by a female servant.|$|E

6000|$|... "See {{that the}} mare gets a good <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> at once, then a feed of corn {{with a dash}} of eau-de-vie in it, a litter of straw, and a drink of water; she is done to death," [...] said Gaston, peremptorily to the sleepy-looking ostler.

60|$|Leaving Pierre to {{unsaddle}} and <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> his horse, Philip {{walked to the}} farther edge of the wood, to view the country beyond. They were, he knew, not far from La Chatre; {{and he was not}} surprised to see the town, lying in a valley, to which the ground sloped down from the wood. It was about {{a mile and a half}} distant. Nearer the wood, but half a mile to the west, the towers of a fortified chateau rose from a clump of trees. The country was rich and well cultivated, and everything had an aspect of peace and comfort.|$|E
60|$|At Nantes, Stainville partook of a frugal breakfast, and Belle Amie had a {{rest and}} {{a mouthful of}} corn. He was again to horse within half an hour, {{crossing}} the Seine here by the newly constructed stone bridge, thence on toward Elboeuf. By ten o'clock the sun was high in the heavens and was pouring heat like molten lead down on horse and rider. Progress had become much slower. Several halts {{had to be made}} at tiny wayside inns for a cooling drink and a <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> for Belle Amie. The enjoyment had gone out of the ride. It was heavy, arduous work, beside which despatch riding, with message of life and death, was mere child's play.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the ends}} of the earth sent horses. God knows what the army did with them, unless they ate them raw. They used horses as a courtesan uses oil: with both hands. These needed many men. Kurban Sahib {{appointed}} me to the command (what a command for me!) of certain woolly ones--Hubshis--whose touch and shadow are pollution. They were enormous eaters; sleeping on their bellies; laughing without cause; wholly like animals. Some were called Fingoes, and some, I think, Red Kaffirs, but they were all Kaffirs --filth unspeakable. I taught them to water and feed, and sweep and <b>rub</b> <b>down.</b> Yes, I oversaw the work of sweepers--a jemadar of mehtars (headman of a refuse-gang) was I, and Kurban Sahib little better, for five months. Evil months! The war went as Kurban Sahib had said. Our new men were slain and no vengeance was taken. It was a war of fools armed with the weapons of magicians. Guns that slew at half a day's march, and men who, being new, walked blind into high grass and were driven off like cattle by the Boer-log! As to the city of Eshtellenbosch, I am not a Sahib--only a Sikh. I would have quartered one troop only of the Gurgaon Rissala in that city--one little troop--and I would have schooled that city till its men learned to kiss the shadow of a Government horse upon the ground. There are many mullahs (priests) in Eshtellenbosch. They preached the Jehad against us. This is true--all the camp knew it. And most of the houses were thatched! A war of fools indeed! ...|$|E

60|$|A little {{distance}} up the street, Kermode stopped {{outside a}} shed {{in which a}} fellow of unprepossessing appearance was <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> a horse. His character, as Kermode knew, was no better than his looks.|$|R
6000|$|The Cigarette {{had gone}} past a while before; for, as I might have observed, if I {{had been a}} little less pleased with the {{universe}} at the moment, there was a clear way round the tree-top at the farther side. He had offered his services to haul me out, but as I was then already on my elbows I had declined and sent him down stream after the truant Arethusa. The stream was too rapid for a man to mount with one canoe, let alone two, upon his hands. So I crawled along the trunk to shore, and proceeded down the meadows by the riverside. I was so cold that my heart was sore. I had now an idea of my own why the reeds so bitterly shivered. I could have given any of them a lesson. The Cigarette remarked facetiously that he thought I was [...] "taking exercise" [...] as I drew near, until he made out for certain that I was only twittering with cold. I had a <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> with a towel, and donned a dry suit from the india-rubber bag. But I was not my own man again {{for the rest of the}} voyage. I had a queasy sense that I wore my last dry clothes upon my body. The struggle had tired me; and perhaps, whether I knew it or not, I was a little dashed in spirit. The devouring element in the universe had leaped out against me, in this green valley quickened by a running stream. The bells were all very pretty in their way, but I had heard some of the hollow notes of Pan's music. Would the wicked river drag me down by the heels, indeed? and look so beautiful all the time? Nature's good-humour was only skin-deep after all.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - This is a {{hard and}} {{interesting}} and beautiful life that we lead now. Our place is in a deep cleft of Vaea Mountain, some six hundred feet above the sea, embowered in forest, which is our strangling enemy, and which we combat with axes and dollars. I went crazy over outdoor work, and had at last to confine myself to the house, or literature must have gone by the board. NOTHING is so interesting as weeding, clearing, and path-making; the oversight of labourers becomes a disease; it is quite an effort not to drop into the farmer; and it does make you feel so well. To come down covered with mud and drenched with sweat and rain after some hours in the bush, change, <b>rub</b> <b>down,</b> and take {{a chair in the}} verandah, is to taste a quiet conscience. And the strange thing that I mark is this: If I go out and make sixpence, bossing my labourers and plying the cutlass or the spade, idiot conscience applauds me; if I sit in the house and make twenty pounds, idiot conscience wails over my neglect and the day wasted. For near a fortnight I did not go beyond the verandah; then I found my rush of work run out, and went down for the night to Apia; put in Sunday afternoon with our consul, 'a nice young man,' dined with my friend H. J. Moors in the evening, went to church - no less - at the white and half-white church - I had never been before, and was much interested; the woman I sat next LOOKED a full- blood native, and it was in the prettiest and readiest English that she sang the hymns; back to Moors', where we yarned of the islands, being both wide wanderers, till bed- time; bed, sleep, breakfast, horse saddled; round to the mission, to get Mr. Clarke to be my interpreter; over with him to the King's, whom I have not called on since my return; received by that mild old gentleman; have some interesting talk with him about Samoan superstitions and my land - the scene of a great battle in his (Malietoa Laupepa's) youth - the place which we have cleared the platform of his fort - the gulley of the stream full of dead bodies - the fight rolled off up Vaea mountain-side; back with Clarke to the Mission; had a bit of lunch and consulted over a queer point of missionary policy just arisen, about our new Town Hall and the balls there - too long to go into, but a quaint example of the intricate questions which spring up daily in the missionary path.|$|E
60|$|The hired man {{was very}} much put out, for it was his fault that the horse had run away. He led the animal around to the barn {{and gave him a}} good <b>rubbing</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{returned}} the boy, regarding it attentively, [...] "we might {{try it on}} Aglootook's nose. That wants cutting short, and <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> too, for it seems very hard to look at it." ...|$|R

6000|$|But what {{help from}} these fineries or pedantries? What help from thought? Life is not dialectics. We, I think, in these times, have had lessons {{enough of the}} {{futility}} of criticism. Our young people have thought and written much on labor and reform, {{and for all that}} they have written, neither the world nor themselves have got on a step. Intellectual tasting of life will not supersede muscular activity. If a man should consider the nicety of the passage of a piece of bread down his throat, he would starve. At Education-Farm, the noblest theory of life sat on the noblest figures of young men and maidens, quite powerless and melancholy. It would not rake or pitch a ton of hay; it would not <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> a horse; and the men and maidens it left pale and hungry. A political orator wittily compared our party promises to western roads, which opened stately enough, with planted trees on either side to tempt the traveller, but soon became narrow and narrower and ended in a squirrel-track and ran up a tree. So does culture with us; it ends in headache. Unspeakably sad and barren does life look to those who a few months ago were dazzled with the splendor of the promise of the times. [...] "There is now no longer any right course of action nor any self-devotion left among the Iranis." [...] Objections and criticism we have had our fill of. There are objections to every course of life and action, and the practical wisdom infers an indifferency, from the omnipresence of objection. The whole frame of things preaches indifferency. Do not craze yourself with thinking, but go about your business anywhere. Life is not intellectual or critical, but sturdy. Its chief good is for well-mixed people who can enjoy what they find, without question. Nature hates peeping, and our mothers speak her very sense when they say, [...] "Children, eat your victuals, and say no more of it." [...] To fill the hour,--that is happiness; to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval. We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to skate well on them. Under the oldest mouldiest conventions a man of native force prospers just {{as well as in the}} newest world, and that by skill of handling and treatment. He can take hold anywhere. Life itself is a mixture of power and form, and will not bear the least excess of either. To finish the moment, to find the journey's end in every step of the road, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom. It is not the part of men, but of fanatics, or of mathematicians if you will, to say that the shortness of life considered, it is not worth caring whether for so short a duration we were sprawling in want or sitting high. Since our office is with moments, let us husband them. Five minutes of today are worth as much to me as five minutes in the next millennium. Let us be poised, and wise, and our own, today. Let us treat the men and women well; treat them as if they were real; perhaps they are. Men live in their fancy, like drunkards whose hands are too soft and tremulous for successful labor. It is a tempest of fancies, and the only ballast I know is a respect to the present hour. Without any shadow of doubt, amidst this vertigo of shows and politics, I settle myself ever the firmer in the creed that we should not postpone and refer and wish, but do broad justice where we are, by whomsoever we deal with, accepting our actual companions and circumstances, however humble or odious as the mystic officials to whom the universe has delegated its whole pleasure for us. If these are mean and malignant, their contentment, which is the last victory of justice, is a more satisfying echo to the heart than the voice of poets and the casual sympathy of admirable persons. I think that however a thoughtful man may suffer from the defects and absurdities of his company, he cannot without affectation deny to any set of men and women a sensibility to extraordinary merit. The coarse and frivolous have an instinct of superiority, if they have not a sympathy, and honor it in their blind capricious way with sincere homage.|$|E
