50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the <b>ratchet</b> <b>head</b> that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the Autobot campaign, NEST Pilot Sgt. Epps is {{reporting}} Decepticons in Shanghai, China. Upon the arrival of the Autobots, Major William Lennox informs them there are Decepticons in the perimeter that must not escape, and Ironhide is sent to fight them. Ironhide then battles and defeats Sideways. When Optimus Prime gets word that Ironhide is missing, <b>Ratchet</b> <b>heads</b> out to find him and get him to safety. After locating Ironhide, his power is recharged and another Decepticon battle ensues. After annihilating Decepticon troops, Optimus battles Demolishor. Upon his defeat, Demolishor states that [...] "The Fallen shall rise again." ...|$|R
50|$|For several weeks, {{the loss}} of Qwark's {{leadership}} cripples the Rangers. (It is revealed that Drek {{was the reason for}} the other planets disappearance, i.e: he destroyed them) When Ratchet returns to Veldin, he decides to take the blame and quit. Clank urges him to reconsider, as the Blarg are preparing to destroy their final target: planet Umbris, whose destruction will destroy countless other worlds due to a rare orbital convergence. Ratchet deduces the truth: Nefarious, angered by his defeat {{at the hands of the}} Rangers, has been manipulating Drek, using his resources to destroy the galaxy so he can discredit them. With his confidence restored, <b>Ratchet</b> <b>heads</b> to planet Kalebo III, where the Blarg have staged an attack on the headquarters of Gadgetron to acquire its stockpile of advanced weaponry. The company chairman asks him to drive off the attackers in time for an upcoming race championship, with a Holo-Guise as the prize. After winning the device, Ratchet confers with the Rangers before heading to the Deplanetizer.|$|R
50|$|Ratchet {{appears in}} Transformers: Age of Extinction. Five {{years after the}} battle in Chicago the human governments have become fearful of all Transformers and begun hunting all of them down, forcing all of the Autobots to disband and go into hiding, Ratchet included. Ratchet is soon found by human {{soldiers}} and though he tries to escape, he is badly injured. Ratchet tries to reason with James Savoy, leader of the soldiers, but he refuses, revealing he lost a relative in Chicago. Moments later, the Cybertronian mercenary, Lockdown, working with the humans, questions Ratchet for Optimus Prime's location, but Ratchet refuses to give in, resulting in Lockdown tearing out Ratchet's spark, killing the Autobot. Later, his body is disassembled and taken to the KSI research labs {{for use in the}} production of man-made Transformers. While infiltrating the facility, Cade Yeager becomes appalled when he discovers <b>Ratchet's</b> <b>head</b> being melted for raw materials. Ratchet's death deeply affects Optimus who tries to kill the humans who were responsible. Ratchet is avenged when Optimus kills Attinger and Lockdown at the film's climax.|$|R
50|$|Many years later, Ratchet {{became the}} crew {{member of the}} Autobot ship that Omega's body was {{converted}} into prior to it crashing onto Earth. There, Ratchet eventually ran into Lockdown again, having him painfully remember the incident which caused Arcee to lose her memory. During the events that transpired, Ratchet retrieved his EMP Generator from Lockdown while saving Optimus Prime from him, giving him some closure. However, when Blitzwing and Lugnut came to Earth, Ratchet admitted to Sari, who was against the Autobots leaving the planet in hopes of getting the Deceptions to pursue them, {{that he had no}} intention to see someone else suffer because of their war. After being ordered later by Prime to take away Sari's key, <b>Ratchet</b> <b>heads</b> to the ship and protect the Allspark, but before he could get there, he was ambushed by Blitzwing and Lugnut, the former freezing him before ripping off most of Ratchet's right arm to get the key. After freeing himself, Ratchet reports to Optimus who tells him to enter the ship and protect the Allspark anyway. After making the ship airborne again, Ratchet managed to save Sari from Blackarachnia and then the rest of his team and Issac Sumdac, teaming up with Bumblebee and Prowl to fight Blitzwing.|$|R
40|$|This {{documentary}} {{may as well}} be Verhoeven's film Starship Troopers. Both {{of these}} works are gleefully fabricated, {{and for the most part}} adopted, evidence of a world we have never seen before. Miyazaki's remarkable Japanese animation Mononoke-Hime (Princess Mononoke - possessed princess) portrays a forest world populated by gods and spirits pitted against human characters in a battle over space and resources. The forest is exceedingly lush, filled with massive cedars, miniscule mosses and exquisite flowers scattered with crystal streams and icy pools. Tiny kodama (echoes/kami/spirits) depicted as white humanoids with <b>ratchet</b> <b>heads,</b> gaping black eyes and mouths, playfully dance about the trees and bogs. Enormous boars, wolves, deer and other animal-gods dwell and debate in the clearings and hollows. If there is one thing the animation makes clear, it is that the forest depicted is not ordinary. The protagonist has had to travel too far, the beasts are too large, the trees too astonishing, the scenery too rich for the animation to imply that all forests are like this one. This forest is so much more than the forests most of us have ever experienced that it appears quite unique and particularly vital. Mononoke-hime's forest is the idealization of the primal forest. Hence, it is not implied by the animation that a visit to any forest would result in the kinds of experiences which would be found at this special location. This view of a privileged forest contrasts with the impression given in Miyazaki's earlier animation, Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbour Totoro), in which the implication is that in each forest, even the one behind the central characters' house, live ancient spirits [...] - if one only knows how to find them. It so happens that the forest of Mononoke-hime is not lo [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulic torque {{wrenches}} {{are used for}} tightening large torques with high accuracy. They are used for aviation and heavy machinery assembly and are specialised tools. [...] Their general construction varies depending on manufacturer and torque requirement. Generally they consist {{of at least one}} hydraulic cylinder operating a drive <b>head</b> <b>ratchet.</b> The cylinder extends, pushing the drive head round via the pawls, and then retracts freely over the ratcheting teeth. The process is repeated until the desired torque is met. Smaller hydraulic {{torque wrenches}} have a reaction arm built into the tool, which rests against another fastener or part of the assembly to prevent rotation when torque is being applied. Larger models require other fixing arrangements in order to prevent rotation.|$|R
