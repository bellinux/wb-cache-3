5000|$|A {{public meeting}} at Waipara in August 1982 saw a {{steering}} committee established {{to investigate the}} Weka Pass Railway proposal. There had been interest {{from a number of}} people in preserving part of this old branch line particularly in the scenic Weka Pass. The impetus came from local Waipara people who saw the tourist potential, and railway enthusiasts, many drawn from the Ferrymead Railway. The Society was formally established in November that year. The new group began negotiating with NZ <b>Railways</b> and other <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> purchase track, locomotives, rolling stock and other facilities. In May 1983, the first major public was held. The [...] "Mayfair Festival" [...] was held and featured the Canterbury Railway Societys Manning Wardle NO 1841 of 1914, and Fowler NO 16246 of 1924 from the Canterbury Steam Preservation Society, along with rakes of LA and LC [...] "high-side" [...] wagons, full of passengers. Shuttles ran from the old Waipara yard to the the 3km straight.|$|R
5000|$|A MoU {{was signed}} in New Delhi on 14 February 2013 between the Ministry of Railways and the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF), the French {{national}} railways, for technical cooperation {{in the field of}} <b>railways.</b> The <b>parties</b> agreed <b>to</b> carry out jointly an [...] "operations and development" [...] feasibility project on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor. The project was funded by the SNCF with support from the French Ministry of Finance. In March 2013, the Railway Board decided to drop the Mumbai-Pune section and operate the high-speed rail service only between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The Board took the decision due to financial constraints, because the ghat section between Pune and Mumbai would escalate the budget for the project. According to V.A. Malegaonkar, Chief Public Relations Officer (PRO), Western Railway, [...] "It's basically a Western Railway project and very little portion of Maharashtra was being covered under it. Hence, the Maharashtra government was showing little interest in the project and was also reluctant to bear a financial burden. That is the reason why the Railway Board has decided against including the Pune-Mumbai portion in the high-speed corridor".|$|R

50|$|When the {{decision}} was to be finalized in parliament on 8 October 1992, there was a majority, consisting of the Labor and Conservative parties, that wanted a new main airport. The Labor Party wanted Gardermoen, while the Conservative <b>Party</b> wanted it <b>to</b> be located at Hobøl. The Center Party and Christian Democratic <b>Party</b> wanted <b>to</b> continue with the divided solution, since they were principally opposed to investments that would give growth opportunities in Eastern Norway. The Socialist Left Party (SV) was concerned about how they could {{reduce the amount of}} air traffic, because of its pollution and energy inefficiency. Instead, SV wanted to build high-speed <b>railways.</b> The Progress <b>Party</b> was indifferent <b>to</b> the location, but stated that if a new airport should be built, it should be built, owned and operate by the private sector.|$|R

In Nevada, the state legislature enacted a law making it legal for a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> record a conversation if one <b>party</b> <b>to</b> the conversation consented, but the Nevada Supreme Court issued two judicial opinions changing the law and requiring all <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> consent to the recording of a private conversation for it to be legal.
