500|$|Telugu scholar C. P. Brown has {{proposed}} that Tiruchirappalli {{might be a}} derivative of the word Chiruta-palli meaning [...] "little town". Orientalists Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell have speculated that the name may derive from a rock inscription carved in the 16th century in which Tiruchirappalli is written as Tiru-ssila-palli, meaning [...] "holy-rock-town" [...] in Tamil. Other scholars {{have suggested that the}} name Tiruchirappalli is a <b>rewording</b> of Tiru-chinna-palli, meaning [...] "holy little town".

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>REWOrD,</b> {{an approach}} to compute seman-tic relatedness between entities in the Web of Data repre-senting real word concepts. <b>REWOrD</b> exploits the graph na-ture of RDF data and the SPARQL query language to ac-cess this data. Through simple queries, <b>REWOrD</b> constructs weighted vectors keeping the informativeness of RDF predi-cates used to make statements about the entities being com-pared. The most informative path is also considered to fur-ther refine informativeness. Relatedness is then computed by the cosine of the weighted vectors. Differently from previ-ous approaches based on Wikipedia, <b>REWOrD</b> does not require any preprocessing or custom data transformation. Indeed, it can leverage whatever RDF knowledge base {{as a source of}} background knowledge. We evaluated <b>REWOrD</b> in different settings by using a new dataset of real word entities and in-vestigate its flexibility. As compared to related work on clas-sical datasets, <b>REWOrD</b> obtains comparable results while, on one side, it avoids the burden of preprocessing and data trans-formation and, on the other side, it provides more flexibility and applicability in a broad range of domains. ...|$|R

500|$|Other {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of <b>rewording.</b> Francisco Ayala argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander similarly {{argued that the}} modern concept of biological 'function' depends on natural selection. So, for example, {{it is not possible}} to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr likewise stated that [...] "adaptedness... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal-seeking." ...|$|E
500|$|Themes from Old English literature, and {{specifically}} from Beowulf, shape {{the ancient world}} Bilbo stepped into. Tolkien, a scholar of Beowulf, counted the epic among his [...] "most valued sources" [...] for The Hobbit. Tolkien {{was one of the}} first critics to treat Beowulf as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, and his 1936 lecture [...] is still required in some Old English courses. Tolkien borrowed several elements from Beowulf, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon. [...] Certain descriptions in The Hobbit seem to have been lifted straight out of Beowulf with some minor <b>rewording,</b> such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders. Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in Beowulf. Other specific plot elements and features in The Hobbit that show similarities to Beowulf include the title thief, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug's personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town. Tolkien refines parts of Beowulf plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.|$|E

Kirchberg in der Steiermark and Neumarkt in der Steiermark were merely the product of inserting [...] "der" [...] in the name.

2500|$|While {{turning down}} the {{challenge}} to the title and summary, the California Superior Court {{also found that the}} Yes on 8 campaign had overstated its ballot argument on the measure's impact on public schools and ordered a minor change in wording. The original arguments included a claim that the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage requires teachers to tell their students, as young as kindergarten age, that same-sex marriage is the same as opposite-sex marriage. The court said the Yes on 8 argument was false because instruction on marriage is not required and parents can withdraw their children. The court said the ballot argument could be preserved by <b>rewording</b> it to state that teachers [...] "may" [...] or [...] "could" [...] be required to tell children there is no difference between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court, in a {{unanimous}} opinion written by Chief Justice Melville Fuller, held that Congress had {{never intended to}} divide South Carolina into separate judicial districts. The language adopted in 1874 had not been enacted by Congress, but was merely a <b>rewording</b> of a previous statute which had been enacted in 1823. The 1823 statute was referenced in {{the margin of the}} 1874 act, and had stated: [...] "The district of South Carolina is divided into two divisions, which will be called the eastern and western divisions of the district of South Carolina". The Supreme Court found that [...] "Congress... seems to have construed the act of 1823, not as dividing the State into two judicial districts, as indicated in the title of the act, but into two districts in the sense of geographical divisions, which is in harmony with the language used {{in the body of the}} act".|$|E
2500|$|Damasus had {{instructed}} Jerome {{to be conservative}} in his revision of the Old Latin Gospels, {{and it is possible}} to see Jerome's obedience to this injunction in the preservation in the Vulgate of variant Latin vocabulary for the same Greek terms. Hence, [...] "high priest" [...] is rendered [...] in Vulgate Matthew; as [...] in Vulgate Mark; and as [...] in Vulgate John. Comparison of Jerome's Gospel texts with those in Old Latin witnesses, suggests that his revision was substantially concerned with redacting the expanded phraseology characteristic of the Western text-type, in accordance with early Byzantine and Alexandrian witnesses. [...] One major change introduced by Jerome was to re-order the Latin Gospels. Old Latin gospel books generally followed the [...] "Western Order" [...] – Matthew, John, Luke, Mark; where Jerome adopted the [...] "Greek Order" [...] – Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. [...] It appears that he followed this order in his programme of work; as his revisions become progressively less frequent and less consistent in the gospels presumably done later. [...] In places Jerome adopted readings that did not correspond to a straightforward rendering either of the Old Latin or the Greek text, so reflecting a particular doctrinal interpretation; as in his <b>rewording</b> panem nostrum supersubstantialem at [...]|$|E
