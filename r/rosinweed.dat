50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, {{the most obvious}} {{features}} of the tallgrass prairie are tall grasses, such as indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), which average between 1.5 and 2 m tall, with occasional stalks as high as 2.5 to 3 m. Prairies also include {{a large percentage of}} forbs, such as lead plant (Amorpha spp.), prairie <b>rosinweed</b> (Silphium spp.), gayfeathers (Liatris spp.), sunflowers (Helianthus spp.), asters (Aster and Symphyotrichum spp.), coneflowers (Echinacea spp., and Rudbeckia spp.), and many other species.|$|E

40|$|AbstrAct A 0. 5 -ha Illinois prairie was {{restored}} in 1988. By 2005 the site increased in traits indicative {{of high quality}} remnant prairies. Weighted Mean Fidelity {{and the proportion of}} native species increased over time. Exotic weeds (e. g. smooth brome [Bromus inermis], dandelion [Taraxacum officinale], black medic [Medicago lupulina], and Kentucky bluegrass [Poa pratensis]) became less frequent and high quality species (purple coneflower [Echinacea pallida], purple prairie clover [Dalea purpurea], stiff goldenrod [Solidago rigida], and rattlesnake master [Eryngium yuccifolium]) increased in frequency. After deer hunting began in 1994, stiff goldenrod and <b>rosinweed</b> had smaller proportions of their stems browsed by deer. Mean Coefficient of Conservatism was similar to a local high quality remnant prairie...|$|E
40|$|Seeds from 10 prairie {{plant species}} of burned and {{unburned}} portions of three tallgrass prairies were collected and tested for germinability. Germination of big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) consistently averaged higher with burning. Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans L.) and sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr. ] averaged 5 % higher with burning {{on two of}} the three sites, although for indiangrass average germination for all three sites was 7 % lower. Species for which germination declined with burning were false sunflower [Heliopsis helianthoides (L.) Sweet var. scabra (Dun.) Fern. ], - 13 %; whole leaf <b>rosinweed</b> (Silphium integrifolium Michx.), - 10 %; and white prairieclover (Dalea candida Michx. ex Willd.), - 4 %. For all species combined, burning also delayed peak germination and extended the length of time of germination...|$|E
40|$|Twenty seven {{perennial}} species {{native to}} the Eastern Temperate Forests Level I Ecoregion were exposed to an acute ozone (O 3) treatment consisting of a target peak O 3 concentration of 2. 0 ppm for 30 minutes in a closed chamber environment, {{during the summer of}} 2010. Plants were evaluated for visible foliar injury symptoms and symptoms were described and photographically documented. Ten of the 27 species developed visible foliar injury in which interspecific and intraspecific response to O 3 was observed. A severity index was used to compare response to acute ozone exposure for the ten species displaying visible foliar injury. Species showing visible foliar injury in descending order of severity index were Coreopsis tripteris L. (tall tickseed), Coreopsis palmata Nutt. (stiff tickseed), Penstemon cobaea Nutt. (cobaea beardtongue), Solidago nemoralis Aiton (gray goldenrod), Monarda fistulosa L. (wild bergamot), Silphium integrifolium Michx (wholeleaf <b>rosinweed),</b> Oligoneuron rigidum (L.) Small var. rigidum (stiff goldenrod), Rudbeckia missouriensis Engelm. ex C. L. Boynt. (Missouri orange coneflower), Penstemon pallidus Small (pale beardtongue), and Solidago speciosa Nutt. (showy goldenrod). A range of symptoms was observed including red to purple stipple and tan to yellow or brown flecking; bronzing, leaf margin necrosis, and bifacial necrotic lesions. Subsequently, in June of 2011, four native Coreopsis species (C. lanceolata, C. palmata, C. tinctoria, and C. tripteris), were exposed to four acute ozone (O 3) treatment levels with target peak O 3 concentrations of 1. 2, 1. 7, 2. 2, and 2. 7 ppm, for 30 minutes in a closed chamber environment. Severity index was used as the criterion for comparing ozone susceptibilities among species. All four species showed foliar injury symptoms following the highest target peak exposure level (2. 7 ppm). Two of the four species (Coreopsis palmata and C. tripteris) exhibited foliar injury symptoms at the lowest target peak exposure level (1. 2 ppm). Symptoms varied among species in the study but were generally uniform within each taxon. Coreopsis lanceolata showed the highest degree of ozone tolerance relative to the other three species in the study. Both Coreopsis palmata and C. tripteris developed visible foliar symptoms at the lowest treatment level (1. 2 ppm) indicating ozone susceptibility relative to the other species...|$|E
