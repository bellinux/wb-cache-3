25|$|While islet {{transplantation}} {{research has}} made important progress {{and the success}} stories are encouraging, the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure remain unclear. Other concerns <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> include questions {{about the impact of}} having insulin-producing foreign cells within the hepatic parenchyma, the long-term consequences of elevated portal pressures resulting from the islet infusion, and the fact that islet recipients can be sensitized against donor tissue types, making it more difficult to find a suitable donor should another life-saving transplant be required in the future. Also, very few islet transplant recipients have remained euglycemic without the use of any exogenous insulin beyond four years post-transplant. Thus, while most islet recipients achieve better glycemia control and suffer less serious hypoglycemia, islet transplantation continues to fall short of the definitive diabetes cure.|$|E

50|$|In fictional works, a force field, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} an energy shield, force shield, defence shield or deflector shield, is a barrier made of energy or particles. It protects a person, area, or object from attacks or intrusions. This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without mass {{that acts as a}} wall, so that objects affected by the particular force <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side. This concept has become a staple of many science-fiction works, so much so that authors frequently do not even bother to explain or justify them to their readers treating them almost as established fact.|$|E

Part of Laughton's motivation is sheer Christian charity, but there's also a more fundamental message he wants to convey to his academic colleagues. He says, [...] "The industrial revolution happened because of craftsmen-inventors... It did not spring from the minds of university-educated people. For too long have we worshipped at the altar of paper qualifications to the exclusion of a wider view. We must recognise the enormous value of the true innovator in effecting the technical changes in society which create real wealth." ...|$|E
