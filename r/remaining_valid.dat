In this period, she excavated no less than six hillforts; and it is her work in the field of hillfort studies which is considered some of her most influential. Hownam Rings (1948), in particular, became the type-site for hillfort development, known as the Hownam Paradigm, <b>remaining</b> <b>valid</b> to this day.

5000|$|The {{main goal}} of a data quality process {{consists}} in capturing erroneous and invalid data, processing them and eliminating duplicates and, lastly, exporting valid data to the user without failing to store a back-up copy into the database.

It enables packets to pass through specified ports by filtering out data that present quality issues and allowing the <b>remaining,</b> <b>valid</b> data to be stored in the database.

5000|$|After the <b>remaining</b> <b>valid</b> area codes {{were used}} up by expansion, in 1995 the rapid {{increase}} in {{the need for more}} area codes (both splits and overlays) forced NANPA to allow the digits 2 through 8 {{to be used as a}} middle digit in new area code assignments, with 9 being reserved as a [...] "last resort" [...] for potential future expansion. At the same time, local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit. The first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were area code 334 in Alabama and area code 360 in Washington, which both began service on January 15, 1995. This was quickly followed by area code 520 serving Arizona on March 19, 1995.|$|E

50|$|The late 1970s brought two {{important}} changes. First, the old nationalists, {{who had run}} the newspaper {{as a kind of}} public trust, began to disappear. Second, the economic climate in India and in Kerala began to become more unapologetically capitalist. Mathrubhumi, which under its old regime was a Kerala institution and also an effectively run business, came {{to be seen as a}} valuable asset. Its control could provide wealth - and certainly provided influence and prestige. Shares in Mathrubhumi began to be traded in a way that was inconceivable 10 years earlier. Indeed, when the share book was tidied up in the mid-1980s, it was found that there were dozens of partly paid-up shares whose owners were long dead or unknown.

The headliners were Idlewild on Sunday, and Garth Hudson (formerly of The Band) on Saturday, backed by a group including his wife Maud on lead vocals, and members of Goldrush and Grand Drive. Other artists on the bill included Glenn Tilbrook, Goldrush, Brakes, The Electric Soft Parade, John Power, Pull Tiger Tail, Metronomy and Grand Drive.

5000|$|In 1964, the American R&B {{group the}} Isley Brothers {{recorded}} a song titled [...] "Love Is a Wonderful Thing".

Bolton's song contained similarities to the song by the Isleys that exceeded the title: in 1994, a jury found songwriters Bolton and Goldmark, along with Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Bolton's label, Columbia Records), liable for copyright infringement due to multiple similarities between the two songs and ordered them to pay the Isleys all profits earned from the single plus 28% of the album profits, which amounted to over US$5 millions. On May 9, 2000, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, an appellate court covering the western regions of the U.S., affirmed the jury's decision, {{which is one of}} the largest monetary sums to be awarded in a case such as this.

40|$|International audienceA {{method for}} failure {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) for redundant aircraft sensors is presented. The outputs of the concerned sensors {{are involved in}} the computation of §ight control laws, and the objective is to eliminate any fault before propagation in the control loop when selecting a unique §ight parameter among a set (generally, three) of redundant measurements. The particular case of an oscillatory failure is investigated. The proposed method allows an accurate FDI of erroneous sensor and computes a consolidated parameter based on the fusion of data from <b>remaining</b> <b>valid</b> sensors. The bene¦ts of the presented method are to enhance the data fusion process with FDI techniques which improve the performance of the fusion when only few sources (less than three) are initially valid...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The errors {{usually made}} by authors during text {{preparation}} are classified. The notion of semantic errors is elaborated, and malapropisms are pointed among them as “similar ” to the intended word but essentially distorting {{the meaning of}} the text. For whatever method of malapropism correction, we propose to beforehand compile dictionaries of paronyms, i. e. of words similar to each other in letters, sounds or morphs. The proposed classification of errors and paronyms is illustrated by English and Russian examples <b>remaining</b> <b>valid</b> for many languages. Specific dictionaries of literal and morphemic paronyms are compiled for Russian. It is shown that literal paronyms drastically cut down (up to 340 times) the search of correction candidates, while morphemic paronyms permit to correct errors characteristic for foreigners and not studied so far...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{changes in}} pupil size were {{recorded}} by infrared pupillographic methods {{in response to}} light flashes of different durations and intensities for a 13 degree 34 minute centrally fixated circular field. For such stimuli, the threshold intensities for (rod) vision and for the pupil response {{were found to be}} about the same. The response amplitudes were related to the logarithm of the flash energy, the reciprocity law <b>remaining</b> <b>valid</b> up to about one-half second. The curve relating flash energy and pupil response was clearly divisible into two parts commensurate with the duplex character of the human retina. A similar dichotomy appears in curves relating response amplitude to response latency. Since the pupil response is determined by total flash energy, intense long flashes produce larger pupil responses than shorter (and perceptually brighter) ones of the same intensity...|$|E
