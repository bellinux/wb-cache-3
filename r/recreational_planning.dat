40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> and open space rarely, if ever, incorporates the demographic and social factors {{of a given}} geographically defined area. This thesis investigates the complex demographic, social and behavioral characteristics of leisure and recreation in the contemporary American industrial society and relates the theory to <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> in an applicable fashion. "The Social and Behavioral Characteristics of Recreational Facility Planning" also investigates the more or less accepted <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> standards as diverse scales of development and applies these standards to a contemporary case study example of a "new town" of 150, 000 people in the Houston Region, presently being planned under the Title VII provision of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, which guarantees federal assistance in planning and development. In the thesis a new conceptual approach to <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> of both facilities and open space areas is formulated and then applied to two hypothetical communities, both of 150, 000 population in the Houston Region and to the case study example of the Tide VII "new town. " The case study example is then compared to the two hypothetical communities using the formulated theoretical approach {{and then to the}} application. of the case study example using the traditional planning approach on the basis of satisfied recreational needs, land allocation, land preservation, economic investment and method validity. The most evident conclusion that has been revealed by my thesis, is that the {{traditional approach}} to <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> does not allow for the differentiation of recreational facilities on the basis of age, income or ethnic background, which I have found to have a great bearing on the type and number of recreational facilities allocated in a given area. Finally, the thesis concludes by summarizing my findings based on both the traditional planning approach and the formulated theoretical planning approach while making recommendations for future <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> and research...|$|E

This zoning exercise reflects the statutory requirements of existing management plans and the application of <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> principles. The ‘restricted ’ zone provides for high levels of natural quiet with aircraft use permitted only for management purposes, the effective removal of large numbers of wild animals and, in some very limited situations, commercial use.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demands for}} outdoor recreation have caused widespread ecological damage {{in many parts}} of the world, so that methods to contain deleterious impacts and maintain the quality of recreational experience must be earnestly sought. This paper evaluates a spectrum of relevant options including the subtle (influencing user-behaviour), through the intermediate (redistributing use), to the regulatory (rationing use). The reduction of per caput impact can, naturally, raise the capacity of an area to accommodate continuing use. Minimum impact techniques can substantially curtail the largely inadvertent damage due to ignorance rather than malice, while <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> and management can take into account the changing user preference. Redistributing use can lessen impacts in over-used or vulnerable areas and reduce user conflicts. Various subtle measures can effect voluntary spread over space and time. As even low-level usage can cause significant ecological changes, the risk of spreading damage should be carefully gauged against management objectives. Rationing use, which erodes the spontaneity of recreational pursuits, should be used only as a last resort. A range of methods are assessed, none being considered ideal. -from Authorlink_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{environmental}} planning and design, planners and designers often engage in various projects, residential planning, <b>recreational</b> <b>planning,</b> open space planning and design etc. based upon the natural landscape. But in accomplishing these projects, a series of planning, design and construction processes occur, which give rise to environmental destruction and many serious social problems. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to assess the impact which residential development, recreational development etc. with the resultant changes in the land will have on the natural environment. Microclimate, surface and underground water, geology, small animals, vegetation, landscape, cultural resources beneath the surface etc. are considered to be the items of the natural environment which such projects will generally affect. There are very few studies which discuss environmental analysis and environmental impact assessment in respect of environmental planning and design. This study sets out to analyze the landscape changes in development sites and to assess the environmental impact on the surrounding areas from a visual aspect. As an analysis and assessment tool, a visible and an invisible concept and appearance model of landscape change were developed through topographical investigation and appraisal.

40|$|The {{importance}} of understanding park planning issues and implementing planning strategies for ageing adults was {{the driving force}} for this study. Literature reviews have identified a variety of scholarly work from fields such as gerontology, psychology, sociology and economics, all of which provide valuable information regarding {{the special needs of}} ageing adults. Very few researchers, however, have investigated the leisure behaviours of older adults in outdoor recreation (Croskeys, Tinsley and Tinsley, 2002) and the use of grounded theory methodology has essentially been unexplored in this area. Ageing adults are projected to live more than 20 percent of their life in retirement (MRP, 1998, cited in Croskeys, Tinsley and Tinsley, 2002), allowing for an increased amount of discretionary time. This offers opportunities for ageing adults to participate in outdoor recreational activities and will undoubtedly increase their leisure time. However, with limited research in recreational needs and inclusion for older adults, it is difficult for park planners and administrators to meet the growing needs of this population. Therefore, this research is necessary in order to determine whether ageing adults are being accounted for in park and outdoor <b>recreational</b> <b>planning.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} use grounded theory research methodology to identify and examine ageing adult needs in relation to outdoor leisure activities in a regional park setting.

40|$|The Hanmer Forest {{was one of}} {{the first}} Government owned exotic forests, being {{established}} around the turn of the century. It is situated 135 km north of Christchurch. The park consists of exotic plantations and native vegetation, from beech remnants in the lower slopes of the Hanmer Range to sub-alpine vegetation along the tops. Hanmer Forest Park was gazetted in 1978. Thus the area is managed for a range of functions, including soil and water conservatlon, recreation and timber production. The recreational side of the forest is still being developed and upgraded. The recent introduction of Recreation Operations Planning System (ROPS) is expected to help with co-ordination of recreational facility developments and maintenance in order to provide an improved recreational experience. From the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) we see that recreation planning has three key elements: activities, settings and experiences. In relation to these, there exists recreation desires and the opportunities that are provided by managers. These are linked through recreation planning. A user survey gives some objective information of demand and resource capability as visitors see it. It can also be used to get user input into management. It is important for the management of the park to have a knowledge of the types of user of the park, and also their reaction to facilities, services and changes that are made in the park. Surveys provide objective information on the desires of users which had previously been subjectively assessed by managers. Hence it is hoped that the information contained in this report can be assimilated into the <b>recreational</b> <b>planning</b> process to better provide the desired experiences...|$|E
