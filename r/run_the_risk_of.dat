Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving {{behavior in the}} presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|Rebellions {{can occur}} if {{the loyalty of}} a {{particular}} province falls too low, with a rebel army appearing in the province to attempt to assume control from the owners. Civil wars may also take place if several generals commanding large armies have sufficiently low loyalty. In {{the event of a}} civil war, the player is given the choice to back either the current rulers or the rebels. It had been planned to allow other factions who had established a prior claim to the throne by marriage to princesses to join in a civil war to claim the throne for themselves; however, this was never implemented. Naval warfare is carried out upon the campaign map, where ships can be built and organised into fleets. These fleets can be used to control the game's sea regions and form sea lanes, allowing trade and troop movement between provinces that have constructed a port. Fleets can engage in sea battles with foreign fleets, although unlike land battles these are resolved by the computer. Religion plays an important aspect in Medieval: Total War, with religious differences between the Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim factions affecting diplomacy and population loyalty. Catholic factions must also respond to the wishes of the Papal States; factions gain favour by refraining from hostilities with other Catholic nations and responding to Crusades, else they <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> excommunication. The option to launch a holy war {{in the form of a}} Crusade or Jihad is open to both Catholic and Muslim factions.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with any}} surgery, {{complications}} may occur. The most common problems a patient <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{because of this}} surgery include infections, reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula. The main infection that a patient <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> is pneumonia. [...] Pneumothorax occurs when there is air trapped between the lung and the chest wall. This {{can lead to the}} patients lung collapsing. [...] A bronchopleural fistula is when there is a tube like opening that allows air to escape. Before surgery takes place, all risks should be discussed with a doctor.|$|R

25|$|In practice, most mathematicians {{either do}} not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the {{consistency}} of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans are}} {{controversial}} {{because they would}} mean {{the loss of the}} minimalist appearance of the building, the clarity of the layout and public spaces in the building. The closure of Secklow Gate was even proposed, removing the rooftop loading facility that is such an important feature of the building.

25|$|Medical devices {{often include}} fan-cooled heat sinks, to cool their {{electronic}} components. While these systems sometimes include HEPA filters to collect microbes, some pathogens do pass through these filters, collect inside the device and are eventually blown out and infect other patients. Devices used in operating rooms rarely include fans, {{so as to}} minimize the chance of transmission. Also, medical equipment, high-end computers, swimming pools, drinking-water systems and other products that utilize liquid lines <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> biofouling as biological growth occurs inside them.|$|E
25|$|Paternity {{confusion}} is proposed {{to be an}} adaptive function for preventing infanticide. Thus, if the female can successfully create paternity confusion, males will {{be less likely to}} kill her offspring, as the lack of paternity certainty means that they <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> killing their own genetic offspring. Additionally, the males, in turn, are likely to protect the same female's offspring from infanticide that may be committed by other adults within the species. Once again, this is because they are uncertain about paternity, and aim to protect infants that are genetically their own.|$|E

He was detained for ten months. After being released, he eventually fled to France, as the PA continued to harass him, and citizens called for him to be lynched. He later found out he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in absentia.|$|E

Here a clear difference {{can be seen to}} the situation of homosexuality. The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless, it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.|$|E
25|$|The Russian mission {{coincided with}} the advent of fascism in Italy, and Gramsci {{returned}} with instructions to foster, against the wishes of the PCI leadership, a united front of leftist parties against fascism. Such a front would ideally have had the PCI at its centre, through which Moscow would have controlled all the leftist forces, but others disputed this potential supremacy: socialists did have a certain tradition in Italy, too, while the Communist Party seemed relatively young and too radical. Many believed that an eventual coalition led by communists would have functioned too remotely from political debate, and thus would have <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> isolation.|$|E
25|$|A Folk Tale {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the archetypal dilemma of the folk ballad, {{the transition from}} one home to another {{in the context of}} a wedding, where both men and women <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> getting into difficulties. The men might be lured under a spell by elves and the women might be carried off by disguised nixes and it always happens in an outdoor, natural environment, which is both compelling and mysterious. Both the elves and the nixes exert a demonic and erotic power over the victims and in most cases have a fateful impact on them - many end in the grave.|$|E
