40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation {{has been}} using the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) <b>Roughometer</b> {{as part of its}} detour {{analysis}} process for more than 20 years. Advances in technology have made the BPR <b>Roughometer</b> obsolete for ride quality testing. High-speed profilers that can collect the profile of the road at highway speeds are the standard ride instruments for determining ride quality on pavements. The objective of the project was to develop a correlation between the BPR <b>Roughometer</b> and the high-speed laser South Dakota type Profiler (SD Profiler). Nineteen pavement sections were chosen to represent the range of types and conditions for detours. Three computer simulation models were tested on the profiler profiles. The first model is the International Ride Index (IRI) which is considered the standard index for reporting ride quality in the United States. The second model is the Ride Number (RN) developed by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the third model used is a quarter-car simulation of the BPR <b>Roughometer</b> (ASTM E- 1170) which should match the speed and range of roadway features experienced by Iowa's BPR <b>Roughometer</b> Unit. The BPR <b>Roughometer</b> quarter-car model provided the best overall correlation with Iowa's BPR <b>Roughometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|The BPR type <b>Roughometer</b> {{has been}} used by the Iowa State Highway Commission since 1955 for the {{evaluation}} of the relative roughness of the various Iowa road surfaces. Since the commencement of this program, standardized information about the roughness of the various Iowa roads with respect to their type, construction, location and usage has been obtained. The <b>Roughometer</b> has also served to improve the economics and quality of road construction by making the roughness results of various practices available to all who are interested. In 1965, the Portland Cement Association developed a device known as the PCA Road Meter for measuring road roughness. Mounted in a regular passenger car, the Road Meter is a simple electromechanical device of durable construction which can perform consistently with extremely low maintenance. In 1967, the Iowa State Highway Commission's Laboratory constructed a P. C. A. type Road Meter in order to provide an efficient and reliable method for measuring the Present Serviceability Index for the state's highways. Another possibility was that after considerable testing the Road Meter might eventually replace the <b>Roughometer.</b> Some advantages of the Road Meter over the <b>Roughometer</b> are: (1) Road Meter tests are made by the automobile driver and one assistant without the need of traffic protection. The <b>Roughometer</b> has a crew of four men; two operating the <b>roughometer</b> and two driving safety vehicles. (2) The Road Meter is able to do more miles of testing because of its faster testing speed and the fa. ct that it is the only vehicle involved in the testing. (3) Because of the faster testing speed, the Road Meter gives a better indication of how the road actually rides to the average highway traveler. (4) The cost of operating a Road Meter is less than that of a <b>Roughometer</b> because of the fewer number of vehicles and men needed in testing...|$|E
30|$|During {{the cutting}} test, the {{dynamometer}} (Kistler- 9272) {{was used to}} measure the cutting force real timely. The surface roughness values of as-machined workpieces were measured by a portable surface <b>roughometer</b> (MITUTOYO SJ- 210). The tool failure appeared as the reduction of the machining quality, so the tool lifetime was approximately defined as the milling length when the machining quantity deteriorates, specifically, as the surface roughness Rz value of the workpiece reaches 1.6 μm. Besides, several typical failure modes were presented, based on worn morphologies examined by the FESEM.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} of abrasive waterjet technology was investigated {{as a method}} to polish Z-blocks of synthetic quartz crystals. The polished surfaces were characterized by surface <b>roughometer</b> and scanning electron microscopy. The main factors affecting the surface roughness and the erosion mechanisms related to material removal were analysed. It is found that abrasive mesh, water pressure and jet incidence angle are the main factors affecting the surface roughness. By contrast, the influence of traverse speed on the surface roughness is small. Under certain controlled conditions, the erosion mechanisms of synthetic quartz crystals are plastic flow, leaving a crack-free surface by low-middle pressure micro abrasive waterjet...|$|E
30|$|The surface {{roughness}} of THM wood samples was recorded by a surface <b>roughometer</b> (TIME 3230, Time, Beijing) with a display resolution of 0.01 µm. Specimens of 40 [*]×[*] 40  mm squares were cut and then sanded with 240 -grit sand paper for 30  s. A Gaussian filter with a cut-off wavelength of 0.8  mm {{was used to}} transform the data. Several roughness parameters were used as the indicators of {{surface roughness}}: Ra (mean roughness), Rt (maximum height of the profile), and Rz (mean peak-to-valley height). Four specimens were sampled randomly from different samples for each group and three measurements of surface roughness were taken per specimen. The surface roughness of untreated wood sample was measured as a reference.|$|E

30|$|However, {{the surface}} {{properties}} of THM wood—high temperatures {{as well as}} elevated pressure for a long time—are less studied. The physical and chemical changes generated by THM process, such as the hydrophobicity on the treated wood surface, may affect the microstructure, color, and wettability of wood composite materials. Therefore, the surface cell morphology of THM wood in relation with the four degrees of compression ratio (CR) was also characterized accordingly. To achieve the aims of surface characterization of the THM wood, surface <b>roughometer,</b> scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed in this study. Color determination, time-dependent contact angle measurements, and surface free energy calculation were also carried out. These analyses provide insights into the changes in surface characteristics of THM poplar wood and the technical support for the subsequent processing of wood-based composite materials.|$|E
40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} is {{a highly}} developed and cheap method of manufacturing reliable materials, either metallic, ceramic or composite. This process was used to make green compacts of iron powders with a high porosity level. This study {{is part of a}} project aimed at describing the relationships between mechanical properties and morphological features of such compacts, with particular attention paid to the shape of the grains and the compaction pressure. In this report, a method is proposed to separate the intra grain porosity from the cavities located between particles. The approach is based on the covariogram of images obtained {{from the surface of the}} compacts by means of a laser <b>roughometer.</b> To achieve this separation, a model of the structure is proposed which assumes that the distributions of the grains and of the intra-particle cavities are random and independent. Each distribution is characterized by two parameters. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between experimental and calculated covariograms after identification of these parameters...|$|E
40|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Federal Highway Administration FHWA to the local community were clarified that {{the single most important}} factor affecting the ride quality was pavement roughness. From previous study, it shown that pavement roughness have an infuences towards the comfort of the driver, fuel efficiency, safety, and vehicle maintenance. Therefore, to improve the driving conditions of the highway system, pavement roughness should be addressed with priority. Numerous studies have shown that initial pavement roughness greatly affects ftiture roughness and roughness progression. Thus in this study, specifically investigates the impact of operating speed on pavement roughness. Considering the importance of pavement roughness towards riding comfort, it is imperative to study the factors from traffic engineering perspective such as crucial traffic parameters that involved to the pavement roughness. The goal of the study is to evaluate the operating speed with regards to pavement roughness, obtained from the actual speed of vehicles generally operates on the road and other traffic engineering parameters. The objectives of this study are to perform survey of road profiling in order to measure pavement roughness by incorporating International Roughness Index (IRI) index, to evaluate operating speed with regards to pavement roughness with the installation of Automatic Traffic Counter (ATC), to develop several models those are able to relate traffic engineering parameters with regards to pavement roughness (IRI index),and finally to validate the models and perform sensitivity analysis in order to check the sensitivity of each significant parameters. The scope {{of this study is to}} explore the traffic engineering parameters such as 85 th percentile speed and space mean speed with regard to road roughness profiling of JKR R 5 Design Standard of straight road within 5 zones in Selangor state. In this research, road tubes are used for gathering the data of traffic parameters where every single vehicle that passed through the tubes will create a pulse and count using the Trax Appollyon as machine counter. <b>Roughometer</b> III was used in this research to perform a survey of road profiling using International Roughness Index (IRI). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop a statistical relationship between operating speeds and road roughness index. In the validation stage, the empirical data were compared with the predicted data using the paired T-test statistic and discrepancy measure such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Finally, the models have successfully developed and validated according to the established statistical procedures in the study. The findings are hoped to provide as a starting point towards the development of a national standard for predicting operating speed with regards to the pavement roughness...|$|E
