There was a simple ingenious safety OFF switch, using a magnet that connected two electrical terminals across a point, located close by the engine's surface watertight hatch. The rider would attach a strap to his ankle with a flexible wire line to the magnet. When he fell off, it would stop the engine.|$|E

5000|$|Continuous-flow {{dampening}} systems (direct or indirect), {{are used}} by most newer presses today {{because they do not}} have the slow reaction time of intermittent-flow dampening systems. They do not employ the water ductor roller but use the water slip roller (a roller in contact with both the water fountain roller and a distribution roller, contrary to the water ductor roller that moves back and forth between the two) for a continuous flow. The speed of the water slip <b>roller</b> <b>controls</b> the supply. The use of alcohol on these type of dampeners was standard for years. Alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) was used as it increased the water viscosity and made it [...] "more wettable" [...] so that transfer was easier from one roller to the other. However, alcohol substitutes such as glycol ethers, butyl cellusolve, etc., are being used today to accomplish the same task because alcohol contains volatile organic compounds. Roller hardness is also being changed to help accomplish the same job—easy transfer of the water.|$|R

25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front <b>rollers,</b> and <b>controlling</b> the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of <b>rollers</b> with <b>controlled</b> fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|R

40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass. Plate glass and automotive glass can be successfully recycled into construction aggregate or other secondary markets if the glass can {{be separated from the}} film. Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment. Best Practice: Systems are now available to crush windshields and screen film plastic residuals in a turnkey system. In one system, compression feed rollers are used to guide windshields through a processing system at a predetermined rate and physical orientation. The system is 70 inches long, 50 inches wide and 56 inches high. The input opening is up to 43 inches and drive components include a 10 horsepower motor, solid steel shaft, 40 hammers constructed of flailing arms made from hardened steel, 2 inch heavy duty isolated bearings, and two- ten inch compression feed <b>rollers.</b> <b>Controlled</b> feed is necessary because flexible impactors are used to flail the glass off the plastic membrane, while keeping plastic pieces as large as possible for removal during screening...|$|R

Prior to 2005, The Raven was operated manually by the ride operator, who had to push a button to release the brakes and position the train in the station. This type of control system allowed the ride to be operated by a single ride operator. In 2005, an automatic control system was added. The automatic control system automatically controls braking, positioning, and the block system, which prevents the two trains from colliding with each other. This type of control system also necessitates that two ride operators be present to dispatch the train from the station.|$|R

40|$|In elastohydrodynamic lubrication, the {{oil film}} {{thickness}} of <b>rollers</b> is <b>controlled</b> by {{the rate at}} which the oil is drawn into the conjunction of the disks by the moving surfaces of the rollers. The theory often assumes isothermal conditions in the inlet, although it can be shown that the maximum shear rate often exceeds 1, 000, 000 per sec, even in pure rolling. A theoretical analysis is presented for the oil temperature rise in the inlet of rollers, and the result is applied to predict the consequent film thickness. It is found that thermal effects on film thickness are only negligible at low rolling speeds. A comparison with experiment supports the conclusion that the thinning of the film thickness below that predicted by isothermal theory is substantially explained by inlet shear heating of the lubricant...|$|R

40|$|A new {{peel test}} method has been {{developed}} for allowing debonding of adhesively bonded, thin metallic substrates. The rolling of the substrates on <b>rollers</b> allows <b>control</b> of the plastic dissipation during substrate bending and prevents dissipation associated with substrate unbending. The measured debonding toughness is shown to be independent of substrate thickness when proper account is taken of the work required for straining the adhesive layer. Mechanical analysis shows that control of plastic dissipation in substrates remains effective, {{as long as the}} ratio of the plate thickness to the roller radius is large enough to prevent wound-up. Mode mixity during debonding can be conveniently modified by changing the radii of the rollers. This possibility of altering mode mixity allows a better control of the occurrence of the cohesive, or near-interfacial debonding mechanisms. Evidence is given {{for the fact that the}} debonding mechanism is not governed by the minimum in the debonding toughness. A significant increase of debonding toughness with increasing mode mixity is observed only when the substrate roughness is high...|$|R
