40|$|International audienceA mobile {{telephone}} user's {{exposure to the}} radio-frequency electromagnetic field depends heavily on the power their telephone radiates, which can vary widely according to requests from the base station. This study presents the design and development of a system called SYstem for Radiated POwer Measurement (SYRPOM), which measures the power radiated by a {{mobile telephone}}. This study also describes the tests carried out on the system itself and gives the results of two measuring campaigns it has been possible to perform in this way. The first such campaign consisted of assessing the <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> received by a typical mobile telephone user carrying out various activities. The second campaign was aimed at (1) comparing the <b>mean</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> when stationary and when moving and (2) assessing and contrasting different models of handsets {{in terms of the}} <b>mean</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>power.</b> The SYRPOM {{has proved to be a}} flexible, easy-to-use high-performance and innovative tool for carrying out this kind of studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanisms of}} excess attenuation are analyzed {{on the basis}} of a one-dimensional time-independent model of propagation in a random medium. Attenuation is regarded as the rate of decrease in the mean intensity and the mean energy flux within a propagation range. A source function is assumed to be determinate, appropriate statistical properties are chosen for the sound speed, and specified statistical properties are found for the wave functions, i. e., the mean intensity and the mean energy flux. The medium is considered to be weakly homogeneous, and expansions are developed for the intensity and mean energy flux, along with an attenuation coefficient in two parts, the second of which defines the excess attenuation. The <b>mean</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> is defined, and backscattering by the random inhomogeneities in the medium is modeled as redistributing the mean intensity and energy flux, with a resultant decay which occurs more quickly than with randomness...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the <b>mean</b> RF <b>power</b> <b>radiated</b> by mobile {{telephones}} during voice calls in 3 G VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) using an application well known to mobile Internet users, and to compare it with the <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> <b>radiated</b> during voice calls in 3 G VoCS (Voice over Circuit Switch) on a traditional network. Knowing that the specific absorption rate (SAR) is proportional to the <b>mean</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>power,</b> the user's exposure could be clearly identified at the same time. Three 3 G (High Speed Packet Access) smartphones from three different manufacturers, all dual-band for GSM (900 MHz, 1800 MHz) and dual-band for UMTS (900 MHz, 1950 MHz), were used between 28 July and 04 August 2011 in Paris (France) to make 220 two-minute calls on a mobile telephone network with national coverage. The places where the calls were made were selected in such a way as to describe the whole range of usage situations of the mobile telephone. The measuring equipment, called “SYRPOM”, recorded the radiation power levels and the frequency bands used during the calls with a sampling rate of 20, 000 per second. In the framework of this study, the <b>mean</b> normalised <b>power</b> <b>radiated</b> by a telephone in 3 G VoIP calls was evaluated at 0. 75 % maximum power of the smartphone, compared with 0. 22 % in 3 G VoCS calls. The very low average power levels associated with use of 3 G devices with VoIP or VoCS support the view that RF exposure resulting from their use is far from exceeding the basic restrictions of current exposure limits in terms of SAR...|$|R

Methods: Fifty patients with atrial septal defect (ASD) type secundum (20 open, 30 closed) were enrolled. All underwent standard echocardiography, a bicycle stress echocardiography, and symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was calculated {{as the product of}} RV cardiac output and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP).

Results: RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was linearly related with oxygen uptake (VO 2) in patients with open (R 2 ¼ 0. 88; p< 0. 0001) and closed ASD (R 2 ¼ 0. 90; p< 0. 0001). The increase in RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was steeper in open than in closed ASD patients (p< 0. 0001). The change in RV cardiac output (7. 13. 4 vs. 5. 72. 4 l/min; p¼ 0. 132) was not statistically different, but the change in mPAP (21. 79. 6 vs. 12. 84. 6 mmHg; p< 0. 0001) and RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (0. 970. 56 vs. 0. 530. 22 W; p¼ 0. 009) were higher in patients with an open ASD.

Conclusion: RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> during exercise is higher in patients with an open than in patients with a closed ASD.
