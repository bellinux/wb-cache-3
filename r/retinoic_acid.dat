5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{in the skin}} may {{contribute}} to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|Tretinoin, {{under the}} {{alternative}} name of all-trans <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> (ATRA), {{is used as}} chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia. This is because cells of this subtype of leukemia are sensitive to agonists of the <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptors (RARs).|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{deprived}} rats {{can be kept}} in good {{general health}} with supplementation of <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid.</b> This reverses the growth-stunting effects of vitamin A deficiency, as well as early stages of xerophthalmia. However, such rats show infertility (in both male and females) and continued degeneration of the retina, showing that these functions require retinal or retinol, which are interconvertible but which cannot be recovered from the oxidized <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The requirement of retinol to rescue reproduction in vitamin A deficient rats is now known {{to be due to}} a requirement for local synthesis of <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> from retinol in testis and embryos.|$|E
25|$|The retinoids (for example, 13-cis-retinoic acid) {{constitute}} {{a class of}} chemical compounds chemically related to <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and are used in medicine to modulate gene functions in place of this compound. Like <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> the related compounds do not have full vitamin A activity, but do have powerful effects on gene expression and epithelial cell differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Many of the non-visual {{functions}} of vitamin A are mediated by <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which regulates gene expression by activating nuclear <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptors. The non-visual {{functions of}} vitamin A are essential in the immunological function, reproduction and embryonic development of vertebrates {{as evidenced by}} the impaired growth, susceptibility to infection and birth defects observed in populations receiving suboptimal vitamin A in their diet.|$|E
25|$|Type II nuclear receptors include principally {{subfamily}} 1, {{for example}} the <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptor, retinoid X receptor and thyroid hormone receptor.|$|E
25|$|Retinyl palmitate {{has been}} used in skin creams, where it is broken down to retinol and ostensibly metabolised to <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which has potent {{biological}} activity, as described above.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceutics {{utilizing}} mega {{doses of}} naturally occurring <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives {{are currently in}} use for cancer, HIV, and dermatological purposes. At high doses, side-effects are similar to vitamin A toxicity.|$|E
25|$|ALDH is a {{ubiquitous}} {{aldehyde dehydrogenase}} family of enzymes, which catalyzes the oxidation of aromatic aldehydes to carboxyl acids. For instance, {{it has a}} role in conversion of retinol to <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is essential for survival.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} other {{conditions}} can also increase cholesterol levels including diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, alcohol use, monoclonal gammopathy, dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, anorexia nervosa, medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, ciclosporin, glucocorticoids, beta blockers, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> antipsychotics).|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{trioxide}} (As2O3) inhibits cell {{growth and}} induces apoptosis(programmed cell death)i in {{certain types of}} cancer cells, which are normally immortal and can multiply without limit. In combination with all-trans <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> it is FDA-approved as first-line treatment for promyelocytic leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, {{and more}} specifically, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> appears to {{maintain}} normal skin health by switching on genes and differentiating keratinocytes (immature skin cells) into mature epidermal cells. Exact mechanisms behind pharmacological retinoid therapy {{agents in the}} treatment of dermatological diseases are being researched.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> is an {{influential}} factor used in differentiation {{of stem cells}} to more committed fates, echoing retinoic acid's importance in natural embryonic developmental pathways. It is thought to initiate differentiation {{into a number of}} different cell lineages by unsequestering certain sequences in the genome.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{modifications}} {{caused by}} extended culture {{leading to the}} death of more female embryos has been theorised as the reason why blastocyst transfer leads to a higher male sex ratio, however adding <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> to the culture can bring this ratio back to normal.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatment}} of supplements of <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{which is a}} part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal, but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily because it will not bring the retinoid hypo-signalling back to normal.|$|E
25|$|Many factors {{increase}} IGFBP-3 {{production by}} cells, including transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), tumor necrosis factor-α, vitamin D, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> IGF-1, and stimuli such as chemotherapy that activate the tumor suppressor p53. Estrogen inhibits IGFBP-3 production, and its tissue levels are lower in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers than in ER-negative cancers.|$|E
25|$|IGFBP-3 {{enters the}} cell nucleus by a {{mechanism}} that is incompletely understood, but involves its binding to importin-β. Within the nucleus, it can modulate nuclear hormone receptor activity by direct binding to retinoid X receptor, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptor, vitamin D receptor, PPARγ, and nur77, IGFBP-3 also interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase within the nucleus {{to promote the}} repair of DNA damage.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin's exact {{mechanism}} of action is unknown, but several {{studies have shown that}} isotretinoin induces apoptosis (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. Isotretinoin has a low affinity for <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptors {{are another}} subset of nuclear receptors. They can be {{activated}} by an endocrine-synthesized ligand that entered the cell by diffusion, a ligand synthesised from a precursor like retinol {{brought to the}} cell through the bloodstream or a completely intracellularly synthesised ligand like prostaglandin. These receptors {{are located in the}} nucleus and are not accompanied by HSPs. They repress their gene by binding to their specific DNA sequence when no ligand binds to them, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Retinol at normal doses is well tolerated. High doses {{may result}} in an {{enlarged}} liver, dry skin, or hypervitaminosis A. High doses during pregnancy {{may result in}} harm to the baby. Retinol is in the vitamin A family. It {{or other forms of}} vitamin A are needed for eye sight, maintenance of the skin, and human development. It is converted in the body to retinal and <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> through which it acts. Dietary sources include fish, dairy products, and meat.|$|E
25|$|PEPCK-C is enhanced, both {{in terms}} of its {{production}} and activation, by many factors. Transcription of the PEPCK-C gene is stimulated by glucagon, glucocorticoids, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cAMP), while it is inhibited by insulin. Of these factors, insulin, a hormone that is deficient in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus, is considered dominant, as it inhibits the transcription of many of the stimulatory elements. PEPCK activity is also inhibited by hydrazine sulfate, and the inhibition therefore decreases the rate of gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Signaling {{molecules}} can {{belong to}} several chemical classes: lipids, phospholipids, amino acids, monoamines, proteins, glycoproteins, or gases. Signaling molecules binding surface receptors are generally large and hydrophilic (e.g. TRH, Vasopressin, Acetylcholine), while those entering the cell are generally small and hydrophobic (e.g. glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, cholecalciferol, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid),</b> but important exceptions to both are numerous, and a same molecule can act both via surface receptor {{or in an}} intracrine manner to different effects. In intracrine signaling, once inside the cell, a signaling molecule can bind to intracellular receptors, other elements, or stimulate enzyme activity (e.g. gasses). The intracrine action of peptide hormones remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|The {{classes of}} CYPs most often {{investigated}} in non-human animals are those either involved in development (e.g., <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> or hormone metabolism) or {{involved in the}} metabolism of toxic compounds (such as heterocyclic amines or polyaromatic hydrocarbons). Often {{there are differences in}} gene regulation or enzyme function of CYPs in related animals that explain observed differences in susceptibility to toxic compounds (ex. canines inability to metabolize xanthines such as caffeine). Some drugs undergo metabolism in both species via different enzymes, resulting in different metabolites, while other drugs are metabolized in one species but excreted unchanged in another species. For this reason, one species's reaction to a substance is not a reliable indication of the substance's effects in humans.|$|E
25|$|Excessive vitamin A {{consumption}} {{can lead}} to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. In chronic cases, hair loss, dry skin, drying of the mucous membranes, fever, insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, bone fractures, anemia, and diarrhea can all be evident {{on top of the}} symptoms associated with less serious toxicity. Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.|$|E
25|$|Smith–Magenis {{syndrome}} (SMS) is {{a complex}} syndrome involving intellectual disabilities, sleep disturbance, behavioural problems, {{and a variety of}} craniofacial, skeletal, and visceral anomalies. The majority of SMS cases harbor an ~3.5 Mb common deletion that encompasses the <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> induced-1 (RAI1) gene. Other cases illustrate variability in the SMS phenotype not previously shown for RAI1 mutation, including hearing loss, absence of self-abusive behaviours, and mild global delays.Sequencing of RAI1 revealed mutation of a heptamericC-tract (CCCCCCC) in exon 3 resulting in frameshift mutations. Of the seven reported frameshift mutations occurring in poly C-tracts in RAI1, four cases (~57%) occur at this heptameric C-tract. The results indicate that this heptameric C-tract is a preferential recombination hotspot insertion/deletions (SNindels) and therefore a primary target for analysis in patients suspected for mutations in RAI1.|$|E
25|$|Genetically, linkage {{studies have}} {{identified}} 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes {{that are associated}} with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia. A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development. The carriers of the high-risk genes have a tenfold increased risk of myopia.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of acne, the most prescribed retinoid drug is 13-cis <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> (isotretinoin). It reduces the size and secretion of the sebaceous glands. Although {{it is known that}} 40mg of isotretinoin will break down to an equivalent of 10mg of ATRA— the mechanism of action of the drug (original brand name Accutane) remains unknown and is a matter of some controversy. Isotretinoin reduces bacterial numbers in both the ducts and skin surface. This is thought to be a result of the reduction in sebum, a nutrient source for the bacteria. Isotretinoin reduces inflammation via inhibition of chemotactic responses of monocytes and neutrophils. Isotretinoin also has been shown to initiate remodeling of the sebaceous glands; triggering changes in gene expression that selectively induce apoptosis. Isotretinoin is a teratogen with a number of potential side-effects. Consequently, its use requires medical supervision.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} little evidence to support this (and mounting evidence to refute it), some early studies implicated the Ephs to {{play a part in}} the signaling of limb development. In chicks, EphA4 is expressed in the developing wing and leg buds, {{as well as in the}} feather and scale primordia. This expression is seen in the distal end of the limb buds, where cells are still undifferentiated and dividing, and appears to be under the regulation of <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> FGF2, FGF4, and BMP-2 – known to regulate limb patterning. EphA4 defective mice do not present abnormalities in limb morphogenesis (personal communication between Andrew Boyd and Nigel Holder), so it is possible that these expression patterns are related to neuronal guidance or vascularisation of the limb with further studies being required to confirm or deny a potential role of Eph in limb development.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{are possible}} {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|Many cell {{signals are}} carried by {{molecules}} that are released by one cell {{and move to}} make contact with another cell. Endocrine signals are called hormones. Hormones are produced by endocrine cells and they travel through the blood to reach all parts of the body. Specificity of signaling can be controlled if only some cells can respond to a particular hormone. Paracrine signals such as <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> target only cells {{in the vicinity of the}} emitting cell. Neurotransmitters represent another example of a paracrine signal. Some signaling molecules can function as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. For example, epinephrine and norepinephrine can function as hormones when released from the adrenal gland and are transported to the heart by way of the blood stream. Norepinephrine can also be produced by neurons to function as a neurotransmitter within the brain. Estrogen can be released by the ovary and function as a hormone or act locally via paracrine or autocrine signaling. Active species of oxygen and nitric oxide can also act as cellular messengers. This process is dubbed redox signaling.|$|E
25|$|HDAC3 {{has been}} found to be most closely related to HDAC8. HDAC3 {{contains}} a non-conserved region in the C-terminal region that was found to be required for transcriptional repression as well as its deacetylase activity. It also contains two regions, one called a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) as well as a Nuclear Export Signal (NES). The NLS functions as a signal for nuclear action while an NES functions with HDACs that perform work outside of the nucleus. A presence of both signals for HDAC3 suggests it travels between the nucleus and the ctyoplasm. HDAC3 has even been found to interact with the plasma membrane. Silencing Mediator for <b>Retinoic</b> <b>Acid</b> and Thyroid Hormone (SMRT) receptors and Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor (N-CoR) factors must be utilized by HDAC3 in order to activate it. Upon doing so, it gains the ability to co-precipitate with HDACs 4, 5, and 7. HDAC3 can also be found complexed together with HDAC-related protein (HDRP). HDACs 1 and 3 have been found to mediate Rb-RbAp48 interactions which suggests that it functions in cell cycle progression. HDAC3 also shows involvement in stem cell self-renewal and a transcription independent role in mitosis.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, or retinol, is {{the sole}} vitamin which is {{embryotoxic}} even in a therapeutic dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, the <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{plays an important role}} as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs. Its natural precursor, the β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophile vitamins, including retinol. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamine A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women, and that the patient is aware of {{how important it is to}} prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. Medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamine A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (microphthalmia), ears, thymus, face deformities, neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as mental retardation.|$|E
500|$|The 5' {{region of}} the NEDD9 {{promoter}} is regulated by all-trans <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> (ATRA), and contains a <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> response element (RARE) that is specifically bound by a retinoid X receptor (RXR)/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimer. NEDD9 is also induced by the environmental pollutant dioxin, based on regulation through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). One study has found NEDD9 repressed by estrogen, based on binding of the SAFB1 co-repressor. NEDD9 is induced by Wnt signaling in colon cancer, based on binding to T-cell factor (TCF) factors in the promoter region. NEDD9 is induced by hypoxia and loss of VHL, based on binding of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) transcription factors to the NEDD9 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] The Fox transcription factor Forkhead box C1 (FoxC1) [...] and PAX5 transcription factor [...] {{have been reported to}} induce NEDD9 transcription. TGF-beta induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] Based on inspection of sequence, the NEDD9 promoter also has potential binding sites for a number of additional transcription factors, including STAT5A and NF-kappa B.|$|E
500|$|Specific {{cytogenetic}} abnormalities can {{be found}} in many people with AML; the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance. The chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins, usually transcription factors whose altered properties may cause the [...] "differentiation arrest". For example, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the t(15;17) translocation produces a PML-RARα fusion protein which binds to the <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid-specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> via the <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{receptor}} {{influences the}} process of cell differentiation, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development there is a concentration gradient of <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover {{the same amount of}} space as all eight would normally occupy. <b>Retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. [...] <b>Retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but <b>retinoic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.|$|E
2500|$|First {{generation}} include retinol, retinal, tretinoin (<b>retinoic</b> <b>acid),</b> isotretinoin, and alitretinoin ...|$|E
