The company {{then began}} to {{experiment}} {{in other areas of}} business using newly injected capital during the period of time between 1963 and 1968. Nintendo set up a taxi company called Daiya. This business was initially successful. However, Nintendo was forced to sell it because problems with the labour unions were making it too expensive to run the service. It also set up a love hotel chain, a TV network, a food company (selling instant rice) and several other ventures. All of these ventures eventually failed, and after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales dropped, and Nintendo's stock price plummeted to its lowest <b>recorded</b> <b>level</b> of ¥60.|$|E

This resulted in Lake Mead dropping to its lowest <b>recorded</b> <b>level</b> since 1937, when it was first being filled. Rapid development and economic growth further complicate the issue of a secure water supply, particularly in the case of California's senior water rights over those of Nevada and Arizona: in case of a reduction in water supply, Nevada and Arizona would have to endure severe cuts before any reduction in the California allocation, which is also larger than the other two combined. Although stringent water conservation measures have been implemented, the threat of severe shortfalls in the Colorado River basin continues to increase each year.|$|E

40|$|Emotion {{recognition}} in real-life conditions faces several challenging factors, which most {{studies on emotion}} recognition do not consider. Such factors include background noise, varying <b>recording</b> <b>levels,</b> and acoustic properties of the environment, for example. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the influence of background noise of various types and SNRs, as well as <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> variations on the performance of automatic emotion recognition from speech. Both, natural and spontaneous as well as acted/prototypical emotions are considered. Besides the well known influence of additive noise, a significant influence of the <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> on the recognition performance is observed. Multi-condition learning with various noise types and <b>recording</b> <b>levels</b> is proposed as a way to increase robustness of methods based on standard acoustic feature sets and commonly used classifiers.

At more than 1,000 feet (305m) deep and more than [...] in area, the lake was nearly as large as Lake Michigan and significantly deeper. With the change in climate, the lake began drying up, leaving Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake as remnants.
