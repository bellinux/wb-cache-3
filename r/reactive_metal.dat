5|$|Plutonium is a <b>reactive</b> <b>metal.</b> In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, {{producing}} {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly <b>reactive</b> <b>metal,</b> if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|Zinc has an {{electron}} configuration of 3d104s2 {{and is a}} member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, , by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.|$|E

5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolNa (from Latin natrium) and atomic number11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly <b>reactive</b> <b>metal.</b> Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, {{because it has}} a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na+ cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a transactinide element in the p-block. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and is the heaviest known member of the carbon group; it is also the heaviest element whose chemistry has been investigated. Initial chemical studies performed in 2007–2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases. More recent results show that flerovium's reaction with gold is similar to that of copernicium, showing that it is a very volatile element that may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure, that it would show metallic properties, consistent with it being the heavier homologue of lead, and that it would be the least <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> in group 14. The question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas is still unresolved as of 2016.|$|E

5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium would be quite a <b>reactive</b> <b>metal,</b> with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E

25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more <b>reactive</b> <b>metal,</b> and then tinned or clad with another.|$|E

25|$|Thallium is a soft, <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> (MH 1.0), {{so much so}} that it has no {{structural}} uses. It has a close-packed {{crystalline structure}} (BCN 6+6) but an abnormally large interatomic distance that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the thallium atoms. Although compounds in the +1 (mostly ionic) oxidation state are the more numerous, thallium has an appreciable chemistry in the +3 (largely covalent) oxidation state, as seen in its chalcogenides and trihalides. It {{is the only one of}} the Group 13 elements to react with air at room temperature, slowly forming the amphoteric oxide Tl2O3. It forms anionic thallates such as Tl3TlO3, Na3Tl(OH)6, NaTlO2, and KTlO2, and is present as the Tl− thallide anion in the compound CsTl. Thallium forms Zintl phases, such as Na2Tl, Na2K21Tl19, CsTl and Sr5Tl3H.|$|E
25|$|Overheating of {{internal}} parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, {{can result in}} trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A getter is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation, but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level {{of internal}} gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter (being a highly <b>reactive</b> <b>metal)</b> is effective against many atmospheric gases, but has no (or very limited) chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive type of failure, especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and cathode-ray tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism is not clear: the metal-to-glass lead-in seals are one possible infiltration site.|$|E
25|$|Radium, like barium, is {{a highly}} <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> and always {{exhibits}} its group oxidation state of +2. It forms the colorless Ra2+ cation in aqueous solution, which is highly basic and does not form complexes readily. Most radium compounds are therefore simple ionic compounds, though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons (in addition to the valence 7s electrons) is expected due to relativistic effects and would enhance the covalent character of radium compounds such as RaF2 and RaAt2. For this reason, the standard electrode potential for the half-reaction Ra2+ (aq) + 2e− → Ra (s) is −2.916V, even slightly lower than the value −2.92V for barium, whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group (Ca: −2.84V; Sr: −2.89V; Ba: −2.92V). The values for barium and radium are {{almost exactly the same}} as those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium.|$|E
