5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{tested a}} path {{model of the}} {{relationships}} of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking with consumption of alcohol and drinking problems. It was hypothesized that <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking would be composed of positively and negatively reinforcing reasons, and that <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking would be composed of personal and social reasons. Problem drinking was operationalized as consisting of two factors, consumption and drinking problems, with {{a positive relationship between}} the two. It was predicted that positively and negatively reinforcing <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking would be associated with heavier consumption and, in turn, more drinking problems, through level of consumption. Negatively reinforcing reasons were also predicted to be associated with drinking problems directly, independent of level of consumption. It was hypothesized that <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking would be associated with lower levels of consumption and would be related to fewer drinking problems, through level of consumption. Finally, among women, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking were expected to be associated with drinking problems directly, independent of level of consumption. The sample, was taken from {{the second phase of the}} Niagara Young Aduh Health Study, a community sample of young adult men and women. Measurement models of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking, and problem drinking were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. After adequate fit of each measurement model was obtained, the complete structural model, with all hypothesized paths, was tested for goodness of fit. Cross-group equality constraints were imposed on all models to test for gender differences. The results provided evidence supporting the hypothesized structure of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking and problem drinking. A single factor model of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking was used in the analyses because a two-factor model was inadequate. Support was obtained for the structural model. For example, the resuhs revealed independent influences of Positively Reinforcing <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Drinking, Negatively Reinforcing <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Drinking, and <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Limiting Drinking on consumption. In addition. Negatively Reinforcing Reasons helped to account for Drinking Problems independent of the amount of alcohol consumed. Although an additional path from <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Limiting Drinking to Drinking Problems was hypothesized for women, it was of marginal significance and did not improve the model's fit. As a result, no sex differences in the model were found. This may be a result of the convergence of drinking patterns for men and women. Furthermore, it is suggested that gender differences may only be found in clinical samples of problem drinkers, where the relative level of consumption for women and men is similar...|$|R

A random sample survey of 494 Oregon physicians identified the presence of economic and non-economic factors related to the recruitment and retention of physicians in Oregon. The research indicated that non-economic factors are overwhelmingly selected by physicians as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> locating their practices in Oregon, while economic factors are strongly selected as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> relocating out of Oregon, and as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> candidates not accepting positions.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) to classify <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> medication nonadherence. A survey method is used to collect individual <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> nonadherence to treatment plans. Seven <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> nonadherence are identified from the survey. ANNs using backpropagation learning are trained and validated to produce a nonadherence classification model. Most patients identified multiple <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> nonadherence. The ANN models were able to accurately predict almost 63 percent of the <b>reasons</b> identified <b>for</b> each patient. After removal of two highly common nonadherence reasons, new ANN models are able to identify 73 percent of the remaining nonadherence reasons. ANN models of nonadherence are validated as a reliable medical informatics tool for assisting healthcare providers in identifying the most likely <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> treatment nonadherence. Physicians may use the identified nonadherence reasons to help overcome the causes of nonadherence for each patient...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the interrelationships between self-objectification, body dissatisfaction, gender role orientation, perfectionism, and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise. A questionnaire assessing {{each of these}} constructs was completed by 149 male participants (M = 30. 28 years) who exercised regularly. Self-objectification showed positive correlations with appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise, negative femininity, and intrapersonal perfectionism. Dimensions of body dissatisfaction showed positive correlations with self-objectification, appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise, and intrapersonal perfectionism. Appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise were found to mediate the relationship between self-objectification and dissatisfaction with muscularity, but not the relationship between self-objectification and dissatisfaction with leanness. Conversely, health management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise were negatively related to both self-objectification and dissatisfaction with overall appearance. Regression analyses showed that appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise were the strongest predictor of both self-objectification and dissatisfaction with overall appearance. It was therefore speculated that appearance management exercise represented a negative behavioural consequence of self-objectification, whereas health management exercise {{could serve as a}} protective factor against self-objectification and body dissatisfaction...|$|R
