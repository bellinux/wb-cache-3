40|$|When a globiferous pedicellaria of Sphaerechinus granularis injects its venom, {{the head}} autotomizes whereas the stalk {{remains on the}} test and enters a {{regression}} process with concomitant resorption of its supporting ossicle (i. e. the rod). Scanning electron microscope investigations of the morphological changes undergone by the stereom of resorbing rods show that: (1) resorption proceeds both axially and laterally, and leads to a reduction of approximately 80 % of the original length of the rod, (2) secondary growth of new stereom processes occurs concomitantly with resorption but never ensures even a partial regeneration of the rod, and (3) resorption and secondary growth stop before the rod is totally destroyed leaving a static stump that remains in place up to 190 days. Particular resorption figures result from either the axial or the lateral resorption of the <b>rod</b> <b>shaft.</b> These consist chiefly of terraced conical cupules, dense cylinders and concentric lamellae whose walls or edges are typically made of closely piled and/or aligned subprismatic crystallites. Whatever their location along the rod, these crystallites always organize strictly parallel to the rod axis. Whether the crystallites are mosaic blocks composing larger monocrystalline units or discrete monocrystals themselves is for the moment unclear. A growth model, which accounts for the observed resorption figures, is proposed for the shaft of pedicellarial rods. According to this model, the early growth of the shaft would produce elongated, interconnected trabeculae (initial trabeculae) made of densely piled and perfectly aligned crystallites. Thickening and coalescence of adjoining trabeculae would progressively occur by adjunction around the initial trabeculae of successive and concentric layers of similarly arranged crystallites. Coalescent trabeculae would then be cemented together in a perforate stereom layer by the final deposition of larger crystallite layers surrounding the whole shaft periphery. Growth of secondary stereom processes occurs both in the resorbing rod (here the newly formed processes are resorbed soon {{after they have been}} produced) and in rods where resorption has stopped. These are always irregular processes that localize near or on the actual sites of resorption. It is suggested these processes result from an uncontrolled activation of the skeleton-forming cells in areas where the concentration of calcium ions increases as a consequence of calcite resorption...|$|E

By this time, harmoniums had reached high levels of mechanical complexity, not only through the need to provide instruments with a greater tonal range, but also due to patent laws (especially in North America). It was common for manufacturers to patent the action mechanism used on their instruments, thus requiring any new manufacturer to develop their own version; as the number of manufacturers grew, this led to some instruments having hugely complex arrays of levers, cranks, <b>rods</b> and <b>shafts,</b> which made replacement with an electronic instrument even more attractive.|$|R

It is {{necessary}} to consider these as separated from the stems; not only, as above noted, because their separate use marks another school of architecture, {{but because they are}} the only organic structures which are capable of being so treated, and intended to be so, without strong effort of imagination. To pull animals to pieces, and use their paws for feet of furniture, or their heads for terminations of <b>rods</b> and <b>shafts,</b> is usually the characteristic of feelingless schools; the greatest men like their animals whole. The head may, indeed, be so managed as to look emergent from the stone, rather than fastened to it; and wherever there is throughout the architecture any expression of sternness or severity (severity in its literal sense, as in Romans, XI. 22), such divisions of the living form may be permitted; still, you cannot cut an animal to pieces as you can gather a flower or a leaf. These were intended for our gathering, and for our constant delight: wherever men exist in a perfectly civilised and healthy state, they have vegetation around them; wherever their state approaches that of innocence or perfectness, it approaches that of Paradise,--it is a dressing of garden. And, therefore, where nothing else can be used for ornament, vegetation may; vegetation in any form, however fragmentary, however abstracted.
