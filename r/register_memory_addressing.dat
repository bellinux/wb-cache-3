Rather than dealing with <b>registers,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, {{with a focus on}} usability over optimal program efficiency. Unlike low-level assembly languages, high-level languages have few, if any, language elements that translate directly into a machine's native opcodes. Other features, such as string handling routines, object-oriented language features, and file input/output, may also be present.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, in {{assembly}} language, an operand is a value (an argument) {{on which}} the instruction, named by mnemonic, operates.

5000|$|For {{a typical}} {{instruction}} like , both argument operands come from explicitly named {{positions on the}} belt, {{and the result is}} dropped on the front, ready for the next instruction. Operations with multiple results simply drop more values at the belt front. Most belt instructions are encoded as just an operation code (opcode) and two belt positions, with no added fields to specify a result <b>register,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>address,</b> or literal constant. This encoding is easily extended to richer operations with more than two inputs or more than one result. Constant operands are dropped by separate [...] instructions. All access of program variables in main random-access memory (RAM) is segregated into separate [...] or [...] instructions containing one <b>memory</b> <b>address,</b> or some way to calculate that address from belt operands.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis talk {{introduces}} {{an efficient}} and portable approach for DIFT (Dynamic Information Flow Tracking) implementations on recon gurable chips. DIFT aims {{to track the}} application control flow by adding metadata (also known as tags) to information containers (e. g. <b>registers,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>addresses,</b> [...] .), propagating and checking it at runtime. These approaches have been successfully used against {{a wide range of}} attacks including bu er over ow, SQL injections and so on. Existing DIFT solutions are either hardly portable or bring unsatisfactory time overheads. For example, DIFT in software brings an overhead of at least 300 % and can rise up to 3700 %. Our chosen approach conists of using a dedicated coprocessor to decouple main computation (application) from tags computation. To efficiently retrieve information on executed instructions by the main CPU, ARM Coresight components are used to export CPU trace towards FPGA part of Zynq SoC. In addition to trace, static analysis {{needs to be done to}} get dependencies between information containers. This talk will present our chosen approach, ongoing work on first prototype and rst results. Existing DIFT approaches and ARM Coresight components will also be discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{an integer}} is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some finite {{subset of the}} mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and {{may or may not}} be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor <b>register</b> or <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> as an integer.|$|R

In this paper, an undergraduate design experience for special purpose 4 -bit microprocessor using the skills learned from digital logic design and Microprocessors courses is presented. The experience started in [1] by designing the ALU using the hardware printed circuit board and we are following it by completing the design by the instruction set architecture and the microprogram code. Our microprocessor contains – {{in addition to the}} ALU- six registers: A 4 -bit accumulator register, Flag register that holds only zero (Z) and carry (C) flags, Program counter <b>register</b> (PC), <b>Memory</b> <b>address</b> <b>register</b> (MAR), Instruction register (IR), and Buffer Register.

40|$|In {{optimized}} programs {{the location}} {{in which the}} current value of a single source variable may reside typically varies as the computation progresses. A debugger for optimized code needs to know all of the locations [...] both <b>registers</b> and <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> [...] in which a variable resides, and which locations are valid for which portions of the computation. Determining this information {{is known as the}} data location problem [3, 7]. Because optimizations frequently move variables around (between <b>registers</b> and <b>memory</b> or from one register to another) the compiler must build a table to keep track of this information. Such a table is known as a variable range table [3]. Once a variable range table has been constructed, finding a variable's current location reduces to the simple task of looking up the appropriate entry in the table. The difficulty lies in collecting the data for building the table. Previous methods for collecting this data depend on which optimizations the compiler performs and ho [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The way {{in which}} the {{instruction}} is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA). Often, one group of bits (that is, a [...] "field") within the instruction, called the opcode, indicates which operation is to be performed, while the remaining fields usually provide supplemental information required for the operation, such as the operands. Those operands may be specified as a constant value (called an immediate value), or as the location of a value that may be a processor <b>register</b> or a <b>memory</b> <b>address,</b> as determined by some addressing mode.|$|R

5000|$|Each ALU, {{called a}} PE slice, {{contains}} sixty four 32 bit registers {{that are used}} for both integer and floating point. The registers are, interestingly, bit and byte addressable. The floating point unit handles single precision and double precision arithmetic on IEEE format numbers. Each PE slice contains two <b>registers</b> for data <b>memory</b> <b>address,</b> and the data. Each PE also has two one-bit serial ports, one for inbound and one for outbound communication to its nearest neighbor. The direction of communication is controlled globally. The PEs also have inbound and outbound paths to a global router for I/O. A broadcast port allows a single instance of data to be [...] "promoted" [...] to parallel data. Alternately, global data can be 'or-ed' to a scalar result.|$|R
50|$|Binary {{arithmetic}} {{and logical}} operations are performed as register-to-register and as memory-to-register/register-to-memory {{as a standard}} feature. If the Commercial Instruction Set option was installed, packed decimal arithmetic could be performed as memory-to-memory with some memory-to-register operations. The Scientific Instruction Set feature, if installed, provided access to four floating point registers that could be programmed for either 32-bit or 64-bit floating point operations. The Models 85 and 195 could also operate on 128-bit extended-precision floating point numbers stored in pairs of floating point registers, and software provided emulation in other models. The System/360 used an 8-bit byte, 32-bit word, 64-bit double-word, and 4-bit nibble. Machine instructions had operators with operands, which could contain <b>register</b> numbers or <b>memory</b> <b>addresses.</b> This complex combination of instruction options resulted {{in a variety of}} instruction lengths and formats.|$|R
5000|$|All 2-operand 8-bit {{arithmetic}} {{and logical}} (ALU) operations {{work on the}} 8-bit accumulator (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit <b>register,</b> or a <b>memory</b> cell <b>addressed</b> by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination other than the accumulator are the unary incrementation or decrementation instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit <b>register</b> or on <b>memory</b> <b>addressed</b> by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and a HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved {{into any of the}} foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (MOV B,B, for instance), which are of little use, except for delays. However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., MOV M,M) instead encodes the HLT instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs.|$|R

Proposed algorithms automatically group these similar intervals of execution into phases, where all the intervals in a phase have homogeneous behavior and similar resource requirements. In this paper we examine different program structures for capturing phase behavior. The goal is to compare the size and accuracy of these structures for performing phase classification. We focus on profiling the frequency of program level structures that are independent from underlying architecture performance metrics. This allows the phase classification to be used across different hardware designs that support the same instruction set (ISA). We compare using basic blocks, loop branches, procedures, opcodes, <b>register</b> usage, and <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> information for guiding phase classification. We compare these different structures in terms of their ability to create homogeneous phases, and evaluate the accuracy of using these structures to pick simulation points for SimPoint...|$|R
