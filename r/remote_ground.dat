40|$|Active {{shielding}} {{is commonly}} used to measure <b>remote</b> <b>grounded</b> capacitive sensors because it reduces the effects of both external noise/interference and parasitic capacitances of the shielded cable. However, due to active shielding, the measurement circuit can become unstable and inaccurate. This paper analyses these limitations theoretically and experimentally, and then provides guidelines for improving the performance of active shielding. One of the key points is {{the selection of the}} bandwidth of the amplifier that drives the shield of the coaxial cable. A wide bandwidth improves accuracy, but a narrow bandwidth improves stability. Therefore, there is a trade-off between stability and accuracy with respect to the bandwidth of the amplifier...|$|R

50|$|The G-BOSS is an {{integrated}} surveillance system, which employs the following: a multi-spectral Electro-Optic/Infrared sensor suite with multiple detection and assessment technologies in a self-contained, mobile platform. The G-BOSS {{has the ability}} to operate independently between an 80-foot or 107-foot tower. The sensor suite is composed of: a Star SAFIRE IIIFP camera composed of lasers and rangefinders, a ThermoVision 3000 camera with a Global Positioning System (GPS), a Man-portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR). The Ground Control Station (GCS) also contains an optional <b>Remote</b> <b>Ground</b> Station (RGS). With the above technologies, the G-BOSS has the capabilities of video capture, storage, transmission, and power generation. The G-BOSS can also integrate signals from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using VideoScout management systems along with the Tactical Remote Sensor Suite (TRSS) ground sensors. The G-BOSS has 3 variants: the G-BOSS itself, the G-BOSS Lite, and the CERBERUS Lite.|$|E
50|$|The G-BOSS {{originated}} {{and enhanced}} the Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) system. During the Global War on Terror, these systems deployed to various Forward Operating Bases both in Iraq and Afghanistan. The {{basis for the}} RAID surveillance system was improved {{with the development of}} the G-BOSS. The G-BOSS took the concept of using elevated infrared sensors and put it on a stationary platform. In addition, the G-BOSS brought the addition of a second electro-optic/infrared sensor and a ground-based radar network located in the <b>remote</b> <b>ground</b> station. Included with the RAID towers are tethered blimp balloon systems (aerostats) as part of the Persistent Surveillance and Dissemination Systems, which later developed into the current G-BOSS system. The system employs a variety of sensors tethered from the blimp balloon system, and later evolved into other platforms, including fixed towers and relocated masts, which addressed logistical issues tested while on deployments.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the windy with little rain Typhoon 9713 which passed around the {{vicinity}} of Nansei Islands, Japan on August 18, 1997,a lot of salt damages occurred on the sugar cane fields.

Secondly, through the analysis of the Landsat Stellite data it was found out that the damaged areas in Amami-Osima and Kikaishima islands can be detected by evaluating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Finally, based on these investigations the authors proposed that early detection with the <b>ground</b> <b>remote</b> sensing, the exact grasp of damaged areas using the satellite data and sprinkling with water sprinklers or vaccum cars are effective as the countermeasure against salt damages of suger cane fields...|$|R
50|$|On February 6, 1943, Major Magruder was {{deployed}} to England for a 3-month stint {{to learn as}} much as possible about Radar Intercept Night Fighting from the Royal Air Force (RAF). The United States Navy critically needed to establish effective night fighting capabilities for the Pacific Campaign. Magruder was assigned to develop the U.S. Naval Radar Intercept Doctrine that entailed extensive modification of the British system into an almost totally different operational syllabus. Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., then Director Aircraft Pacific, required a single-pilot, single-engine aircraft that was capable of operating from a carrier while the British utilized a two-seat fighter that employed an onboard radar operator. Magruder reconfigured the system to include a <b>remote</b> <b>ground</b> control intercept (GCI) radar operator to coordinate exclusively with his designated pilot, to give him a vector close enough to the target for the pilot’s own shorter-range radar to locate the target. In June 1943 Magruder was assigned as Night Fighter Training Officer at the newly formed Marine Aircraft Group 53 (MAG-53) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina.|$|E
50|$|Considering the {{majority}} of casualties in both Iraq and Afghanistan {{in terms of the}} Global War on Terror were from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the need for surveillance has increased with their increased use. In a move to counter this threat and lower the effectiveness of IEDs, the US Marine Corps directed the creation of a persistent surveillance system to identify and counter threats to security of military installations. The Marines requested the system be fielded as soon as possible. The result of this request was the development of the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System ready for rapid deployment to theater.The G-BOSS provides the command operations center with a round-the-clock display and tracking of items of interest through the use of high resolution night and day cameras. The cameras are integrated with enhanced target recognition and radar systems used to increase the ability to detect moving targets. The G-BOSS allows personnel to counter insurgent activities with an emphasis of disrupting placement of improvised explosive devices. The G-BOSS enhances situational awareness by allowing personnel to monitor activities {{in the vicinity of the}} military installation. Common places of surveillance include the gates, along the roads, borders, rivers, pipelines, and chokepoints, among other areas of responsibility and interest. The multiple towers of cameras and surveillance systems allows for 360-degree security with easily understood computer displays. Included on the computer displays are alarms and assessment data through overlay and window pop-ups, with 24/7 network running capability, allowing reduced manpower and hours in relation to personnel on guard. The multiple camera systems have the capability of routing all into a single <b>remote</b> <b>ground</b> system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} results of {{structural}} lightning protec-tive system (LPS) tests conducted in 2004 and 2005 at the Inter-national Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, FL. Lightning was triggered using the rocket-and-wire technique, and its current was directly injected into the LPS. The test configurations in 2004 and 2005 differed in the lightning current injection point, number of down conductors, grounding system at the test house, {{and the use of}} surge protective devices. The primary objective was to examine the division of the injected lightning current between the grounding system of the test house, and <b>remote</b> <b>ground</b> accessible via the neutral of the power-supply cable. In 2004, the mean value of the peak current entering the electrical circuit neutral in search of its way to <b>remote</b> <b>ground</b> was about 22 % of the injected lightning current peak, while in 2005, it was about 59 %. For comparison, more than 80 % of the injected peak current was observed to enter the electrical circuit neutral in similar 1997 tests at the ICLRT in which a different test house with a different (poorer) grounding system was used (Rakov et al. 2002 [1]).
