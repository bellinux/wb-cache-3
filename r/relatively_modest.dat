40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) is used {{to explore}} the role of various processes in regulating the stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT). Simulations {{are based on a}} composite case derived from a Lagrangian analysis of 2 yr of data from the northeastern Pacific. The simulations reproduce well the observed transition from a compact stratocumulus layer to more broken fields of cumulus, simply as a response to increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs) along the transition. In so doing they support earlier theoretical work that argued that the SCT was a response of boundary layer circulations to increased forcing by surface latent heat fluxes. Although the basic features of the SCT imposed by the increase in SST are robust, a variety of other factors affect the detailed character of the SCT. For example, enhanced precipitation or increased downwelling longwave radiative fluxes can accelerate the reduction in cloud cover that accompanies the SCT, while a gradual decrease in the large-scale divergence can make changes in cloud cover that accompany the SCT <b>relatively</b> more <b>modest.</b> The simulations also demonstrate that the pace of the SCT is mainly set by the strength of the temperature inversion capping the initial stratocumulus-topped boundary layer...|$|R

We aimed to illustrate the epidemiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in high-risk groups, which were identified based on existing literature. To this end, PubMed was searched to retrieve original articles published until May 2015 using relevant and pertinent keywords “nonalcoholic fatty liver disease” and “diabetes”, “obesity”, “hyperlipidemia”, “familial heterozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia”, “hypertension”, “metabolic syndrome”, “ethnicity”, “family history” or “genetic polymorphisms”. We found that age, sex and ethnicity are major physiological modifiers of the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, along with belonging to “non-alcoholic fatty liver disease families” and carrying risk alleles for selected genetic polymorphisms. Metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, mixed hyperlipidaemia and hypocholesterolaemia due to familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia are the major metabolic modifiers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease risk.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the characteristics of families with catastrophic health care expenditures. Based on data from a national sample, three overlapping groups of families are considered: those incurring annual out-of-pocket expenditures that exceed, respectively, 5, 10, and 20 percent of the family's income. Such families represent {{a small percentage of}} all families, but they account for a disproportionally large share of total health care expenditures. Nevertheless, the actual amounts spent out of pocket by most of these families are <b>relatively</b> small. <b>Modest</b> sums are financially burdensome to these families because {{they are more likely to}} be low-income and to be headed by someone who is not employed. Families with catastrophic expenditures are also more likely to be headed by someone 65 or older and, consistent with that, a greater share of their total expenditures is covered by Medicare. However, all other third-party payers cover a relatively smaller share of total expenditures for these families than they do for all families, reflecting the generally worse third-party coverage of families with catastrophic health expenditures. The implications of these findings for several current issues are discussed, including catastrophic coverage proposals for Medicare and proposed programs to help the medically indigent and the uninsured...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a big survey in {{enhancing}} the balance of the routing load and the consumption of resources using network layer metrics for the path discovery in the MAODV protocol. A ad hoc network (AD HOC NETWORKS) consists of a collection of wireless mobile nodes, which form a temporary network without relying on any existing infrastructure or centralized administration. The bandwidth of the ad hoc networks architecture is limited and shared between the participating nodes in the network, therefore an efficient utilization of the network bandwidth is very important. Multicasting technology can minimize the consumption of the link bandwidth and reduce the communication cost too. As multimedia and group-oriented computing gains more popularity for users of ad hoc networks, the effective Quality of Service (QoS) of the multicasting protocol plays a significant role in ad hoc networks. In this paper we propose a reconstruction of the MAODV protocol by extending some featuring QoS in MAODV. All simulations are prepared with the NS 2 simulator and compare the performance of this algorithm with the MAODV algorithm. The achieved results illustrate faster path discovery and more performing routing balance in the use of MAODV-Extension.

The publication of Robert Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland (1848–52) provided a handbook for the style and the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace (and subsequent adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–58) confirmed its popularity. Estate house building boomed between about 1855 and the agricultural depression and Glasgow Bank crash of 1878. Construction was now dominated by patronage from nouveau riche industrialists. The decline in numbers of servants, linked to the introduction of electricity, central heating and labour-saving devices such as the vacuum cleaner, also led to changes in the scale of building. Arts and crafts designs first featured in Philip Webb's (1831–1915) gothic design at Arisaig (1863–64).

It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by CharlesII which states that the heir {{apparent}} of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion {{in front of him}} when he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, GeorgeIII, then his son, GeorgeIV, and last used by EdwardVII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future GeorgeV, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, EdwardVIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the potential}} impact of climate change on EU tourism demand and provides long-term (2100) scenarios accounting for adaptation in terms of holiday duration. Our long-term projections for tourism demand are based on hedonic valuation of climatic conditions combining hotel price information and travel cost estimations. This approach allows us to analyse together the climatic aspect of recreational demand and its travel cost dimension and thus to draw alternative hypotheses regarding the time dimension of tourism demand. We derive alternative scenarios for adaptation of holiday in terms of holiday frequency and duration. We find that the climate dimension plays a significant (economically and statistically) role in explaining hedonic valuations of tourism services and, as a consequence, its variation in the long-term are likely to affect the relative attractiveness of EU regions for recreational demand. In certain cases, most notably the Southern EU Mediterranean countries climate condition in 2100 could under current economic conditions, lower tourism revenues for up to - 0. 45 % of GDP per year. On the contrary, other areas of the EU, most notably Northern European countries would gain from altered climate conditions, although these gains would be <b>relatively</b> more <b>modest,</b> reaching up to 0. 32 % of GDP on an annual basis. Overall our results suggest that the change in holiday duration appears to be more beneficial than the change in the frequency of holidays in view of mitigating the cost of climate change for the tourism sector.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios that form the analytical backbone for other contributions to this Special Issue. We first describe the motivation behind this scenario exercise and introduce the main scenario features and characteristics, in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Altogether, we analyze three baseline scenarios of different socio-economic and technological developments that are assumed not to include any explicit climate policies. We then impose a range of climate stabilization targets on these baseline scenarios and analyze in detail the feasibility, costs and uncertainties of meeting a range of different climate stabilization targets in accordance with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The scenarios were developed by the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework that encompasses detailed representations of the principal GHG-emitting sectors - energy, industry, agriculture, and forestry. The main analytical findings from our analysis focus on the implications of salient uncertainties (associated with scenario baselines and stabilization targets), on feasibility and costs of climate stabilization efforts, and on the choice of appropriate portfolios of emissions abatement measures. We further analyze individual technological options with regards to their aggregated cumulative contribution toward emissions mitigation during the 21 st century as well as their deployment over time. Our results illustrate that the energy sector will remain by far the largest source of GHG emissions and hence remain the prime target of emissions reduction. Ultimately, this may lead to a complete restructuring of the global energy system. Climate mitigation could also significantly change the relative economics of traditional versus new, more climate friendly products and services. This is especially the case within the energy system, which accounts for the largest share of emissions reductions, but it is also the case in the agriculture and forestry sectors, where emissions reduction and sink enhancement measures are <b>relatively</b> more <b>modest...</b>|$|R

Eris formally traces the production of oxygen and iron due to Type-Ia and Type-II supernovae. We include in post-processing the production of r-process elements from compact binary mergers.

40|$|In a {{numerical}} calculation sometimes we need higher-than double-precision floating-point arithmetic {{to allow us}} to be confident of a result. One alternative is to rewrite the program to use a software package implementing arbitrary-precision extended floating-point arithmetic such as ARPREC or MPFR, and try to choose a suitable precision. Such an arithmetic scheme, in spite of helpful tools, may be inconvenient to write. There are also facilities in computer algebra systems (CAS) for such software-implemented “bigfloats. ” These facilities are convenient if one is already using the CAS. In any of these situations the bigfloats may be rather slow, a cost of its generality. There are possibilities intermediate between the largest hardware floating-point format and the general arbitrary-precision software which combine a considerable (but not arbitrary) amount of extra precision with a (<b>relatively</b> speaking) <b>modest</b> factor loss in speed. Sometimes merely doubling the number of bits in a double-floating-point fraction is enough, in which case arithmetic on double-double (DD) operands would suffice. Another possibility is to go for yet another doubling to quad-double (QD) arithmetic: instead of using the machine double-floats to give about 16 decimal digits of precision, QD supplies about 64 digits. DD and QD as used here provide the same exponent range as ordinary double. Here we describe how we incorporated QD arithmetic implemented in a library into a Common Lisp system, providing a smooth interface while adding only modest overhead to the run-time costs (compared to accessing the library from C or C++). One advantage is that we keep the program text almost untouched while switching from double to quad-double. Another is that the programs can be written, debugged, and run in an interactive environment. Most of the lessons from QD can be used for other versions of arithmetic which can be embedded in Lisp, including MPFR, for indefinite (arbitrary) precision, should QD provide inadequate precision or range. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: For complex oligosaccharides, {{which are}} <b>relatively</b> rigid with <b>modest</b> {{excursions}} {{from a single}} minimum energy conformation, it is straightforward to build conformational models from NOE data. Other oligosaccharides are more flexible with transitions between distinct minima separated by substantial energy barriers. We show that modeling based on scalar coupling data is superior to NOE-based modeling for the latter case. Long range 13 C- 13 C and 13 C- 1 H coupling constants measured for the heptasaccharide repeating subunit of the cell wall polysaccharide from Streptococcus mitis J 22 are correlated with individual glycosidic dihedral angles, effectively uncoupling the degrees of freedom of the oligosaccharide and allowing a search for combinations of dihedral angles which are energetically reasonable, i. e., with no bad van der Waals contacts, and which can be combined to satisfy all the measured J values. Allowed values of the individual angles can then be combined to search for overall oligosaccharide conformations which contribute to the ensemble. We show that while the polysaccharide from S. mitis J 22 is flexible, requiring multiple conformations, most of the flexibility is localized to a few bonds and only a rather small number of conformations is required to reproduce the experimental NOE and scalar coupling data. A central question in the conformation and dynamics of complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides is whether...|$|R

Some of this association, however, may be confounded by relevant covariates {{that have not}} been controlled. By using data with repeated observations from the same individuals, this study aimed to quantify the bias due to unobserved characteristics that are time invariant. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey were used to estimate negative binomial regression models of the number of annual paid sickness absence days. Observations spanning the period 2005 - 2012, and covering all employed persons aged 15 - 64 years, were used (56 348 observations from 13 622 individuals). RESULTS: Significant associations between the number of paid sickness absence days taken each year and scores on the mental health subscale of the SF- 36 (MHI- 5) were found. Inclusion of correlated random effects (which effectively control for unobserved person-specific factors that do not vary over time), however, resulted in a marked decline in the magnitude of this association. For persons with severe depressive symptoms (MHI- 5 ≤ 52), the estimated incidence rate ratios were in the range 1. 13 - 1. 14 for men and 1. 10 - 1. 12 for women. CONCLUSIONS: Poor mental health is a risk factor affecting work attendance, but the magnitude of this effect, at least {{in a country where the}} rate of sickness absence is <b>relatively</b> low, is <b>modest.</b> Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
