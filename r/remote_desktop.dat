40|$|Accessing {{the display}} of a {{computer}} remotely, is popularly called “remote <b>desktopping</b> 1 ”. <b>Remote</b> <b>desktopping</b> software installs at both the user-facing client computer and the re-mote server computer; it simulates user’s input events at server, and streams the corresponding display changes to client, thus providing an illusion to the user of control-ling the remote machine using local input devices (e. g., keyboard/mouse). Many such <b>remote</b> <b>desktopping</b> tools are widely used. We show that if the remote server is a virtual machine (VM) and the client is reasonably powerful (e. g., current lap-top and desktop grade hardware), VM deterministic replay capabilities can be used adaptively to significantly reduce the network bandwidth consumption and server-side CPU uti-lization of a <b>remote</b> <b>desktopping</b> tool. We implement these optimizations in a tool based on Qemu/KVM virtualization platform and VNC <b>remote</b> <b>desktopping</b> platform. Our tool reduces VNC’s network bandwidth consumption by up to 9 x and server-side CPU utilization by up to 56 % for popular graphics-intensive applications. On the flip side, our tech-niques consume higher CPU/memory/disk resources at the client. The effect of our optimizations on user-perceived la-tency is negligible...|$|R
