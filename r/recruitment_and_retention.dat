5|$|Nevertheless, due {{to further}} cuts in defence {{spending}} and an eagerness {{of the government}} to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention.</b> Further, {{the decision was made to}} abolish the old CMF divisions, as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation, but rather a force that could provide individual sub-units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army. Centralisation of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves. Other issues such as pay and conditions of service, protection of civilian employment and <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> rates across the RAN resulted {{in the number of}} trained submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent burnout. A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E

The relationship of employee retention on performance is exceedingly complex.

5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention,</b> and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention,</b> the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1960, McNicoll {{was posted}} to the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel. As noted by {{historian}} Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position {{at a time}} in which <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets. McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period. Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard , the flagship of the RAN. The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise. McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare. As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS Melbourne. The Army and Air Force opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN {{was in the process of}} a complete overhaul of its order of battle and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six Ton-class minesweepers acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities. Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.|$|E

40|$|The {{proficient}} {{human resource}} management of employees and their contribution to small business is commonly accepted as contributing to Australia’s future prosperity (Schaper 2000). Effective <b>recruitment,</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> of employees {{are part of the}} employment relationship and can enhance work performance and contribute to business success (Crompton, Morrissey and Nankervis 2002). Effective <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> selection has regularly been associated with positive <b>retention</b> <b>and</b> performance outcomes.

This paper seeks to demonstrate an increased understanding {{of the importance of the}} creation of sustainable performances through the development of enhanced employee relationships that impact on small business outcomes in Australia. A pilot study led to the development of a comprehensive survey instrument.

A series of relationships similar to that found in “relationship marketing” were identified as contributing to enhanced sustainable small business outcomes. This in turn has laid the framework for entrepreneurial activities to be improved through ongoing relationship development. The study demonstrated an approach in which the use of the characteristics of relationship marketing when applied to the <b>recruitment,</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> of employees in small entrepreneurial businesses can enhance sustainable performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} problem of poor retention of employees with scarce skills in the Limpopo Department of Agriculture. Employees with scarce skills were selected {{to participate in the}} research which focused on <b>recruitment,</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>retention.</b> <b>Recruitment,</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> of line employees with valued skills are a major crises facing many institutions. The problem of poor <b>retention</b> <b>and</b> turnover of line employees with scarce skills has far reaching consequences in that dissatisfaction with working conditions causes additional turnover. To some extent, the Department can control the turnover rate of its employees with scarce skills. The research assessed <b>recruitment,</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> of line employees with scarce skills in the Limpopo Department of Agriculture. The research concentrated on the reasons for poor retention of line employees with scarce skills, the extent of turnover of employees with scarce skills, what process do the Limpopo Department of Agriculture follow in filling vacant post and what interventions and measures do the Department undertakes to ensure compliance to the recruitment policy. A questionnaire was used to collect data from managers and line employees with scarce skills. A hundred (100) questionnaires were distributed and 67 were returned. The findings revealed that Limpopo Department of Agriculture can do more in retaining its valued line employees (those with scarce skills). The challenge of scarce skills in the Department is compounded by the high demand of for instance engineers, state veterinarians and researchers in South Africa. There is a war on scarce skills in South Africa, Generation Y needs resources, better working conditions and a better salary to be retained. The research findings were evaluated and possible strategies for improving <b>recruitment,</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> of line employees with scarce skills are recommended. The Department should design a career progression path policy. This would assist in retaining scarce skills in the public sector. Public Administration and ManagementM. A.
