25|$|In 2007, {{the need}} to fund $1 billion per year for {{pressing}} transportation projects resulted in another impasse between the House of Delegates and Senate. Rather than approve additional tax increases, the final <b>Republican</b> <b>plan,</b> which was enacted into law, resulted in new abusive driving fees of up to $3,000 which are assessed against Virginia residents {{in addition to the}} historic fines assessed on out-of-state drivers convicted of the same driving law violations. The <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> also called for issuing general obligation bonds which Democrats claim will reduce funding of non-transportation needs in future years. In general, the Democrats opposed the abusive driving fees. On 2007-08-23, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate responded to public opposition of the new fees by promising to moderate them in the 2008 legislative session.|$|E

25|$|In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, {{supported}} banning {{slavery in}} all the U.S. territories. The Southern states viewed this {{as a violation of}} their constitutional rights and as {{the first step in a}} grander <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas' votes were distributed nationally and Constitutional Unionist John Bell's votes centered in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a plurality of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally, so Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before his inauguration, seven slave states with cotton-based economies declared secession and formed the Confederacy. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 49 percent. The first seven with state legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for unionists Douglas and Bell in Georgia with 51% and Louisiana with 55%. Alabama had voted 46% for those unionists, Mississippi with 40%, Florida with 38%, Texas with 25%, and South Carolina cast Electoral College votes without a popular vote for president. Of these, only Texas held a referendum on secession.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> and a recent deal on the 2011 budget, President Obama on April 13, 2011 presented an alternative plan in a major policy speech. [...] This new plan would cut deficits by $4 trillion over 12 years {{through a combination of}} broad spending cuts and tax increases, including the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for incomes over $200,000 and proposed a cap on increases in Medicare and Medicaid spending, to be paid for by individuals. [...] Obama criticized the <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> for enriching the wealthy through tax cuts while placing a greater economic burden on the elderly through Medicare cuts. [...] Obama's plan was criticized by Republicans for its large cuts in defense spending and for its lack of specific detail. On June 23, at a hearing of the Budget Committee, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf was asked what his agency made of the proposals in that presidential address. “We don’t estimate speeches,” he said. “We need much more specificity than was provided in that speech." [...] A motion to proceed on a Republican-sponsored bill meant to represent the original Obama administration budget proposal was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 0–97 votes on May 25, 2011; the lack of Democratic support was said to have been because the original budget had been superseded by Obama's April speech.|$|E

500|$|A {{competing}} plan, called The Path to Prosperity, {{was announced}} by House Republicans, led by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, on April 5, 2011.

The plan would make no further reduction in defense spending beyond the Obama administration's plan, but would make major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which was expected to pass more {{of the cost of}} these programs onto individuals. [...] It would also cut energy research and other applied research and development. This plan was criticized by Democrats for disproportionately cutting programs which benefit the disadvantaged and stifling innovation, while not cutting defense spending further and containing deep tax cuts. The House <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 40–57 votes on May 25, 2011, the same day that the Obama budget was also defeated.|$|E
