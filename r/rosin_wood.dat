50|$|There {{are three}} types of rosin: gum rosin (from pine tree oleoresin), <b>wood</b> <b>rosin</b> (obtained by {{extraction}} of tree stumps), and tall oil rosin (obtained from tall oil, a byproduct of kraft paper process). Gum rosin has a milder odor and lower tendency to crystallize from solutions than <b>wood</b> <b>rosin,</b> and is therefore preferred for flux applications. Tall oil rosin finds increased use due to its higher thermal stability and therefore lower tendency to form insoluble thermal decomposition residues. The composition and quality of rosin differs by the tree type, and also by location and even by year. In Europe, rosin for fluxes is usually obtained from {{a specific type of}} Portuguese pine, in America a North Carolina variant is used.|$|R

This type of rosin is typically called <b>wood</b> <b>rosin.</b>|$|R

50|$|Glycerol ester of <b>wood</b> <b>rosin,</b> {{also known}} as glyceryl abietate or ester gum, is an {{oil-soluble}} food additive (E number E445). The food-grade material is used in foods, beverages, and cosmetics to keep oils in suspension in water. It is also used as an ingredient {{in the production of}} chewing-gum and ice cream. Similar, less pure materials (glycerol ester of gum rosin) are used as a component of certain low-cost adhesives.|$|R
30|$|To {{improve the}} welding properties, several {{researches}} on the enhancement process have been studied. According {{to the study}} of Rodriguez et al., the welding properties could be significantly improved using smaller pre-drilled holes [6]. The use of dry dowels inserted hot into the substrate after preheating them at high temperature yielded consistently better results [7]. Natural additives, lignin and rosin, could significantly improve the welding properties [8]. Lignin, mono-oligosaccharides, acetic acid, vanillin, furfural, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF), and syringaldehyde in water extracts were quantified [9]. Application of <b>rosin</b> to the <b>wood</b> faces to be joined by both linear vibration welding and rotational dowel welding has shown to greatly enhance the water resistance of the welded wood joints [10].|$|R
40|$|Application of <b>rosin,</b> a <b>wood</b> derived, non-toxic, natural, {{inexpensive}} and easily and abundantly available natural material, to the wood faces {{to be joined}} by either linear vibration welding or rotational dowel welding has shown to greatly enhance the water resistance of welded wood joints. The method of application has been shown to have a marked effect on the results, with the application and drying of a diluted rosin solution to the wood surfaces before welding yielding the best results. The considerable improvement in water resistance does not still allow classification of the joints as fully exterior grade. However, dowel welding can now be used for protected exterior joints due to a combination of rosin waterproofing and joint geometry. Welded dowel joints holding together for longer than 455 days immersion in water indicate this to be the case. Rosin-treated linear vibration joints held together well in excess of 30 days but retained a measurable strength, in the best case, only up to 18 days water immersion. The wood anatomy and chemical reasons for the effect of rosin were determined by X-ray microdensitometry and CP-MAS (13) C-NMR analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Because the {{turpentine}} {{and pine}} oil from destructive distillation [...] "become somewhat contaminated with other distillation products", solvent processes are commonly used. In this process, stumps and roots are chipped and soaked {{in the light}} end of the heavy naphtha fraction (boiling between 90 °C and 115 °C) from a crude oil refinery. Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in intermediate stages and naphtha laden with rosin from intermediate stages contacts unleached wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the rosin, fatty acids, turpentine, and other constituents later separated through steam distillation. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery. After the solvent has been recovered, [...] "the terpene oils are separated by fractional distillation and recovered mainly as refined turpentine, dipentene, and pine oil. The nonvolatitle residue from the extract is <b>wood</b> <b>rosin</b> of rather dark color. Upgrading of the rosin is carried out by clarification methods that generally may include bed-filtering or furfural-treatment of rosin-solvent solution." ...|$|R
