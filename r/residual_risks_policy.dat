40|$|Strategic risk {{appraisal}} (SRA) {{has been}} applied to compare diverse <b>policy</b> level <b>risks</b> to and from the environment in England and Wales. Its application has relied on expert-informed assessments of the potential consequences from <b>residual</b> <b>risks</b> that attract <b>policy</b> attention at the national scale. Here we compare consequence assessments, across environmental, economic and social impact categories that draw on ‘expert’- and ‘literature-based’ analyses of the evidence for 12 public risks appraised by Government. For environmental consequences there is reasonable agreement between the two sources of assessment, with expert-informed assessments providing a narrower dispersion of impact severity and with median values similar in scale to those produced by an analysis of the literature. The situation is more complex for economic consequences, with a greater spread in the median values, less consistency between the two assessment types and a shift toward higher severity values across the risk portfolio. For social consequences, the spread of severity values is greater still, with no consistent trend between the severities of impact expressed by the two types of assessment. For the latter, the findings suggest the need for a fuller representation of socioeconomic expertise in SRA and the workshops that inform SRA output...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the percentage of patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction currently prescribed a statin, with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 400 mg/dL were excluded. The <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> population consisted of patients currently taking a statin with LDL < 100 mg/dL and HDL < 50 / 55 mg/dL. Patients were excluded from the <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> population if they were on niacin, had an allergy to or previously failed niacin therapy, or expired within 72 hours. Results: A total of 553 patients experiencing an AMI had lipid panels available for evaluation. The mean LDL was 97. 3 ± 36. 0 mg/dL, mean HDL was 33. 5 ± 11. 1 mg/dL, and mean triglycerides were 133. 1 ± 71. 3 mg/dL.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{screening}} blood donations {{with advanced}} technologies and improved donor screening, {{the risk of}} transfusion-transmitted infections persists. This risk is mainly due to blood donations collected during the window period. A precise estimate of the transfusion risk of viral infection will help {{to determine the effect}} of new and current safety measures and to prioritize and allocate limited resources. Therefore, we estimated the risk of transfusion-transmitted viral infection in blood donations collected in Korea from 2000 to 2010. Methods Blood donations collected at 16 blood centers were tested for HIV, HCV, and HBV to estimate the <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> of transfusion-transmitted viral infection. The <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> was calculated in two-year periods using the incidence/window model. The incidence rates for HIV/HCV and the confirmed positive rate for HIV/HCV in first-time and repeat donors were compared. Results The <b>residual</b> <b>risks</b> for HIV in 2004 / 2005 and 2009 / 2010 were 1 in 1, 080, 244 and 1 in 1, 356, 547, respectively. The risks for HCV in 2000 / 2001 and 2009 / 2010 were 1 in 81, 431 and 1 in 2, 984, 415, and the risks for HBV in 2000 / 2001 and 2009 / 2010 were 1 in 45, 891 and 1 in 43, 666. These estimates indicate that the <b>residual</b> <b>risks</b> for HCV in Korea have declined 36. 6 -fold, and those for HIV and HBV have not improved significantly, compared to previous estimates. The odds ratios for HCV and HBV positivity in first-time donors compared to repeat donors were 11. 8 and 19. 6, respectively. Conclusions The <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> of HCV declined over the last decade due to improved screening reagents, implementation of the nucleic acid amplification test, and tight application of strict donor selection procedures. Current <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> estimates for HIV and HCV in Korea are extremely low, but the risk for HBV is still high; therefore, urgent measures should focus on decreasing the <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> of HBV. Despite the introduction of more sensitive assays in blood screening, several other factors may influence the actual <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> of transfusion-transmitted infection. A continuous monitoring of <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> of transfusion-transmitted infection is crucial in managing blood safety. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Measures of <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> are {{developed}} as extension of measures of risk. They view a random variable {{of interest in}} concert with an auxiliary random vector that helps to manage, predict, and mitigate the risk in the original variable. <b>Residual</b> <b>risk</b> can be exemplied as a quantication of the improved situation faced by a hedging investor {{compared to that of}} a single-asset investor, but the notion reaches further with deep connections emerging with forecasting and generalized regression. We establish the fundamental properties in this framework and show that measures of <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> along with generalized regression can play central roles in the development of risk-tuned approximations of random variables, in tracking of statistics, and in estimation of the risk of conditional random variables.

The paper introduces a comprehensive measure of systematic risk (SR) for individual hedge funds by breaking up total risk into systematic and fund-specific or <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> components. Contrary to the popular understanding that hedge funds are market neutral, we find that systematic risk is a highly significant factor explaining the dispersion of cross-sectional returns {{while at the same time}} measures of <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> and tail risk seem to have little explanatory power. Funds in the highest SR quintile generate 6 % more average annual returns compared with funds in the lowest SR quintile.

The objective {{of this study was to}} verify seroprevalence, incidence and <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> for both viruses before and after the implementation of NAT. Methods Over 700, 000 blood samples from all blood banks in the southern Brazilian State of Santa Catarina were analyzed during the period between January 2007 and July 2013. Results Compared with the period preceding the NAT screening, HIV prevalence increased from 1. 38 to 1. 58 per 1, 000 donors, HIV incidence rate increased from 1. 22 to 1. 35 per 1, 000 donor-years, and HIV <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> dropped almost 2. 5 times during the NAT period. For HCV, seroprevalence increased from 1. 22 to 1. 35 per 1, 000 donors, incidence dropped from 0. 12 to 0. 06 per 1, 000 donor-years, and <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> decreased more than 3 times after the NAT implementation.

While questions have been raised about the technical compliance measures that will be required by the new regulations, the communication issues related to <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> should not be overlooked. More than ever, EPA is stressing the importance of public outreach in all its initiatives. Industrial facilities need to be prepared to keep the lines of communication open on the local level and to discuss potential health and environmental impacts from their dayto-day operations with residents, agencies, other industry, and the media.

To be successful, facilities need to identify and respond to public concerns as well as raise awareness of what facilities are doing to lower emissions, reduce risks, and protect human health and the environment. In order to get this message out effectively, industry also needs to build trust and improve its credibility with the public.

Atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides {{and low levels of}} high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often with elevated apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol, is common in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome and contributes to both macrovascular and microvascular <b>residual</b> <b>risk.</b> However, atherogenic dyslipidemia is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice. The <b>Residual</b> <b>Risk</b> Reduction Initiative (R 3 i) was established to address this highly relevant clinical issue. The aims of this position paper are (1) to highlight evidence that atherogenic dyslipidemia is associated with residual macrovascular and microvascular risk in patients at high risk for CVD, despite current standards of care for dyslipidemia and diabetes; and (2) to recommend therapeutic intervention for reducing this <b>residual</b> vascular <b>risk</b> supported by evidence and expert consensus.
