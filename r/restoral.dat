Reliability of individual components has improved and some networks can achieve availabilities {{on the order of}} 0. 99999. However, the routing technologies used by these networks, like Open Shortest Path First and Border Gateway Protocol can create system-wide vulnerabilities. Some of the vulnerabilities include widespread outages such as earthquakes and floods, unintentional device mis-configurations, and hacker attacks. One of the leading-edge architectures to address system-wide outages is the use of a dual-core backbone, which uses two independent long-haul cores to connect the network’s sites.

These cyclostationarity-exploiting techniques do not need training signals, the knowledge of array manifold, or noise characteristics. The least-square spectral self-coherent <b>restoral</b> (LS-SCORE) algorithm has been presented by [3] {{to deal with the}} problem of blind adaptive signal extraction. As the number of data snapshots approaches infinity, it has been shown in [3] that the performance of the LS-SCORE algorithm approaches that of the conventional beamforming methods developed by maximizing the output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). The a[*][*]priori information required by the LS-SCORE algorithm is only the cycle frequency of the SOI. Hence, its performance is sensitive to the accuracy of the presumed cycle frequency. However, the actual cycle frequency may not be known very well in some applications due to, for example, the phenomenon of Doppler shift. Accordingly, several existing works deal with the cycle frequency error (CFE) have been presented by [6 – 8]. The robust cyclostationarity-exploiting beamforming methods presented by [6, 7] are in conjunction with the SCORE algorithms. These methods developed an iterative procedure to find an appropriate estimate of the cycle frequency of the SOI. Recently, a robust cyclostationarity-exploiting direction-finding approach [8] adopts the average of the cyclic correlation matrices in a presumed range of cycle frequencies including the actual one to alleviate the performance degradation due to the CFE. Nevertheless, the aforementioned methods consider the case of one SOI with CFE.|$|E

However, because MOD 35 is by design clear sky conservative (i. e., it identifies "not clear" pixels), certain situations exist in which pixels identified by MOD 35 as "cloudy" are nevertheless likely to be poor retrieval candidates. For instance, {{near the edge of}} clouds or within broken cloud fields, a given 1 km MODIS field of view (FOV) may in fact only be partially cloudy. This can be problematic for the MOD 06 retrievals because in these cases the assumptions of a completely overcast homogenous cloudy FOV and 1 -dimensional plane-parallel radiative transfer no longer hold, and subsequent retrievals will be of low confidence. Furthermore, some pixels may be identified by MOD 35 as "cloudy" for reasons other than the presence of clouds, such as scenes with thick smoke or lofted dust, and should therefore not be retrieved as clouds. With such situations in mind, a Clear Sky <b>Restoral</b> (CSR) algorithm was introduced in C 5 that attempts to identify pixels expected to be poor retrieval candidates.

Bone was formed in cavities, leading to <b>restoral</b> of nearly cleaved trabeculae. For the first time, effects in PTH-treated rats were analyzed longitudinally. Introduction: Our aims were to over time (1) determine changes in trabecular thickness and number after PTH, (2) compare responses to PTH between the meta- and epiphysis, (3) determine effects of PTH on mineralization and mechanical properties, (4) determine locations of new bone formation due to PTH on a microlevel, and (5) determine the predictive value of bone structural properties for gain in bone mass after PTH. Methods: Adult rats were divided into ovariectomy (OVX; n = 8), SHAM-OVX (n = 8), and OVX and PTH treatment (n = 9). Between weeks 8 and 14, PTH rats received daily subcutaneous PTH injections (60 µg/kg/day). At weeks 0, 8, 10, 12, and 14, in vivo micro-CT scans were made of the proximal and diaphyseal tibia. After sacrifice, all tibiae were tested in three-point bending. Results: PTH increased bone volume fraction linearly over time in meta- and epiphysis, accompanied by increased trabecular thickness in both and increased trabecular number only in the latter one. CT-estimated mineralization increased in trabecular and remained constant in cortical bone. Ultimate load and energy were increased and ultimate displacement and stiffness unaltered compared to SHAM rats. For those trabeculae analyzed, bone was formed initially on places where it was most beneficial for increasing their strength and later on to all surfaces. © 2009 The Author(s) ...|$|E

With the advent of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua platforms, simultaneous global/daily 1 km retrievals of cloud optical thickness and effective particle size are provided, {{as well as the}} derived water path. In addition, the cloud product (MOD 06 /MYD 06 for MODIS Terra and Aqua, respectively) provides separate effective radii results using the l. 6, 2. 1, and 3. 7 ~m spectral channels. Cloud retrieval statistics are highly sensitive to how a pixel identified as being "notclear" by a cloud mask (e. g., the MOD 35 /MYD 35 product) is determined to be useful for an optical retrieval based on a 1 -D cloud model. The Collection 5 MODIS retrieval algorithm removed pixels associated with cloud'edges as well as ocean pixels with partly cloudy elements in the 250 m MODIS cloud mask - part of the so-called Clear Sky <b>Restoral</b> (CSR) algorithm. Collection 6 attempts retrievals for those two pixel populations, but allows a user to isolate or filter out the populations via CSR pixel-level Quality Assessment (QA) assignments. In this paper, using the preliminary Collection 6 MOD 06 product, we present global and regional statistical results of marine warm cloud retrieval sensitivities to the cloud edge and 250 m partly cloudy pixel populations. As expected, retrievals for these pixels are generally consistent with a breakdown of the ID cloud model. While optical thickness for these suspect pixel populations may have some utility for radiative studies, the retrievals should be used with extreme caution for process and microphysical studies...|$|E

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 In Air Trafﬁc Control (ATC), communications outages {{may lead to}} immediate loss of communications or radar contact with aircraft. In the short term, there may be safety related issues as important services including power systems, ATC, or communications for ﬁrst responders during a disaster {{may be out of}} service. Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial damage from airline delays and cancellations may occur in the long term. This highlights the different types of impact that may occur after a disaster or other geographic event. The question is How do we evaluate and improve the ability of a mission-critical network to perform its mission during geographically correlated failures? To answer this question, we consider several large and small networks, including a multi-layer ATC Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) network known as SWIM. This research presents a number of tools to analyze and mitigate both long and short term geographic vulnerabilities in mission critical networks. To provide context for the tools, a disaster planning approach is presented that focuses on Resiliency Evaluation, Provisioning Demands, Topology Design, and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities. In the Resilience Evaluation, we propose a novel metric known as the Network Impact Resilience (NIR) metric and a reduced state based algorithm to compute the NIR known as the Self-Pruning Network State Generation (SP-NSG) algorithm. These tools not only evaluate the resiliency of a network with a variety of possible network tests, but they also identify geographic vulnerabilities. Related to the Demand Provisioning and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities, we present methods that focus on provisioning in preparation for rerouting of demands immediately following an event based on Service Level Agreements (SLA) and fast rerouting of demands around geographic vulnerabilities using Multi-Topology Routing (MTR). The Topology Design area focuses on adding nodes to improve topologies to be more resistant to geographic vulnerabilities. Additionally, a set of network performance tools are proposed for use with mission critical networks that can model at least up to 2 nd order network delay statistics. The ﬁrst is an extension of the Queueing Network Analyzer (QNA) to model multi-layer networks (and speciﬁcally SOA networks). The second is a network decomposition tool based on Linear Algebraic Queueing Theory (LAQT). This is one of the ﬁrst extensive uses of LAQT for network modeling. Beneﬁts, results, and limitations of both methods are described.
