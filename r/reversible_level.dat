Level 2 is the first level that is directly usable formost scientific applications; its value {{is much greater than}} the lower levels. Level 2 data sets tend to be less voluminous than Level 1 data because they have been reduced temporally, spatially, or spectrally. Level 3 data sets are generally smaller than lower level data sets and thus can be dealt with without incurring a great deal of data handling overhead. These data tend to be generally more useful for many applications. The regular spatial and temporal organization of Level 3 datasets makes it feasible to readily combine data from different sources.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{trend in}} electronics involves {{the development of}} materials, mechanical designs and manufacturing strategies that enable the use of unconventional substrates, such as polymer films, metal foils, paper sheets or rubber slabs. The last possibility is particularly challenging because the systems must accommodate not only bending but also stretching. Although several approaches are available for the electronics, a persistent difficulty is in power supplies that have similar mechanical properties, to allow their cointegration with the electronics. Here we introduce a set of materials and design concepts for a rechargeable lithium ion battery technology that exploits thin, low modulus silicone elastomers as substrates, with a segmented design in the active materials, and unusual “self-similar” interconnect structures between them. The result enables <b>reversible</b> <b>levels</b> of stretchability up to 300 %, while maintaining capacity densities of ~ 1. 1 mAh cm‑ 2.

Other {{key members of the}} original development team - such as chief planner Tsuyoshi Kobayashi, visual chief Yoshihiko Arai, and sound designer Kanako Kakino - contributed to the remake to surpass the standards of the original game. The remake features a graphical upgrade, redesigned characters, updated gameplay, and remade cut scenes using cel-shaded animation. The original game features voices in a fictional language unique to each character, but these have been re-acted in Japanese - although the player has the option of hearing either. The voice actors include Kumiko Watanabe as Klonoa, Bin Shimada as Joka, Akemi Kanda as Huepow, and Yuko Minaguchi as Lephise. Many small modifications were made to the gameplay to make it [...] "much more intuitive and easier to control", according to producer Yoshizawa. These include the speed at which Klonoa runs, the length of his shot, and adjusting the hit range of the enemies. Additions to the gameplay are centered around unlockable features, such as additional costumes and <b>reversible</b> <b>levels</b> designed for [...] "the hardcore fans".|$|R
40|$|RpoS, the stationary-phase {{sigma factor}} of Escherichia coli, is {{responsible}} for increased transcription of an array of genes when cells enter stationary phase and under certain stress conditions. RpoS is rapidly degraded during exponential phase and much more slowly during stationary phase; the resulting changes in RpoS accumulation {{play an important role}} in providing differential expression of RpoS-dependent gene expression. It has previously been shown that rapid degradation of RpoS during exponential growth depends on RssB (also called SprE and MviA), a protein with homology to the family of response regulators, and on the ClpXP protease. We find that RssB regulation of proteolysis does not extend to another ClpXP substrate, bacteriophage lambda O protein, suggesting that RssB acts on the specific substrate RpoS rather than on the protease. In addition, the activity of RpoS is down-regulated by RssB when degradation is blocked. In cells blocked for RpoS degradation by a mutation in clpP, cells devoid of RssB show a four- to fivefold-higher activity of an RpoS-dependent reporter fusion than cells overproducing RssB. Therefore, RssB allows specific environmental regulation of RpoS accumulation and may also modulate activity. The regulation of degradation provides an irreversible switch, while the regulation of activity may provide a second, presumably <b>reversible</b> <b>level</b> of control...|$|E

Characteristics of the heat shock response were an intermediate, <b>reversible</b> <b>level</b> of injury, appearing as though dead; greater recovery from heat shock by G. aequinoctiale (57 %) than M. affine (30 %) that supplemented higher temperature survival by G. aequinoctiale; and lack of protection generated by conditioning at sublethal temperature. Heatinduced mortality is attributed to an abrupt, accelerated water loss at 50 °C for M. affine and 54 °C for G. aequinoctiale, not to the species (M. affine) that loses water the slowest and has the lower activation energy, Ea as a measure of cuticular boundary effectiveness. These temperatures where water loss increases sharply are not critical transition temperatures because Arrhenius analysis causes them to be erased (uninterrupted Boltzmann function) and Ea fails to change when cuticular lipid from these beetles is removed. Our conclusion is that the temperature thresholds for survival and accelerated water loss closely match, and the key survival element in hot and dry environments contributing to wide distribution of G. aequinoctiale and M. affine derives from rising temperature prompting entry into quiescence and a resistance in cuticular lipid fluidity...|$|E
40|$|The {{papers in}} this thesis {{investigate}} issues related to investment with particular reference to the mining sector in Zimbabwe. Issues analysed are the levels of risk premia that attract investment in minerals in developing countries, whether firms in the sector manage to reduce operation to optimal levels consistent with theoretical predictions, {{and the extent to}} which irreversibility has reduced investment expenditures. Paper I describes the structure of the Zimbabwean mining industry. It is shown that the importance of the mining sector has been declining over time yet it has remained as the most important foreign currency earner for the economy. Depressed mineral prices, foreign exchange shortages and a hostile domestic political climate have impacted negatively on mineral investments. The government is focused on an indigenisation program whose success could depend on a detailed understanding of effects uncertainty in the investment climate, historical mining returns, and the potential of attracting appropriate investment for small-scale operations. Paper II analyses risk-risk premia on mining investments in Zimbabwe, using the risk adjusted Hotelling model to examine the level of risk-premia required for investment in mining to take place. Empirical results show that a risk-premium higher than 27 % is required. For that reason it is highly unlikely that much mining investment will take place in Zimbabwe. Paper III examines extraction costs for mining firms in Zimbabwe and tests whether the behaviour of firms satisfy optimality conditions derived from inter-temporal profit maximisation using parameter estimates from a dual cost minimisation problem. Results reject the hypothesis that firms optimise inter-temporal profits and show a positive relationship between cumulative extraction and costs that suggests that ore stock depletion matters. For that reason investment in the sector depend on the possibility of raising sufficient funds to enough to cover setting up costs for frequent new operations due to the small-scale nature of deposits. Paper IV examines the effects of irreversibility on mining investments in Zimbabwe. The path of reversible investment determined by the equality of the marginal-revenue-product of capital to its user-cost is used to predict irreversible investment based on individual-firm uncertainty. It is assumed that the level of capital-stock deviates from its desired level and that the distribution of the deviations can be derived. The distribution is then used to estimate the implied effects of the uncertainty which underly the observed regular investment-pattern. Results show that the individual-firm uncertainty must have deviation values greater than 0. 166 contrasted with values less than 0. 04 for the observed investment-ratio. The result implies that the irreversible capital stock was less than 68 % of the <b>reversible</b> <b>level</b> when there was positive investment...|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of insulin on {{lipoprotein}} synthesis and secretion by the liver, apoprotein and lipid levels were measured in primary rat liver cell cultures grown on fibronectin-coated dishes. Triglycerides, phospholipids, apoprotein (apo) B, apo-E, and apo-C-III 3 all accumulated in culture media linearly for periods up to 20 h. During incubations, cellular triglyceride contents increased slightly, while cellular apoprotein and phospholipid contents remained constant. In the absence of insulin, rates of accumulation in media of triglycerides, apo-B, apo-C-III 3, and apo-E were 2. 5 +/- 0. 3 micrograms/mg and 33 +/- 5, 24 +/- 3, and 162 +/- 32 ng/mg cell protein per h, respectively. On gel permeation chromatography and density gradient ultracentrifugation, the majority of apoproteins in media {{were found to be}} associated with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and very little eluted or sedimented with albumin. Incubations in the presence of 50 - 800 microU/ml of insulin resulted in dose-dependent decreases of triglyceride, phospholipid, apo-B, and apo-E accumulation in the media, paralleled by increases in the cellular contents of these lipoprotein components. The inhibitory effects of insulin on secretion were <b>reversible.</b> <b>Levels</b> of apo-C-III 3 and albumin were not affected by insulin. In addition to decreasing secretory rates, the proportion of apo-B, apo-E, and apo-C-III 3 associated with VLDL also decreased after the addition of insulin. Concomitantly, the proportion of apo-B eluting with LDL and apo-C-III 3, and apo-E eluting near albumin increased. Control experiments, in which exogenous 125 I-VLDL or endogenously labeled [14 C]VLDL were added to cultures, revealed that the insulin-induced differences in VLDL accumulation and the lipid association of media apoproteins were not due to differences in the processing of VLDL by cells cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} insulin. Therefore, it appears that insulin may inhibit the secretion of VLDL perhaps by reducing the intracellular association of lipids and apoproteins...|$|R

Forty-three patients aged ≥ 65 years or with contraindications against cisplatin treatment (36 males and seven females: median age 66 years; range 48 – 75 : PS 0 = 11, PS 1 = 19, PS 2 = 13) received intravenous (i. v.) gemcitabine 1000 mg m– 2, followed by vinorelbine 25 mg m– 2 i. v. on day 1 and 8 every 21 days. Fifteen patients (34. 9 %) achieved partial remission (confidence interval: 27. 6 – 42. 2 %) for a median duration of 6 months; the median survival of these patients has not yet been reached. A further 15 had stable disease for a median of 4 months and a median survival of 7 months. The 10 patients (23. 2 %) who experienced disease progression had a median survival of 4 months. Three patients are not evaluable. The 1 -year actuarial survival rate is 31. 1 %. The treatment was well tolerated: only 35 % of the patients had grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia on day 14, none experienced episodes of neutropenic fever, and {{there was no evidence of}} severe haematological toxicity upon recycling.

The first level RCT from RGB to HSV provide higher reduction in number of unique hue components, thus gives higher compression in case of natural images. The first level RCT followed by the second level RCT from HSV to YUV helps to yield small number of unique Y component values. DC level shifting and twos complement operation will be applied as preprocessing steps to second level RCT.

To understand the importance of PEPC kinase in relation to its target PEPC in terms of CAM performance, the expression of the genes encoding the two enzymes was investigated in four species of Clusia that have photosynthetic patterns ranging from C 3 photosynthesis to constitutive CAM. By linking changes in the expression of PEPC and PEPC kinase to day/night patterns of leaf gas exchange, organic acid, and soluble sugar contents under different environmental conditions, the genetic and metabolic limitations to CAM plasticity were assessed. The results indicate that PEPC expression is a major factor underpinning the genotypic capacity for CAM and that PEPC kinase expression does not appear to limit CAM. The day/night regulation of Ppck transcript abundance was found to be a consequence of CAM and the day/night cycling of associated metabolites, rather than the primary controlling factor for the temporal separation of carboxylation processes...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{disease is}} the leading cause of {{mortality}} in western countries. Apart from congenital and anatomical alterations, ischemia is the most common agent causing myocardial damage. During ischemia, a sudden decrease in oxygen concentration alters cardiomyocyte function and compromises cell survival. The calcium handling machinery, which regulates the main functional features of a cardiomyocyte, is heavily compromised during acute hypoxic events. Alterations in calcium dynamics have been linked to both short- and long-term consequences of ischemia, ranging from arrhythmias to heart failure. In this perspective, we aimed at investigating the calcium dynamics in functional cardiomyocytes during the early phase of a hypoxic event. For this purpose, we developed a microfluidic system specifically designed for controlling fast oxygen concentration dynamics through a gas micro-exchanger allowing in line analysis of intracellular calcium concentration by confocal microscopy. Experimental results show that exposure of Fluo- 4 loaded neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to hypoxic conditions induced changes in intracellular Ca(2 +) transients. Such behavior was reversible and was detected for hypoxic levels below 5 % of oxygen partial pressure. The observed changes in Ca(2 +) dynamics were mimicked using specific L-type Ca(2 +) channel antagonists, suggesting that alterations in calcium channel function occur at low oxygen <b>levels.</b> <b>Reversible</b> alteration in ion channel function, that takes place in response to changes in cellular oxygen, might represent an adaptive mechanism of cardiopreservation during ischemia...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{models for}} {{hematopoiesis}} have been proposed: determinism and stochastic theory. For {{the stem cells}} and other undifferentiated blood cells in the bone marrow, the determination is generally explained by the determinism theory of haematopoiesis, saying that colony stimulating factors and other factors of the haematopoietic microenvironment determine the cells to follow a certain path of cell differentiation. This is the classical way of describing haematopoiesis. In stochastic theory, undifferentiated blood cells differentiate to specific cell types by randomness. This theory has been supported by experiments showing that within a population of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, underlying stochastic variability {{in the distribution of}} Sca-1, a stem cell factor, subdivides the population into groups exhibiting variable rates of cellular differentiation. For example, under the influence of erythropoietin (an erythrocyte-differentiation factor), a subpopulation of cells (as defined by the levels of Sca-1) differentiated into erythrocytes at a sevenfold higher rate {{than the rest of the}} population. [...] Furthermore, it was shown that if allowed to grow, this subpopulation re-established the original subpopulation of cells, supporting the theory that this is a stochastic, <b>reversible</b> process. Another <b>level</b> at which stochasticity may be important is in the process of apoptosis and self-renewal. In this case, the haematopoietic microenvironment prevails upon some of the cells to survive and some, on the other hand, to perform apoptosis and die. By regulating this balance between different cell types, the bone marrow can alter the quantity of different cells to ultimately be produced.|$|R
