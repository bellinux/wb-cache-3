5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits with <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> H. W.

25|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw {{election}} or succession of Republican presidents Dwight D.

Voters liked Ike much more than they liked the GOP, and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position. After 1970, the liberal wing began to fade away.|$|E

The plurality opinion, signed jointly by three justices appointed by <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> H. W. Bush, ignited a firestorm of criticism from conservatives. Kennedy had stated at least as early as 1989 that, in order to uphold precedent, he might not vote to overturn Roe.

25|$|In the United States, zero tolerance, as an {{approach}} against drugs, was originally {{designed as a}} part of the War on Drugs under <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> H.W. Bush, ostensibly to curb the transfer of drugs at US borders. Law-enforcement was to target the drug users rather than the transporters or suppliers under the assumptions that harsh sentences and strict enforcement of personal use would reduce demand and, therefore, strike at root cause of the drug problem. The policy did not require additional laws; instead existing law was enacted with less leniency. Similar concepts in other countries, such as Sweden, Italy, Japan, Singapore China, India, and Russia have since been labeled zero tolerance.|$|E

25|$|Hawkins was {{frustrated}} from the {{relative lack of}} success that he achieved during the 1980s presidencies of <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> HW Bush. They were the most conservative presidents since the 1920s, and {{members of his own}} party were moving to the right and viewed Hawkins' old-school New Dealer stance as outdated. His greatest setback was George HW Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, sometimes called the Hawkins-Kennedy Civil Rights Act. It would have reversed six Supreme Court decisions made in the previous year that had shifted the burden of proof of discriminating hiring practices of minorities on women from the employer to the employee. It remains the only successful veto of a civil rights act in United States history. Hawkins, old and tired, retired in 1991. Bush would sign a watered-down bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, after Hawkins's retirement.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that younger voters tend to vote mostly for Democratic {{candidates}} in recent years. Despite supporting <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> H. W. Bush, the young have {{voted in favor of}} the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since Bill Clinton in 1992, {{and are more likely to}} identify as liberals than the general population. In the 2004 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry received 54% of the vote from voters of the age group 18–29, while Republican George W. Bush received 45% of the vote from the same age group. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats received 60% of the vote from the same age group. Polls suggest that younger voters tend to be more liberal than the general population and have more liberal views than the public on same-sex marriage and universal healthcare, helping Barack Obama carry 66% of their votes in 2008. The Young Democrats of America are an affiliated organization of members of the party younger than 36 that advocates for youth issues and works for youth voter turnout.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, Zaire enjoyed warm {{relations}} with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including Richard Nixon, <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> H. W. Bush. Relations did cool significantly in 1974–1975 over Mobutu's increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations of American foreign policy), and plummeted to an all-time low {{in the summer of}} 1975, when Mobutu accused the Central Intelligence Agency of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (in absentia) a former head of the Central Bank (Albert N'dele). However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu's staunchest critics, Nzongola-Ntalaja, speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule. In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries found each other supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> <b>and</b> <b>George</b> W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
