50|$|One common {{style of}} {{radio-controlled}} clock uses time signals transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters, which emit a time code {{that can be}} demodulated and displayed by the <b>radio</b> <b>controlled</b> clock. The <b>radio</b> <b>controlled</b> clock will contain an accurate time base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable. Other <b>radio</b> <b>controlled</b> clocks use the time signals transmitted by dedicated transmitters in the shortwave bands. Systems using dedicated time signal stations can achieve accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds.|$|R
