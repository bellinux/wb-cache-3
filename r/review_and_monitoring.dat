40|$|Introduction: A {{trend for}} organisations {{to change from}} single to {{multiple}} project management has been observed {{over the last couple}} of decades. Organizations shifted their focus from single project management towards the simultaneous management of the whole set of projects as one entity – project portfolio. New multi-project settings require a new management approach and practices to successfully manage a portfolio. A common practice in organizations is to evaluate projects after they had been carried out. At that point not much can be done and it is impossible to improve performance and prevent failure. Hence, problems that occur in projects’ implementation phase remain unsolved and even unidentified. Constant control, <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of projects’ performance in the implementation phase could lead to the problematic portfolio areas being spotted and timely management decisions being made in order to improve the overall portfolio performance. Problem: How do organisations manage projects within a portfolio that perform poorly in the implementation phase? Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is: to describe to what extent and in what ways organizations control, review and monitor project performances in the implementation phase; to identify if organisations use any methods, tools or techniques in order to spot projects that perform poorly according to their expectations; and to discover what happens to the poorly performing projects in the implementation phase after they were identified. Method: An electronic qualitative questionnaire had been constructed and sent out to the 46 sampled Swedish companies currently running project portfolios. 115 most suitable respondents had been chosen to answer the survey. Frame of Reference: Theoretical framework is built on the literature within project portfolio management field, mostly concerning control, <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of projects of projects’ performance within their implementation phase; practices used to manage poorly performing projects as well as the value of organizational learning. Conclusion: The research results show that even though majority of the studied organizations are aware and striving towards efficient project portfolio control, <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring,</b> a lot of space for improvement still remains. Results reveal that organizations are trying to keep track of projects’ performance within a portfolio, however, very few poorly performing are identified. Moreover, the management practices for underperforming projects are still very limited if not non-existent...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{investigates the}} concept of the Behavioural Based Safety (BBS) approach, the steps involved and the problems encountered. A case study approach comprising of the Oil and Gas companies practicing BBS had been chosen. The methods to retrieve information includes the semi-structured interview, questionnaires survey and site observation. Four basic steps of the BBS approach are identification, observation, intervention, <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Further, an extra element to be observed during the observation steps was found. The findings show that the BBS approach experienced in the Malaysian Oil and Gas Industry are able to minimise accident, change unsafe behaviour and improve quality and safety environment...|$|E

30|$|Unlike Clean Air Act {{which had}} an effect on the overall health and {{distribution}} of the coal industry, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 had a direct impact on coal waste management by directly regulating disposal practices. Under this act the MSHA has promulgated rules to regulate the design, <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of coal waste disposal areas (30 CFR. 77.214, 30 CFR. 77.215, and 30 CFR. 77.216). A professional engineer certified design is required for impounding structures and the location of underground workings in relation to them. MSHA review of the design is in depth and can be lengthy. Requirements for monitoring of the impounding structure are extensive and include inspection by one of the engineers at the mine or another “qualified person” (every 7  days), Federal MSHA inspectors (2 – 4 times per year), and state inspectors. The MSHA review and inspections are focused on protecting the miners and nearby public for health and safety.|$|E
