5000|$|This {{soft rock}} song {{tells the story}} of a {{condemned}} criminal on the run to Mexico. Told from a first-person point of view, it describes how an outlaw and convicted multiple murderer, on the <b>run</b> from <b>a</b> death-by-hanging <b>sentence,</b> has to [...] "ride like the wind" [...] to reach [...] "the border of Mexico," [...] where, presumably, the posse apparently in pursuit of him will not be able to reach him.|$|R

Her {{name is a}} play on words as {{it sounds like the}} {{pronunciation}} of the letters [...] "LMNOP", fitting with the content of the novel. She is a strong and intelligent young woman who uses her determination and persistence to survive the hardship placed on the island of Nollop by the high council. Towards the end of the novel, she is the only one in her family left on the island and is in charge of Enterprise 32. She eventually <b>runs</b> across <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> in her father's farewell letter that will save the citizens of Nollop from the oppression they are experiencing, and allow her family to return to the island.|$|R
5000|$|... "What's in the box" [...] is {{a popular}} Improv fundraiser in which the hosts gather a variety of prizes, {{put them in a}} box, and sell off raffle tickets for various prices. Halfway through the show the {{officials}} will give a hint distantly related to the contents of the box when time comes the official will explain the clue usually in <b>a</b> <b>run</b> on <b>sentence.</b> <b>As</b> prizes are given out the teams are encouraged to say there are more as the official prompts by saying [...] "But wait..." [...] prior to pulling out another object. The many mystery prizes within the box will be revealed and usually tied to a theme by the presenters as drawn out of the box. These prizes are often [...] "silly" [...] prizes such as odd books and bars of soap as well as Canadian Improv Games merchandise. Often a [...] "real" [...] prize will also be offered for selection (such as chocolates, CDs and gift cards), in which case two raffle winners are selected and often have to participate in a small competition to see who gets to choose their prize first.|$|R

50|$|The bill amends {{the federal}} {{criminal}} US {{code of the}} United States title 18, Part II, Chapter 227, Subchapter A, Section 3553 Imposition of <b>a</b> <b>Sentence.</b> It aimed to authorize a federal court to impose <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> below <b>a</b> statutory minimum if necessary to avoid violating federal provisions prescribing factors courts must consider in imposing <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> It requires the court to give parties notice of its intent to impose <b>a</b> lower <b>sentence</b> and to state in writing the factors requiring such <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{specific}} type of disjunct is the [...] (or sentence adverbial), which modifies <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> or <b>a</b> clause within <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> to convey the mood, attitude or sentiments of the speaker, rather than an adverb modifying a verb, an adjective or another adverb within <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> simple <b>sentence</b> {{consists}} {{of only one}} clause. <b>A</b> compound <b>sentence</b> {{consists of}} two or more independent clauses. <b>A</b> complex <b>sentence</b> has at least one independent clause plus at least one dependent clause. A set of words with no independent clause may be <b>an</b> incomplete <b>sentence,</b> also called <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> fragment.|$|R
5000|$|An example {{will help}} to explain this. Suppose we define the quine of a phrase to be the {{quotation}} of the phrase followed by the phrase itself.

40|$|Suppose we are {{prepared}} to conceive the meaning of <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> as <b>a</b> classification criterion which enables us to establish whether something is or is not a justification to believe that sentence. Which properties of the intuitive notion of justification to believe <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> are essential from this point of view? And how might a theoretical notion of justification for <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> be defined? In Sections 2 - 5 some properties are suggested as essential, in particular Intentionality (a justification is always a justification for <b>a</b> <b>sentence),</b> Defeasibility (<b>a</b> justification for <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>A</b> can cease to be a justification for A as new information is received), and Epistemic transparency (a justification for A is not a justification for A unless it is recognized as such by an idealized knowing subject). In Section 6 the sketch of a definition is proposed, according to which a justification for <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>A</b> is a cognitive state in which the subject has at his disposal a certain amount of information, and the hypothesis that A is the best explanation of that information. Section 7 shows how the notion defined escapes a crucial objection to defeasible justifications recently stated by P. Casalegno...|$|R
