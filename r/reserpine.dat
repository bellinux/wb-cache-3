5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, <b>reserpine,</b> colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
25|$|High dose {{studies in}} rodents found <b>reserpine</b> to cause fibroadenoma {{of the breast}} and {{malignant}} tumors of the seminal vesicles among others. Early suggestions that <b>reserpine</b> causes breast cancer in women (risk approximately doubled) were not confirmed. It may also cause hyperprolactinemia.|$|E
25|$|Tryptophan is the {{starting}} material in the biosynthetic pathway of <b>reserpine,</b> and is converted to tryptamine by tryptophan decarboxylase enzyme. Tryptamine is combined with secologanin {{in the presence of}} strictosidine synthetase enzyme and yields strictosidine. Various enzymatic conversion reactions lead to the synthesis of <b>reserpine</b> from strictosidine.|$|E
25|$|The {{daily dose}} of <b>reserpine</b> in {{antihypertensive}} treatment is as low as 0.1 to 0.25mg. The use of <b>reserpine</b> as an antipsychotic drug had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as adjunctive treatment, {{in combination with other}} antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from <b>reserpine.</b> Doses for this kind of adjunctive goal can be kept low, resulting in better tolerability. Originally, doses of 0.5mg to 40mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> {{may be used}} as a {{sedative}} for horses.|$|E
25|$|The monoamine {{hypothesis}} was compelling, especially based on apparently successful clinical results with early antidepressant drugs, {{but even at}} the time there were discrepant findings. Only a minority of patients given the serotonin-depleting drug <b>reserpine</b> became depressed; in fact <b>reserpine</b> even acted as an antidepressant in many cases. This was inconsistent with the initial monoamine theory which said depression was caused by neurotransmitter deficiency.|$|E
25|$|At {{doses of}} less than 0.2mg/day, <b>reserpine</b> has few side effects, {{the most common of}} which is nasal congestion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> {{has been}} {{discontinued}} in the UK {{for some years}} due to its numerous interactions and side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{vesicular}} monoamine transporter (VMAT). This normally transports free intracellular norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the presynaptic nerve terminal into presynaptic vesicles for subsequent release into the synaptic cleft ("exocytosis"). Unprotected neurotransmitters are metabolized by MAO (as {{well as by}} COMT) in the cytoplasm and consequently never excite the post-synaptic cell. Thus, <b>reserpine</b> decreases metabolic rate of monoamine neurotransmitters; but also decreases magnitude of monoamine release.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> passes into {{breast milk}} and is harmful to breast-fed infants, and should {{therefore}} be avoided during breastfeeding if possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> {{was also}} highly {{influential}} {{in promoting the}} thought of a biogenic amine hypothesis of depressionâ€” see Everett & Tolman, 1959.|$|E
25|$|In mice pre-treated with <b>reserpine,</b> an oral dose of 0.3mg/kg d-synephrine {{significantly}} {{reversed the}} hypothermia, while l-synephrine required {{a dose of}} 1mg/kg to be effective.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much concern about <b>reserpine</b> causing {{depression}} leading to suicide. However, this was reported in uncontrolled studies using doses averaging 0.5mg per day.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> almost irreversibly {{blocks the}} uptake (and storage) of {{norepinephrine}} (i.e. noradrenaline) and dopamine into synaptic vesicles by inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2).|$|E
25|$|Reserpine-mediated {{depletion}} of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapses {{is often cited}} as evidence to the theory that {{depletion of}} the monoamine neurotransmitters causes subsequent depression in humans (c.f. monoamine hypothesis). However, this claim is not without controversy. The reserpine-induced depression is considered by some researchers to be a myth, while others claim that teas made out of the plant roots containing <b>reserpine</b> have a calming, sedative action that can actually be considered antidepressant. Notably, <b>reserpine</b> was the first compound shown {{to be an effective}} antidepressant in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> (also {{known by}} trade names Raudixin, Serpalan, Serpasil) is an indole alkaloid, antipsychotic, and {{antihypertensive}} drug {{that has been}} used for the control of high blood pressure and for the relief of psychotic symptoms, although because of the development of better drugs for these purposes and because of its numerous side-effects, it is rarely used today. The antihypertensive actions of <b>reserpine</b> are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines (among other monoamine neurotransmitters) from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
25|$|Another {{frequent}} use of <b>reserpine</b> is {{in the field of}} mass spectrometry where it is widely used as a reference standard owing to its availability, ease of ionization under electrospray conditions and stability in solution.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, <b>reserpine</b> has a {{peripheral}} action {{in many parts}} of the body, resulting in a preponderance of the effects of the cholinergic part of the autonomous nervous system on the GI tract, smooth muscles, blood vessels, etc.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} <b>reserpine</b> is still available {{as part of}} combination drugs {{for the treatment of}} hypertension, in most cases they contain also a diuretic and/or a vasodilator like hydralazine. These combinations are currently regarded as second choice drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{antihypertensive}} {{effects of}} methyldopa, mecamylamine, <b>reserpine</b> and veratrum alkaloids {{may be reduced}} by sympathomimetics. Beta-adrenergic antagonists may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Antacids increase the rate of pseudoephedrine absorption, while kaolin decreases it.|$|E
25|$|The {{antidepressant}} {{effect of}} a tricyclic, a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by Roland Kuhn in a Swiss psychiatric hospital. Antihistamine derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as neuroleptics. Although in 1955 <b>reserpine</b> was shown {{to be more effective}} than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as sedatives and antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reserpine</b> {{is one of}} the few {{antihypertensive}} {{medications that}} have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce mortality: The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group in Anti-hypertensive Agents, and the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program. However, these studies are dated, with the results of the most recent study being published in 1991.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Woodward {{synthesized}} many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, <b>reserpine,</b> chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward {{opened up a}} new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{researchers}} {{theorized that}} depression {{was caused by}} a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of <b>reserpine</b> and isoniazid in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms. During the 1960s and 70s, manic-depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder (now most commonly known as bipolar disorder) which was distinguished from (unipolar) depression. The terms unipolar and bipolar had been coined by German psychiatrist Karl Kleist.|$|E
25|$|Sugar beet is an {{important}} source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide rotenone is obtained from roots of Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian and <b>reserpine.</b> Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized bald cypress roots, termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.|$|E
25|$|The first {{antipsychotic}} drug, chlorpromazine (known {{under the}} trade name Largactil in Europe and Thorazine in the United States), was first synthesised in France in 1950. Pierre Deniker, a psychiatrist of the Saint-Anne Psychiatric Centre in Paris, {{is credited with}} first recognising the specificity of action of the drug in psychosis in 1952. Deniker travelled with a colleague to the United States and Canada promoting the drug at medical conferences in 1954. The first publication regarding its use in North America {{was made in the}} same year by the Canadian psychiatrist Heinz Lehmann, who was based in Montreal. Also in 1954 another antipsychotic, <b>reserpine,</b> was first used by an American psychiatrist based in New York, Nathan S. Kline. At a Paris-based colloquium on neuroleptics (antipsychotics) in 1955 a series of psychiatric studies were presented by, among others, Hans Hoff (Vienna), Dr.Ihsan Aksel (Istanbul), Felix Labarth (Basle), Linford Rees (London), Sarro (Barcelona), Manfred Bleuler (Zurich), Willi Mayer-Gross (Birmingham), Winford (Washington) and Denber (New York) attesting to the effective and concordant action of the new drugs in the treatment of psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of <b>reserpine</b> and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E

500|$|Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very {{widespread}} in nature, and often toxic, {{found in many}} medicinal plants. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as Berberis and Mahonia), caffeine (Coffea), cocaine (Coca), ephedrine (Ephedra), morphine (opium poppy), [...] nicotine (tobacco), <b>reserpine</b> (Rauwolfia serpentina), quinidine and quinine (Cinchona), vincamine (Vinca minor), and vincristine (Catharanthus roseus).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reserpine</b> {{is rarely}} {{used in the}} {{management}} of hypertension today. [...] <b>Reserpine</b> is listed as an option by the JNC 7. In 1987, <b>reserpine</b> was considered a second-line adjunct agent for patients who were uncontrolled on a diuretic alone when cost was an issue. However, there are far safer generic first/second-line medications available today that can be combined with diuretics, notably the ACE inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor antagonists.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reserpine</b> is {{no longer}} {{available}} in the United Kingdom; however it is still available in the United States ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reserpine</b> {{is used as}} a long-acting {{tranquilizer}} {{to subdue}} excitable or difficult horses and has been used illicitly for the sedation of show horses, for-sale horses, and in other circumstances where a [...] "quieter" [...] horse might be desired.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reserpine</b> can cause: nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, gastric intolerance, gastric {{ulceration}} (due {{to increased}} cholinergic activity in gastric tissue and impaired mucosal quality), stomach cramps and diarrhea are noted. The drug causes hypotension and bradycardia and may worsen asthma. Congested nose and erectile dysfunction are other consequences of alpha-blockade.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reserpine</b> was {{isolated}} in 1952 from the dried root of Rauwolfia serpentina (Indian snakeroot), {{which had been}} known as Sarpagandha and had been used for centuries in India {{for the treatment of}} insanity, as well as fever and snakebitesâ€” Mahatma Gandhi used it as a tranquilizer. It was first used in the United States by Robert Wallace Wilkins in 1950. [...] Its molecular structure was elucidated in 1953 and natural configuration published in 1955. It was introduced in 1954, two years after chlorpromazine. The first total synthesis was accomplished by R. B. Woodward in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|In {{work that}} {{earned him a}} Nobel Prize in 2000, Swedish {{scientist}} Arvid Carlsson first showed in the 1950s that administering L-DOPA to animals with drug-induced (<b>reserpine)</b> Parkinsonian symptoms caused {{a reduction in the}} intensity of the animals' symptoms. In 1960/61 Oleh Hornykiewicz, after discovering greatly reduced levels of dopamine in autopsied brains of patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, published together with the neurologist Walther Birkmayer dramatic therapeutic antiparkinson effects of intravenously administered L-DOPA in patients. This treatment was later extended to manganese poisoning and later Parkinsonism by George Cotzias and his coworkers, [...] who used greatly increased oral doses. The neurologist Oliver Sacks describes this treatment in human patients with encephalitis lethargica in his book Awakenings, upon which the movie of the same name is based.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are {{the first line of}} treatment for hemiballismus. [...] Quetiapine, sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while <b>reserpine</b> depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E
