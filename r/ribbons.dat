5|$|Mattea {{is known}} for her roles in AIDS activism. In 1992, many {{televised}} awards shows were handing out red <b>ribbons</b> to participants in honor of AIDS awareness, but the Country Music Association chose to hand out green <b>ribbons</b> promoting environmental awareness instead. Mattea chose to wear three red <b>ribbons</b> that night, each one honoring {{a friend of hers}} who had died of the disease, along with the green ribbon. A 1994 article in the Chicago Tribune noted that a Nashville newspaper interprted a comment she had made on wearing both color <b>ribbons</b> as a confrontation, and that Mattea was often questioned as to whether her activism had a negative impact on sales of her then-current album. Besides her participation in the Red Hot + Country charity album series, Mattea also participated in charity concerts and made public appearances at activism campaigns. She was also the recipient of the inaugural Harvard AIDS Initiative award in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red <b>ribbons.</b> The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the <b>ribbons</b> as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink <b>ribbons</b> and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink <b>ribbons,</b> so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ribbon</b> movement, {{which also}} occurs at every keypress, {{automatically}} reverses direction {{when there is}} no <b>ribbon</b> left on the feed reel; two mechanical sensors, situated next to each wheel, move when the <b>ribbon</b> is put under tension (indicating <b>ribbon</b> end), attaching the appropriate wheel to the <b>ribbon</b> transport mechanism and detaching the other.|$|R

C-3 and C-4 is the same as C-2, except that the turtleneck and blue T-shirt replaces the shirt and tie respectively; C-3 may be worn in cold weather.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2014, Connie {{performed}} {{a couple of}} concerts in South Korea (Osan and Seoul). These concerts, performed shortly after the horrendous Sewol ferry tragedy, were delivered with much personal consideration by Connie {{to make sure that}} all song choices were appropriate. Connie performed with yellow <b>ribbons</b> to show her respect for the families of the victims. The proceeds from at least one of the concerts were donated to the fundraising efforts in support of the families of the victims.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ribbon</b> of {{the order}} was, until 1818 and after 1914, yellow with broad black stripes near each edge. After November 1917, when the <b>ribbon</b> was worn without the medal, the <b>ribbon</b> bore a green-enameled wreath to {{distinguish}} it from other Württemberg decorations on the same <b>ribbon.</b> The <b>ribbon</b> from 1818 to 1914 was blue.|$|R

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored <b>ribbons</b> {{pinned to the}} hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of their military. In Poland, until 1831, there was no consensus {{as to what the}} colors of the national cockade should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} codimension- 2 <b>ribbon</b> knottings of {{circles and}} 2 -spheres. We find {{that if a}} given <b>ribbon</b> knot has two <b>ribbon</b> disks, those disks are related by ambient isotopy together with {{a finite number of}} local modifications to be described. This allows a complete set of moves to be developed for the representation of <b>ribbon</b> 2 -knots by abstract or planar graphs. Similar results hold for classical <b>ribbon</b> knots although the planar graphs in that case are more complex. We also use this result to define new invariants for classical <b>ribbon</b> knots in terms of associated <b>ribbon</b> 2 -knots. These result...|$|R

5|$|The collar is worn on {{designated}} collar days over {{military uniform}} or morning dress by members attending formal events. The collar is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk <b>ribbons</b> (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress).

5|$|The geology of {{the town}} {{comprises}} bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent Quaternary drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a cap of clay-with-flints on the western edge {{of the town}} around Poundbury, alluvium in the river's floodplain, and several narrow <b>ribbons</b> of poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town's northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|The edge {{stabilized}} <b>ribbon</b> (ESR) silicon <b>ribbon</b> {{was grown}} in widths of 1, 2. 2 and 4. 0 inches at speeds ranging from. 6 to 7 in/min, which result in <b>ribbon</b> thicknesses of 5 to 400 microns. One {{of the primary}} problems remaining in ESR growth is that of thermally induced mechanical stresses. This problem is manifested as <b>ribbon</b> {{with a high degree}} of residual stress or as <b>ribbon</b> with buckled <b>ribbon.</b> Thermal stresses result in a high dislocation density in the grown material, resulting in compromised electronic performance. Improvements in <b>ribbon</b> flatness were accomplished by modification of the <b>ribbon</b> cooling profile. <b>Ribbon</b> flatness and other experimental observations of ESR <b>ribbon</b> are discussed. Laser scanner measurements show a good correlation between diffusion length and dislocation density which indicates that the high dislocation densities are the primary cause of the poor current performance of ESR materials. Dislocation densities were reduced and improved electronic performance resulted. Laser scanner data on new and old material are presented...|$|R
