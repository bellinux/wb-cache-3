40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{advantages}} of the uncooled infrared focal plane array (UIFPA), it is widely used in various fields. To achieve more vivid image, the dimensions of infrared focal plane array need to be enlarged. Hence the high speed analog to digital converter (ADC) integrated on-chip needs to obtain the digital infrared imaging signal. We propose a new single slope ADC with half-period counter and two <b>ramp</b> <b>generators</b> to realize the high resolution digitizing, which can operate at much lower speed.

50|$|The AMY {{was based}} around {{a bank of}} 64 oscillators, which emit sine waves of a given frequency. The sine waves were created by looking up the {{amplitude}} {{at a given time}} from a 16-bit table stored in ROM, rather than calculating the amplitude using math hardware. The signals could then be mixed together to perform additive synthesis. The AMY also included a number of <b>ramp</b> <b>generators</b> {{that could be used to}} smoothly modify the amplitude or frequency of a given oscillator over a given time. During the design phase it was believed these would be difficult to implement in hardware, so only eight frequency ramps are included.|$|R

Most circuit design systems are given the circuit schematic and use arithmetic constraints to select component values. This circuit designer is different because it designs the schematic.

40|$|A {{conventional}} {{phase-locked loop}} is improved by replacing its phase detector with one comprising a linear <b>ramp</b> <b>generator</b> and a sample-and-hold circuit, thus {{eliminating the need}} for a lowpass loop filter, although the output of the sample-and-hold circuit may be filtered {{in the case of a}} very low level modulating signal on the incoming FM signal, but then filtering is not a difficult problem as in a conventional phase-locked loop. The result is FM demodulation by zero-order estimation. For FM demodulation by first-order estimation, the arithmetic difference between adjacent samples is formed, and using a second sample-and-hold circuit an arithmetic difference signal is produced as an input to a second <b>ramp</b> <b>generator</b> that is reset after each sampling cycle to generate a ramp the slope of which is a function of the arithmetic difference signal stored in the second sample-and-hold circuit. The ramp thus generated by the second <b>ramp</b> <b>generator</b> is arithmetically summed with the zero-estimation signal from the first sample-and-hold circuit to form a first-order estimation signal.

40|$|Trabajo presentado al ECCTD celebrado en Alemania del 8 al 12 de septiembre de 2013. [...] et al. Many image sensors employ column-parallel ADCs {{in their}} readout structures. Single-slope ADCs are ideally suited for these {{multi-channel}} applications {{due to their}} simplicity, low power and small overall area. The <b>ramp</b> <b>generator,</b> shared by all the converters in the readout architecture, {{is a key element}} that has a direct effect in the transfer characteristic of single-slope ADCs. Because a digital counter is inherently present in this conversion scheme, one common practice is to use a digital-to-analog converter driven by the counter to generate the ramp. Given the direct relationship between the DAC and the ADC transfer characteristics, one of the main issues is to ensure a sufficient linearity of the DAC, with special emphasis on its monotonicity. Very often, in particular when medium to high resolutions are aimed, this requires calibration of the DAC, which must be repeated {{every once in a while}} to account for temperature, process, power supply, and aging variations. This paper presents an inherently monotonic <b>ramp</b> <b>generator</b> with high levels of linearity and stability against any expected source of variations, combined with a very efficient realization and an inherent automatic adaptability to different resolutions.

40|$|Concepts for the {{generation}} and {{the measurement of}} highly linear frequency ramps are presented. The fractional ramp synthesiser concept shown here is able to generate frequency ramps with a very low phase noise level, a very good frequency linearity and reproducibility. Related to the bandwidth of the generated frequency ramps of 4. 5 GHz a relative linearity error below 4 &#x 00 B 7; 10 – 10 is demonstrated in a prototype system. This linearity error {{is close to the}} limit set by the phase noise floor of the <b>ramp</b> <b>generators</b> and marks a significant improvement over existing aproaches (Musch and Schiek, 2000). The basic measurement sensitivity due to the phase noise is 1. 8 &#x 00 B 7; 10 – 10 without averaging. As the phase noise is important for the linearity of the frequency ramp the set-up has to be optimised for a good phase noise behaviour, too. In order to achieve this good phase noise a special phase-frequency detector is introduced that is especially designed for the use in a fractional phase locked loop...|$|R
