5|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to false {{attribution}} is {{the oldest}} of the statutory moral rights, originating (albeit in a limited form) in the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862. Found in Section 84 of the 1988 Act, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to false attribution allows individuals to avoid being named on works they are not the author of, and applies to literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, as well as films. It only applies to acts of false attribution perpetrated after 1 August 1989, and lasts for 20 years after the death of the person falsely attributed with authorship. It is infringed whenever an individual issues copies of a work to the public, exhibits them in public or broadcasts them with a false attribution.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a medical}} practitioner’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object</b> <b>to</b> providing a legally available healthcare service in New Zealand, {{on the grounds}} of their personal beliefs. Currently, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object</b> is enshrined in the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 and the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act. This paper argues the current legislative arrangement regulating a health practitioner’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object</b> under New Zealand law is vague, and risks cementing uncertainty, due to scope of the protection being unclear. In addition, the current protection risks patient safety, as it does not exclude the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object</b> in medical emergencies, or when the efficacy of the treatment is time dependent. To remedy this unsatisfactory situation, it is recommended that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object</b> in healthcare be rendered impermissible in the aforementioned scenarios. It is further recommended that direct referral to a non-objecting colleague be mandatory in the event a practitioner wishes <b>to</b> exercise their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object.</b> This is because access to healthcare may be compromised by a practitioner exercising the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> conscientiously <b>object,</b> with no corresponding direct referral requirement, a risk borne by patients...|$|R

500|$|Whether {{or not a}} work is {{attributed}} to the wrong person depends on, according to Clark v Associated Newspapers, [...] "the single meaning which... the work conveys to the notional reasonable reader". There {{is no need to}} prove that the false attribution caused any harm to the actual author, and the right has been interpreted to cover situations as diverse as a newspaper parody of Alan Clark's diaries, an interview with Dorothy Squires and a replica painting that contained the signature of the original author. The right is closely linked to passing off, defamation and other non-statutory causes of action, which may be used to supplement a claim for infringing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to false attribution. David Vaver, writing in the International Journal of Law and Information Technology, goes as {{far as to say that}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to false attribution is merely [...] "passing off, writ large". Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin also note a strong overlap between the rights against false attribution and against derogatory treatment.|$|E
500|$|Authors {{can still}} {{rely on the}} old common law rights which remain in force; they act as {{alternate}} forms of relief if a claim under dedicated moral rights is dubious, or is seen as unlikely to succeed. Similarly, an author can sometimes rely on contractual rights, as in Frisby v BBC, where the claimant was allowed to block modifications to his work by virtue of a contractual clause prohibiting the BBC from making [...] "structural" [...] changes to his script. Originally these were the only forms of relief for injured authors, although Section 43 of the Copyright Act 1956 created a [...] "tort of misattribution". With the 1988 Act, however, four distinct moral rights were recognised: {{the right to be}} identified as the author (the right of paternity), the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to derogatory treatment (the right of integrity), the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to false attribution, and the right to privacy in private films and photographs. Because moral rights are personal rights attached to the author, rather than economic rights attached to the work, they cannot be transferred or assigned, but they can be waived.|$|E
500|$|While {{exceptions}} to normal infringement such as fair dealing do not apply, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to derogatory treatment has its own, individualised exceptions. When works {{are created by}} employees of a company {{in the course of}} their work, the company or its other employees can alter the work in question, with the author's rights [...] "giving way to the light of business reality". This exception does not apply if the employee has already been identified on the work, either at the time of alteration or at any point beforehand. Another exception allows for the alteration of work in order to avoid committing a criminal offence, such as one of those under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.|$|E

500|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to {{derogatory}} treatment, or [...] "right of integrity", {{is considered}} by Bently and Sherman to be [...] "one {{of the most important}} of the innovations in the 1988 Act". Applying to authors of literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, as well as the directors of films, the right forbids [...] "derogatory treatment" [...] of the copyrighted work in circumstances where the author should be protected from such treatment. The word treatment refers to [...] "any addition to, deletion from, alteration to or adaptation of the work" [...] – in other words, any interference with the work's internal structure. This deliberately excludes translations of literary works, or arrangements or transcriptions of musical works involving nothing more than a change in key or register.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom law {{relating}} to moral rights has been repeatedly criticised, primarily {{for failing to}} entirely comply with the Berne Convention. Bently and Sherman {{point out that the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to derogatory treatment uses a far narrower definition of treatment than the Convention, which merely requires that the author be able to object to [...] "any... derogatory action" [...] without limitation. Vaver notes a [...] "grudging attitude toward moral rights, at least if the expression given these rights in [...] is any testament". Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention requires that the exercise of authors' moral rights [...] "shall not be subject to any formality", while the right to attribution requires that the author assert ownership in writing, and is not available to authors by default. In addition, the exclusion of things such as encyclopedias, computer programs and typefaces is [...] "out of step with international practise".|$|E
500|$|The {{right of}} {{integrity}} protects authors from having their copyrighted works altered {{in such a}} fashion as to constitute a [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] of the original work, or {{in a way that}} harms the author's reputation or honour. Cases vary as to how the right of integrity should be interpreted, with some judges saying that [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] should be taken {{to be part of the}} wider clause on reputation and honour to avoid subjective decisions, and others interpreting each clause as distinct types of violation. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to false attribution protects individuals from being identified as the authors of works they have not contributed to; unlike the other moral rights it exists only for the individual's lifetime and the 20 years after death, not for the full term of copyright. The United Kingdom's law on moral rights has been criticised for failing to correctly implement the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and for being unreasonably narrow in the types of creative works it covers.|$|E
50|$|Taxpayer {{bears no}} <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> a loss {{determined}} by IRD because loss {{is not an}} assessment in accordance {{to the definition of}} Ordinance. Until the time when profits are assessed which affects the tax loss (e.g. offsetting of previous tax loss), the taxpayer may apply for an objection to the CIR. It also implies that a statement of loss, which grants no objection option to the taxpayer, has a different status with the notice of assessment.|$|R

Replication between servers occurs periodically using deltas of the objects. Each server can act as a master of the information it holds (provided the replica is not read only). Additionally, replicas may be filtered to only include defined attributes to increase speed (for example, a replica may be configured to only include a name and phone number for use in a corporate address book, as opposed to the entire directory user profile).|$|R
500|$|In Komoco Motors, the Court of Appeal {{held that}} the Registrar of Vehicles had not abdicated to the Customs her {{discretionary}} power. Expressing {{the view of the}} Court, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong {{held that the}} Lines International conditions [...] "although correct in law, [...] inapplicable to the factual context of the appeal". The Court distinguished the factual context in Lines International from the present case on two bases. First, it found that the Registrar had made the decision in the lawful exercise of her power and for practical reasons, which included the Customs' reliability in assessing the OMV of vehicles. In any case, an aggrieved importer had a statutory <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to and be heard on the Customs' determination of OMVs. Secondly, while Lines International involved a determination of whether a vessel should be given berthing space, the PSA had to exercise its judgment as to how to weigh up various relevant factors. However, in Komoco Motors, once the Registrar had decided to adopt the Customs' OMV of a motor vehicle as its [...] "value" [...] {{for the purposes of the}} ARF Scheme, no further exercise of judgment was required of the Registrar. The Court held that the calculation of the ARF was simply an arithmetical exercise of applying the percentage stated in subsidiary legislation to the Customs' OMVs, and hence did not involve the taking of instructions by the Registrar from another statutory agency.|$|E

The Brumbrella continued in use {{for a little while}} longer, but, after 20 years of use, it was replaced in early 2001. [...] Parts were given away to Warwickshire clubs to use as covers, including Moseley Ashfield, and a [...] "massive section" [...] was acquired by Atherstone Town Cricket Club. The Brumbrella was also blamed, in part, for a deterioration in the condition of the Edgbaston pitch.|$|E
5000|$|... was {{considered}} that {{this way of}} appointing magistrates elections was also more democratic than the casting of lots, since under the plan of election by lot chance would decide the issue and the partizans of oligarchy would often get the offices; whereas under the plan of selecting the worthiest men, the people would have in their hands the power to choose those who were most attached to the existing constitution. This argument applies to juries, but less to larger groups where the probability of, for example, an oppressive majority, are statistically insignificant. The modern processes of jury selection and the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> and exclude particular jurors by both the plaintiff and defence are used to potentially lessen the possibilities of a jury not being representative of the community or being prejudicial towards {{one side or the}} other. Today, therefore, even juries in most jurisdictions are not ultimately chosen through pure sortition.|$|R

The trial court had overruled these objections. [...] The plaintiffs had taken no exception to the trial court's ruling, and had not stated their right to reserve an exception. Did this create grounds for an appeal? [...] Story concluded it did not. [...] In a major statement about civil procedure, he wrote, [...] "In the ordinary course of things at the trial, if an objection is made and overruled as to the admission of evidence and the party does not take any exception at the trial, he is understood to waive it." [...] But even if the plaintiffs had managed to retain their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>object</b> to the trial court's ruling, Story concluded, it did not matter when the will was registered in Tennessee.

40|$|Questions of {{information}} flow {{are in many}} ways more important than questions of access control, because the goal of many security policies is to thwart the unautho- rized release {{of information}}, not merely the illicit obtaining of access <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> that information.
