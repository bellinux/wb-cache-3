40|$|Innovation of {{products}} {{is the key}} to survival. At this exhibition, we saw some trends of the innovation and development directions of weaving machines. Important innovation criteria include energy saving, flexibility, quality, product diversification as well as higher productivity. Flexibility and versatility are the key demands of fabric manufacturers, which drive the development of fabric formation technologies. Among weaving machines exhibited at the show, flexible rapier machines dominated the sector (36 companies). Air jets came second (32 companies), followed by water jet weaving machine (8 companies), projectile weaving machines and others. For projectile weaving machines, there were only three companies. For shuttle looms, there were five. Most of companies focussed on shuttleless weaving machines, especially air jet weaving machine and <b>rapier</b> <b>weaving</b> <b>machine.</b> These two technologies are likely to dominate over others in the near future. ITMA Asia + CITME 2008 was also a window to see the technological gap between Chinese textile machine manufacturing sector and international manufacturers, although the product quality and diversification of China's textile machinery have made remarkable progress in the past two decades. For the Chinese textile machinery industry, global science and technology develops with each passing day, it is a long-term goal to transform textile industry with modern technologies {{to keep pace with the}} international trend of informatics technologies and keep on enhancing the continuous innovation capability.

40|$|Elastane yarns {{are often}} used to produce stretch fabrics on {{knitting}} machines as well as <b>rapier</b> <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> On air-jet <b>weaving</b> looms their use is still limited. That is why {{the objective of this}} paper is to investigate the weavability of elastane based stretch yarns on air-jet looms. Bobbins of elastane were woven on an air-jet loom and a distinction of the bobbins in three categories was made according to the most important production processes for elastane yarn: core twist, core spun and air covered. Yarn properties such as linear density, elongation at break and Air Index value were determined, weaving tests were performed and properties of the resulting fabric were determined...|$|R
50|$|In 1966 {{the company}} was listed on the Brussels Stock Exchange. At the ITMA {{exhibition}} in Paris in 1971, Picañol exhibited the MDC, the world’s first electronically controlled flying shuttle machine. In 1989 the foundry division was split off from the other activities and made into a separate company, Proferro NV. Also in 1989 Picanol became part owner {{in what was then}} Protronic (now PsiControl Mechatronics). In 1993 Picanol achieved ISO 9001 certification, as a guarantee of the quality of its products and services. Verbrugge NV in Belgium and Steel Heddle Inc. in the USA were acquired in 2001. They were followed in 2002 by Te Strake Textile in the Netherlands and Lhenry in France. In 2003 among others Burcklé in France joined the group, while GTP Bandung was set up in Indonesia, GTP São Paulo in Brazil and GTP in Mexico. In 2004 a controversy arose concerning the remuneration of the former President & CEO, Jan Coene, whose greed had a very negative influence on the health of the company. After a turbulent period (the Picanol Scandal), Chris Dewulf was chosen as the new President & CEO of the Picanol Group in 2005, and a new Board of Directors was appointed. In 2007, the company launched the new OptiMax and GT-Max <b>rapier</b> <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Rapier</b> <b>{{machines}}</b> <b>weave</b> {{more rapidly}} than most shuttle machines but more slowly than most other projectile machines. An important advantage of rapier machines is their flexibility, which permits the laying of picks of different colours. They also weave yarns of any type of fibre and can weave fabrics up to 110 inches in width without modification.|$|R
40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> is higher as compared with <b>rapier</b> and projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> comparing projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet weft insertion. However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the air consumption of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, air consumption was varying almost in all <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure. Main reason of disparity of air consumption in air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> may be variation of distance from compressor to <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> number of joints, un-necessary valve opening and pipes leakages cause an increase of compressed air consumption...|$|R
