50|$|The Noble comb is {{no longer}} used in worsted system as {{technology}} is inefficient. Noble combing may have uses for woollen system, or long fibers 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibers is the French comb system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a <b>rectilinear</b> <b>comb</b> relative to a mean fiber length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of wool comb {{can be seen in}} stroke of the components used in a cotton comber. The scaled down has the purpose of accommodating fiber length and fiber physics requirements. The same scaled-up version of a comb {{can be seen in the}} way flax is combed.|$|E

The Noble and French combs are now well understood technology thanks to work by CSIRO. After 1994, Sokolov has endeavored to improve combing performance in the <b>rectilinear</b> <b>comb.</b> Combing technology continues to develop: Sokolov and Kirby developed a theory for combing model, simulation software for combing and drive design in 1982. Current technology used in providing comb drive by introducing innovation on cam performance to deliver textile fiber needs and separate mechanical performance of the comb was developed by Sokolov. [...] The cam technology was an advance on century-old technology of cams by producing a subspecies of new cam design.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rectilinear</b> <b>comb</b> uses a {{circular}} comb {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular combing short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|E
50|$|There are two {{competing}} combing technologies: the Noble (1853) comb (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and the French comb. The Noble comb technology is inefficient, hence most combing {{in the world}} is carried out on the French system. The French system is superior as it combs the entire length of a fiber. Noble combs suffer from the problem that they will not comb 2 mm of a fiber's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a <b>rectilinear</b> <b>combing</b> system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and Noble comb was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18-19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology - resulting in development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.|$|R
