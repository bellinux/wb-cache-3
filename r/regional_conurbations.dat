50|$|Doxiadis {{proposed}} ekistics as {{a science}} of human settlement and outlined its scope, aims, intellectual framework and relevance. A major incentive {{for the development of}} the science is the emergence of increasingly large and complex settlements, tending to <b>regional</b> <b>conurbations</b> and even to a worldwide city. However, ekistics attempts to encompass all scales of human habitation and seeks to learn from the archaeological and historical record by looking not only at great cities, but, as much as possible, at the total settlement pattern.|$|E
50|$|The Alliance's {{interests}} and constituency are {{the communities of}} rural and remote Australia. Rural and remote areas are defined (arbitrarily) by the Alliance as all those places except the nine capital cities and the <b>regional</b> <b>conurbations</b> of Townsville, the Gold Coast, Newcastle, the Central Coast, Wollongong and Geelong. Australia has various formal classification systems of the geographic continuum from 'metropolitan' to 'remote', the latest and most widely used {{of which is the}} Australian Standard Geographic Classification System - Remoteness Areas (ASGC-RA).|$|E

40|$|The bicentric {{conurbation}} formed now by two regional cities, Hradec Králové and Pardubice, was {{a significant}} industrial and farming region of Eastern Bohemia from 1986 to 2000. The development of this conurbation was regulated by the Territorial Plan for the Large Territorial Unit Hradec Králové – Pardubice <b>regional</b> <b>conurbation</b> which was approved in 1989. The urbanistic conception of the entire territory was designed with an outlook for 2000. Anticipated development of industry and agriculture, including housing development pointed out to increased demands on transport and engineering infrastructure. The proposal was supported by increased demands on urbanistic development with increased demands on dwelling, civic amenities and on industrial and agricultural production. After 2000, significant transformation of primary and secondary into higher civic amenities, i. e. so far the tertiary bicentric regional Hradec Králové – Pardubice conurbation was formed by the main centres, Hradec Králové – the regional city and Pardubice, the district city. This transformation results from proclaiming Pardubice {{the capital of the}} region. In the present, the Territorial Development Policy of the Czech Republic is the superior document for development of both regions...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{adopts a}} {{strategic}} spatial planning approach to think strategically about potential joint place branding initiatives between cross-border regions. The case study {{focuses on the}} extended cross-border European region composed of the NUTS 3 Minho-Lima, Cávado, Ave, Grande Porto, Tâmega, Entre Douro e Vouga, Douro, and Alto Trás-os-Montes of Northern Portugal and the provinces of A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra of the Autonomous Community of Galicia in northwest Spain. Bearing in mind the mismatch of styles of regional government systems, the approval by the European Commission of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation Galicia-North Portugal, and the current socio-economic environment, this chapter discusses the possibility of joining forces, procedures and strategic tools {{in order to enhance}} the reputation and give visibility to this European <b>regional</b> <b>conurbation.</b> In addition, this chapter intends to shed some light on the empirical significance of a cross-border place branding strategy able to encourage entrepreneurship, job creation, trade and investment. It draws important lessons from the idea of inter-regional branding and aims to encourage a unique cross-border storyline. The chapter directly addresses the need to develop place branding, independently of the geographical scale of application, through a strategic spatial planning approach. Here the complex inter-regional branding exercises carried out by the Øresund and the Baltic Sea regions are taken as comparative cases. This chapter also aims to contribute to the academic debate on inter-regional place branding by discussing the potential development of place branding initiatives across-administrative-border regions underpinned by knowledge from strategic spatial planning literature...|$|R
