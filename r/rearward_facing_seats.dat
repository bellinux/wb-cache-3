40|$|This {{intellectual}} property concerns an innovative new seating arrangement for passenger cars in which <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> passenger(s) sit beside and {{slightly to the}} rear of the centrally positioned forward facing driver. A forward facing passenger sits directly behind the driver between and slightly rearward of the two rear facing passengers (Figures 1 to 4). This arrangement overcomes the access/egress problems normally associated with all-forward-facing diamond seating configurations. The reverse diamond seating configuration allows conventional vehicle architecture and all rear passengers can alight from the conventional rear doors. When used for adults but particularly children, the rear <b>facing</b> <b>seat</b> squabs and head restraints retard the forward movement of occupants under rapid deceleration or collision. This reduces the concentrated loading and whiplash effect imparted by seatbelts on forward <b>facing</b> <b>seats.</b> The <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> <b>seat</b> cushions and squabs fold away in unit to allow the centre rear passenger to alight and to create luggage space alongside the centre rear passenger (Fig. 5). In addition the centre rear seat cushion can be raised to create a large transverse luggage space. The rear seat can also be folded to the floor or removed entirely to further increase the luggage space (Fig. 6). The ‘reverse diamond’ seating arrangement permits a wide range of seating and cargo configurations and also reduces frontal projected area of the vehicle which is beneficial to the reduction of aerodynamic drag...|$|R

40|$|For the {{protection}} of the unbelted occupants on the front passenger’s seat in frontal crashes the airbag is fired according to FMVSS 208 depending on the occupant’s size or for children at individual stages. For children <b>seated</b> in a <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child <b>seat</b> or OoP (“Out of Position“) situ ations the airb ag should not be fired. A sensor mat on the seat cushion is developed for the classif ication of the occupants on the passenger seat (“Occupant Classification System “ = OCS). The e mployed sensors in the mat are activated based on a resistive measuring principle so that a chara cteristic activation of sensors for particular “classes of occupants “ can be achieved. During the development of such a sensor mat for a particular seat model, a large number of tests with test persons, child seats and special buttock dummies are carried out in order to guarantee a reliable recognition of the seat’s occupancy. The benefit of using numerical simulation is in the early phase of the development process. Simulation results can be used for predicting how the sy stem will behave. Moreover, avai lable test results can be analyzed and understood better {{with the help of the}} simulation model. The FE simulation model of the seat and the sensor mat was set up and validated against material and component tests. Fu rthermore simula tion models of rigid test punches with different shapes and child seats as well as special buttock du mmies were set up and validated against real test results. The comparison of simulation results with test results showed a good accordance. Mechanisms in the seat which are relevant for pressure measurement can be reproduced in the simulation very well. Parameter studies have been carried out with the validated simulation models. The variables are stiffness of the seat foam, covering materials an...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to quantify the}} effects of the misuse in LATCH lower webbing. In the short period since the implementation of the LATCH system several cases of potential misuses have been reported. A series of sled tests in frontal impact mode were conducted with various misuse conditions (loose attachment of LATCH lower webbing, misrouting of LATCH lower webbing and child seat back inclination) for both forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child safety <b>seats</b> (FFCSS and RFCSS). Results from these tests are compared and discussed with that of the standard test with no misuse and showed that as the slack in the lower LATCH webbing increased, ATD injury measures exceeded the limits. The FFCSS tests in the reclined condition yielded lower injury values for all except the chest G’s when compared to the standard upright test. In the misrouting tests the ATD kinematics depended on the routing pivot point, the lower the pivot point the better the ATD kinematics. Similar findings were also observed in the RFCSS tests. The use of top tether with the FFCSS substantially improved the performance of the Hybrid III 3 year old ATD in spite of misuse conditions and the injury values were lower than the corresponding tests with no top tether. The effective reduction was 37 % in the HIC values, 6 % in the chest G’s, 30 % in the head excursion, 22 % in the knee excursion and finally 37 % reduction in the Nij values...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} made within the Child Safety group at Volvo Car Corporation.   The {{purpose of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to study the different aspects of <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems, which is the safest way for small children to travel, in order to suggest improvements {{in the development of}} child restraint systems. The studies included scientific articles regarding child safety and fatally injured children in car accidents, both in Sweden and internationally. The overall aim is to find factors that enables the increase in usage of <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems, including the increase of usage time to as long as possible.   Swedish accident data, obtained by the Swedish Traffic Data Acquisation, was studied. It was found that the fatally injured children during car accidents in Sweden between the years 2000 - 2016 commonly were involved in extraordinarily accident scenarios with an outcome independent of how they were restrained. The literature study and the survey that was made were both supporting the statement of inconvenience while using <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems. The inconvenience often corresponded to different types of misuse. The main issue with <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> according to the responding parents was lack of leg space, both for their child but also for the driver and the front seat passenger. These issues made some parents turning their children forward facing at early age, whereas they could still fit in the <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint system.   One key in order to increase the global use of <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems lies in changes of the materials and design. A more lightweight and compact design is suggested, providing a more spacious travel environment for the children and easier mounting for the parents.

The notable exceptions were the velocity for which the measured values showed more scatter and the temperature at the wall for which the value measured was below the adiabatic wall temperature.

The holographic interferometric measurements were supplemented by classical measurements of surface pressure, oil flow, and schlieren visualization. The effects of step height and step width were examined. A method to determine the reattachment point from the interferograms was examined and found {{to be in good}} agreement with the other measurement techniques. The reattachment point moved closer to the step as the step height was decreased, but its location did not change with varying step width.

40|$|When small {{children}} travel in minibuses, during for example daycare transports, they seldom have adequate protection {{in terms of}} crash safety. To be sufficiently protected the child should travel in a <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint system (CRS). The possibility to use such a seat is unfortunately accompanied by several problems. The main issues are {{that it can be}} hard and time consuming to secure a conventional child restraint system and that the available space in a minibus is limited. The task is therefore to develop a new system that makes it possible to easily secure the child restraint system in the bus, without compromising the space and mobility of the other passengers. This is done by using the newly developed anchorage system, Isofix, in combination with a small stand that replaces the bus seat.

40|$|The random vortex method (RVM) of Chorin was {{developed}} by the recirculating flows. The RVM method models turbulence from first principles, tracking the vorticity and obtaining the interaction of vorticity with the bulk flow field. A computer program was produced called MIMOC, Modeling the Interface Motion of Combustion, which can be used to calculate the reacting flow field behind a <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> step. Several comparisons between experimental data and calculations were made. The RVM methood computes qualitatively good results, but the quantitative agreement as yet is not completely satisfactory. Much of the difficulty may be caused by the treatment of boundary conditions and the techniques used for obtaining statistical averages of velocities and turbulence quantities. For the <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> step the computed reattachment length equals the experimental value. However, the reverse velocity in the recirculation zone is over predicted by 300 percent.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the injury potential of children in forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> configurations involved in frontal collisions. Experimental sled tests were completed following {{the requirements of the}} Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 using a Hybrid III 3 -year-old dummy in a forward facing configuration restrained in a child restraint system (CRS) that employed a five-point seat belt. The Hybrid III 3 -year-old dummy was equipped with three uniaxial accelerometers arranged in mutually perpendicular directions in the head and chest. Experimental sled tests were also completed for a <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> configuration, but the results were not applicable due to excessive rotation of the child safety seat {{toward the front of the}} sled which would not typically occur in a frontal crash. In addition the set-up did not allow for proper placement of the child dummy 2 ̆ 7 s legs and did not portray a realistic configuration of the child in the child safety seat. Using Finite Element Model Builder (FEMB) software and EASi-Crash Dyna, a numerical model employing a subset of the apparatus used in the forward facing experimental sled test was developed and numerically simulated using LS-DYNA. To verify the numerical simulations, the head and chest accelerations were compared to the experimental observations and it was found that there was a reasonable engineering correlation between the data. Further numerical simulations were completed to study the possible benefits of facing a 3 -year-old child in a <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> configuration during a frontal crash.
