40|$|AIM: To {{verify the}} content {{validity}} of the nursing diagnosis risk for decreased cardiac output (RDCO). BACKGROUND: DCO is a phenomenon that is not restricted to individuals or environments that specifically focus on cardiovascular care. It is not only prevalent in cardiovascular care units, but also in post-anaesthesia units and non-cardiac care units among individuals with non-cardiogenic disorders. A significant decrease in cardiac output is a life-threatening situation, demonstrating the need for developing a <b>risk</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for early intervention. The development of this diagnosis requires {{the construction of a}} diagnosis label, a definition of the diagnostic concept and the risk factors associated with the diagnosis. METHODS: The research was carried out in two methodological stages based on the Fehring diagnosis content validation model. The quantitative analysis consisted of the calculation of the weighted mean of the values attributed by experts to each risk factor, the level of agreement/disagreement between the experts regarding the operational definitions of risk factors and the index of diagnostic content validity (DCV). RESULTS: The label 2 ̆ 7 risk for decreased cardiac output 2 ̆ 7 was considered representative of a nursing diagnosis defined as 2 ̆ 7 at risk of developing a health status characterized by an insufficient quantity of blood pumped by the heart to meet physical metabolic demands 2 ̆ 7. Critical risk factors (DCV 3 ̆e/= 0. 7) were myocardial dysfunction (0. 887), blood loss (0. 875), increase in intrapericardial pressure (0. 825), condition that leads to changes in cardiac rhythm and/or electrical conduction (0. 812), deficient fluid volume (0. 725), plasma loss (0. 712), ineffective tissue perfusion (0. 712) and electrolyte imbalance (0. 7). CONCLUSIONS: The research identified eight risk factors with valid content for assessment of RDCO. Implications for nursing practice: The identification of risk factors for DCO assists nurses to intervene early and minimize the consequences of a deficient cardiac function...|$|E

Method: cross-sectional study assessing 105 patients with stroke.

The clinical judgments of three expert RNs were used to establish the diagnosis. The relationship between variables and strength of association using Odds Ratio (OR) was verified both in regard to Risk for aspiration and respiratory aspiration. Results: risk for aspiration was present in 34. 3 % of the patients and aspiration in 30. 5 %. The following stood out among the risk factors: Dysphagia, Impaired or absent gag reflex, Neurological disorders, and Impaired physical mobility, {{all of which were}} statistically associated with Risk for aspiration.

40|$|Problem {{solving and}} {{decision}} making are two main components of clinical reasoning process; developing <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis</b> {{is a part of}} clinical reasoning process since it finds one solution which is the best solution for patient. Developing <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is second step of nursing process when nurse help patients to solve their nursing problem. However, deciding the <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is not easy thing to do especially for students who join the internship phase for the first time (novice students). The objectives of this study are to know the experiences of the clinical teacher in nursing, especially students’ difficulties during deciding the <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis</b> from clinical teacher’s perception, the causes of those obstacles, and how clinical teachers derive the strategies to solve those problems, and implication those strategies for clinical teacher. The data were collected by conducting in-depth interview to three clinical teachers in Nursing Program, Diponegoro University, Semarang, Indonesia. Each interview is conducted for at least 20 minutes for asking several questions such as: the problems are faced by students when they develop the <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> the causes of those problems, the strategies were used by clinical teacher to solve the problems, and the implications for teacher related to the strategies were used. The result shows that there is the same perception between students and teachers about students’ difficulties during developing <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> Students did not have enough self confidence to compose the <b>nursing</b> <b>diagnosis</b> even though they had the data from assessment. The cause of this problem is students got minimum supervision or feedback from clinical teacher. To overcome the problems, clinical teachers used several strategies such as: using CD Rom as teaching material and case method before students join the internship phase while enriching feedback for students and conducting bedside teaching during the leraning process in clinical setting. The last strategy is encouraging students to read as much as they can. The implication for clinical teachers is to enhance their experiences and to improve their quality by joining training and seminars, and conducting research in related topic.

A self-administered anonymous questionnaire study was carried out a total of four times: once after the introductory course for first-year students (Group 1), once each before and after the intermediate course for secondyear students (Groups 2 and 3), and once after the applied course for third-year students (Group 4). We determined nursing students’ actual level of awareness, self-assessed learning attainment, self-assessed difficulties in studying, and preparedness regarding the <b>nursing</b> process/nursing <b>diagnosis.</b> Then, we analyzed the correlations among these measures. Regarding awareness, significantly greater percentages of respondents responded to items in such a way as to indicate that they were highly aware of the <b>nursing</b> process/nursing <b>diagnosis</b> in Groups 1 and 3 than in Groups 2 and 4. In Group 4, a significant positive correlation was found between preparedness and self-assessment.
