25|$|Oresme's most {{important}} contributions to mathematics {{are contained in}} Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the intensio (the degree of heat at each point) and the extensio (as {{the length of the}} heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call <b>rectangular</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness, whiteness, and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed, the longitudo represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled.|$|E

60|$|The {{explanation}} of this remarkable fact seems {{to lie in}} the following circumstances. In the first place, all questions of position and figure may be resolved into questions of magnitude. The position and figure of any object are determined by determining {{the position of a}} sufficient number of points in it; and the position of any point may be determined by the magnitude of three <b>rectangular</b> <b>co-ordinates,</b> that is, of the perpendiculars drawn from the point to three planes at right angles to one another, arbitrarily selected. By this transformation of all questions of quality into questions only of quantity, geometry is reduced to the single problem of the measurement of magnitudes, that is, the ascertainment of the equalities which exist between them. Now when we consider that by one of the general axioms, any equality, when ascertained, is proof of as many other equalities as there are other things equal to either of the two equals; and that by another of those axioms, any ascertained equality is proof of the equality of as many pairs of magnitudes as can be formed by the numerous operations which resolve themselves into the addition of the equals to themselves or to other equals; we cease to wonder that in proportion as a science is conversant about equality, it should afford a more copious supply of marks of marks; and that the sciences of number and extension, which are conversant with little else than equality, should be the most deductive of all the sciences.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational investigation {{on the effects}} of subtended and vertex angles on the free vibration characteristics of open conical shell panels. Unlike the conventional approximation using a <b>rectangular</b> or cylindrical <b>co-ordinate</b> system, this analysis adopts a natural conical co-ordinate system so that any approximation in geometry is eliminated. The strain and curvature components formulated in this orthogonal conical co-ordinate system have been employed to derive the strain and kinetic energy integrals. The energy functional is minimized in accordance with the Ritz procedure to arrive at a governing eigenvalue equation. Admissible shape functions compromising sets of two-dimensional orthogonal polynomials and a basic function are employed to account for the boundary constraints and to approximate the three-dimensional displacements of the conical shell. Comparison of natural frequency shows excellent agreement with the solution of finite element, finite strip and integral equation methods. The effects of subtended and vertex angles and other geometric parameters on vibration are investigated in a comprehensive parametric study. Selected vibration mode shapes are illustrated to enhance the physical understanding of vibration of such open conical shell panels...|$|R
40|$|Tiris {{thesis is}} about the {{creation}} of a numerical model and its application to Macquarie Harbour (Tasmania, Australia). With the aim being to better understand the harbour and aid the management of its environment and industry. A numerical model was developed through the combination of an original two-dimensional laterally averaged river model and an existing three-dimensional ocean model. The existing three-dimensional model used is the Princeton Oceanographic Model (POM) by Blumberg and Mellor (1987), which is used for modelling the harbour. The author's river model is used for the two main rivers flowing into Macquarie Harbour, and part of the ocean surrounding the harbour. The river model is based on non-Boussinesq primitive equations, which include the density terms neglected in the commonly used Boussinesq approximation. These density terms are important where there are large salinity stratifications, which occur in the rivers flowing into Macquarie Harbour. The primitive equations for the model are derived in a <b>rectangular</b> Cartesian <b>co-ordinate</b> system and then transformed to a a co-ordinate system. The a coordinate system transformation, also used by POM, non-dimensionalises depth - resulting in a more accurate and efficient method for handling a varying bathymetry. The river model is solved with a finite difference implicit scheme, which is numerically centred in space and time. As the models' bathymetries vaiy from 1 to 90 m, to get the required resolution in the deeper sections with the a co-ordinates, the resulting vertical spacing in the shallow sections is small. Hence, the finite difference equations are solved vertically, which avoids a restrictive Courant, Friedrichs and Lewy (CFL) time restraint with the explicit finite difference operators. The model successfully predicts the general circulation and pollution distribution in the harbour, agreeing to within 36...|$|R

40|$|In part A a {{non-singular}} {{connection matrix}} {{is used to}} combine the self and mutual impedance matrix {{of a group of}} mutually coupled elements with a network bus impedance matrix; the resulting impedance matrix is then reduced by eliminating rows and columns if necessary, to give the bus impedance matrix of the interconnected network. The self impedances of the mutually coupled group of elements are added to the network bus impedance matrix {{in the same way as}} uncoupled elements, then the mutual impedances Are added followed by matrix reduction. By considering examples of the connection matrix applied to adding a single element, then to adding groups of uncoupled and coupled elements to a network, rules are devised for combining the celf impedances of branch and loop elements and group mutual imped-ances with the network bus impedance matrix. From the bus impedance matrix of power system sequence networks fault parameters are derived by simple arithmetic operations. It is shown that rules for adding a group of mutually coupled loop elements can be applied to modify a bus impedance matrix when element self and mutual impedances are changed. The derivation of an equivalent network from the bus impedance matrix is noted; the addition of two network bus impedance matrixes is considered and shown to be a special case of the more general problem of adding a self and mutual impedance matrix to a bus impedance matrix. A numerical example involving the calculation and modification of the bus impedance matrix, deriving an equivalent circuit and adding bus impedance matrixes is included. An outline of a digital computer power system short circuit programme which calculates fault parameters from the bus impedance matrix derived from randomly ordered lists of network element self and mutual impedances is given. The inverse of the connection matrix discussed in part A is used in part B to combine a network bus admittance matrix with the self and mutual admittance matrix of a group of mutually coupled elements. From this the Well known method of forming the bus admit-tance matrix from uncoupled element self admittances follows and is extended to cover self and mutual admittances of coupled elements. For a group of mutually coupled elements, the diagonal terms of the group admittance matrix are added to the bus admittance matrix in the same way as self admittances of uncoupled elements while the off-diagonal terms are added in a matrix operation either before or after the diagonal terms. A relationship is indicated between the admit-tance connection matrix and the group element bus incidence matrix. Although the presence of mutual coupling results in some loss of spal-sity, it is shown that for power systems the bus admittance matrix still has a large proportion of zero terms. By eliminating terms below the main diagonal in an optimal order, a "factored inverse" of the admittance matrix is derived which has considerably fewer non-zero terms than the corresponding bus impedance matrix. Terms of the Impedance matrix can be obtained from the inverse as required. The numerical calculation of the bus admittance matrix of a power system zero sequence network is set out and derivation of fault impedance and current distribution factors included. A digital computer programme using the bus admittance matrix and factored inverse method for power system short circuit studies is described and a tabulation indicates the affect on computer storage requirements of the optimal factoring procedure. In part C Newton's method of power system load flow calculation using Gaussian elimination to solve the voltage correction equations is discussed. The network and problem parameters are specified in <b>rectangular</b> cartesian <b>co-ordinates.</b> As the voltage correction equation matrix has the same form as the bus admittance matrix, a preferred order for the Gaussian elimination which preserves sparsity is devised by analogy with network reduction. A digital computer load flow programme is outlined and a tab-ulation included which shows that, for typical power system networks, the preferred elimination order retains sparsity in the matrix. Algol listings of the digital computer short circuit and load flow programmes are included in the supplement with data and corresponding calculated results for power system studies...|$|R

The thickness variation of the plate is continuous and can be represented by a power function of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> A wide range of tapered rectangular plates can be described by giving various index values to the power function. Two sets of new admissible functions are developed, respectively, to approximate the flexural displacement and the angle of rotation due to bending of the plate. The eigenfrequency equation is obtained by using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The complete solutions of displacement and angle of rotation due to bending for a tapered Timoshenko beam (a strip taken from the tapered Mindlin plate in some direction) under a Taylor series of static load have been derived, which are used as the admissible functions of the rectangular Mindlin plates with taper thickness {{in one or two}} directions. Unlike conventional admissible functions which are independent of the thickness variation of the plate, the static Timoshenko beam functions presented in this paper are closely connected with the thickness variation of the plate so that higher accuracy and more rapid convergence can be expected.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of a dynamic power flow computer algorithm using Newton's method. It addresses both the development of a positive sequence dynamic power flow algorithm for the dynamic study of balanced power systems and a fully-fledged three-phase dynamic power flow algorithm for the dynamic study of power systems exhibiting a significant degree of either structural or operational unbalance. As a prelude to the {{research work}} on dynamic power flows, a three-phase Newton-Raphson power flow algorithm in <b>rectangular</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> with conventional HVDC power plant modelling is presented in this thesis, emphasising the representation of converter control modes. The solution approach takes advantage of the strong numerical solutions for combined HVAC-HVDC systems, where power plant and operational imbalances are explicitly taken into account. The dynamic algorithm is particularly suited to carrying out long-term dynamic simulations and voltage stability assessments. Dynamic model representations of the power plants components and the load tap changing transformer are considered, and to widen the study range of dynamic voltage phenomena using this method, extensions have been made to include induction motor and polynomial load modelling features. Besides, reactive power compensators that base their modus operandi on the switching of power electronic valves, such as HVDC-VSC and the STATCOM are taken into account. The dynamic power flow algorithm has primarily been developed making use of the positive sequence and [dq] representations. Extensions are made to developing a three-phase power flows dynamic algorithm. Test cases for the various dynamic elements developed in this research are presented to show the versatility of the models and simulation tool, including a trip cascading event leading up to a wide-area voltage collaps.

40|$|Studies of {{the common}} grass grub (Costelytra zealandica (White)) covered two major aspects, {{population}} ecology and pest assessment. The object or these studies {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of developing models, predicting population density and estimating the associated losses in pasture productivity, as a basis for the formulation of a pest management programme. I. Population Studies Studies of natural populations of soil insects such as grass grub require the development of accurate and efficient mechanical methods of sampling and extraction as well as a statistically precise and efficient sampling plan. 1. Population Studies a) Mechanical aspects. A split barrelled manually operated corer was developed for sampling grass grub. This implement permitted 175 to 245 samples to be taken daily by one man. Sample sites were drawn randomly within strata by a computer as <b>rectangular</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> and converted to polar co-ordinates, originating from the centre of the 20, 20 x 20 m subplots in each study plot. Sites were then sorted and listed in numerical order based on the polar ordinate. The use of the computer allowed large savings in the time taken to draw and list random co-ordinates and made it possible to randomly draw samples from irregular shaped strata. A large compass wheel enabled sample sites to be located rapidly in the field. Sampling times were based on beetle flights, seasons and, in the case of pupal sampling, pilot sampling. Extraction or all the developmental stages of grass grub from soil was accomplished by means of a modified Ladell process which gave a 96 to 98 % recovery rate and, dependent on the stage of the insect, a processing rate of between 4. 4 and 6. 5 man minutes per sample. The extraction process did not impair the insect’s viability. b) Statistical aspects. The main consideration {{in the development of a}} sampling plan was to obtain, for the lowest cost, an estimate of population density with a precision of ± 10 % SE. The variance minimizing efficiencies of different methods of stratified sampling and sample allocation were assessed. The different strata used were based on the division of the study plots by; subplots, damaged and undamaged pasture and damaged and undamaged pasture within each subplot. The most efficient method of stratification was influenced by the accuracy with which damaged areas of pasture could be defined and the population level. Although optimal allocation of samples gave spectacular gains in efficiency, the use of this method of sample allocation in the field was not practical. The adoption of a flexible rather than a rigid sampling plan in which the strata varied with population level and the ease with which pasture damage could be identified, enabled, except at very low population levels, the required level of precision to be attained with the resources available. Sample size was inversely related to population density but was highest for the egg stage in which grass grub are most aggregated. The sample size required to attain the level of precision sought ranged between 131 sample units, for high third instar larval populations, and 2450 units for low egg populations. 2. Population Dynamics Over the period of study at Takapau marked changes were not evident in the flight behaviour of female beetles. No parasites, or important invertebrate or vertebrate predators were found at Takapau and the effect of disease organisms on Takapau populations was considered unimportant. In the Waikato region, however, where the native milky disease may infect up to 40 % of the third instar grass grub population, disease is considered to be an important factor in population regulation. Analyses of age specific mortalities within generations indicated that mortality over the autumn and winter was strongly density dependent and above a certain threshold density compensated completely for change in population density. Laboratory experimentation showed that the major contribution to density dependent mortality arose from larval combat which increased as food supply declined. From this observation the hypothesis was proposed that weather conditions which influence the survival of damaged plants and therefore dispersal and aggregation of larvae, influences larval combat. From field data it was found that the autumn threshold for combat mortality over the autumn-winter period was linearly related to pasture production over this period. At Takapau when summer soil moisture levels were in excess of wilting point larvae were found feeding close to the surface. Under these conditions combat mortality occurred and thus summer mortality was density dependent. When soil moisture levels approached and fell below wilting point summer mortality became linearly related to soil moisture. At Rukuhia as distinct to Takapau highest soil moisture levels under drought conditions were found close to the surface. As a result, larvae did not descend in the soil profile in response to drought and for this reason summer mortality at Rukuhia, under drought conditions, was attributed to the direct effect of the lethally high soil temperatures found near the surface. It was concluded from these studies that grass grub populations at Takapau fluctuate in response to low summer or high spring soil moisture levels and are regulated in relation to food supply by larval combat. The effect of summer mortality on generation mortality is moderated by the density dependent nature of combat mortality of larvae in autumn-winter. Consequently, mortality in the summer only influences generation mortality if it decreases population density below the threshold density at which autumn-winter combat mortality occurs. The knowledge gathered from these studies explains why grass grub populations are so difficult to control with transient insecticides and has suggested better ways of using insecticides. A population model was developed for predicting population changes within and between generations at Takapau. The model was based on the relationships described above and gave encouragingly accurate results. However, it did highlight the need for more accurate definition of the relationships between the major mortalities identified by these studies and the important variables which affect them such as soil moisture, rainfall, pasture production and population density. II. Pest Assessment Studies A technique which does not involve the use of insecticides was developed for measuring losses in pasture production arising from grass grub damage. This technique is suited to areas of relatively low summer rainfall where the occurrence of grass grub can be located visibly by pasture damage. The method involves the division of a paddock into, and the measurement of herbage production from, three strata; undamaged areas, areas damaged by previous generations and areas damaged solely by the current generation. The sizes of the strata were measured by aerial photography or estimated from a growth curve of the area visibly damaged or, the relationship established between the area of visible damage and insect density. Given the size and herbage production from each stratum the total production for each plot or paddock can be estimated. Pasture damaged by grass grub showed deterioration in botanical composition with an increase in litter and grass weeds and a decrease in white clover. Damaged pasture had a higher percentage of bare ground and in the autumn and winter was poorly utilized by livestock. Seasonal herbage losses were highest in autumn and winter, although the highest loss in monthly herbage production was recorded in late summer. In newly damaged areas seasonal losses in herbage production of 70 % and 74 % were recorded in autumn and winter respectively whereas the respective losses in the areas damaged by previous generations in autumn and winter were 54 and 34 %. Recovery, in terms of pasture production, of damaged areas was complete in late spring. Observations made in these studies showed that within the strata described the severity of damage caused by low and high populations of grass grub was not significantly different, and that increased losses in pasture production associated with higher populations resulted from an increase in the damaged area rather than an increase in the severity of damage in damaged areas. Based on this information losses in pasture productivity caused by different population levels were estimated from the relationship between population density and the area of visible damage and the mean pasture production from each stratum. Two models were developed which simulated the growth, over successive generations, in area of visible damage under environmental conditions which favoured the increase or maintenance of grass grub populations. Both models describe the growth in area of damage up to a stage where damage was extensive, ill-defined and impossible to measure. One model is based on the relationships between, the size of individual patches of damage and the factor by which these grow over successive generations, and the rate of appearance of damaged areas in the following generation and proportion of the paddock currently damaged. The other model involves the growth curve of May larval populations under conditions which are favourable for population increase and the relationship between population density and pasture damage. The latter model tended to underestimate the actual growth of the area damaged by approximately 20 %. It was found that the establishment of accurate economic threshold levels for different classes of farms run at different intensities and in different regions is attended by many problems. In the light of current knowledge the translation of losses in herbage production into animal production and economic terms for different farming intensities under different climatic conditions will lead to such grossly inaccurate estimates that the worth of pest assessment studies would be lost. From these studies it was concluded that at best pest assessment studies of grass grub could provide the farmer with information that will allow him to predict population density and the associated losses in herbage production. Given this information the farmer is in the position to make more objective decisions, than would otherwise be possible, on the course of action to follow based on his own socio-economic circumstances...|$|E
