5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> for coal, {{resulting}} {{from an economic}} downturn, many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E

5|$|While Union Station {{was busy}} from its opening and through World War II, {{passenger}} rail service began to dwindle {{after the war}} when air and highway travel became more popular. By the 1960s, the New York Central drastically cut service, while the Pennsylvania abandoned service to Erie altogether. Both railroads were merged in 1968 to form Penn Central, and passenger rail was transferred from Penn Central to Amtrak in 1971. At one point, from 1972 to 1975, even Amtrak service in Erie was suspended. With <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> for train travel, Union Station was neglected and allowed to decay until Logistics Plus bought it in 2003. Since then it has been restored, with portions re-purposed as commercial and retail space.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the debate}} at large traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep that the four completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to Camberwell from Elephant & Castle was planned and approved in 1931. Elephant & Castle was {{also to be}} reconstructed with a third platform to provide the additional reversing capacity, along with a new ticket hall and escalators. Due {{to the need to}} prioritise the extension from Baker Street to Finchley Road, to relieve congestion on the Metropolitan line, as well as financial constraints and the outbreak of the Second World War, no work was carried out on the extension. In the 1950s there was a brief revival of the plan, in which it was proposed that Elephant & Castle would not be altered and the additional turn-round capacity would be provided by making Camberwell a three-platform terminus. The project was ultimately unaffordable owing to post-war austerity, <b>reduced</b> <b>demand,</b> and the disproportionately high cost of the project with a three-platform deep-level terminus and the requirement for new trains and a depot.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian {{oil shale}} was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of shale oil began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into oil shale and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Norman was {{developed}} in the early 19th century, and along with Thoroughbred and local Norman blood, influences were seen from other breeds, including British and Russian trotting horses. By the mid-19th century, the Anglo-Norman was a popular breed throughout France, and in 1864 a breed association was founded. While often purchased by the French army and used as cavalry and artillery horses, there was controversy over whether the Anglo-Norman was the best choice for the military. The late 19th century saw significant improvements in breeding programs, although there remained a dispute between the goals of breeders and the needs of the military. Mechanization in the early 20th century significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> for the breed, and fighting during World War II and the German occupation of France resulted in major damage to breeding centers and the deaths of many horses. While rebuilding their herds, breeders turned away from draft and carriage horses and began breeding sport horses for equestrian competition.|$|E
5|$|Whitby grew in {{size and}} wealth, {{extending}} its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolutions catch produced 230tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which {{were used in the}} corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship, the Phoenix, remained.|$|E

5|$|Bob Ayling's {{leadership}} {{led to a}} {{cost savings}} of £750m {{and the establishment of}} a budget airline, Go, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to <b>reduced</b> <b>demand</b> following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} employee job crafting behaviors (i. e., seeking resources, seeking challenges, and <b>reducing</b> <b>demands)</b> {{in the context}} of organizational change. We examined predictors of job crafting both at the organizational level (i. e., perceived impact of the implemented changes on the working life of employees) and the individual level (i. e., employee willingness to follow the changes). Job crafting behaviors were expected to predict task performance and exhaustion. Two-wave longitudinal data from 580 police officers undergoing organizational changes were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings showed that the degree to which changes influence employees’ daily work was linked to <b>reducing</b> <b>demands</b> and exhaustion, whereas employee willingness to change was linked to seeking resources and seeking challenges. Furthermore, while seeking resources and seeking challenges were associated with high task performance and low exhaustion respectively, <b>reducing</b> <b>demands</b> seemed to predict exhaustion positively. Our findings suggest that job crafting can act as a strategy of employees to respond to organizational change. While seeking resources and seeking challenges enhance employee adjustment and should be encouraged by managers, <b>reducing</b> <b>demands</b> seems to have unfavorable implications for employee...|$|R

40|$|Widespread {{participation}} of retail electricity consumers in short-term wholesale electricity markets throughout the United States is rapidly becoming technologically feasible. A number of jurisdictions are installing or have installed interval meters {{for a large}} fraction or all of their retail customers. With this technology in place, the only remaining barrier is whether state regu-lators will require customers {{to pay for their}} electricity according to retail prices that vary with hourly system conditions. A common complaint about retail tariffs that pass through the hourly wholesale price in the retail price is that these dynamic pricing tariffs require customers to monitor hourly prices in order to decide whether to <b>reduce</b> <b>demand</b> dur-ing a given hour of the day. The customer must assess whether the pattern of hourly prices is suf-ficient to justify taking action to <b>reduce</b> <b>demand.</b> For example, if the customer has a fixed cost to take action to <b>reduce</b> <b>demand</b> and the wholesale price increase lasts only one hour, then a very large price spike is necessary to cause the cus-tomer to take action. Taking the example of a residential cus-tomer with a 2. 5 kilowatt-hour (KWh) demand in that hour and $ 5 fixed cost of taking action to <b>reduce</b> <b>demand</b> by 20 percent implies that an hourly price spike of at least $ 10, 000 per megawatt-hour (MWh), or 1, 000 cents/KWh, is needed to produce sufficient cost savings from <b>reducing</b> <b>demand</b> by 0. 5 KWh (20 per-cent of 2. 5 KWh) to overcome the $ 5 cost of taking action. This logic implies that if custom-ers face a fixed cost of taking action to <b>reduce</b> their <b>demand,</b> there may be hours with high prices that the customer decides not to respond to because the expected cost savings from th...|$|R

50|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have discovered}} that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, {{a significant amount of}} money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power <b>demand</b> curves by <b>reducing</b> the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or <b>reduce</b> <b>demand.</b> Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps to <b>reduce</b> <b>demand.</b> Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to <b>reduce</b> <b>demand</b> - typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to <b>reduce</b> aggregate <b>demand.</b> Loads such as incandescent lights and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, induction motor loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption.|$|R
