Liabilities were £22,000 and assets £1,000. Failure was owing to bad debts owed by their father and trading losses. Their father had failed in July or August 1892 leading to the bad debt and to their own failure. Their partner J.W. Nightingale was believed to be still trading in New York, where the London court could not reach him.|$|E

While most of his failing companies were British, {{he was involved in}} an international scandal involving the fraudulent sale of shares in the exhausted Emma Silver Mine at Alta, Utah. He was declared bankrupt in 1877, but attempted to regain his fortune by establishing a new bank in 1878. This failed, and he was again in the bankruptcy court in 1885. A third and final <b>receiving</b> <b>order</b> was made against him a few days before his death in 1899.

The show lasted for only one series, and Green was apparently told it was [...] "too American" [...] for the British audience. After the show was cancelled, Green sued the BBC, Carroll Levis, and six friends and family of Levis, alleging a conspiracy to keep his Opportunity Knocks show off the air to preserve Levis's rival show, [...] "Discoveries". The case came to trial at the High Court in May 1955, with Green represented by Viscount Hailsham. The trial lasted for twenty days, but on 27 May, after a retirement of only 20 minutes, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. As {{a result of the}} costs in the case, Green's creditors filed a petition for his bankruptcy, and a <b>receiving</b> <b>order</b> was made on 8 May 1956.

30|$|In this environment, TCP {{inability}} {{to distinguish the}} actual reason (i.e., congestion or not) for a packet loss can lead to inappropriate reaction to a false congestion state, which results in wasteful behavior and unnecessary throughput decrease. Another key issue contributing to the degradation of TCP performance is packet reordering, which {{is not such a}} rare event in wireless networks [3]. It happens when the <b>receiving</b> <b>order</b> of TCP packets differs from the sending order. High channel error rates in wireless links activate link-layer retransmissions which can lead to out-of-order delivery. The packet reordering problem violates the near in-order assumption made in the design of many traffic control mechanisms (i.e., duplicate acknowledgments), introducing several unnecessary retransmissions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} production-inventory decisions under order-occurrence risk. To characterize this problem briefly, let the number of periods which elapse between the receipt of orders n and n + 1 for an item be described by a probability mass function f n(s). If f n(∞) > 0, then order-occurrence risk is said to exist. That is, upon <b>receiving</b> <b>order</b> n for an item, there exists a positive probability that no future orders will occur. Assuming deterministic order quantities, the order-occurrence risk problem is formulated as a dynamic program. Optimal production-inventory disposal policies are characterized for the case of piecewise-linear production-disposal costs and concave increasing holding costs. The production cost is assumed to include a setup cost, and demand backlogging is not permitted. The production and disposal lead times {{are assumed to be}} zero. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this article, a {{bandwidth}} and latency aware con-tribution estimation (BLACE) {{mechanism is}} proposed {{to enhance the}} efficiency of content distribution in a mesh peer-to-peer (P 2 P) streaming system. This is because the mesh P 2 P streaming system outperforms others in many aspects, but most content distribution mechanisms use only one of upload bandwidth and link latency as a factor, several contribution-aware schemes (CASs) just punish selfish peers, and some CASs only rearrange the content <b>receiving</b> <b>order.</b> Hence, the BLACE proposes a prevention way considering every peer’s upload bandwidth, link latency, and the maximum playing delay of a stream {{at the same time}} to prioritize the content distribution. Moreover, BLACE is implemented on Coolstreaming with NS 2 and experimental results show that BLACE could at the most shorten the receiving time about 15. 44 %, 13. 94 %, and 8. 26 %, and improve the whole performance about 7. 05 %, 2. 81 %, and 2. 69 % at the most, when it compares with the Coolstream-ing, the Coolstreaming with bandwidth preference, and the Cool-streaming with latency preference, respectively.

3000|$|Lead Time (LT) is {{the time}} that elapses between the placing of an order (either a {{purchase}} order or a production order issued to the shop or the factory floor) and actually receiving the goods ordered. If a supplier (an external firm or an internal department or plant) cannot supply the required goods on demand, then the client firm must keep an inventory of the needed goods. The longer the lead time, the larger the quantity of goods the firm must carry in inventory. In general, the time of order <b>receiving,</b> <b>order</b> handling, order processing, manufacturing, assembly, distribution and delivery time to the customer includes in a lead time. Since the customer perspective is very important. LT has been counted until products or goods arrive to the customer. Hence the lead time measurement can be done from the customer points of view. The customers can be varies by different meanings. For instance, suppliers deliver components or parts to the main manufacturer where manufacturer is the customer from supplier’s perspective. LT can be also measured from the manufacturer points of view. Manufacturer also measures the lead from starting of the processing, fabrication and assembly up-to ready the product for shipment. This can be said as internal lead time. Whereas the external lead time can define by includes shipping, logistics and distribution time.|$|E

Goal {{of this research is}} to know about the sale of the credit system and billing system receivable trade (business) that is applied by PT. Jaya Mulya Perkasa and provide solutions (exit) on the problems associated with credit sales receivables and billing system in accordance with the situation in the PT. Jaya Mulya Perkasa. Methods of data analysis consisted of analysis of some of the document or forms are used, analysis of credit sales system, billing system analysis of receivables, and analysis of the internal system of credit sales. From the results of the research done by the author, some conclusions can be drawn on the system, among other credit sales receivables and billing system there is still weakness, for example, customers that recorded by the marketing conditions have not been known whether or not eligible for the sting up, because after <b>receiving</b> <b>order</b> the direct marketing data submitted to the accounting and administrative areas is not to stock the Surveyor, the task duplication between the accounting with the administration and the stock Surveyor with the shipment, and also the number of forms that are used less and still need improvements. Based on above conclusions, the author provides several suggestions, among others, after receiving orders from customers, the marketing should immediately submit a form to be taken immediately so that the Surveyor feasibility analysis, separation of duties between the accounting with the administration and the stock Surveyor with the need to allow was so happens internal check (a clear division of tasks), and the company also needs to add some form, such form of the survey plus 3 pieces, stock request form to make as much as 2 pieces, the delivery of 4 sheets, 1 sheet form billing schedule, 3 sheets receipt ransom, and the form letter 3 sheet path of law and the letter of agreement between the company with the customer (SKPC) 2 pieces of work to prevent the customer from trying to avoid the problem receivables. In addition, companies need to provide a motivation or attention to the debt collector with the bonus money if, successful debt collector collect all the customer in accordance with the target company that has been set, and also the prize for the customer to pay installments on time is always on the payment date or on the when charged and prizes are given only once after the last installment. There are also other things such as the placement of employees in the positions that match the potential, making a rotation or movement of employees, and the development employee creativity so that employees of the company can produce a competent and honest.
