40|$|BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) {{the cost}} of adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{in the general population}} is high and under-reporting by health professionals is a well-recognized problem. Another way to increase ADR reporting is to let the consumers themselves report directly to the authorities. In Sweden it is mandatory for prescribers to report serious ADRs to the Medical Products Agency (MPA), but there are no such regulations for consumers. The non-profit and independent organization Consumer Association for Medicines and Health, KILEN has launched the possibility for consumers to report their perceptions and experiences from their use of medicines in order to strengthen consumer rights within the health care sector. This study aimed to analyze these consumer <b>reports.</b> METHODS: <b>All</b> <b>reports</b> <b>submitted</b> from January 2002 to April 2009 to an open web site in Sweden where anyone could report their experience with the use of pharmaceuticals were analyzed with focus on common psychiatric side effects related to antidepressant usage. More than one ADR for a specific drug could be reported. RESULTS: In total 665 reports were made during the period. 442 reports concerned antidepressant medications and the individual antidepressant reports represented 2392 ADRs and 878 (37 %) of these were psychiatric ADRs. 75 % of the individual reports concerned serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the rest serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Women reported more antidepressant psychiatric ADRs (71 %) compared to men (24 %). More potentially serious psychiatric ADRs were frequently reported to KILEN and withdrawal symptoms during discontinuation were also reported as a common issue. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that consumer reports may contribute with important information regarding more serious psychiatric ADRs following antidepressant treatment. Consumer reporting may be considered a complement to traditional ADR reporting...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the underlying genetic defect in a Chinese family affected with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract. Methods: A four-generation Chinese family with inherited nuclear cataract phenotype was recruited. Detailed family history and clinical data were <b>recorded.</b> <b>All</b> <b>reported</b> nuclear cataract-related candidate genes were screened for causative mutations by direct DNA sequencing. Effects of amino acid {{changes on the}} structure and function of protein were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Results: All affected individuals in this family showed nuclear cataracts. Sequencing of the candidate genes revealed a heterozygous c. 559 C>T change in the coding region of the major intrinsic protein (MIP), which caused a substitution of highly conserved arginine by cysteine at codon 187 (p. R 187 C). This mutation co-segregated with all affected individuals and was not observed in unaffected family members or 110 ethnically matched controls. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the mutation was predicted to affect the function and secondary structure of MIP protein. Conclusions: This study identified a novel disease-causing mutation p. R 187 C in MIP in a Chinese cataract family, expanding the mutation spectrum of MIP causing congenital cataract. Congenital cataract is characterized by any opacities of the lens presented at birth or shortly thereafter. It is one of th...|$|R

No attempt was made to standardize the type or location of the urinary tract infection. Only those patients with gross urinary tract abnormalities, severe neurogenic bladder disease, or indwelling urinary catheters for prolonged periods were excluded from the study.
