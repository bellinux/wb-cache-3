40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of aluminium foams {{can be improved}} by matrix reinforcement and <b>resin-impregnation</b> methods. In the present study, aluminium foams were reinforced by both ceramic particulate reinforcing of the aluminium matrix and resin-impregnating pores. The {{mechanical properties}} and the energy absorption of the reinforced aluminium foams were investigated by dynamic and quasi-static compression. Results indicated that the ceramic particle additions of CBN, SiC and B 4 C in aluminium foams increase the peak stress, elastic modulus and energy absorption of the aluminium foams, under both conditions of dynamic and quasi-static compression. Moreover, the aluminium foams with and without ceramic particle additions exhibited obvious strain rate sensitivity during dynamic compression. Furthermore, the <b>resin-impregnation</b> improves the mechanic properties and energy absorption of aluminium foams significantly. However, aluminium foams with <b>resin-impregnation</b> showed negligible strain rate sensitivity under dynamic compression. It is reported that both the ceramic particle addition and <b>resin-impregnation</b> can be effective techniques to improve the mechanical and the energy absorption properties of aluminium foams. <br /...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} and thermal properties of multi-walled carbon nano-tubes and carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin matrix composite patch were tested, which was {{prepared by the}} hand lay-up method. The {{results indicated that the}} imagination observed by SEM presented good <b>resin-impregnation</b> for both of the two kinds of composite patches, and the {{mechanical and}} thermal properties of composite patch could be effectively increased by improvement of the interface combination after adding MWCNTs. For the mechanical properties of composite patch reinforced with MWCNTs, the interlaminar shear strength, bend strength and impact-tolerance were separately increased by 3. 1 %, 51. 66 % and 60. 7 %; and heat-resistance obtained by DMA were shown better thermal stability...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the association between}} geometry and material behaviour, specifically the elastic properties of resin impregnated latex membranes, by means of homogenizing protocols which translate physical properties into geometrical functions. <b>Resin-impregnation</b> patterns are applied to 2 -D pre-stretched form-active tension systems to induce 3 -D curvature upon release. This method enables form-finding based on material properties, organization and behaviour. Some theoretical foundations for material-computation are outlined. A digital tool developed in the Processing (JAVA coded) environment {{demonstrates the}} simulation of material behaviour and its prediction under specific environmental conditions.

40|$|Advani, Suresh G. Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) {{processes}} {{are useful in}} manufacturing high quality parts at low cost. To ensure this quality, modeling and simulation of the process should be performed before the part is manufactured. Predicting infusion and <b>resin-impregnation</b> will give the manufacturer an advantage when setting up the LCM process. It is essential, then, to evaluate accurately the permeability of individual system components such as flow enhancement media (distribution media) and multiple preform layups that is usually required as input to such simulation of resin flow. Extensive work {{has been devoted to}} developing various methods of this evaluation, with the majority of the work focusing on a single type of fabric characterization. In this work, a methodology is developed and validated to estimate the in-plane and transverse (through-thickness) permeability of the fabric, as well as permeability of the distribution media {{in the direction of the}} flow. An effective permeability for the combination of fabric and distribution media is also defined. The approach is based on tracking the resin flow-front during linear infusion along the top and the bottom surface over a sample representing several material layups (a segment of which includes the flow enhancement media). Analytic solution of flow progression is derived and used to characterize the permeability of all components/layups. The solution, the error due to the assumptions and approximations made and its limits of applicability are presented. A numerical technique using flow simulation results is utilized to execute a data correction algorithm to further improve experimental estimates.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} demand for {{lightweight}} solutions {{in a wide range}} of industries, the selection and combination of various materials is becoming more and more important. As a result, the need for suitable joining technologies is increasing along with it. Within the DFG research group "Schwarz-Silber" ("black-silver"), Fraunhofer IFAM is investigating so-called transitional structures in cooperation with the University of Bremen. In this process, glass fiber structures are integrated into aluminum by a high pressure die casting process. These structures are used for the electrochemical insulation between aluminum and carbon fiber textiles, which are connected by textile processes in a subsequent production step. A solid hybrid structure is finally achieved through a <b>resin-impregnation</b> process. The key challenges are the positioning, pre-tensioning and infiltration of the glass fiber structures within the high pressure die casting process. In order to meet these challenges, a customized die casting tool was developed within the project. With the aid of mold-filling simulations, the die system of the die casting tool was optimized to achieve better infiltration of the fiber bundles and to additionally support the position of the glass fibers in the casting process. After the design of the molding tool, the implementation was carried out in collaboration with a toolmaker. In subsequent, up-to-date investigations, the positioning and infiltration of different variants of glass fiber structures is evaluated. The results are compared with previous attempts to position and infiltrate the glass fiber structures to assess the effect of the optimized newly designed tool...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade robotic {{fabrication}} in architecture has succeeded where early digital architecture has fallen short: in the synthesis of the immaterial logic of computers and the material reality of architecture. In light of this new/profound shift architectural theorist and historian of the ‘Digital Turn’ - Mario Carpo argues: ‘We no longer are witnessing the delayed modernization of an industry, but rather an historic departure: the modern division between intellectual work and manual production, between design and realization and manual production. Through this we see traditional modes of design becoming obsolete’. The increasing power of digital design software, the widespread availability of digital fabrication tools, and the growing complexity of our built environment, are {{in stark contrast to}} the inefficient techniques that currently hinder today’s construction industry. Furthermore, the utilisation of concepts from nature including biomemesis, biophilia, swarm tectonics, as well as cross-disciplinary influences - from the film industry to social sciences and artificial intelligence - has contributed significantly to the depth of change in the tools, and their subsequent delivery of, architecture. Using nature and biological paradigms as a key influence for the work (specifically biological systems as defined by Menges, Wienstock and others) the thesis asks the question: How can biological theories on growth disrupt inert material perception within the discourse of 3 D-printing architecture? It seeks to consider a design and fabrication process that allows the dynamic potential found in natural systems (patterns, forms, behaviours, organisation) to design and build with far more complexity and sophistication. Such work could fore front notions of growth, evolution and natural forms of optimization compared to the current post industrialised notions of beauty. New computing capacity and assembly efficiencies should over time produce more advanced structures than are possible with current technologies. The researcher is ‘aware’ of the range of fabrication methods available to the industry, firstly the invention of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) known primarily as a ‘subtractive method’ of machining and additive manufacturing machines (3 D printers) by Charles Hull (1984) which revolutionized rapid prototyping throughout the automotive, aeronautic, and design industries. The application of additive manufacturing workflows - in particular to the architectural field - holds significant potential to provide a fabrication method for the complex geometrical forms that substantiate the parametric design paradigm. However, contemporary attempts in mass fabrication of computer generated componentry are still costly in terms of practice, investment, and time [...] . They are also complex in terms of assembly and co-ordination. Using customized CAD/CAM workflow the author speculates a self-assembling ‘ 4 -D’ architecture. As a piece of explorative design research, the thesis focuses primarily on the underlying philosophy and design methods, and looks to offer up a series of tectonic iterations that integrate form, surface and structure. These iterations have been designed and developed through complex surface pattern projection, a speculative technique developed by the author. It allows a use of direct additive 3 d print to surface and enables a prototype fabrication system. This prototype system results in the production of self-assembling tension based membrane surface structures. These structures could, for example, be used for rapid deployment construction scenarios. (see final Design Research). <b>Resin-impregnation</b> patterns are applied to 2 -D pre-stretched form-active tension systems to induce 3 -D curvature upon release. Form-finding is enabled through this method based on materials’ properties, organization and behavior. A digital tool is developed in the CAD environment that demonstrates the simulation of material behavior and its prediction under specific environmental conditions. The methodology follows a systematic design-led research approach, in which physical form finding techniques, developed throughout the 19 th and 20 th centuries, are digitized via parametric 3 D modelling software. Extensive physical modelling and analysis is conducted into a biomimetic approach to the design of fabric tensegrity surface structures, and their CNC fabrication potential explored. This research demonstrates the association between geometry and material behavior, specifically the elastic properties of resin impregnated Lycra membranes, by means of homogenizing protocols which translate physical properties into geometrical functions. The work challenges the shifting role of the architect from that of an assembler of inert (discrete) material parts towards that of ‘an orchestrator of material effects’. This shift in role is enabled through the affordances of computational design tools, and emerging fabrication methods. Conclusions are drawn from the physical and digital explorations which redefine generative material-based design computation, supporting a synergetic approach to design integrating form, structure, material and environment.
