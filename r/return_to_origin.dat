40|$|Abstract Background The invasion-metastasis {{cascade of}} cancer {{involves}} {{a process of}} parallel progression. A biological interface (module) in which cells is linked with ECM (extracellular matrix) by CAMs (cell adhesion molecules) has been proposed {{as a tool for}} tracing cancer spatiotemporal dynamics. Methods A mathematical model was established to simulate cancer cell migration. Human uterine leiomyoma specimens, in vitro cell migration assay, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, dynamic viscosity, and an in vivo C 57 BL 6 mouse model were used to verify the predictive findings of our model. Results The <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>origin</b> probability (RTOP) and its related CAM expression ratio in tumors, so-called "tumor self-seeding", gradually decreased with increased tumor size, and approached the 3 D Pólya random walk constant (0. 340537) in a periodic structure. The biphasic pattern of cancer cell migration revealed that cancer cells initially grew together and subsequently began spreading. A higher viscosity of fillers applied to the cancer surface was associated with a significantly greater inhibitory effect on cancer migration, in accordance with the Stokes-Einstein equation. Conclusion The positional probability and cell-CAM-ECM interface (module) in the fractal framework helped us decipher cancer spatiotemporal dynamics; in addition we modeled the methods of cancer control by manipulating the microenvironment plasticity or inhibiting the CAM expression to the Pólya random walk, Pólya constant. </p...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 166 - 172. The {{reason for}} this study was to {{determine}} if there is any connection between nostalgia and the debunking effect in the work of N. P. van Wyk Louw Starting with a thorough explanation of the term nostalgia to establish any implications the word might have. They can be summarised as: A longing for a simple life without loneliness where the person will feel at home. A desire to reach a better understanding of God and the primordial as the source of all life. Nostalgia develops as a result of a interrelationship between the past, present and the future and an interrelationship between the abstract and concrete aspects of nostalgia. In short: Nostalgia is a desire to establish an Utopian existence. It was found that the secondary literature on the topic is of a limited nature. The literature relating to Van Wyk Louw concentrates mostly on Nuwe Verse and Tristia and especially on the type of language used in "Klipwerk" and the fact that the author resided in the Netherlands while writing these two books. To outline the developement of nostalgic tendencies, the theme-poem of every book was looked at and it was found that Alleenspraak, Die Halwe Kring and Gestaltes en Diere encompasses the desire aspect of nostalgia, while Nuwe Verse and Tristia have a bearing on the remembrance aspect. The study of the love-, monologue- and prophet-figures showed that the search for certainty and unity leads has a debunking effect. Innocence brings the primordial into play which was studied using the poem "Die Swart Luiperd". The study showed that it is impossible to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>origin</b> of life. With the debunking of the abstract aspects of nostalgia, attention was given to the earthly aspects. In this regard it was also found that the human being is isolated. Lastly, the poem "Groot Ode" was looked at to see if the poet has any answer to the debunking effect of nostalgia. Here irony was suggested as an answer to the debunking effect of nostalgia and as something that would make nostalgia bearable...|$|E

40|$|Today the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is widely}} used in the {{estimation}} of position. But the GPS signal is not always available and not precise in some certain case. For pedestrian navigation applications, daily non-GPS systems mainly use inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are more portable and potentially inexpensive. However, the bias or drift {{in the process of}} inertial measurement largely limits the precision of position and attitude estimation when integrated directly from accelerations and angular rates. ^ In our study, we have designed an integrated system to analyze the data collected from a MicroStrain Inertial Measurement Unit. For convenience and comfort, the inertial measurement instrument in our experiment is strapped at the middle of the beltline at the back to collect data. This is commonly considered closest to the center of gravity of a person. From frequency domain analysis, the fundamental frequency of walking is clear enough which shows the different stepping periods, and the noise is also easily seen from the spectra. Thus, in the integrated system, a Kalman Filter (KF) is applied first to reduce the noise, especially in the measurement system. The filtered angular rate is then integrated to the three by three rotation matrix, to make an output of walking directions, as well as the attitudes. The mainly auxiliary part to correct the estimation of position is the application of human gait model. From the investigated former results, the dynamic gait for individuals can be expressed clearly as a relationship between stride length and stride frequency. It is a basic characteristic of human walking and running. Here, we perform several series of experiments again to obtain the correct functional form of this relationship. After adding a non-zero constant in the formula instead of a sole power function, the updated curve of simulated result between stride length and stride interval fits the experimental data much better than before. Also we can know the variance of this method by analyzing the confidence interval of this relationship. ^ Having the relationship in human gait model, both walking and running modes are covered by the function. Thus, the estimation of position can be corrected in each step by integrating both the results from integration of acceleration and the gait model. When detecting each step of human walking or running, we use the methodology of detecting the zero-crossing points from the compensated acceleration in vertical direction. After filtering the candidate zero points, which means potentially a moment that the force from the ground balanced by gravity, some false detections need to be filtered again to obtain the satisfied result. The idea here is to use the human gait again. Since human cannot run in a very large frequency, commonly not far beyond 3 Hz, we can neglect some zero points if the time interval between them is very small which means oscillations may happen. Having found all the correct points when lift off (LO) and touch down (TD) events, we have produced an impulsive function illustrating two phases (on stance and on flight) in each stride interval very well. ^ We have built up several experiments for human walking and running process and analyze by the integrated system. The typical experiment is implemented by walking back and forth in a straight line, as well as walking around a square closed-loop. In the square loop experiment, a close loop having a total length of 120 meters is set up. The pedestrian walked or ran in clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) then <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>origin.</b> Having estimated from the method, our most current result shows that overall drift can be minimized to below 4 % and even 1. 5 % in one direction. ^ Moreover, we are improving the system by investigating on the elimination of initial drift from IMUs by the use of rotation transformation matrix, as well as the application of gyroscope for 3 -D model. We have expand the tests to about four hundred meters length and obtain a relatively error around 1 %, and about the ∼ 2 % drift of position tracking. At last, as an exploration, a 3 -D test including stairs is established and a potential approach of analysing has been introduced. ^ The result from this integrated method indicates that the drift can be limited below some certain percentage. Based on the precise results from our experiments, we can improve this methodology a lot and apply this method to the area of pedestrian walking estimation, soldier and firefighter tracking, and urgent rescue. ...|$|E

Moreover, conditioned on {S_ 2 n= 0 } the maximal displacement _k≤ 2 n |S_k| converges in distribution when scaled by √(n) (diffusive scaling). We consider the analogous problem for transient random walks in random environments on Z. We show that under the quenched law P_ω (conditioned on the environment ω), the maximal displacement of the random walk when conditioned <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the <b>origin</b> at time 2 n is no longer necessarily of the order √(n). If the environment is nestling (both positive and negative local drifts exist) then the maximal displacement conditioned on <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the <b>origin</b> at time 2 n is of order n^κ/(κ+ 1), where the constant κ> 0 depends on the law on environment.

In particular, for certain non-nestling environments we show that P_ω(X_ 2 n= 0) = {-Cn -C'n/(n) ^ 2 + o(n/(n) ^ 2) } with explicit constants C,C'> 0.
