40|$|Background and Objectives: Plantar foot is a {{very active}} part in leap activities, such as <b>rope</b> <b>jumping</b> and with its small surface playes an {{important}} role in balance control. In this research, the effect of 12 week <b>rope</b> <b>jumping</b> exercise was investigated on postural control and static and dynamic balance in 10 - 13 years old male students with cavus foot. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was done on 450 male students aged 13 - 10 years in Jarghouyeh sofla. After the initial evaluation by pedescope (qualitative) and then measurement by a foot scanner (quantitative) and Staheli index, 30 students were selected as samples and were divided into two groups (experimental and control, each 15 cases). To measure the postural control, a foot scanner device was used and changes in plantar center of pressure was recorded for 20 seconds. Static balance was evaluated with stork test and dynamic balance by Y balance test. The subjects of the experimental group participated in a <b>rope</b> <b>jumping</b> training protocol three 45 -minute sessions per week for 12 weeks. In this period of time, the subjects of the control group did not participate in any regular physical activity program in this time. Data were analyzed using dependent and independent t-tests. The significance level was considered p< 0 / 05. Results: A 12 -week <b>rope</b> <b>jumping</b> exercise improved postural control and static and dynamic balance in patients with cavus foot, which this change was significant (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, <b>rope</b> <b>jumping</b> can be a useful exercise to improve static and dynamic balance and postural control in individuals with cavus foot...|$|R

40|$|Rope {{skipping}} is {{a popular}} indoor exercise which enhances cardiorespiratory fitness. A lot of researches investigated the physiological effects of rope skipping. However, biomechanical analysis in this exercise was limited. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the changes of kinematics of double-leg forward skipping, before and after fatigue. One male subject participated in the study. The subject skipped for 2 minutes and 55 seconds. Results showed that, after fatigue, the subject decreased the jump height, more trunk and head movement in the forward-backward direction, and might recruit more quadriceps and hamstrings muscles during skip.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{relative}} impact of two established jump training programs on increasing vertical jump ability. Twenty-four male high school basketball players were randomly assigned to two groups. Each group participated in a jump training program using either plyometrics or heavy <b>rope</b> <b>jump</b> routines. The players were tested prior to and after a six-week, 18 day period. A standard test for vertical jump was used. The test had two trials measuring vertical jump ability. The test required the subjects to stand at attention with their dominant arm stretched up the wall. The height their arm reached was then measured. The subjects were then instructed to crouch down and explode up as high as possible. The height their arm reached during the jump was measured and the procedure was repeated. The difference between the standing height and the jumping height was the final score. The best score of the two trials was then recorded. The subjects were randomly assigned to group A) Heavy Rope, or B) Plyometric training program with 12 subjects in each group. Both groups were split into six pairs with each pair starting on a different exercise. Two sets of 30 seconds were performed at each exercise with a rest period of 30 seconds as the partners took turns. Each pair would rotate until all six exercises were performed. There were a total of 18 days of training with each group meeting three times a week for the entire six weeks. Prior to the start of each day's activities, each group participated in rigorous stretching and flexibility exercises along with a minimal amount of form running techniques. Data was analyzed using a statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). The analysis showed there was no significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores and there was no significant difference between plyometric and heavy <b>rope</b> <b>jump</b> programs. Therefore, the hypothesis can be rejected. This data is not in agreement with previous findings. Reasons for these findings may be due to the long distance running that was part of the conditioning program. Other possible factors leading to these results may be due to the duration of the training program. It would be interesting to repeat this study using a larger sample size, longer duration of training time, using only the jump routines with no distance runs, and using a smaller unit of measurement to calculate the jump heights.

40|$|In {{line with}} writer’s observation, game {{activity}} {{of boys and}} girls are different in the way they are playing. Some experts belived that the difference appeared since they born, in other words, they were pattern genetically. Others believed that this difference resulted from different nurture toward the kids. The fact above showed why they, boys and girls, play differently. Based on the way their parents take care and guide resulted in they play in the same or different ways. This study purposed to observe deeply on parents’ perception of pre-school children games based on gender. The research used quantitative descriptive analysis method using accidental sampling technique. The research instruments were questionnaire and survey hand out to the research subject directly. The subject consisted of 35 person with being categorized those who have 2 - 5 years old children and lived in Tlogomas district, Malang. The aspects being observed related to children games were games of pretending, physical/movement, constructive, explorative, collection, entertain, traditional and board. The result showed that the parents considered that certain games were appropriate or more to boys than girls or to girls and for both of them. Parent considered that boys games tended to more on physical and adventure games while games for girls were more on calm and less challenge. They believed that games for boys should be games of battle, journey, tree-climb, bike, soccer, playing in field and river, collecting car and robot toys, yo-yo and playing AS card. For girls, the games should be buyer-seller roles, take care baby, dance, <b>rope</b> <b>jump,</b> collecting dolls, game of jack and game played on bord. The games that appropriate for both should be role games in schools, family, doctor-patient, construct puzzle and blocks, make things for paper, wood, sand, paraffin, and soil, collecting money toys, watching TV and VCD, listening to radio and story, hide-and-seek, monopoly and sneak ladder...|$|E

40|$|To regular {{exercise}} {{and a healthy}} diet, the American Heart Association (AHA) strongly recommends <b>rope</b> <b>jumping,</b> and according to previous studies, <b>rope</b> <b>jumping</b> is considered a very strenuous exercise. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the steady state metabolic cost of repetitive jumping on the Digi-Jump machine, and to determine if exercise on this device is more or less strenuous than similar exercise with a <b>jump</b> <b>rope.</b> We also evaluated relative intensity of this type of exercise, based on each person’s VO 2 max as measured on a treadmill. Twenty – seven subjects completed two trials, one jumping trial at a rate of 120 jumps per minute (JPM) with the jumping height set at. 5 inch for 5 min, and one graded exercise test (GXT) using the Bruce protocol. Oxygen uptake (VO 2), heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and rating perceived exertion (RPE) were measured each minute during each trial. Results of this study indicated that steady state VO 2 during the 5 min jump test was reached at the 3 rd min (p 3 ̆c. 05), therefore we equated all other variables (HR, RE, RPE) steady state to be from 3 rd min. Average jumping steady state VO 2 was 31. 1 ± 5. 5 ml/kg/min, while average VO 2 max was 56. 4 ± 12 ml/kg/min, thus steady state VO 2 during jumping trial was 57. 1...|$|R
