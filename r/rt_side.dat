40|$|Statement of problem: Condylar {{hyperplasia}} of the mandible is a self limiting abnormality {{which can}} cause facial asymmetry, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction and esthetic problems. Treatment planning {{is based on the}} results of isotope scanning, clinical findings and patient age. Single photon emission tomography(SPECT) is considered to be a sensitive method in the calculation of condylar uptake differences. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the growth activity occurring in the mandibular condyles, and to devise an index of side-to-side differences in condylar activity in different individuals. Material and Methods: 38 patients, with an age range of 13 to 34 years, undergoing skeletal scintigraphy for a variety of conditions, were chosen for this study. 25 mci TC- 99 was injected to all subjects in order to assess the difference between right (Rt) andleft (Lt) condylar uptake percentage and to calculate the Lt to Rt condylar uptake ratio. The normal index was determined. Results: The maximum amount of difference between the uptake of Rt and Lt condyles was 6. 2 percent (Lt side and <b>Rt</b> <b>side</b> were 53. 1 % and 46. 9 %, respectively) in the male patients and 5. 7 percent in the female patients (Lt side and <b>Rt</b> <b>side</b> were 52. 85 % and 47. 15 %, respectively). The condylar activity difference and ratio of Lt to Rt condylar uptakes did not show a significant difference between the male and female groups.

40|$|Radiation therapy (RT) is {{utilised}} for {{the treatment}} of around half of all oncology patients during the course of their illness. Despite great clinical progress in the rational deployment of RT, the underlying molecular basis for its efficacy and toxicity are currently imperfectly understood. In this study, we took a biochemical approach to evaluate the potential role of key ionising radiation repair proteins in the treatment outcomes of patients with severe acute or late <b>RT</b> <b>side</b> effects. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from blood samples from 36 radiosensitive cases and a number of controls (the latter had had RT but did not develop significant toxicity). The expression level and migration of key proteins from the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway was evaluated by Western blot analysis on cases and controls. We did not observe any abnormalities in expression level or migration pattern of the following NHEJ proteins in radiosensitive cancer cases: Ku 70, Ku 80, XRCC 4, DNA Ligase IV. These important negative results provide evidence that mutations that affect protein expression of these NHEJ components are unlikely to underlie clinical radiation sensitivity...|$|E

Objective: The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the efficacy of narrow band versus broad band in the treatment of pityriasis rosea. Methods: Twenty patients (12 female & 8 male) with extensive pityriasis rosea type III & IV were participated in the study. Their ages ranged between 18 and 35 years. The right half of the body of each patient was irradiated with NB-UVB,while left side of each patient is exposed to broadband BB-UVB for 3 times alternatively per week until clearing of lesions or for 6 weeks. The rate of clearing was monitored by estimating the pityriasis rosea severity (PRSS) score and the pruritus score.

Material and methods: 17 adult hemiplegics patients (50 - 70 yrs., mean = 60. 52, SD= 7. 22); with <b>RT</b> <b>side</b> dominancy and 6 months after stroke, participated in this study. All procedures were approved by ethical committee of TUMS and written consents were also taken. Patients were familiarized with the procedure and shoulder extensor and abductor muscles isometric strengths were measured by dynamometer. Results: According to results of our study, shoulder extensor and abductor muscles isometric strengths showed significant differences between mean scores of pre and post intervention (P< 0. 05). Progressive Resistive Exercise improved 34 % in shoulder extensor muscles isometric strength and 27 % shoulder abductor muscle isometric strength. Conclusion: Results of our research showed that progressive resistive exercise approach is a useful method for increasing the isometric strength of shoulder extensor and abductor muscles. Therefore, it might be concluded that improvement of strength of shoulder muscles could result in stability in shoulder girdle and consequently might affect on hand function in hemiplegic patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pineal parenchymal tumor (PPT) {{is a rare}} {{neoplasm}} {{arising from}} the pineal gland and originating from pineocytes. It accounts for 0. 3 % of all primary intracranial tumors. PPTs are classified as pineocytoma, pineocytoma with intermediate differentiation (PPTID) and pineoblastoma. PPTID is the least frequent type among these three. Little is known about its clinical behavior and the definitive treatment {{is yet to be}} defined. We presented two patients with PPTID managed in our institution with literature review. Case 1 : A 65 -year-old lady presented with increasing dizziness and vomiting in March 2008. CT brain noted an ill-defined lesion over the midbrain causing obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI revealed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion at the pineal region, superiorly abutting the posterior aspect of the thalamus and inferiorly extending to the cerebellum. Partial debulking of the tumor and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt were immediately performed. Pathology confirmed pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (PPTID), grade II – III. Patient then received post-op radiotherapy (RT) to the tumor bed using 3 D conformal technique given 54 Gy in 27 fractions over 5. 5 weeks and completed in May 2008. She had good recovery after treatment. 6 -month post-RT MRI showed significant improvement and decreased in size of the pineal tumor. The lesion remained static in 30 -month post-RT MRI. Case 2 : A 59 -year-old lady presented with headache and unsteady gait since April 2009. MRI brain showed a ____ mass in the pineal region causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Maximal tumor resection with VP shunting was performed. Pathology confirmed PPTID. Patient subsequently had post-op RT to the tumor bed given 54 Gy in 27 fractions over 5. 5 weeks and completed treatment in August 2009. Interval post-RT MRIs and the latest one in April 2013 (Post-RT 45 -month) still showed completion remission. Conclusion: PPTID is very rare and its proper management strategy remains unclear. Dose and volume of irradiation for PPT reported were heterogeneous and diverse, ranging from craniospinal irradiation, whole-brain RT, whole-ventricular RT to RT just to tumor bed. As shown in our cases, a less extended RT field to the tumor bed alone with dose up to brainstem tolerance would be reasonable and effective in view of the good radiosensitivity of PPTID and the minimum <b>RT</b> <b>side</b> effects. Further studies are warranted to investigate the best adjuvant treatment for PPTID...|$|E
40|$|The LHCb {{experiment}} {{will take}} place at the future LHC accelerator at CERN and will start in 2006. It is a forward single-arm spectrometer dedicated to precision measurements of CP violation and rare decays in the b quark sector. Recent experimental results have shown that CP violation is large in this sector. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises via the complex phase of the 3 x 3 CKM quark mixing matrix. The LHCb experiment will test the unitarity of this matrix by measuring in several theoretically unrelated ways all angles and all sides of the unitarity triangle. This will allow to over-constrain the model and - hopefully - to exhibit inconsistencies which will be a signal of physics beyond the Standard Model. This thesis presents the sensitivity of the LHCb experiment to the recently observed flavour changing neutral current decays b → lld,s. Comparing the inclusive branching ratios of the B → μμXs and B → μμXd decays allows to extract the CKM matrix elements ratio Vtd/Vts. This constrains the length of the <b>Rt</b> <b>side</b> - opposite to gamma - of the unitarity triangle. We present an event generator for these decays and assess the sensitivity of the LHCb experiment to these branching ratios using the full Geant-based simulation of the detector. We find that the relative statistical uncertainty on the Vtd/Vts ratio will be 11. 5 (+ 2. 8,- 3. 2) % after one year of data taking (2 fb- 1) assuming Vtd/Vts) 2 = 1 / 30. Over the whole allowed range of this ratio, the limit of 5 % statistical uncertainty can be reached in less than 10 years of data taking. This makes this way of extracting this ratio the most precise available at LHC. Because rare semileptonic decays occur via loop and penguin diagrams they are very sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Several observables using inclusive or exclusive channels are discussed and the physics sensitivity of the LHCb experiment presented. The most promising is the measurement of the dilepton mass for which the forward-backward charge asymmetry vanishes in the B → μμK* decay. This allows to extract the ratio of two Wilson coefficients for which precise SM and supersymmetry predictions exist. The LHCb experiment is presently finishing its R&D. We have participated {{to the development of the}} vertex locator (VeLo) and to the writing of the VeLo Technical Design Report submitted in May 2001. We have contributed via the development of a simulation of interacting particles in silicon and the study of the off detector electronics (ODE).

This study was conducted to show the difference between mechanical and manual traction in management of cervical spondylosis. Subjects and methods: The study included fourty patients divided into two groups with age ranged from 30 to 45 years, the first group with mean age= 36. 6,SD= 0. 274 followed a physical therapy program of exercise in the form of stretching of cervical muscles with using deep friction massage, and manual cervical traction, three sessions per week for 6 weeks. The second group with mean age= 35. 8,SD= 0. 241, submitted to stretching of cervical muscles with using deep friction massage, and mechanical cervical traction, three sessions per week for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were universal goniometer to measure ROM of side bending, tape measurement to detect range of motion of cervical extension and flexion, and visual analogue scale to measure the pain severity.

Contrary to most expectations, the long awaiting results of the RTOG 0617 trial didn’t show any benefit of dose escalation to 74 Gy. In this unicentric retrospective analysis we compare the RTOG 0617 result with the outcome of our own 74 -Gy-NSCLC cohort. Methods and Material: Since October 2009, 80 patients with NSCLC were treated with 74 Gy in 37 fractions, of which 69 patients were eligible for a retrospective analysis of local and distant failure, survival time and treatment related toxicity.

The nociceptive neuronal firing in the STNcd was suppressed by the facilitation of the non-opiate pain inhibitory system, such as electrical stimulation of the IC or VPM of either side. High amplitude spontaneous and continous neuronal hyperactivity (deafferentation hyperactivity: DH), which was provoked in the left STNcd after complete ablation of the left Gasserian ganglion, was conspicuously suppressed by electrical stimulation of the IC of either <b>side</b> (<b>rt.</b> IC stimulation: 30 / 60; It. IC stimulation: 13 / 33), {{as well as by}} VPM stimulation of either <b>side</b> (<b>rt.</b> VPM stimulation: 5 / 13; It. VPM stimulation: 5 / 9). DH, similar to that provoked in the left STNcd after ganglionectomy, was found to spread to the right sensory thalamic nucleus. Twelve neurons with DH were identified in right VPM and nucleus centralis medialis. As many as nine of these twelve neurons were distributed in the marginal area of the VPM. DH in the right thalamus was also suppressed by the stimulation of the IC on either side, however, the suppressive effect was predominant with ipsilateral IC stimulation. These results are compatible with the clinical experience of relief of deafferented (deafferentation) pain by electrical stimulation of the IC or sensory thalamic nucleus (VPM, VPL). After detailed analysis and considerations, it was supposed that this experiment supports the postulated theory that not only deafferented pain but also afferent pain is relieved by the facilitation of the non-opiate pain inhibitory system including the IC and/or the sensory thalamic nucleus...|$|R

It {{has been shown}} in a supraliminal priming task that highly reward sensitive subjects have a larger reaction time (RT) priming effect and make more commission errors to prime-incongruent targets. We adapted a similar task to event-related fMRI and hypothesized that (1) high reward sensitivity is associated with increased activation in dopaminergic brain regions, the ventral striatum in particular, (2) that BAS related personality traits predict impulsivity and (3) that the BAS effects are larger after adjusting for the interactive influence of trait avoidance, as predicted by the Joint Subsystems Hypothesis. Fourteen healthy females participated in the fMRI experiment and were scored on sensitivity to reward (SR) and trait avoidance, i. e., sensitivity to punishment (SP) and neuroticism (N). SR scores were adjusted by SP and N scores. As hypothesized, adjusted SR scores predicted, more than SR scores alone, activity in the ventral striatum (left caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens).

The use of high temperature superconductors (HTS) in the 70 / 4 K range of the current lead (so-called binary current lead) allows to carry high currents with lower thermal conductivity and smaller cross sectional areas in comparison to a conventional copper current lead.

The goal of this new area is to create the commerce the community needs to survive and continue to grow, {{as well as to}} maintain that small town America feel. Getting the neighborhood to buy in will be key for this to succeed as Kemblesville residents have posted strong opposition to expansion in the past, most notably when residents Christian Scheing and Ryan Boylan expressed their feelings about a proposed NASA Space Camp by standing along <b>side</b> <b>Rt.</b> 896 baring their [...] "full moons." [...] The space camp project was quickly scrapped after this incident. Mayor Irving has stressed that Downtown Indian Town will not only be good for the community as a whole, but also the individual as a projected 2.5 new jobs could be created. [...] "This one is for the Future, Our Future!" [...] the Mayor has been quoted as saying.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMultiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{is frequently}} associated with fronto-subcortical dysfunction. Nevertheless; the specific {{basis for this}} pattern of cognitive dysfunction is still not clear in this disease. The current study aimed at further tracking the attention deficit in MS investigating 10 patients with remittent MS and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers. To study endogenous and exogenous components of attention allocation, we measured reaction times (RTs) and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) at 26 electrode sites in a visuospatial attention paradigm (Posner, 1980). Par- ticipants performed a detection task with two types of cues, peripheral (a square) and central (an arrow), which, respectively, involved exogenous (automatic) and endogenous (controlled) attention processes. Half of the trials were valid (i. e., the cue oriented the attention to the correct target location) and half of them were not valid (i. e., the cue oriented the attention to the opposite <b>side).</b> <b>RT</b> analyses showed characteristic validity effects for both peripheral and central cueing in control subjects with a right hemispheric advantage. In contrast, MS patients demonstrated a RT validity effect only in the peripheral cueing. Electrophysiological data showed longer N 1 and P 2 latencies in MS patients compared to controls arguing for an early dysfunction of information processing at perceptive stages with a reduction of N 1 amplitude at frontal sites in favour of an early modification of attention modulation. These results suggest that MS might modify only the endogenous component of attention allocation (i. e., controlled attention processes). Our investigation also underlines the usefulness of ERP recording to detect early cognitive disorders in MS...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether resistance and stretching training programmes altered the viscoelastic properties of human tendon structures in vivo. Eight subjects completed 8 weeks (4 days per week) of resistance training {{which consisted of}} unilateral plantar flexion at 70 % of one repetition maximum with 10 repetitions per set (5 sets per day). They performed resistance training (<b>RT)</b> on one <b>side</b> and resistance training and static stretching training (RST; 10 min per day, 7 days per week) on the other side. Before and after training, the elongation of the tendon structures in the medial gastrocnemius muscle was directly measured using ultrasonography, while the subjects performed ramp isometric plantar flexion up to the voluntary maximum, followed by a ramp relaxation. The relationship between estimated muscle force (Fm) and tendon elongation (L) was fitted to a linear regression, the slope of which was defined as stiffness. The hysteresis was calculated as {{the ratio of the}} area within the Fm-L loop to the area beneath the load portion of the curve. The stiffness increased significantly by 18. 8 ± 10. 4 % for RT and 15. 3 ± 9. 3 % for RST. There {{was no significant difference in}} the relative increase of stiffness between RT and RST. The hysteresis, on the other hand, decreased 17 ± 20 % for RST, but was unchanged for RT. These results suggested that the resistance training increased the stiffness of tendon structures as well as muscle strength and size, and the stretching training affected the viscosity of tendon structures but not the elasticity...|$|R

Only 30 % of oligodendroglial tumors have anaplastic characteristics. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) is often localized as a single lesion in the white matter and in the cortex, rarely in brainstem or spinal cord. The management of AO is deeply changed in the recent years. Maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) was considered as the standard of care since paramount findings regarding molecular aspects, in particular co-deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chromosome 19, revealed that these subsets of AO, benefit in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), from the addition of chemotherapy to RT. Allelic losses of chromosomes 1 p and 19 q occur in 50 %– 70 % of both low-grade and anaplastic tumors, representing a strong prognostic factor and a powerful predictor of prolonged survival. Several other molecular markers have potential clinical significance as IDH 1 mutations, confirming the strong prognostic role for OS. Malignant brain tumors negatively impacts on patients&# 39; quality of life. Seizures, visual impairment, headache, and cognitive disorders can be present. Moreover, chemotherapy and <b>RT</b> have important <b>side</b> effects. For these reasons, “health-related quality of life” is becoming a topic of growing interest, investigating on physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. Understanding the impact of medical treatment on health-related quality of life will probably have a growing effect both on health care strategies and on patients.

40|$|The {{performance}} of real-time (RT) precise positioning {{can be improved}} by utilizing observations from multiple Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) instead of one particular system. Since the end of 2012, BeiDou, independently established by China, began to provide operational services for users in the Asia-Pacific regions. In this study, an regional RT precise positioning system in Australia is developed to evaluate the {{performance of}} GPS/BeiDou observations in providing high precision positioning services for users. Fixing three hourly updated satellite orbits, RT correction messages are generated and broadcasted by processing RT observation/navigation data streams from AUSCORS at the server side. At the user <b>side,</b> <b>RT</b> PPP is realized by processing RT data streams and the RT correction messages received. RT clock offsets, for which the accuracy reached 0. 07 and 0. 25 ns for GPS and BeiDou, respectively, can be determined. Based on these corrections, an accuracy of 12. 2, 30. 0 and 45. 6 cm in the North, East and Up directions was achieved for the BeiDou-only solution after 30 minutes while the GPS-only solution reached 5. 1, 15. 3 and 15. 5 cm for the same components at the same time. A further improvement of 43. 7, 36. 9 and 45. 0 percent in the three directions, respectively, was achieved for the combined GPS/BeiDou solution. After the initialization process, the North, East and Up positioning accuracies were 5. 2, 8. 1 and 17. 8 cm, respectively, for the BeiDou-only solution, while 1. 5, 3. 0, and 4. 7 cm for the GPS-only solution. However, we only noticed a 20. 9 % improvement in the East direction was obtained for the GPS/BeiDou solution, while no improvements in the other directions were detected. It is expected that such improvements may become bigger with the increasing accuracy of the BeiDou-only solution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{radiotherapy}} (<b>RT)</b> {{reduces the}} <b>side</b> effects at organ at risk. However, skin toxicity {{is still a}} major problem in many entities, especially head and neck cancer. Some substances like chemotherapy provide a risk of increased side effects or can induce a "recall phenomenon" imitating acute RT-reactions months after RT. Moreover, some phototoxic drugs seem to enhance side effects of radiotherapy while others do not. We report a case of "radiation recall dermatitis" (RRD) one year after RT as a result of taking hypericin (St. John's wort). Case report A 65 year old man with completely resected squamous cell carcinoma of the epiglottis received an adjuvant locoregional RT up to a dose of 64. 8 Gy. The patient took hypericin during and months after RT without informing the physician. During radiotherapy the patient developed unusual intensive skin reactions. Five months after RT the skin was completely bland at the first follow up. However, half a year later the patient presented erythema, but only within the area of previously irradiated skin. After local application of a steroid cream the symptoms diminished but returned after the end of steroid therapy. The anamnesis disclosed that the patient took hypericin because of depressive mood. We recommended to discontinue hypericin and the symptoms disappeared afterward. Conclusion Several drugs are able to enhance skin toxicity of RT. Furthermore, the effect of RRD is well known especially for chemotherapy agents such as taxans. However, the underlying mechanisms are not known in detail so far. Moreover, it is unknown whether photosensitising drugs can also be considered to increase radiation sensitivity and whether a recall phenomenon is possible. The first report of a hypericin induced RRD and review of the literature are presented. In clinical practise many interactions between drugs and radiotherapy were not noticed and if registered not published. We recommend to ask especially for complementary or alternative drugs because patients tend to conceal such medication as harmless. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of amifostine on acute and late side effects, and its tolerability in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material and Methods: The study included 87 patients with primary head and neck cancers and cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary cancers treated with RT alone or combined with chemotherapy (CT). Forty-one patients (47 %) received amifostine combined with RT (ART group) and 46 patients (52 %) received RT without amifostine (RT group). The patients were evaluated every week during the treatment and at month 1 and 2 {{after the completion of}} <b>RT</b> for acute <b>side</b> effects and month 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 after the treatment for late side effects according to SOMA/LENT scale. Amifostine was administered prior to RT, along with anti-emetic prophylaxis. The two groups were compared with the Student's t and Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Results: The ART group had significantly less toxicity (grade! 1 mucositis, grade 2 fibrosis) than patients in the RT group (p= 0. 001, p= 0. 03, respectively). At week 3 of RT grade 2 mucositis developed in two patients (5 %) in the ART group and 10 patients (22 %) in the RT group (p= 0. 02). The protective effect of amifostine on skin reactions developed at week 4 of RT (p= 0. 05). Grade 3 xerostomia at 9, 12, and 15 months of follow-up (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 02, and p= 0. 02, respectively), grade 2 xerostomia at 18 and 24 months (p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 01, respectively) and fibrosis at 15, 18 and 24 months (p= 0. 05, p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 02, respectively) decreased markedly in the ART group compared with the RT group. Emesis was the most common adverse effect of amifostine. Conclusion: Daily administration of amifostine during RT was effective in avoiding late grade 2 - 3 xerostomia, as well as grade 2 fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{separated}} {{effects of}} dietary ergot alkaloids from effects of feed intake or ambient temperature on respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), surface temperature (ST), rectal temperature (RT), blood pressure (BP), serum hormone, and plasma metabolite concentrations in beef steers. The balanced, single reversal design for each experiment used 8 beef steers fed tall fescue seed (2. 5 g/kg body weight, (BW)) with (E+) or without (E-) ergot alkaloids {{as part of}} a 60 : 40 switchgrass hay: supplement diet. Periods were 35 d with 21 d of preliminary phase and 14 d of feeding fescue seed once daily. Measures of dependent variables were collected on d 20, 25, 29 and 35 of each period at 0730 (before feeding), 1230 and 1530. In Expt 1 steers weighed 286 kg, gained 0. 61 kg BW/d, E+ supplied 2. 72 mg ergot alkaloids including 1. 60 mg ergovaline per steer daily, and mean minimum and maximum daily ambient temperatures were 23. 6 and 32. 3 °C. In Expt 2 steers weighed 348 kg, gained 1. 03 kg BW/d, E+ supplied 3. 06 mg ergot alkaloids including 2. 00 mg ergovaline daily, and mean minimum and maximum daily ambient temperatures were 11. 9 and 17. 4 °C. Dry matter intake was not affected by fescue seed treatment (P < 0. 20) in either experiment. In both experiments, E+ reduced HR (P < 0. 01) and increased insulin (P = 0. 07). Systolic BP minus diastolic BP decreased (P< 0. 05) for E+ in both experiments, due to increased diastolic BP in Expt 1 (P < 0. 03) and decreased systolic BP in Expt 2 (P < 0. 07). In Expt 1, above the thermoneutral zone, E+ increased (P< 0. 05) RR, <b>RT</b> and left <b>side</b> ST in comparison to E-, but in Expt 2, within the thermoneutral zone, E+ and E- did not differ (P < 0. 18). Ergot alkaloids from fescue seed affect the cardiovascular system of steers separately from effects of feed intake or environmental temperature. Ergot alkaloids interact with ambient temperatures above the steers’ thermoneutral zone to exacerbate the symptoms of hyperthermic stress...|$|R
40|$|Background Most cancer {{patients}} undergo external radiotherapy (RT) at some stage during their treatment trajectory. RT is {{often associated with}} unfamiliar procedures where the technical environment, side effects and interaction with staff seem {{to play a major role}} in the patient’s treatment experience. These experiences could sometimes lead to disruption of the treatment which may have negative consequences for the outcome. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain further knowledge about how patients experience RT and the related processes. Such knowledge is of vital importance when developing and improving care within a high-tech RT environment. Aim The overall aim of this thesis was to gain further knowledge about how patients experience RT and the related processes. Such knowledge is of vital importance when developing and improving care within a high-tech RT environment. Methods To gain further knowledge and understanding about patients experience of RT both quantitative (I, II, III) and qualitative (III, IV) methodology were used. The data in the thesis focused on patients undergoing external RT at different RT units in Sweden. Study I and II, focused on two regions, the northern region of Sweden and the region of Stockholm and Gotland.   Study III and IV were performed at eight different RT units in Sweden. Results In Study I, two types of topical agents (Calendula Weleda cream vs. Essex cream) were compared regarding reducing the risk of severe acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR). No difference in severe ARSR was found between the groups and the patients reported low levels of ARSR. In Study II, the influence of an RT unit’s psychosocial climate and treatment environment on {{cancer patients}}’ anxiety during external RT was evaluated. Data was collected (questionnaire) from 892 patients. The results showed that both the treatment environment and the psychosocial climate of the RT unit significantly impacted cancer patient anxiety levels. In Study III & IV, a questionnaire to measure the patient´s experience during external RT was developed and tested. The results showed that the RT Experience Questionnaire (RTEQ), with 23 items, was a tentatively valid and reliable instrument to measure how patients experience the RT process and the environment in the treatment room. In Study IV, written comments from the open-ended question “Is there anything else you want us to know?” in the preliminary RTEQ was analysed with qualitative content analysis. This data was abstracted into the following four major categories reflecting the experience of the RT process:  Experiences in the high tech RT environment; Understanding the <b>RT</b> procedures and <b>side</b> effects; Dealing with daily life during RT and The nurses’ role and performance. Conclusion The RT environment and the RT related processes seem to impact cancer patients, both physically and psychologically. A person-centered care approach, as well as attention to the design, both of the treatment process and the physical environment could significantly improve the patient experience and patient involvement. The results also highlight the importance of taking patient experiences into account when introducing new RT methods and techniques...|$|R
