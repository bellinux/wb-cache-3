40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the minimum value of a {{fracture}} load, {{with respect to the}} notch <b>root</b> <b>radius,</b> in plates weakened by U-notches under Mode I loading. It has been found that the fracture load has a minimum value at a critical value of the notch <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> (ρ), using four criteria, namely, Mean Stress (MS), maximum tangent stress or Point Stress (PS), Critical Strain-Energy (CSE) and Averaged Strain-Energy Density (ASED). Using a characteristic length (lch), which is a function of material properties, the results showed that the dimensionless critical notch <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> (ρ/lch) cr depended on w/a ratio (the specimen width to the notch depth), Poisson ratio, and loading condition (tensile or bending loading) under Mode I loading. In other words, according to these criteria, a notch <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> different from zero exists, providing a minimum fracture load. Therefore, a crack is not more dangerous rather than a U-notch under Mode I loading. This critical notch <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> is important for a quasi-brittle material, but may not be significant for brittle ones in practical engineering situations.

Notched cylindrical specimens of nickel base superalloy of varying notch <b>root</b> <b>radii</b> are modeled using microstructural-sensitive crystal plasticity finite element codes.

Consider {{the problem of}} designing a controller y/x, with deg(y) ≤ deg(x) < deg(a) − 1 and x monic, subject to lower and upper bounds on the coefficients of y and x, so that the poles of the closed loop transfer function, that is the roots (zeros) of ax + by, are, if possible, strictly inside the unit disk. One way to formulate this design problem is as the following optimization problem: minimize the <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> of ax + by, that is {{the largest of the}} moduli of the roots of ax + by, subject to lower and upper bounds on the coefficients of x and y, as the stabilization problem is solvable if and only if the optimal <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> subject to these constraints is less than one.

40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of any member {{subjected to a}} load gets impaired due {{to the presence of}} cracks or crack-like defects.

40|$|An elastic-plastic {{finite element}} method (FEM) was used to {{calculate}} the stress and strain distributions ahead of notches with various <b>root</b> <b>radii</b> in a bending specimen of C-Mn steel with grain sizes of 10 and 30 μm. By accurately measuring the distance of the cleavage initiation site from the root of the notch, the local cleavage stress σ ƒ * was measured. When the notch radius increased from 0. 25 to 1. 0 mm, the distribution of high stress had a definite variation but the σ ƒ * remained relatively constant. In notch specimens with different <b>root</b> <b>radii,</b> the critical fracture event is identical,i. e., propagation of a ferrite grain-sized crack into the neighboring matrix. Therefore, the σ ƒ * is mainly determined by the length of the critical microcrack, here, the size of ferrite grain instead of the high stress volume for finding an eligible brittle particle. The critical strain for initiating a crack was about 1 pct. The cleavage site ahead of a notch was related to the relative distributions of stress and strain and the random distribution of the weakest grains. The higher fracture load of the fine-grain material can be attributed to its higher value of σ ƒ * /σ o as compared with the coarse-grain. The σ ƒ * /σ o is a potential engineering parameter for toughness assessment in notch specimens...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{presence}} of sharp (zero radius) V-shaped notches the notch stress intensity factors (N-SIFs) quantify the intensities of the asymptotic linear elastic stress distributions. They are proportional to the limit of the mode I or II stress components multiplied by the distance powered 1 −λi from the notch tip, λi being Williams’ eigenvalues. When the notch tip radius is different from zero, the definition is no longer valid from a theoretical {{point of view and}} the characteristic, singular, sharp-notch field diverges from the rounded-notch solution very next to the notch. Nevertheless, N-SIFs continue to be used as parameters governing fracture if the notch <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> is sufficiently small with respect to the notch depth. Taking advantage of a recent analytical formulation able to describe stress distributions ahead of rounded V-notches, the paper gives a generalized form for the notch stress intensity factors, in which not only the opening angle but also the tip radius dimension is explicitly involved. Such parameters quantify the stress redistribution due to the <b>root</b> <b>radius</b> with respect to the sharp notch case...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuum}} model {{based upon}} the Peierls-Nabarro description of a dislocation ahead of a crack is {{used to evaluate the}} critical mode I loading for dislocation nucleation at the tip of a finite, pre-blunted crack. A similar approach is used to evaluate the critical mode I loading for atomic decohesion. Results are presented for various crack tip <b>root</b> <b>radii</b> (a measure of bluntness), for several crack lengths. It is shown that increasing the crack length increases the critical energy release rate for both material behaviors. Increasing the bluntness of a crack tip always increases the required loading for atomic decohesion but nucleation thresholds are initially decreased by very small increases in crack tip bluntness. Nucleation thresholds are later increased after reaching significant crack tip blunting.
