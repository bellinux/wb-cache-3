5000|$|As {{a result}} of an {{accident}} in Cherry Valley, Illinois, in 2009, the Association of American Railroads studied several options for increasing the crashworthiness of DOT-111 tank car designs and published new construction standards in a Casualty Prevention Circular, with the intent to revise the AAR Manual for Standards and Recommended Practices for tank cars that are used to transport ethanol and crude oil. Beginning on October 1, 2011, the new AAR standard for DOT-111 tank cars requires tank heads and shells to be constructed of thicker steel. The new specification also requires that heads and shells be constructed of normalized steel, and in all cases [...] thick half head shields must be provided. The AAR has also mandated a more <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> or rollover skid for protection of top fittings. The new standards only apply to newly manufactured cars; there is no requirement to retrofit, repurpose, or retire existing DOT-111A cars built to the older design.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{overarching}} analysis of housing in Ireland from 1993 - 2014, examining trends in housing and land prices, supply and vacancy, social housing, private renting, mortgage debt and arrears, negative equity, and homelessness. The central thesis we advance is that housing in Ireland has been perpetually in crisis {{over the past}} twenty years, evolving through three distinct phases: 1993 - 2006 (the Celtic Tiger years); 2007 - 2012 (the crash); 2013 - (unstable, uneven and partial rebalancing). The paper sets out the trends, policy and the multiple crises operating within each of these periods, illustrated through an extensive use of relevant data. The conclusion sets out why housing in Ireland evolved through these crises and examines what might be done to solve present issues and provide more <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> policies that will be sustainable, equitable and ameliorate against future boom and bust cycles...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{sales prices}} and local vacancy {{rates in the}} housing market pose a natural analogy to the wage curve, a popular concept in labor {{economics}} that describes how individual wages decrease with higher local unemployment. While housing search and matching models and housing externalities strongly suggest a stable inverse relationship, there is still a lack of convincing empirical research on the sensitivity of house sales to local vacancy variation. Based on more than 10, 000 single-family home transactions from the German market, this paper confirms a <b>robust</b> <b>house</b> price-vacancy curve among individual home prices and adjacent residential vacancies. The economic size of the relationship is highly comparable across all four analyzed states: a doubling of the vacancy rate at the municipality level is associated with a 5 - 8 % discount in quality-controlled selling prices.

40|$|From 1992 to 2005, six factors {{contributed to}} the U. S. housing boom: {{mortgage}} rates decreased to generational lows; financing innovations lowered homeownership costs; home listings were centralized on the Internet (to minimize transaction costs); lenders gave priority to minority homeownership; demographic influences strengthened housing demand; and real estate was perceived as {{a safe haven for}} household wealth compared to the stock market, which offered poor investment returns. These factors, combined with recordvolume home sales, increased home appreciation, record homeownership rates, and sizable increases in mortgage originations, have lead many economists to the conclusion that there is a national housing boom. Industry economists recognize that price gains have been unusually strong in recent years because of <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> demand and increasingly stringent supply constraints in some areas, which have boosted price appreciation above the rate of income growth.

40|$|This thesis aims at the {{extraction}} of energy from wind waves on open seas. Many designs have failed {{over the years and}} there is currently a need for new designs. This thesis features such a design. The principle is to convert wave power into compressed air at 2 to 3 bar. This air can then be expanded in an engine to produce mechanical power. The reason for this design is twofold. At first, there is the challenge to create a design that has to withstand a very rough environment, such as open oceanic waters. Almost all designs have failed on this aspect. Second, sea waves have a complex pattern of water motions with very unfavorable internal impedance: very high forces (drag or lift) in combination with very slow motions. This makes it hard to convert wave energy straight into mechanical or electric power. Moreover, the energy stored in the waves is broadbandly, almost like the solar spectrum. This means that energy has to be extracted over a wide frequency band. The idea for the design is that of a very <b>robust</b> <b>house</b> in which a seismic mass/membrane is hung such that it can vibrate and periodically suck in air and expel it to a pressurized vessel. This air flow will pulsate irregularly. The vessel can dampen these fluctuations and feed an air expander continuously with the proper ratio of pressure/flow rate. The design of the vibrating membrane is complex in that it has to resonate across a wide frequency spectrum, e. g. with non-linear elasticity or a divided mass/spring system,...|$|R

40|$|Households' {{links with}} NGOs are an {{important}} support for disaster resilience and recovery in Bangladesh. Previous studies have examined how social capital promotes disaster recovery. However, few explore the complexities of linking social networks and, in particular, the role of NGOs, after disasters. Through {{a case study of}} Cyclone Sidr— 2007 affected two coastal villages of Bangladesh, using household surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews, this study examines when these linking networks perform well and poorly. NGOs provide strong support through immediate relief (food, water, medicine, household utensils), shelter (building materials, new houses), and livelihood assistance (microcredit, cropping seeds, livestock, fishing boats, and nets). However, this catalyzes relief dependency also, NGOs generally favour households they lend to, sometimes demand normal repayments continue even though a disaster has occurred, and often take bribes when they are distributing livelihood assistance to households. We suspect many Bangladeshi NGOs focus on relief activities rather than preparedness, because post-disaster relief provides significant opportunities for financial irregularities, as the cash flows (donor support) are relatively large. Instead, NGOs should increase their emphasis on disaster risk reduction, providing more <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> and fostering alternative livelihood options rather relief centric activities, because households' have a strong preference for empowerment and resilience, rather than relief dependency. 21 page(s...|$|E

40|$|U. S. {{commercial}} banks {{continued to be}} highly profitable in 2004. Return on assets and return on equity declined moderately, but the economy's continued expansion and supportive financial conditions helped keep bank profits in the elevated range that has prevailed since the mid- 1990 s. Profits were trimmed a bit by a narrowing of banks' net interest margins as the yield curve flattened and competition put pressure on loan spreads. In addition, gains in non-interest income were less pronounced than in 2003, and non-interest expenses increased. However, the continued improvement in the overall credit quality of business and household loans allowed banks to reduce their provisioning for loan and lease losses, and delinquency and charge-off rates for all loan categories trended down. Bank balance sheets also expanded. A <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> sector and generally low interest rates supported residential mortgage lending, and increases in demand along with an easing of lending standards and terms throughout the year boosted commercial and industrial loans. Banks also reported easing their standards and terms on commercial real estate loans, and such loans increased despite soft conditions in some markets.

Fifteen thought-provoking chapters address the themes of ‘disorder and regeneration’, the ‘policing of crime and disorder’, ‘service provider approaches to safe communities’ and ‘social inclusion and community safety. ’ The authors explore the importance of working with residents in community safety responses and examine how staff in housing, social work, police and education can overcome barriers by working in partnership.

40|$|Land tenure is an {{important}} variable impacting on vulnerability to climate-related disaster. Land tenure insecurity is widespread in southern Africa and manifests itself {{in a number of}} ways that accentuate vulnerability to climate change impacts. Insecure tenure is seen to heighten vulnerability against growing demand for land for residential purposes and working space in urban areas while in the rural areas insecure tenure militates against diversified livelihoods and hinders investment in appropriate technologies and uptake of sound environmental management practices. Using the focused synthesis method, this article (1) maps the intersections between land tenure insecurity and vulnerability to climateinduced disaster in southern Africa; and (2) identifies the opportunities tenure reforms hold for vulnerability reduction in a region predicted to suffer widespread impacts from climate change. The paper contends that land tenure is a critical component of the milieu of factors – economic, social, cultural, institutional, political and even psychological – that are known to shape vulnerability and determine the environment that people live in. The study finds that land tenure reforms can help to reduce vulnerability and enhance community resilience to climate change. In this regard, the article outlines how tenure reforms can help build diverse household livelihoods, improve environmental management, particularly in the rural areas, and encourage investment in <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> and safe neighbourhoods among the urban poor – all of which are integral to the region’s response to climate change.

TNO underlines the importance and has therefore designed and tested a general use sensor system that is modular and can be used and adapted to the specific needs of a variety of missions. The sensor system is designed to be operated complementary to an interferometric distances measurement system. It replaces the interferometer retro reflector and uses a small part of its laser light. This light then is used to measure lateral displacement in two directions, pitch, yaw and roll. The lateral displacement accuracy is to the micrometer level and the pitch yaw and roll accuracies are to the arcsecond level. The basis for this system was created by the successful ESA HPOM-project, where TNO developed and tested Fine Lateral displacement Sensor (FLS), with a few cm range and with sub-micron accuracies. At this stage the technology was aimed at the SMART 2 mission, which is very similar to the presently initiated PROBA 3.

The principle {{aim of this study}} was to determine the suitability of lithium-sulphur cell technology for space industry applications by considering all areas of performance, modelling and electronic protection requirements. This thesis is split into three main areas. Firstly, after examining the background material, the current state of the lithium-sulphur electrochemistry is analysed in detail. It is of great importance to have a clear understanding of the cell’s electrochemical and chemical interactions as they can be used to explain the performance characteristics of the cell later in the work. On completion of the electrochemical analysis the thesis then goes on to describe a set of electrical and thermal characterisation tests, the results of which are used to establish a novel equivalent circuit model of a Li-S battery. The equivalent circuit modelling method was chosen mainly for its ease of implementation into a full power system model and for its adaptability to future cell variations, both of which are important for the intended application. The resultant model uses electrical, thermal and “split capacity” domains to successfully predict cell performance. Further characterisation testing results are then analysed with a view to specifying the electrical protection requirements of a Li-S battery management system suitable for different space industry applications. It was determined that the Li-S cell has safety and protection needs that exceed that of lithium-ion batteries, as well as requiring a <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> structure, reducing the energy density of the battery pack. The conclusion of the work is that, although the Li-S cell holds promise for the future, the current state of the cell’s degradation characteristics prevents it from competing with lithium-ion cells in its current format...|$|E

However, the magnitude of these swings {{in the use of}} credit varied considerably within the United States. An analysis of trends in household debt over the past decade shows that compared with the nation as a whole, the New York–northern New Jersey region experienced a relatively mild “credit cycle, ” although pockets of financial stress exist. The amount of debt taken on by U. S. households has increased rapidly over the last decade, reaching record-high levels. In today’s dollars, the average household owed roughly $ 40, 000 in the mid- 1980 s, a figure that tripled to $ 120, 000 just before the Great Recession. With the onset of the recession and financial crisis, a contraction in credit availability accompanied by a weak economy created financial stress for many households. As a result, the U. S. household sector began a process of deleveraging, or reducing its debt. This increase and decline in the availability and use of credit—often referred to as a “credit cycle”—was more pronounced {{in some parts of the}} country than in others. The severity of this credit cycle has important connections to the performance of regional economies. Higher debt supported a more <b>robust</b> <b>housing</b> market during the housing boom, creating spillovers into the broader economies of these areas and contributing to more rapid growth. Many of these trends began to reverse as the economy slowed and the financial crisis ensued. Indeed, during the Great Recession, areas with higher debt tended to have more severe downturns and, subsequently, weaker recoveries. 1 In addition to providing important information about the economic health of households in a region, the nature and magnitude of local credit cycles help us better understand regional economic performance.

Discussion [...] Chapter 8. Conclusion. Bangladesh {{is one of the}} most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones and storm surges. Due to climate change, the frequency of cyclones and storm surges is expected to increase on the Bangladesh coast. These events create enormous damage and loss and increase community vulnerabilities. Over the last decade, many studies have examined how these vulnerabilities can be addressed and how the capacities of households can be strengthened to build more resilient communities. Little of this research has considered the contribution of social capital to disaster resilience and recovery in Bangladesh, and on the Indian sub-continent generally. This current research seeks to address this gap in the research by examining the contribution of social networks (particularly bonding networks - households' relationships with immediate family members and other relatives; bridging networks - households' relationships with neighbours and friends; and linking networks - households' relationships with organisations, for example NGOs, local government and other community-based organisations) to disaster resilience and recovery. Through a mixed methods approach using household surveys, focus groups, key informant interviews, workshops and meetings, this study examines when social networks perform strongly and poorly in disaster resilience and recovery; how households' assets enable and constrain their contributions through bonding and bridging social networks; how social networks are articulated in the disaster management policies of Bangladesh; and what opportunities there are to strengthen the capacity of social networks to contribute effectively to disaster resilience and recovery, using two coastal villages affected by Cyclone Sidr as case studies. Findings show that bonding and bridging networks provide very important support - sharing of food and shelter, providing comfort, etc. - immediately after a disaster. As the time after the disaster increases, these networks perform less well due to households' limited physical, financial and human capital, and the uncertainties of their access to natural capital. After a period, bridging networks become less active and sometimes break down due to competition and conflict over access to external relief support. Bonding networks, however, do not break down. Household members continue contributing to the recovery process by reducing food intake, helping with alternative income and livelihood options through temporary migration and so on. For longer-term recovery, however, disaster victims usually need support through linking social networks - from NGOs (e. g. local, national and foreign NGOs), local government and other community-based organisations (CBO). their links with NGOs and local government provide households with strong support in the form of emergency relief, shelter, livelihood assistance, and reconstruction of major community services. However, while providing this support, they often engage in corruption through favouritism and taking bribes. These poor practices of NGOs and local government foster inequality, discontent and mistrust (between households, and between households and organisations), which, in the long run, harm linking relationships. This study found that despite the importance of social capital in disaster resilience and recovery, households' social networking relationships are not given adequate emphasis in the disaster management policies of Bangladesh; and linking social networks are given greater focus than bonding and bridging networks. Within linking networks, government's links with various national, regional and international organisations and foreign states are prioritised, not households' links with local and national organisations. This study argues that NGOs and local government should strengthen the capacity of local households to contribute effectively to disaster resilience and recovery. This can be accomplished by placing more emphasis on disaster risk reduction programs rather than simply relief works, fostering alternative income options, providing more <b>robust</b> <b>housing,</b> and rebuilding trust through fair distribution of recovery support to build disaster-resilient communities. Through these measures, disaster-affected households would be able to reduce their dependency on the intervention of external organisations (linking social networks) to recover from a disaster. This study also suggests that disaster policies should be revised to make better use of the potential of local social capital to contribute to disaster resilience and recovery.

40|$|A <b>robust</b> in <b>house</b> {{solid-phase}} micro extraction (SPME) surface {{has been}} developed for the headspace (HS) -SPME determination of endocrine disruptor pesticides, namely, Chlorpyrifos, Penconazole, Procymidone, Bromopropylate and Lambda-Cyhalothrin in wine sample by using sodium dodecylsulfate doped polypyrrole SPME fiber. Pyrrole monomer was electrochemically polymerized on a stainless steel wire in laboratory conditions in virtue of diminishing the cost and enhancing the analyte retention on its surface to exert better selectivity and hence the developed polymerized surface could offer to analyst to exploit it as a fiber in headspace SPME analysis. The parameters, mainly, adsorption temperature and time, desorption temperature, stirring rate and salt amount were optimized to be as 70 °C and 45 min, 200 °C, 600 rpm and 10 gL- 1, respectively. Limit of detection was estimated {{in the range of}} 0. 073 - 1. 659 ngmL- 1 for the pesticides studied. The developed method was applied in to red wine sample with acceptable recovery values (92 - 107 %) which were obtained for these selected pesticides. Ege University (Project 2010 /Fen/ 033...|$|R
40|$|California’s {{economic}} recovery in 2013, while {{ahead of the}} nation, was uneven with nuanced growth in coastal zones, and inland areas lagging behind. Drought conditions have added to the challenges that California must overcome for a full rebound {{of the economy in}} general, and of the housing market in particular, especially in hard-hit communities. Some of the construction jobs have rebounded helping to reduce the State’s unemployment rate to 8 percent as of February 2014, which is still higher than the nationwide rate. Regional differences between coastal and inland areas are likely to continue. 1 This uneven and slow rebound delays the economic multiplier benefits of more <b>robust</b> new <b>housing</b> construction to the state and regional economies. Trends and factors contributing to California’s continuing housing supply shortage and affordability problems are highlighted in this brief: • Affordability worsens, particularly impacting lower income renters, as falling incomes lag behind spiking rents, and homeowners continue to face tight lending standards that impede access to housing financing. • Housing supply shortage in growth areas persists, as new construction i...|$|R
40|$|With an {{extended}} production cycle up to 100 weeks of age, the yearly number of layer chickens hatched and reared can be reduced, {{and in turn}} so can the euthanasia of day-old male chickens. Lately, the interest for keeping laying hens for a prolonged production cycle has increased in Sweden {{as well as in}} other European countries. However, concerns exist regarding how prolonged laying cycles affect egg quality, animal welfare as well as producer economy. In this trial, the two commercial hybrids LSL Classic and Bovans <b>Robust</b> were <b>housed</b> in furnished cages and a single tier floor production system. In addition to the effects of age, an organic mineral complex with a hypothesized positive effect on egg quality, integument and skeletal condition was evaluated. The study was conducted during 20 - 61 weeks of age. There were no consistent effects of the mineral amino acid complex supplementation on either egg quality, plumage condition or keel bone deformities at a hen age of 55 weeks. However, {{there were a lot of}} differences between hybrids regarding egg composition and layer performance in the two production systems. As expected and concluded in earlier research; egg shell quality, plumage condition and keel bone deformities were negatively affected by increased hen age...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{sustainable}} building construction practices are actively promoted. One {{of the key}} strategies that can enhance the degree of sustainability is creating built environments that can last {{a very long time}} when very high level of disaster resistance is achieved with commonly available building materials in a very cost effective way. These strength enhancement methods should cover multitudes of disasters like cyclones, floods and earthquake tremors. Masonry is a very good material for carrying compressive stresses due to gravity loads consisting of self weight and live loads. However, alternative building materials such as Compressed Stabilized Earth (CSE) bricks and blocks and rammed earth can also demonstrate a behaviour comparable to conventional masonry such as burnt clay bricks and cement sand blocks. Lateral loads are the dominant of all forces acting in a disastrous situation. Therefore, flexural strengths of the building materials are of very importance. These lateral forces are static or dynamic in nature. In most instances, {{it may be possible to}} find equivalent quasi-static forces for dynamic forces. This means, an accurate assessment of the lateral load carrying capacity of masonry walls and also strategies available for improving the lateral load carrying capacities will be of importance. It is shown that for experimental determination of flexural strength parallel and perpendicular to bed joints, testing of panels with low degree of pre-compression can give reasonable results with acceptable level of scatter. This method has been used to determine the flexural strength parameters for both conventional and alternative materials. It is also shown that the presence of continuous tie beams at plinth level, window sill level and lintel level can create a situation where wall panels behave almost as vertically spanning. Since tie beams cap control the deflection in lateral direction while applying some pre-compression, it was possible to present a theoretical concept for determining the lateral load resistance with the enhancements possible with tie beams. This method relies on the compressive strength of masonry. Once this theoretical method is used with adequate partial factors of safety, a reasonable estimate of lateral load resistance can be obtained. This method can be used even with masonry having very low flexural tensile strength parallel to bed joints. The above method has to rely on the restraint offered by the continuous tie beam. This means that the tie beam should be adequately restrained. The ideal restraint can be the return walls that would generally occur at 3. 0 - 4. 0 m intervals in houses. It would also be advisable to have the tie beam extended at least 300 to 600 mm into the partition walls since it can provide better load transfer. This means that some of the plan layout may need some adjustments. Such an integrated approach could provide a house where the masonry walls are adequately tied at various levels and hence capable of transferring loads from one element to the other thus mobilizing various load resisting systems like that can be possible with shear walls. Even a well constructed house with these disaster resistant features can still suffer if the foundation fails. Thus, adequate soil improvements where sandy soil (s mixed with laterite soil and re-compacted in both foundation and also around the house would be essential. Three-dimensional finite element modelling with commercial software became a reality only recently. The use of such software like SAP 2000 to identify the likely behaviour under lateral loads was presented. A similar attempt was made to obtain the influence of the nearby houses under wind conditions using ANSYS software. With all these disaster resistant features, it would now be possible to create a <b>robust</b> single storey <b>house</b> with potential to last as long as possible. The same techniques can be adopted for multi-storey houses as well. Therefore it can be stated with confidence that the research presented in this thesis led to a development of an integrated approach for creating disaster resistant <b>houses.</b> Once such <b>robust</b> built environments are coupled with passive techniques already successfully used for adequate indoor thermal comfort, it would be possible to have <b>robust</b> <b>houses</b> that will need very low energy for day to day operations...|$|R
