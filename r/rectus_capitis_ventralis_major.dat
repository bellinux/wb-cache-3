40|$|In swifts and {{hummingbirds}} (Apodiformes), the splenius capitis muscle {{displays a}} charac-teristic modification, the ‘cruciform origin’. The muscle pairs arise from the second ver-tebra by several slips which criss-cross and interdigitate with each other, before inserting into the skull. In {{the course of a}} study on the neck muscles of the Common Swift, we paid special attention to the arrangement of these slips of the splenius capitis muscle, and noted a previously unrecognized individual modification of this muscle. In addition, we observed an incipient cruciform origin of the deep portion (slip) of the <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> <b>ventralis</b> muscle that has not been noticed for swifts or any other avian taxon before. The development and function of these modifications of the splenius <b>capitis</b> and <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> <b>ventralis</b> muscle are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{guttural}} pouches {{are located}} behind the cranial cavity, caudally {{the skull and}} below {{the wings of the}} atlas (C1). They are enclosed by the parotid and mandibular salivary glands, and the pterygoid muscles. The ventral portion lays on the pharynx and beginning of the esophagus, with the retropharyngeal lymph nodes located between the ventral wall and pharynx. The left and right pouches are separated by the longus <b>capitis</b> and <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> <b>ventralis</b> muscles dorsomedially. Below these muscles, the two pouches fuse to form a median septum.|$|R
5000|$|Parallel to the ribs, on {{the outer}} side of the neck a cable-shaped {{structure}} was discovered with a constant diameter of three millimetres. It had an oval cross-section and a rough and striated surface. The structure originated directly behind the skull and continued over a length of several vertebrae, thus of some metres. It was interpreted by the describing authors as an ossified tendon. The alternative hypothesis {{that it might be}} a neck rib was rejected because the ribs are thicker and should have a different position. Such tendons might have been a continuation of the neck ribs, but again, its position did not confirm this. Instead, it was assumed to have been internal to some neck muscle. Such ossified tendons have never before been found in any fossil dinosaur but some extant bird groups such as the cranes show them, though they are relatively shorter, at most two vertebrae long. Possible muscles, where it could have been located, are the Musculus <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> anterior <b>ventralis,</b> the Musculus longus colli ventralis or the Musculi intertransversarii. The internal structure of the tendon, with much reworked bone tissue, indicated a swift ossification at a young age.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> {{anterior}} (<b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> anticus minor) is a short, flat muscle, situated immediately {{behind the}} upper part of the Longus capitis.|$|R

50|$|The pre{{vertebral}} {{muscles are}} the muscles located between the prevertebral fascia (older definition) and the vertebral column, i.e., the longus <b>capitis,</b> longus colli, <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> anterior, and <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> lateralis muscles.|$|R
50|$|Flexion is {{produced}} mainly by {{the action of}} the longi <b>capitis</b> and <b>recti</b> <b>capitis</b> anteriores; extension by the <b>recti</b> <b>capitis</b> posteriores major and minor, the obliquus capitis superior, the semispinalis capitis, splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoideus, and upper fibers of the trapezius.|$|R

50|$|The <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> {{posterior}} minor (or <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> posticus minor, both being Latin for lesser posterior {{straight muscle}} of the head) arises {{by a narrow}} pointed tendon from the tubercle on the posterior arch of the atlas, and, widening as it ascends, is inserted into the medial part of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone and the surface {{between it and the}} foramen magnum, and also takes some attachment to the spinal dura mater.|$|R
50|$|The {{posterior}} {{division of}} the first cervical or suboccipital nerve {{is larger than the}} anterior division, and emerges above the posterior arch of the atlas and beneath the vertebral artery. It enters the suboccipital triangle and supplies the muscles which bound this triangle, viz., the <b>Rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> posterior major, and the Obliqui superior and inferior; it gives branches also to the <b>Rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> posterior minor and the Semispinalis capitis. A filament from the branch to the Obliquus inferior joins the posterior {{division of the}} second cervical nerve.|$|R
50|$|As {{the muscles}} of the two sides pass upward and lateralward, they leave between them a {{triangular}} space, in which the <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> posterior minor is seen.|$|R
50|$|On {{either side}} of the middle line the longus <b>capitis</b> and <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> {{anterior}} are inserted, and immediately in front of the foramen magnum the anterior atlantooccipital membrane is attached.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> lateralis, a short, flat muscle, {{arises from}} the upper surface of the {{transverse}} process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone.|$|R
5000|$|Connective tissue bridges {{were noted}} at the atlanto-occipital joint between the <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> {{posterior}} minor muscle and the dorsal spinal dura. Similar connective tissue connections of the <b>rectus</b> <b>capitis</b> posterior major {{have been reported}} recently as well. [...] The perpendicular arrangement of these fibers appears to restrict dural movement toward the spinal cord. The ligamentum nuchae {{was found to be}} continuous with the posterior cervical spinal dura and the lateral portion of the occipital bone. Anatomic structures innervated by cervical nerves C1-C3 have the potential to cause headache pain. Included are the joint complexes of the upper three cervical segments, the dura mater, and spinal cord.|$|R
