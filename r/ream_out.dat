As it burrows, the mole pushes forward with its feet in a rolling motion so that its tusks <b>ream</b> <b>out</b> the soil in front of it. The loose soil is pushed back by the feet and compacted to the tunnel walls by its tail. As well as eating earthworms and other burrowing invertebrates, it also preys on small surface-living animals, especially mice, voles and lizards. It lies in wait just the soil surface listening for sounds of movement above, and when it hears prey approaching it springs out, using its tail as a level, grasping the prey creature with its teeth. The tusked mole's strong limbs and powerful tusks enable it burrow through the hardest and stoniest soils.|$|E

5000|$|Reloadable {{cartridge}} {{cases can}} be produced by resizing and trimming 9mm Winchester Magnum brass, or alternately by reforming 5.56×45mm NATO. The cartridge case is inserted into the open-topped die, which produces a shoulder in the correct position, and one saws off {{the portion of the}} case projecting through the top. Afterward, one uses a reamer—which fits a tap handle—to <b>ream</b> <b>out</b> the new case neck to an acceptable thickness. This is necessary because a powerful rifle cartridge has just been cut back to where the brass is relatively thick—this must be thinned if excessive chamber pressures are to be avoided in the pistol. Alternately, reloaders in the USA can purchase proper, new cases from Starline Mfg. Use [...]308" [...] or [...]309" [...] bullets for reloading for the Tokarev TT-33 and Czech CZ-52. Mauser C96 and C30 [...] "Broomhandle" [...] pistols typically have oversized bores, and [...]311" [...] bullets may be needed to produce acceptable accuracy. Hornady makes an 85-grain [...]309" [...] "XTP" [...] bullet that functions well in all these pistols. On the Starline website, at the 7.62×25mm section, information is given about using the slightly less powerful, but otherwise nearly identical ammunition designed for the Mauser C96 pistol (7.63×25mm Mauser) from which the Tokarev cartridge was derived, in pistols chambered for the Tokarev round. This was common practice by Finnish and German forces in WWII.|$|E

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationIn {{order to}} extract {{heat from the}} high temperature rocks that lie relatively {{close to the surface}} {{in different parts of the}} world, wells must first be drilled down into those rocks. Once the wells are established then either natural fissures or artificially induced fractures are generated to create an underground network of channels in the hot rock. Either existing steam in the rock, or injected water is then pumped through this network as a way of extracting the heat, turning it into steam, and bringing it to the surface. At the surface the steam, depending on temperature, can be used to drive generators, and/or to provide district heating. The rocks through which the wells must be drilled are generally igneous, and thus of a high strength, tough and very hot, and conventional methods of drilling are difficult and slow. The use of high-pressure fluid jets to drill the wells has been shown to be faster than conventional drilling, and since the jets cut away from the bit, there are not the wear problems that are associated with conventional drilling tools. Further the jets have the potential to be re-oriented in the production zone to <b>ream</b> <b>out</b> the well from a radius of 4. 5 inches to some 36 inches. This increases the productivity of individual wells, and reduces the number that may need to be drilled. Abrasive can also be introduced into the water-jet stream as it is pumped down the borehole, and it is also possible to create a cutting jet that can notch the walls of the borehole so that, under controlled pressurization, cracks can be grown out in preferred directions, and the process of heat extraction simplified...|$|E

2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be <b>reamed</b> <b>out</b> with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|R
40|$|The Chilean tsunami of 22 May 1960 <b>reamed</b> <b>out</b> {{a breach}} and {{built up a}} fan as it flowed across a sparsely {{inhabited}} beach-ridge plain near Maullín, midway {{along the length of}} the tsunami source. Eyewitnesses to the flooding, interviewed mainly in 1988 and 1989, identified levels that the tsunami had reached on high ground, trees, and buildings. The maximum levels fell, from about 10 m to 2 m, between the mouth of the tidal Río Maullín and an inundation limit nearly 5 km inland across the plain. Along this profile at Caulle, where the maximum flow depth was a few meters deep, airphotos taken in 1961 show breaches across a road on a sandy beach ridge. Inland from one of these breaches is a fan with branched distributaries. Today its breach holds a pond that has been changing into a marsh. The 1960 fan deposits, as much as 60 cm thick, are traceable inland for 120 m from the breach. They rest on a pasture soil above two additional sand bodies, each atop its own buried soil. The earlier of the pre- 1960 sand bodies probably dates to AD 1270 - 1400, in which case its age is not statistically different from that of a sand sheet previously dated elsewhere near Maullín. The breach likely originated then and has been freshened twice. Evidence that the breach was freshened in 1960 includes a near-basal interval of cobble-size clasts of sediment and soil, most of them probably derived from the organic fill of pre- 1960 breach. The cobbly interval is overlain by sand with ripple-drift laminae that record landward flow. The fan of another breach near Maullín, at Chanhué, also provides stratigraphic evidence for recurrent tsunamis, though not necessarily for the repeated use of the breach. These findings were anticipated a half century ago by description of paired breaches and fans that the 1960 Chilean tsunami produced in Japan. Breaches and their fans may provide lasting evidence for tsunami inundation of beach-ridge plains. The breaches might be detectable by remote sensing, and the thickness of the fan deposits might help them outlast an ordinary tsunami sand sheet...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2015. Major: Geological Sciences. Advisor: James Miller. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 139 pages. The Current Lake Intrusive Complex (CLIC) {{is one of}} several ultramafic to mafic intrusions associated with the Midcontinent Rift that host Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. Geophysical surveys and drilling have outlined a six kilometer-long mafic to ultramafic, chonolith-shaped intrusion that is composed primarily of wehrlite to dunite and has intruded into granitic (Current Lake Zone or CLZ) and metasedimentary rocks (Beaver Lake Zone or BLZ) of the Quetico Subprovince. Initial core logging conducted by Magma Metals (now Panoramic Resources Ltd.) noted the occurrence of a zone of texturally and mineralogically heterogeneous, intensely altered, inclusion-bearing, mafic to intermediate intrusive rocks located at the margins of the main mineralized body. These intrusive rocks were initially referred to as the Hybrid Rock unit (HRU), and due to subtle differences in color, were subsequently spilt into the "red hybrid"� and "gray hybrid"� units. Observations from core logging and petrography of the "red hybrid"� show it to be an intensely altered and hematized, locally poorly mineralized, vari-textured (prismatic to subophitic), fine- to medium-grained, quartz gabbro to lesser quartz ferrodiorite. The mineralogical, textural, and chemical characteristics of this rock type are similar in both the CLZ and BLZ, with the exception that the BLZ contains large, chlorite-mantled quartzite and granitic xenoliths and has more abundant interstitial quartz. Some of the "grey hybrid"� rocks were found to be very similar to "red hybrid"� rocks and were thus renamed the Heterolithic Quartz Gabbro (HQG) unit in both the CLZ and BLZ. Further petrographic investigations of the non-HQG "grey hybrid"� rocks indicated a mineralogical and textural resemblance to the CLIC rocks as they were moderately to intensely altered, fine- to medium-fine grained, intergranular to subpoikilitic quartz-bearing feldspathic wehrlite to melagabbro in the BLZ and gabbro to melagabbro in the CLZ. Consequently, the non-HQG "grey hybrid"� rock were renamed the Melagabbro unit in both the CLZ and BLZ. In both zones, the Melagabbro unit is observed as the marginal phase of the CLIC rocks. The principal goals of this study were to document the mineralogical, textural, chemical, and alteration attributes of the HQG and Melagabbro units, the nature of their lithologic heterogeneity, and transition into the CLIC rocks, as well as to establish the petrogenetic relationship, if any, between the HQG and Melagabbro units to the CLIC rocks. Evaluation of lithogeochemical data indicate that despite the intense felsic contamination and hydrothermal alteration, the trace element characteristics of the HQG unit are consistent with having similar parental magma as the CLIC rocks. These data also indicate that the granitic and metasedimentary country rocks of the Quetico Subprovince are a reasonable source of contamination. These results and the contact relationships between the HQG unit and the CLIC rocks are best explained by a two-stage model of emplacement. First, as the HQG unit was emplaced it incorporated abundant country rock xenoliths, becoming strongly contaminated, and extensively hydrothermally altered. Then, the CLIC mafic magma was emplaced into the HQG unit, likely by <b>reaming</b> <b>out</b> and inflating the semi-molten core of the HQG intrusion...|$|R
50|$|Todd {{comes back}} to town in 2000 and helps Blair cover {{up the fact that}} she shot Max in the back in a moment of rage. Through this teamwork, Todd proposes to Blair and she accepts. However, Max tricks Todd into {{thinking}} that he and Blair slept together right before their wedding, and during the ceremony, Todd reveals that Blair shot Max. Although he realized he was wrong, Blair couldn't forgive him for giving over the evidence to the police. In 2001, Blair realizes she is pregnant. She believes that the baby is Max's but then finds out it's really Todd's. Blair doesn't tell Todd the truth. Blair decides to marry Max when Todd won't let her see Starr.Todd takes Starr away from Blair and says she can never see her again if she marries Max. Blair goes to Mexico to have her baby alone since she doesn't get to see Starr. Todd comes down Blair goes into premature labor. Todd delivers the baby, later named Jack, but he still believes the baby is Max's. Todd gets rid of the baby and tells Blair the baby is dead when really he is in the other room. Blair finally tells Todd the baby was his, and he struggles to get baby Jack back. He gives Blair the baby as a Christmas present, but doesn't tell her it's Jack. They remarry after growing closer. When Blair finds out the truth, she <b>reams</b> Todd <b>out</b> and they separate. Todd leaves town for a little while.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} cases of {{intramedullary}} nailing with <b>reaming,</b> carried <b>out</b> after complications in regenerated bone and docking site had occurred, is presented here. Nine patients (involving 5 femurs, and 4 tibias) had previously been treated with resection and bone transport after open fractures with loss of bony tissue and infection. Before bone transport, there was Staphylococcus aureus infection in 6 cases and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in 3. The mean length of regenerated bone was 9. 5 cm (min. 6, max. 18). After transport, the fixator remained {{in place for a}} mean period of 12. 8 months (min. 8, max. 24). In 6 cases (4 femurs, 2 tibias), the thickness of the cortical wall was insufficient and, in 2 of these, there was nonunion of the docking site. In 2 tibias, nailing was carried out shortly after the fixator had been removed, after refracture of the regenerated bone due to insufficient cortical thickness. In one femur, nailing was carried out because of nonunion with the docking site. Follow-up involved clinical and X-ray checks. The mean follow-up was 3. 9 years (min. 2, max. 6). In all cases, union and corticalization was complete on average 6 months after nailing (min. 4, max. 11). Infection appeared in only one tibia 4 months after nailing and complete corticalization. The infection was treated with antibiotics and the nail subsequently removed. We conclude that nailing is an excellent solution for regenerated bone and docking site problems, as long as antibiotic therapy is prescribed for at least 10 days after the fixator has been removed. Complications due to infections after nailing are not frequent and can be resolved relatively easily...|$|R
40|$|In Inside Story, Sally Young {{looks at}} the role of direct mail campaigning in this {{election}} BECAUSE I live in a safe seat, I’ve only received one letter from each major party this election and each party’s letter begins with the generic “Dear voter…” But it’s {{a very different story}} for voters in hotly contested marginal seats. In electorates like Gilmore, Robertson and McEwen – which are among the most marginal in the country – households have been receiving lots of direct mail, and the parties make an effort to personalise it. “Dear Ms Smith” will begin a letter that might differ in its content from the letter sent to Ms Smith’s next door neighbour. The internet, Twitter and social networking have attracted {{a great deal of attention}} during this election. But I would argue that direct mail – an adaptation of a nineteenth-century election tool, pamphleteering – is much more important. The parties are sending <b>out</b> <b>reams</b> of leaflets, postcards and letters to voters, and they do this because… Read the full article    ...|$|R
40|$|Process {{capability}} {{analysis is}} {{a vital part of}} an overall quality improvement program. It is a technique that has application in many segments of the product cycle, including product and process design, vendor sourcing, production or manufacturing planning, and manufacturing. Frequently, a process capability study involves observing a quality characteristic of the product. Since this information usually pertains to the product rather than the process, this analysis should strictly speaking be called a product analysis study. A true process capability study in this context would involve collecting data that relates to process parameters so that remedial actions can be identified on a timely basis. The present study attempts to analyze performance of drilling, pressing, and <b>reaming</b> operations carried <b>out</b> for the manufacturing of two major lock components viz. handle and lever plate, at Gaurav International, Aligarh (India). The data collected for depth of hole on handle, central hole diameter, and key hole diameter are used to construct histogram. Next, the information available in frequency distribution table, the process mean, process capability from calculations and specification limits provided by the manufacturing concern are used with Taguchi technique. The data obtained from histogram and Taguchi technique combined are used to evaluate the performance of the manufacturing process. Results of this study indicated that the performance of all the processes used to produce depth of hole on handle, key hole diameter, and central hole diameter are potentially incapable as the process capability indices are found to be 0. 54, 0. 54 and 0. 76 respectively. The number of nonconforming parts expressed in terms of parts per million (ppm) that have fallen out of the specification limits are found to be 140000, 26666. 66, and 146666. 66 for depth of hole on handle, central hole diameter, and key hole diameter respectively. As a result, the total loss incurred due to variation in the measured quality characteristics in the same order is estimated as, 14076950, 7364675, and 18226962 INR. It is found that the combination of histogram and Taguchi technique helps to evaluate the overall performance of given process...|$|R
