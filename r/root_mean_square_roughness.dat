40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{techniques}} for estimating the amount of weathering a clast has undergone. These usually have the objective of establishing an ordinal chronology of geomorphological surfaces, or investigation of site-specific conditions affecting weathering rates. Three such techniques are applied to a dated sequence of alluvial fan segments in southern Tunisia. Two of these techniques depend on measuring surface roughness (the micro-roughness meter and a displacement approach) and one uses the structural weakening of the rock fabric (Schmidt hammer). The micro-roughness meter enables calculation of standard deviation of surface height variation, <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>roughness</b> and surface autocorrelation function. Of these techniques, Schmidt hammer rebound values, standard deviation, <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>roughness</b> and the displacement technique show systematic changes on the three fan segments which are statistically significant at the 0. 05 level.

40|$|AbstractThe {{roughness}} of {{cell membrane}} {{is a very}} interesting indicator of cell's health state. Atomic Force Microscopy allows us to investigate the roughness of cell membrane in great detail, but the obtained roughness value is scale-dependent, i. e. it strongly depends on measurement parameters, as scanning area and step size. The scale-dependence of the roughness value can be reduced by means of data filtration techniques, that are not standardized at nanometric scale, especially as far as biological data are concerned. In this work, a new method, based on the changes of values of some roughness parameter (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>roughness</b> and skewness) as a function of filtration frequencies, has been implemented to optimize data filtering procedure in the calculation of cell membrane roughness. In this way, a <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>roughness</b> value independent of cell shape, membrane micro-irregularities and measurement parameters can be obtained. Moreover, different filtration frequencies selected with this method allow us to discriminate different surface regimes (nominal form, waviness and roughness) belonging to the raw cell profile, each one related to different features of the cell surface...|$|E
