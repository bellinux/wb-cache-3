The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E

Once elected, {{he met with}} then Ohio Governor James Rhodes, to solicit the state government's help in clearing up the city's debts. Voinovich negotiated a debt <b>repayment</b> <b>schedule</b> and in October 1980, with the state serving as guarantor, eight local banks lent Cleveland $36.2 million, allowing the city to emerge from default. Despite this, the city's economy continued to decline and federal funding was cut. Two weeks earlier, voters turned down another 0.5 percent income tax increase. The opposition was led by Kucinich, who had been keeping a low profile since his defeat in the 1979 election. Voinovich said he would resubmit the tax issue on the February ballot to avoid facing a deficit in 1981. This time the voters approved the tax increase.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of a {{commercial}} microfinance institution in Madagascar, this paper investigates how the provision of microfinance loans with (in) flexible <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> affects loan delinquencies of agricultural borrowers. Flexible <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> allow a redistribution of principal payments during periods with low agricultural returns to periods when agricultural returns are high. We develop a theoretical framework and apply and estimate an econometric model for the loan repayment behavior of agricultural microborrowers with seasonal and non-seasonal production types. Our results reveal that delinquencies of non-seasonal farmers and seasonal farmers with inflexible <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> are {{not significantly different from}} those of non-farmers. Furthermore, we find that seasonal farmers with flexible <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> show significantly higher delinquencies than non-farmers in low delinquency categories, but we also find that this effect disappears in the highest delinquency category...|$|R

The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 49, 128 - 138], I argued that the standard WACC formula is inadequate in most circumstances to reward stockholders and bondholders where the necessary cash flows are calculated separately to exactly cover the respective costs of capital. Axel Pierru [2009. 'The weighted average cost of capital is not quite right': A comment. The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 49, 1219 - 1223] observes correctly that my assumed <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> (equal periodic payments to bondholders; similarly for stockholders) imply a temporal drift in the debt (or leverage) ratio; he would recalculate the WACC annually. He proposes an alternative calculation of the <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> under the constraint of a constant debt ratio. Here I suggest three additional possible repayment schedules; in general <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> determine the drift in the debt ratio.

40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{focuses on}} a key aspect of {{microfinance}} contracts - <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> - to determine the impact of greater flexibility in <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> on clients’ ability to smooth consumption as well as increase income by putting their loans in less liquid but higher return investments. Traditionally, microfinance <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> are notoriously rigid, involving high frequency repayment in small installments beginning soon after loan disbursement, {{an important aspect of}} the lending model pioneered by earliest MFIs such as the Grameen Bank (Armendariz and Morduch 2005). However, in theory, clients are likely to be better off under more flexible repayment terms, which would give them greater ability to smooth consumption in the face of unanticipated shocks and encourage them to invest more of the loan in relatively illiquid but potentially higher return business investments (Field and Pande 2008). Through both of these channels, introducing flexibility in the timing of repayment by reducing repayment frequency could increase client long-run business income...|$|R

40|$|Microcredit {{institutions}} typically apply {{rigid and}} fixed <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> when disbursing loans {{in order to}} reduce transaction costs, simplify procedures, and inculcate fiscal discipline for better repayment behavior. Microcredit clients, however, often have neither smooth income nor singular moments in which to make lumpy investments throughout the year. This mismatch generates a cash flow disconnect and, given the presumed liquidity constraints of the typical microcredit client, a potential welfare loss. Using data from a randomized evaluation with dairy farmers in rural India, we test the impact of flexible microcredit <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> relative to "normal" inflexible, fixed <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules.</b> Although we are only able to track those who borrow, which introduces potential selection effects, we find amongst those in flexible lending groups some evidence for higher ability to absorb shocks and higher income, which seems to be driven by limited improvements in investment and higher production from milk. On the cost-side, defaults do increase for the lender. Towards the end of the study, the microcredit market encountered crisis, with mass defaults, thus it is hard to generalize with respect to the default results. We conclude with caution, that we have shown suggestive evidence that a more flexible product design, one tailored to the needs of a dairy farmer, may be welfare enhancing for the dairy farmer. Further work is needed to both validate these results, and explore how to balance any trade-off with default...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{innovations}} in the mortgage market have benefited consumers {{through a variety of}} channels. Innovations include the lowering of down payment requirements, increased flexibility in <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules,</b> and the reduction of costs associated with extracting equity from homes. To ascertain the ways in which these innovations would alter spending on housing, we develop a model of the home buying and mortgage choice decision that produces a number of testable implications. For instance, the lowering of down payment requirements should result in homeownership rates increasing, especially for households that are traditionally cash constrained. In fact, we show that between 1994 and 2004, the homeownership rate for young and low-income households rose sharply. Increased flexibility of <b>repayment</b> <b>schedules</b> should assist households in smoothing their housing consumption choices. Empirically, we document that households have increased the share of their income spent on housing by a substantial margin. The result is robust to the changing composition of households and also to regional location. Households that have been traditionally cash constrained have increased their housing expenditures but tend to have low mortgage rates, suggesting that these households may be financing their increased housing consumption with alternative, flexible mortgage products.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the theoretical underpinnings of high-frequency repayment, a feature {{in nearly all}} microfinance contracts that has been largely overlooked by theorists. The pervasive belief among practitioners that frequent repayment is critical in achieving high repayment rates is puzzling.

This paper proposes a simple explanation based on present bias. For such individuals, more frequent repayment can increase the maximum incentive compatible loan size. However, the welfare effects are ambiguous. More frequent repayment can lead to over-borrowing, reducing welfare as it increases loan sizes. ...|$|R
