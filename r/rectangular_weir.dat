Labyrinth weirs are composed of folded sections observed as trapezoidal and triangular in plan view. In this study, rectangular and U-shaped labyrinth weirs were investigated. Experiments were conducted on 15 labyrinth weir models. The models included eight rectangular labyrinth models and six U-shaped labyrinth models with different heights and lengths, and one linear model. All the experiments were performed in a horizontal rectangular flume, 7 m long, 0. 32 m wide and 0. 35 m high. The results indicated that for all the models, discharge coefficient increased sharply with an increase in Ht/P and attained a maximum value. This coefficient then decreased smoothly with a further increase in Ht/P. Increasing height of weirs increased the discharge coefficient for both rectangular and U-shaped weirs. The results also showed that increasing the length parallel to the flow direction decreased and increasing the length perpendicular to the flow direction increased the discharge coefficient. Generally, the discharge coefficient for <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> was less than that of the U-shaped weir. The obtained results compared with those of Tullis et al. (1995) showed that discharge coefficient for U-shaped weir is more and for <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> is less than that of the trapezoidal weir for angle of the side legs of 8 and 12 degrees...|$|E

It is shown that a <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> placed over an inverted V-notch of depth 0. 90 d gives the maximum operating range, where d is the overall depth of the inward trapezoidal weir (from the crest to the vertex). For all flows in the rectangular portion, the discharge is proportional to the linear power of the head, h, measured above a reference plane located at 0. 292 d below the weir crest, in the range 0. 90 d {{less than or equal to}} h less than or equal to 7. 474 : within a maximum error of +/- 1. 5 % from the theoretical discharge. The optimum range of operation of the newly designed weir is 200 % greater than that in the chimney weir designed by Keshava Murthy and Giridhar, and is nearly 950 % greater than that in the inverted V-notch.

40|$|Real-time flow {{measurement}} and monitoring are important components of modern irrigation SCADA systems. Many projects have existing sharp-crested weir structures {{that have not}} been incorporated into SCADA systems because they are partially contracted, and thus do not have a simple rating equation relationship.

One of the hydraulic advantagesof compound weirs is that atlowflow rate, the bottomnotchacts assimpleweir andwith the creation of morehydraulicheadonits upstream, due to theshape of thenotch, make dischargemeasurement withappropriatesensitivity. In high flow rates, the upper notch prevents of increasing upstream water level and backwater and discharge measurement is possible with acceptable accuracy. The compound sharp-crested weirs {{can be used as}} an appropriate solution for discharge measurement with reasonable accuracy and sensitivity of the extensive range of flows. Relations are derived from this kind of weirs hassufficientaccuracy withobservation of design criteriaandconstructionstandards. The purposeofthisresearch was a laboratory investigation of geometricandhydraulic effective parameterson discharge coefficient of compound arched circular- <b>rectangular</b> sharp-crested <b>weirs</b> in two cases of full width of channel and partially contracted weirs and compare the values of the discharge coefficient of compound and simple <b>rectangular</b> <b>weirs.</b> Materials and Methods:Considering the geometric, kinematic and dynamic variables affecting the free flow of sharp-crested weirs, there are 11 independent variableswiththree main quantities (length, massandtime). Usingdimensional analysis with π-Buckinghammethod,it can bederived thedimansionlessrelationship. In order to assess theeffect of various parametersonthe coefficient ofCd,thedimansionlessdiagramsare used. Inthe state of(h≤h 0), discharge relationship usedinsimplecircular weir. In thestate of(h>h 0), discharge of compound weir is computeted from the linear combination of discharge relationships in circular and <b>rectangular</b> <b>weirs.</b> Experimentsare conducted inthe hydraulic engineering models laboratory, Department of Water Engineering, University of Tabriz, in a rectangular glass-metal flume of 9 m length, 25 cm width and 50 cm height. Aftersetting up the weirs in a relevant place of flume andestablish thesteady flow,experiments were performedinthefree flowon 36 models of weirs. Results and Discussion:In this research, theeffects ofrectangularnotch width, the height of weir crest, the height ofcirculararch notch were investigated forchanges of headwithdimensionless ratios of h/P,h/R,h/h_ 0,h/Bon discharge coefficient. The results showthat fora known headover the weir, discharge coefficient increase about 2 to 10 percent with the development of the rectangular notch width of compound and simple <b>rectangular</b> sharp-crested <b>weirs.</b> For a given head over the weir, discharge coefficient decrease approximately 1 to 5 percent by increasing the height of the weir crest of compound and simple sharp-crested weirs.

The meanvalues of thecoefficient of determination (R 2) androot mean square error(RMSE) are 0. 630 and 0. 061,respectively. Among the effective factors that indicate the difference, it can be referred to the theoretical equation in the compound state that is obtained by assuming a linear combination of simple weirs. The effect of the lateral walls of the flume, the measurement accuracy of hydraulic head and discharge, the conditions of flow entrance, the extension of the range of empirical equations proposed in literature for discharge coefficient of simple weirs, Other factors contributing to the difference between the estimated and observed values of discharge coefficient.

40|$|V-shaped weirs {{with small}} angles are {{efficient}} in accurately measuring extremely small discharge rates. The concept of slit weirs to measure discharge rates {{has been studied}} in recent investigations. Rectangular multi-slit notches or weirs {{have been shown to}} extend the range of flow measurement to include both very low and high discharge rates. It is a well-known fact that V-notches whose sections are narrower at lower heads are preferred to rectangular notches to measure small discharge rates in laboratories. To increase the range of discharges measured, the concept of multi-slit <b>weirs</b> using <b>rectangular</b> <b>weirs</b> has been introduced recently. For <b>rectangular</b> multi-slit <b>weirs,</b> experimental data showed that the discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs or a single weir was a function of the Reynolds number R e when R e is based on the width of <b>rectangular</b> <b>weirs.</b> V-notches are generally used for laboratory flow measurements, as they can very precisely measure discharge rates. Hence, the multi-slit weirs formed by V-notches are expected to measure discharges in a very wide range of discharge rates. To represent a common discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs formed of either rectangular or triangular shaped individual weirs, a new Reynolds number R eR is proposed to unify representation of discharge coefficient data for both rectangular shaped and V-shaped multi-slit weir units. C d data for both rectangular and V-shaped multi-slit weirs fall on a single curve and appear to be the function of R eR. At large Reynolds number, R eR, the discharge coefficient C d approaches a constant value of 0. 61. This constant also denotes the contraction coefficient for the narrow two-dimensional slit flow. Present test data show that C d for multi-slit V-shaped weirs is generally a function of R eR for b/B < 0. 3. Here, R eR is based on the hydraulic radius R and b is the value of top flow width of the water passing the multi-slit weirs. A very limited number of numerical simulations are also performed to determine discharge coefficient (C d) and the water surface profiles for the multi-slit V-shaped weirs. The predictions related to the surface profile based on the numerical model are validated by experimental data.

40|$|Introduction: Pivot weirs (sharp crested {{inclined}} weirs, Fig. 1 -a) {{is frequently}} used for discharge measurement, controlling water surface and flow diversion. Some typical features of pivot weirs are: (a) overshot design for better water level control, (b) Their application as head gates, turnout or check structure which requiring low head loss and high accuracy, (c) ease of removing sediment deposit behind the weir, and (d) {{ability to manage}} and monitor on-site or operating remotely when connected to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network. Kindsvater and Carter (8) derived a weir discharge equation based on energy and continuity equations. Hulsing (4) determined head-discharge relationship of inclined suppressed sharp crested weir with the slope of 3 : 3, 2 : 3 and 1 : 3 toward downstream and compared them with the equivalent normal sharp crested weir. In the USBR report on pivot weirs (regarding The Boulder Canyon Project, 1948) the head discharge data of the suppressed pivot weir were presented in a channel with 5. 5 m length, 2. 9 m depth and 0. 61 m width. Some field experiments were also {{carried out in the}} IID (Imperial Irrigation District) on a trapezoidal cross-section (0. 61 m bottom width) channel with pivot weir of 1. 7 m length, and two different widths of 1. 63 m. The flow rate (350 - 880 lit/s) was held constant and different angles (15 - 50 °) calibrated instead of holding the angle constant and varying the flow rate. Some other laboratory tests were performed with Wahlin and Replogle (1994) on two pivot weirs with 1. 2 m and 1. 14 m width for the 0. 61 m and 0. 46 m length of blade and contraction factor of 0. 925. RUBICON Company established an extensive operation on the application and automation of pivot weirs in irrigation channels in Australia (Www. rubicon. com). All previous studies concentrated on modifying the normal <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> head-discharge equation {{so that it can be}} used for the pivot weirs. In this study, it is trying to derive a unique head-discharge equation for pivot weirs based on dimension analysis and critical discharge equation (implementing Ferro rule). This equation can be used for different inclined angles and side contractions. The obtained unique and simple discharge equation can be used in automation of this structure. Material and Method: In this research, experimental data consist of experiments carried out in hydraulic research institute of Tehran, Iran and experiments of USBR on Pivot weir with side contraction in 0. 925 in the canal with 1. 14 m width and 0. 46 m blade length (Wahlin and Replogle, 1994). Experiments of the water institute of Tehran were carried out in the concrete <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> with 10. 30 m long, 1 m wide and 1 m depth (Fig. 2). Experimental model was consisted of canals, water supply system, dampers (avoided of turbulent flow upstream of pivot weir), pivot weirs, sluice gate at the end of the channel (make different tail waters). With respect to laboratory equipment’s, three pivot weirs with of 80 × 65, 60 × 55 and 40 × 40 (cm×cm) respectively length of the blade and the width was built and set 5. 5 m far from the first of the canal. Discharge was determined from the calibrated weir located at the upstream of pivot weir. A manual point gauge with ± 0. 01 mm sensitivity was used to measure water surface levels. Extraction of discharge equation: Dimensional Analysis based on Ferro rule (2000 and 2001) is used to determine the discharge formula of pivot weirs. Since the h-Q function is usually exponential, the relation between dimensionless parameters could be defined as Ferro rule. Results and Discussion: The rating curve of the pivot weirs with different side contractions is compared with the normal suppressed <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> (equal weir height) in Fig. 3. The discharge of normal suppressed <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> was calculated from the discharge equation of Kindsvater-Carter and discharge coefficient of Rehbock (1) for the equal weir height and head of pivot weirs. For a constant water head, the discharge of pivot weir with a side contraction of 0. 925 is more than the normal suppressed weir. When the weir plate is inclined to the bottom of the canal, because of the stagnation area behind the weir plate, the streamlines approach the weir blade smoothly and the energy dissipation is lower than for the normal weirs. The vortex behind the weir plate increases as the inclined angle increases and subsequently the discharge coefficient decreases. Reduction of discharge for a constant water head in contract weirs is simply justified by decreasing of the weir width. The α and β coefficients were obtained based on all experimental data. Discharge equation obtained based on critical depth-discharge equation. Conclusion: In this study, based on dimension analysis a unique head-discharge relation was obtained which could be used for different inclined angels and side contractions. This equation is more appropriate than previous formulas which are modifications to the normal weir head-discharge equation. The accuracy of this equation was evaluated by different data sets including different inclined angle, side contractions, weir heights and also a wide discharge range. This equation could be used in the automated irrigation network easily...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the design of the quadratic weir notch, which finds application in the proportionate method of flow measurement in a by-pass, such that the discharge through it is proportional to the square root of the head measured above a certain datum. The weir notch consists of a bottom {{in the form of a}} <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> of width 2 W and depth a over which a designed curve is fitted. A theorem concerning the flow through compound weirs called the “slope discharge continuity theorem” is discussed and proved. Using this, the problem is reduced to the determination of an exact solution to Volterra's integral equation in Abel's form. It is shown that in the case of a quadratic weir notch, the discharge is proportional to the square root of the head measured above a datum Image a above the crest of the weir. Further, it is observed that the function defining the shape of the weir is rapidly convergent and its value almost approximates to zero at distances of 3 a and above from the crest of the weir. This interesting and significant behaviour of the function incidentally provides a very good approximate solution to a particular Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, transforming the notch into a device called a “proportional-orifice”. A new concept of a “notch-orifice” capable of passing a discharge proportional to the square root of the head (above a particular datum) while acting both as a notch, and as an orifice, is given. A typical experiment with one such notch-orifice, having A = 4 in., and W = 6 in., shows a remarkable agreement with the theory and is found to have a constant coefficient of discharge of 0. 61 in the ranges of both notch and orifice...|$|E

The Conte Laboratory’s Air Directed Passage (ADP) technology acts to supplement volitional behavioral cues by exploiting fish sensitivity/aversion to high energy flow fields established with a sequentially activated series of parallel air diffusers (medium bubble flexible membrane type) positioned at strategic locations {{along the floor}} of test fishways. Compressed air flow is controlled by a PLC/solenoid valve system that acts to pulse air introductions at high frequency so as to actively herd fish toward upstream water inlet structures. ADP allows for control of progression (sweep) speed, direction, energy level and frequency of repeat sweeps. Tests of ADP were conducted using actively migrating wild adult Connecticut River American shad (Alosa sapidissima) collected mid-May through early June 2014 (N= 408). Collected fish were measured for length, sexed, and tagged externally with 23 mm half-duplex PIT tags and held overnight. Trials were performed in a laboratory flume measuring 3 m X 18 m that received Connecticut River water {{at a rate of}} 368 l/s which provided a working depth of 137 cm. Water entered the flume via a contracted <b>rectangular</b> <b>weir</b> 91 cm in width with a delta H of 35. 6 cm. The flume bulkhead supporting the weir incorporated aprons and a ramped floor to streamline flow. The floor of the flume incorporated 14 recessed rows of diffusers positioned at 1. 2 m centers along its longitudinal axis. Each row relied on 17 diffusers for air release. Air flow was applied at 5 m^ 3 /min with rest periods of 1 min between the 10 successive ADP sweeps used per trial. Fish passage rates were monitored by PIT antennas interfaced to a multi-reader PIT tag recorder. ADP increased passage rate 7. 7 fold over selected test periods when compared to controls, i. e., 3. 83 % vs 0. 44 % per min...|$|E
40|$|A {{side weir}} is a {{hydraulic}} structure {{set into the}} side of a channel. This structure is used for water level control in channels, to divert flow from a main channel into a side channel when the water level in the main channel exceeds a specific limit and as storm overflows from urban sewerage system. Computation of water surface over the side weirs is essential to determine the flow rate of the side weir. Analytical solutions for water surface profile along <b>rectangular</b> side <b>weir</b> are available only for the special cases of rectangular and trapezoidal channels considering constant specific energy. In this paper, a <b>rectangular</b> side <b>weir</b> located in a combined (trapezoidal with exponential) channel was considered. Expanding binominal series of integer and fraction powers and the using of reduction formula of cosine function integrals, a general analytical formula was obtained for water surface profile along a side weir in a combined (trapezoidal with exponential) channel. Since triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal and parabolic cross-sections are special cases of the combined cross section, the derived formula, is applicable to triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal cross-sections as analytical solution and semi-analytical solution to parabolic cross-section with maximum relative error smaller than 0. 76 %. The proposed solution should be a useful engineering tool for the evaluation and design of side weirs in open channel...|$|R
40|$|The sharp-crested weir is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used device in channels for flow measurement and flow regulation due to its simplicity. Several {{attempts have been made to}} study in detail the flow over different shapes of normal conventional weirs including those with sharp crest, side weirs and oblique weirs, mainly based on experimental work. On the contrary, little efforts have been done to use numerical models in investigating flow characteristic and pressure distributing over these types of weirs. The concern of this paper is to study flow over a <b>rectangular</b> sharp crested <b>weir</b> and to provide a means to estimate the discharge coefficient. A CFD Software which is ANSYS CFx- 14 has been used for evolving a relationship to estimate the discharge coefficient for <b>rectangular</b> sharp crested <b>weirs.</b> Several combinations of discharge and weir height have been used to develop a best fit curve for estimating the discharge coefficient. The discharge coefficient estimate by the develop model has been found to be in good agreement with those listed in the literature within  4 %error. The study showed that the important variable governing discharge over sharp crested weir was the water head over weir per weir divide by weir height, h/P. Furthermore, the advantages of an ANSYS CFX- 14 as a tool for examining velocity vectors and pressure pattern over <b>rectangular</b> sharp crested <b>weirs</b> have been highlighte...|$|R
40|$|The most {{classic example}} of a {{hydraulic}} structure where gas transfer occurs is a weir. Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a free overfall jet from a weir. A free overfall jet from a weir plunging into down-stream water causes entrainment of air bubbles if the free overfall jet velocity exceeds the critical value where aeration occurs. This paper investigates the free overfall jets from Venturi and <b>rectangular</b> notch <b>weirs</b> and their effect on air entrainment rate. A Venturi weir was placed at the upstream channel end {{in order to increase}} the flow velocity of the free overfall jet and, in turn, to increase air entrainment. It was demonstrated that the air entrainment rate of the Venturi weir is significantly better than the <b>rectangular</b> notch <b>weir,</b> and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the throat width of the Venturi weir is decreased. These results demonstrated that Venturi weirs can be used as highly effective aerators in streams, rivers, constructed channels, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc. Moreover, a regression equation was obtained for the Venturi weirs, relating air entrainment rate to unit discharge, weir crest width, drop height and throat width of Venturi weir. There was good agreement between the measured air entrainment rates and the values computed from the predictive equation. Key words: air entrainment rate, aeration, jet expansion, Venturi, wei...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{occurrence}} of ponding {{during the period of}} rice growth, the analyses of rainfall-runoff in paddy fields are different from those in general lands. The diffusive tank model has been successfully applied in rainfall-runoff simulations in paddy fields because it can well describe the features of the local water flow. In most of the applications of this model, although the determination of the related model parameters is important, detailed investigations on each individual parameter are definitely needed to improve the accuracy of the results. In the study, an improved procedure is proposed to determine certain variables involved in the diffusive tank model and the application is conducted in a field area in Taiwan. In the application, the roughness of the river channel was assessed according to the actual field conditions. Instead of using the observed water levels in each rainfall event, the notch width of the <b>rectangular</b> contracted <b>weir</b> per unit area was evaluated by direct field measurements to calibrate the discharge coefficient. Test results from the selected field in six rainfall events showed that the local average value of the notch width of the <b>rectangular</b> contracted <b>weir</b> per unit area was 1. 025 m/ha. Compared to the results of field measurements, the relative errors of the predictions were within 3 % in all tests of rainfall events. In addition, for different types of catchment partitions, {{it was found that the}} corresponding weir discharge coefficients remained roughly unchanged.

30|$|The PKW has a <b>rectangular</b> {{nonlinear}} <b>weir</b> crest layout (in planform); unlike traditional labyrinth weirs, the sloped {{floor in}} the inlet and outlet cycles, referred to as keys, overhangs the apexes providing a longer crest length than a <b>rectangular</b> labyrinth <b>weir,</b> and several times the transverse weir width. The piano key weir {{does not have any}} gates. So it will involve very little operation and maintenance and would be very much cheaper than conventional dam spillways or barrage structure. Mountainous rivers of India transport higher sediment concentration through it & because of this the use of PKW may be promoted by answering the question of sedimentation mechanism behind it. As sediment from upstream normally moves downstream along with flowing water, the geographical features are changed and hydro-ecological habitats are subsequently affected. Inhibited sediment continuity has an effect on the hydro-environmental status downstream of a weir, which can result in serious disturbance to the riparian ecosystem. To support recovery of sediment continuity in rivers, the piano key weir might be used as an alternative transverse structure. It needs the elemental sediment transport study in the approach flow PKW to point out the physical hydraulic characteristics. Research found that the turbulence structure {{played a significant role in}} sediment transport and suspension (Duan et al. 2009, 2011). The measured turbulent flow field (e.g., turbulence intensities, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulence diffusion, conditional functions and flow structures) at various levels in the upstream of the flow is needed for accurate estimation of sediment transport. These turbulent parameters in the upstream of a piano key weir can be investigated experimentally. For these researches, at first we have to clearly understand the terminology behind it.|$|R

Emiroglu and Kisi (2013) utilized ANFIS to simulate the discharge coefficient of trapezoidal side weirs and compared the results with the ANN method. The authors concluded that the ANFIS model could predict the trapezoidal side weir discharge coefficient with higher accuracy. Seyedian et al. (2014) used ANFIS to investigate the effect of changing the side weir length, flow depth and side weir height on the discharge coefficient.|$|R
40|$|Side weirs are {{extensively}} used in hydraulic engineering, irrigation, {{and environmental}} engineering applications which involve flow measurement and regulation. Flows through side weirs are typical examples of spatially varied flow (SVF) with decreasing discharge. The flow emerging {{out from the}} side weir is three-dimensional (3 D) due to variations in the water surface profile. These flow characteristics {{can be obtained by}} experimental methods,numerical modeling or by theoretical analysis. The present study is confined to the <b>rectangular</b> side <b>weir</b> located in a horizontal rectangular channel having zero sill height. Experiments were performed on the <b>rectangular</b> side <b>weir</b> to locate the stagnation zone, the region of separation and the water surface profile. A Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) unit was used to measure the mean and turbulent velocity components of the flow. Experimental results are analyzed to find the detailed flow characteristics using data related to the velocity distribution, velocity vectors, separation streamlines, stagnation point and water surface profiles for different weir flow configurations. The predictions of the 3 D numerical turbulence model were validated using the experimental results. The 3 D equations, Reynolds’s averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the twoequation renormalized relations (RNG k-ε) were verified using experimental results. The volume of fluid (VOF) scheme was incorporated in the model to find free surface profiles of the open channel flow configuration denoting the side weir flow. The simulation result provided iv detailed analysis of flow patterns, velocity distributions, water surface profiles, flow separation zone, stagnation zone, and separation streamlines. In general, the experimental data validated the predictions of the numerical model. The location of the stagnation point on the near wall was also determined based on the existing ideal flow analysis of Michell for flow past a rectangular outlet in a 2 D conduit and was shown to be close to both test results and model predictions...|$|R

However, as will be shown below, its sensitivity as per change in over head for unit change in discharge is con-sidered less than satisfactory.

40|$|This {{report is}} the {{conclusion}} of a series of experiments, which were performed on weirs placed obliquely in a shallow flow. Its purpose is to report on laboratory investigation on the flow over different types of oblique weirs, including behaviour and hydraulic characteristic of the flow, different phenomena in the neighbourhood of the weir, hydraulic parameters and physical laws that govern the process. To that end, many experiments were performed in a shallow flume under various flow conditions. Two different types of impermeable weirs are tested, including a <b>rectangular</b> sharp-crested <b>weir</b> and a <b>rectangular</b> broad-crested <b>weir,</b> both placed 450 obliquely to the flow direction. These weirs are schematically designed with vertical upstream and downstream walls, sharp edges, and two small end parts of each weir perpendicular to the flow. Flow velocities were measured using Particle Tracking Velocimetry technique, which helps gaining instantaneous whole field velocity maps. In conjunction with Matlab we can get almost necessary statistical information. By changing the flow discharge and the downstream water level, different flow behaviour and various phenomena like vortex, hydraulic jump, undulation, flow divergence, flow concentration, etc. can be observed. The data collected from measurements are used to investigate the hydraulic process and the phenomena of interest. This report also aims at a quantitative view on the energy loss and the discharge coefficient. It is shown that the flow tends to change its direction to perpendicular direction with the weir crest. This leads to the difference in water levels at two ends of the weir, the flow concentration at {{on one side of the}} flume behind weir, the variation in flow velocity distribution. In case of emerged flow condition, the flow behind weir becomes highly turbulent and very complex, which make it difficult to perform accurate measurements. This flow regime also accounts for the higher head loss and energy dissipation than in case of submerged flow condition. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R

In order to decrease the length of channel opening with the desired water height, this study focuses on applying trapezoidal geometry for side weirs. The discharge coefficient needs to be found experimentally for any kinds of trapezoidal side weirs. For this study experimental tests {{have been carried out}} for trapezoidal side weir in order to obtain the discharge coefficient. The main dimensionless variables for the tests include: Upstream end Froude number (F 1), w/y 1, L/B, L′/L, w/L′ and sin (α). Finally, the relationship for De-Marchi’s coefficient in subcritical flow for trapezoidal side weir is presented based on the non-dimensional parameters of weir and flow.
