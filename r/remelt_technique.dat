40|$|Electrochemical {{corrosion}} behaviour of iron aluminides, {{produced by}} electroslag <b>remelting</b> <b>technique,</b> having the compositions (1) Fe– 15. 6 Al– 0. 05 C, (2) Fe– 15. 6 Al– 0. 14 C, (3) Fe– 15. 6 Al– 0. 5 C and (4) Fe– 15. 6 Al– 1 C were investigated in 0. 5 N H 2 SO 4 media. Corrosion rates of these alloys {{were found to}} increase with carbon content. This was attributed to the preferential attack of the carbide phases. These alloys exhibited typical active–passive–transpassive behaviour. In addition, they displayed a secondary anodic current maxima during polarization. The resistance of aluminides to breakdown of passivity was assessed by varying addition of chloride ions in the same media. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of bearing alloy {{containing}} ultrafine sized tin and silicon dispersions in aluminum was designed using laser surface alloying and laser <b>remelting</b> <b>techniques.</b> The microstructures of these non-equilibrium processed alloys were studied in detail using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The microstructures revealed three distinct morphologies of tin particles namely elongated particles co-existing with silicon, globular particles, and very fine particles. Our detailed analyses using cellular growth theories showed that the formation of these globular tin particles {{was due to the}} pinching off of the tin rich liquid in the inter-cellular space by the growth of aluminum secondary dendrite arms. Evidence of fine recrystallized aluminum grains at the top layer due to constrained solidification was shown. Thermal analyses suggested that melting of the spherical shaped tin particles was controlled by the binary aluminum-tin eutectic reaction, whereas non-spherical tin particles melted via the tin-silicon eutectic reaction...|$|R

40|$|Directionally {{solidified}} Al 2 O 3 /Er 3 Al 5 O 12 (EAG) eutectic ceramic {{was prepared}} by laser zone <b>remelting</b> <b>technique.</b> The eutectic morphology and microstructure evolution investigated {{as a function}} of laser scanning rate. Moreover, the mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms were studied. The Al 2 O 3 /EAG eutectic ceramic consists of only two continuous phases of Al 2 O 3 and EAG which interpenetrates with each other to form well―distributed three―dimensional network. The eutectic spacing is only around 0. 2 ― 2. 1 &mu;m and reduces with the increase of scanning rate. At low scanning rate, the typical lamellar irregular eutectic structure is obtained. When the scanning rate reaches 800 &mu;m/s, the cellular or dendrite microstructure appears. The hardness and the fracture toughness at room temperature are measured to be 18. 7 GPa and 2. 45 MPa&middot;m 1 / 2, respectively. The refined microstructure, crack deflection at phase interface and crack branching contribute to the improved toughness...|$|R
40|$|The {{applications}} of the chromium ferritic stainless steel AISI 410 S have been considerably increased {{in the last years}} in many technical fields as chemical industries and oil or gas transportation. However, the phase transformation temperatures are, currently, unknown for this alloy. The aim of this work is to determine the alpha to gamma transformation temperatures of the AISI 410 S alloy in different cooling conditions and to analyze them using continuous cooling theory. In order to achieve different cooling rates and thermal conditions, two complementary techniques were used: Bridgman furnace crystal growth and laser <b>remelting</b> <b>technique.</b> The measured solidification temperature was around 1730 and 1750 K. Plate-like and dendritic austenite precipitates were obtained in solid-state phase using growth rates between 5 and 10 µm/s in directional growth experiments. Only plate-like austenite phase was observed in the experiments using growth rates above 100 µm/s. The appearance of dendrites, with the consequent segregation of the elements, can be previously determined by the microstructure modeling currently proposed. Massive austenite can be produced from 0. 3 to 10 mm/s rates at temperatures between 1100 - 1300 K. The structure might be less sensitive to corrosion because this phase is produced without microsegregation. Commission of Technology and Innovation (Switzerland) Swiss Steel Co.

40|$|Rapid {{solidification}} {{experiments were}} carried out on single-phase Zn-rich Zn-Ag alloys processed by laser <b>remelting</b> and melt-spinning <b>techniques.</b> For comparison, Bridgman solidification was performed as well. Three solidification morphologies were mainly identified with increasing growth velocity from 0. 02 to 300 mm/s: regular cells or dendrites of eta, plate-like cells of eta, and plane front of eta. Plate-like and regular cells {{were found to be}} velocity-dependent and occurred in high-velocity and low-velocity domains, respectively. The development of solidification interface morphologies in the present Zn-Ag alloys was proposed accordingly over a wide range of growth velocities from the limit of constitutional supercooling to the limit of absolute stability. Four microstructure transitions were identified: low-velocity plane front of eta [...] > low-velocity plate-like cells of eta [...] > regular cells or dendrites of eta [...] > high-velocity plate-like cells of eta [...] > high-velocity plane front of eta. It implies that a plate-like cell would be the favorable morphology at growth conditions approaching a stable planar solid/liquid interface in comparison with the regular one...|$|R
40|$|The modern steel {{plants for}} clean steel {{production}} depend to large extent on {{the efficiency of}} the refining processes that applied for the production. Refining processes that applied for low alloy and alloyed steel production include degassing via vacuum or ladle and ladle furnace units. This technique could help in producing homogeneous steel with low gas content and minimum internal defects. In certain grades of steel for tools and penetration and impact resistance uses, non-metallic inclusions (NMI) and sulphur content are the key factors for the steel performance and applications. ESR, Electro-salg refining (or <b>remelting),</b> is the <b>technique</b> that can efficiently produce clean steel with minimum content of NMI and sulphur due to the special nature and mechanism of this technique. In this study, the effect of initial chemical composition of steel and slag properties on the efficiency of ESR process in removal of NMI and sulphur from steel are evaluated. Different grades of steels were refined using ESR process. The efficiency of ESR in modifying and enhancing NMI shape, size and counts as well as removal of sulphur in different steel grades was evaluated at different slag composition and physical properties. The effect of chemical composition of steel on the efficiency of ESR process was studied. It was found that ESR process has a great effect in producing clean steel where both viscosity and initial composition of steel have influence on the final NMI status and sulphur content in the produced steel...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state recycling, which {{involves}} the direct recycling of scrap metal into bulk material using severe plastic deformation, {{has emerged as}} a potential alternative to the conventional <b>remelting</b> and recycling <b>techniques.</b> Hot press forging has been identified as a sustainable direct recycling technique that has fewer steps and maintains excellent material performance. An experimental investigation was conducted to explore the hardness and density of a recycled aluminum-based metal matrix composite by varying operating temperature and holding time. A mixture of recycled aluminum, AA 6061, and aluminum oxide were simultaneously heated to 430, 480, and 530 °C and forged for 60, 90, and 120 min. We found a positive increase in microhardness and density for all composites. The hardness increased approximately 33. 85 %, while density improved by about 15. 25 % whenever the temperature or the holding time were increased. Based on qualitative analysis, the composite endures substantial plastic deformation due to the presence of hardness properties due to the aluminum oxide embedded in the aluminum matrix. These increases were significantly affected by the operating temperature; the holding time also had a subordinate role in enhancing the metal matrix composite properties. Furthermore, in an effort to curb the shortage of primary resources, this study reviewed the promising performance of secondary resources produced by using recycled aluminum and aluminum oxide as the base matrix and reinforcement constituent, respectively. This study is an outline for machining practitioners and the manufacturing industry to help increase industry sustainability with the aim of preserving the Earth for our community in the future...|$|R
