While conventional reprocessing process, PUREX process, was successful to recover uranium and plutonium, in recent years some countries have turned to focus on advanced reprocessing process, which features of partitioning of minor actinides (MA) and long-lived fission products(LLFP). Most advanced reprocessing processes under development involve new extractants and additional extraction cycles. In China, TRPO extraction process has been developed to partition MA/LLFP from high-level liquid waste(HLLW) since early 1980 ’s. In parallel to R&D work on separation technologies, studies on concentration & denitration process have been evolved to prepare feed solutions to suit qualifications of extraction. Industrially, concentration & denitration is the internationally recognized standard to treat HLLW released from PUREX before vitrification. It enables to minimize the volume of interim storage, to restrain the corrosion of storage tank, to recover nitric acid in HLLW and to reduce the <b>required</b> <b>evaporation</b> duty of the vitrification process.

40|$|The paper reports {{experiments}} {{employing the}} cloud chamber technique for creating fuel aerosols, {{in studies of}} premixed laminar flames. Spherical explosion flames were initiated at different times {{after the start of}} expansion of the original gaseous mixture to lower pressure. Flame speeds were measured close to atmospheric pressure, over a range of equivalence ratios of iso-octane, ethanol and hydrous ethanol with air. A methodology was developed for deriving mass burning velocities and entrainment velocities, as well as mass burning fluxes, from the measurements of aerosol number densities, droplet sizes and flame speeds. It was vital to estimate whether droplet evaporation was completed in the flame preheat zone. This was done by calculating the spatial progress of droplet evaporation for the different aerosols from values of the evaporation rate constants of the different fuels. With predominantly the leaner mixtures and smaller droplet diameters, evaporation was close to completion, but the mass burning velocities of the aerosols were somewhat lower than those of the corresponding gaseous phases, because of the lower final temperatures due to the <b>required</b> <b>evaporation</b> enthalpies. However, the mass burning fluxes were higher than those for the purely gaseous flames, due to the higher two-phase reactant densities. At the higher values of the liquid phase equivalence ratio, in overall lean mixtures, the mass burning velocity could exceed that in the purely gaseous phase due to localised enrichment around the droplets. The presence of fuel droplets is shown to enhance the generation of Darrieus-Landau, thermo-diffusive instabilities and the associated flame wrinkling. With richer mixtures and larger droplets, it is possible for droplets to enter the reaction zone and further enhance existing gaseous phase instabilities through the creation of yet further flame wrinkling. This leads to the maximum entrained fuel mass flux, in the richest mixture, being significantly higher than that occurring at the maximum burning velocity of a premixed gaseous flame...|$|E

If these ponds are to be implemented successfully, then a more complete understanding of the mechanisms and phenomena governing their behaviour is <b>required.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> has been shown previously to be the dominant mode of heat loss from the pond surface, and the fresh water that would need to be added to maintain the pond’s inventory could potentially add significantly to operating costs. To this end, an experimental unit was constructed to examine and observe the behaviour of a salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) before and after covering the pond with a thin layer (0. 5 cm) of paraffin, with the aim of eliminating evaporation. The unit was run for 71 days in Nasiriyah, Iraq. This is the first study to attempt to completely eliminate the harmful effects of evaporation on solar pond performance using a liquid layer. The layer successfully eliminated the significant evaporation observed from the uncovered pond and crucially, while the salinity gradient through the non-convective zone remained substantially intact {{over the course of the}} study, the temperature profile became approximately uniform throughout the entire pond after about 50 days. This behaviour has significant implications for the construction of the pond, as it may mean that if evaporation can be largely suppressed, the salinity gradient may not be necessary for the pond to capture and efficiently store heat. Furthermore, the effects on evaporation of different climatic factors such as relative humidity, wind speed, ambient temperature and solar radiation were considered by analysing data measured on-site and longer-term meteorological data. The results showed that ambient temperature, solar radiation and humidity have a significant correlation with the evaporation rate; and their impact varies seasonally. A more comprehensive multiple regression analysis showed that ambient temperature has the highest impact on evaporation, while the effect of the incident solar radiation is insignificant. Such insights are vital in the design and siting of solar ponds, and can be used to minimise evaporative losses...|$|E

The combination of a treated catchment feeding runoff water to a planted area coupled with surface storage is defined as a water harvesting agrisystem.

To date, various approaches {{have been reported}} to fabricate Sb 2 S 3 absorber layers. Sb 2 S 3 -sensitized inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells exhibit a high solar energy harvesting ability and have demonstrated conversion efficiency of 7.5 % [19]. However, the device fabrication is complicated, and the lifetime of organic hole transporting materials is low. In comparison, planar heterojunction solar cells are advantageous in terms of simplified absorber preparation as well as device fabrication. Both physical vapor-deposited and solution-processed Sb 2 S 3 films have been previously applied in planar heterojunction solar cell fabrication. All-inorganic Sb 2 S 3 planar heterojunction devices with a simple structure of FTO/n-type buffer layer/Sb 2 S 3 /electrode have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.27 – 4.17 % [20 – 24]. Vacuum-based film deposition methods like magnetron sputtering are convenient to operate and provide accurate thickness control, reproducibility, and smooth surface building. Due to these advantages, they have been widely applied in industrial manufacturing of CIGS and CdTe solar cells. Sb 2 S 3 has a low melting point (550  °C) and high vapor pressure, favoring thermal evaporation instead of magnetron sputtering. However, Sb 2 S 3 {{exhibits a}} poor thermostability in vacuum resulting in significant deviations in the composition [25], and the tendency for surface oxidation. Currently, component preserving rapid thermal evaporation (RTP) has been employed in the fabrication of all-inorganic Sb 2 S 3 solar cells having achieved a maximum PCE of 4.17 % [23]. Compared with the rapid thermal evaporation technique, regular thermal evaporation has some advantages in terms of providing accurate thickness and variable morphology control. Also, the substrate rotation is easier to realize and beneficial for uniform preparation of large-area thin film specimen. Since the distance between substrate and source is greater, the <b>required</b> <b>evaporation</b> power is lower than rapid evaporation. This ensures that the source has less thermal effect on the substrate during evaporation process. It consumes less material and has better prospect in flexible solar cell fabrication. However, this approach has some limitations that need to be addressed. To avoid decomposition and surface oxidation, Sb 2 S 3 films can only be prepared at a low substrate temperature (~[*] 200  °C) by regular thermal evaporation. However, the low substrate temperature resulted in poor crystallinity of the films, which was not suitable for the preparation of efficient photovoltaic devices.|$|E

However, as a homeothermic endotherm it is still {{faced with the challenge}} of maintaining a constant body temperature while being exposed to both the day (light period) and night (dark period) temperatures of its environments. Phoenicopterus ruber have evolved a number of thermoregulatory mechanisms to keep itself cool during the light period and warm during the dark period without expending too much energy. The American flamingo has been observed in a temperature niche between 17.8 - 35.2 C. In order to prevent water loss through evaporation when temperatures are elevated the flamingo will employ hyperthermia as a nonevaporative heat loss method keeping its body temperature between 40 - 42 C. This allows heat to leave the body by moving from an area of high body temperature to an area of a lower ambient temperature. Flamingos are also able to use evaporative heat loss methods such as, cutaneous evaporative heat loss and respiratory evaporative heat loss. During cutaneous heat loss, Phoenicopterus ruber relies on evaporation off of the skin to reduce its body temperature. This method is not very efficient as it <b>requires</b> <b>evaporation</b> to pass through the plumage. A more efficient way to reduce its body temperature is through respiratory evaporative heat loss, where the flamingo engages in panting to expel excessive body heat. During the dark period the flamingos tend to tuck their heads beneath their wing to conserve body heat.

Data from Current and Future RCM runs driven by boundary conditions from a Global Climate Model are then used to investigate potential future changes in PE, and how certain factors affect those changes. In particular, the importance of including changes in canopy resistance is demonstrated. PE projections are also shown to vary to some extent according to how aerosols are modelled in the RCMs...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the production of}} pulp is of economic interest to many kraft pulp mills. However, significant increases in production generally require the recovery boiler to be debottlenecked: it must either be rebuilt or replaced. Both options require costly investments that can be avoided by extracting lignin from the black liquor before it is burnt in the boiler. This, in turn, requires changes being made in the evaporation plant. In the present study, simulations have been carried out based on a 25 % {{increase in}} the production of pulp. The evaporation plants are simulated with and without an integrated lignin separation plant to investigate the consequences of extracting lignin from black liquor. The results show that the evaporation plants with lignin extraction have investment costs that are 5 - 30 % higher than an equivalent plant without lignin extraction. Furthermore, the evaporation plants with lignin extraction <b>require</b> an <b>evaporation</b> capacity that is 7 % higher, since filtrates from the lignin separation plant are also evaporated here. This increases the steam demand by 9 - 12 % compared with a plant without lignin extraction. The span in the investment cost and steam demand depends on where the filtrates are recirculated in the evaporation plant...|$|R
