In this paper a finite element {{scheme based on}} the Galerkin technique is {{used to analyze the}} reflection characteristics of the resonant absorber when insonified by a normal incidence plane wave. A waveguide theory coupled with an impedance matching condition in the fluid is used to model the problem. It is shown in this paper that the fluid medium encompassing the absorber can be modeled as an elastic medium with equivalent Lamé constants. Quarter symmetry conditions within the periodic unit cell are exploited. The finite element results are compared with analytical results, and with results published elsewhere in the literature. It is shown in the process that meshing of the fluid domain can be obviated if the transmission coefficients or reflection coefficients only are desired as is often the case. Finally, some design curves for thin resonant absorbers with water closure are presented in this paper...|$|R
30|$|The resonance-type {{resistance}} silencer {{is based}} on the principle of the Helmholtz resonator (HR). It has the advantages of simple structure, high amount of noise elimination, and small pressure loss, among other attributes. It is widely used in automotive engine air intake noise control (Sohn and Park 2011). Arefi et al. (2014) was able to improve reverberation time in a conference room using HRs with defined dimensions, diffusers, and <b>sound</b> <b>absorbers.</b> Mao and Pietrzko (2010) carried out an experimental investigation of passive control of sound transmission through a double-glazed window by using an arrangement of HRs. It was shown that a considerable reduction of the transmitted sound pressure levels has been achieved around the mass-air-mass resonance frequency (50 – 120  Hz). Lee et al. (2013) studied the effect of leakage on the acoustic performance of reactive silencers, such as expansion chambers, HRs, and quarter-wave resonators. Sanada and Tanaka (2013) used two degree of freedom Helmholtz-based resonators with a flexible panel to extend the frequency range of <b>resonant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>absorbers.</b> Yasuda et al. (2013), based on the typical structure, designed a muffler with an interconnecting hole on the tail tube, which was proposed to improve its acoustic performance. Park (2013) introduced a micro-perforated panel of absorbers backed by HRs to improve sound absorption in the low-frequency region, where conventional micro-perforated panel absorbers cannot provide sufficient absorption. Singh and Rienstra (2014) presented a systematic derivation of a solution of the nonlinear HR equation, in order to obtain analytically expressions for impedances close to resonance, while including nonlinear effects. Atak et al. (2014) combined two concepts to design acoustic lenses that are based on HRs. It was shown that using HR-based sonic crystals leads to better acoustic lens designs, especially at the low frequencies, where the local resonances are pronounced. At present, research focuses primarily on designing or analyzing HR, which has a good effects on the air inlet system’s low-frequency noise elimination; however, a larger proportion of intake system noise is high-frequency, especially during rapid acceleration. In order to improve an automobile’s riding comfort, it is necessary to establish a method to suppress the engine’s air inlet high-frequency noise during rapid acceleration.|$|R

The experimental results also found that the coconut coir fiber with perforated plate gives higher value for lower frequencies range from 600 - 2400 Hz. The optimum value for coconut coir fiber with perforated panel is around 0. 94 - 0. 95 for the frequency range 2600 - 2700 Hz. Conclusion: Noise absorption coefficient of coconut coir fiber was increased at all frequency when they were backing with Woven Cotton Cloth (WCC). At low frequency, the NAC have significant increasing. This is because WCC have higher flow resistivity than coconut coir fibers, so that sound can be dissipated as it travels through material significantly.

The <b>resonant</b> <b>sound</b> field, which is principally longitudinal, is calculated by the finite element method and a discrete-vortex model is used to predict the observed separated flow.

Comparison is made between the predicted time-dependent structures and the observed flow structures using smoke visualization.
