Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy."

500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a <b>really</b> <b>smart</b> girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

[...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted.

Anna Torv, who portrays Olivia, was not aware that her character would be channeling Bell until just prior to filming of the episode, and stated of the role, [...] "This is not one I had been asking for!" [...] To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to jump right into the role. Noble later commented [...] "I think the solutions she came up with – taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice — were <b>really</b> <b>smart.</b> We {{had a lot of fun}} doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} become the {{character}} of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s [...] "Italian Boy" [...] hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Although Brown now wears a wig, for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress. Brown has stated {{that as soon as}} Dot's hairpiece is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985. The fur-collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in 1988 when she left the serial. Brown commented, [...] "I like the older clothes [...] I don't want new clothes, I'm happy the way she is. She thinks she looks <b>really</b> <b>smart.</b> She's got a terrible opinion of herself that woman!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? Do we have to go there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. I think it was just so implausible and just an image that Black folks don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane! It's going brilliantlyshe's a wonderful woman, she's <b>really</b> <b>smart,</b> she's really strong, a real team player. She's a great addition." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{stated that}} Valve's aim {{was not to}} make Portal 2 more {{difficult}} than its predecessor, but instead to produce [...] "a game where you think your way through particular parts of the level, and feel <b>really</b> <b>smart</b> when you solve it." [...] Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game's mechanics, an approach that led to two basic types of test chamber. The first type, which Valve calls [...] "checklisting", provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally, providing challenging and rewarding puzzles. Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings. The developers performed a sanity check on the chamber before crafting simple levels with a software tool called the Hammer level editor. Extensive playtesting ensured the solutions to each chamber were neither too obvious nor too difficult, and observed alternative solutions discovered by playtesters. Based on play-testing results, the design team retained these alternative solutions or blocked them if they were considered too easy. These versions were sent back for further play-testing to verify that the new elements did not prevent players from finding solutions; further iterations between artists and playtesters occurred until such issues were resolved. Some elements from Portal were modified to suit Portal 2; whereas players of Portal would {{be familiar with the}} game mechanics, novice players required some training, as would players of Portal for some game elements. For example, the energy spheres used in the first game were replaced with lasers, which provided immediate feedback and reduced the in-game training time.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Flynn was {{conceived}} as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that [...] "Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a <b>really</b> <b>smart</b> girl but is just locked away in this tower. So {{she has a very}} limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy." [...] The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender-neutral Tangled {{is due in part to}} Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is [...] "to name the movie after the Princess", the directors had initially thought that the film [...] "would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that [...] "When Nathan and I figured out that this film was really about two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea." [...] Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with [...] "an ironic counterpoint", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As [...] "an example of first-person voice-over narration", Flynn's narration [...] "compels the viewer to identify empathetically with" [...] Flynn and Rapunzel.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Impossible {{is used as}} an {{archetype}} or stock character supervillain. He {{is characterized}} as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts {{to take control of}} the world's population. This is seen as a sub-type of the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: [...] "it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even if he knows he's going to lose. The superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause." [...] From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, [...] "they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero just has to come in and smash it up." [...] Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, [...] "On the one hand, you're supposed to be <b>really</b> <b>smart,</b> and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [...] in the eyes of the world." ...|$|E
