40|$|The Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in {{collaboration}} with the Czech Technical University, carried out the experiment of satellite laser <b>ranging</b> with sub-centimeter <b>precision</b> in Shanghai in August 2001. A pico-second event timer was used for the measurement of the time interval between the transmitted and returned laser pulses for Lageos 1, 2, Starlette, Stella, Topex/Poseiden and ERS- 2 in coordination with the existing laser transmitting and receiving system at the Shanghai Observatory. The analysis of the measurement showed that the single-shot <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> with these satellites is 7 - 8 mm. In order to compare <b>ranging</b> <b>precision,</b> the existing <b>ranging</b> system has tracked simultaneously these satellites and obtained the <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> of 12 - 15 mm. It means that the <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> with the new system is 80 % better than the existing system.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the satellite laser ranging is the millimeter precision and accuracy. The accuracy of the satellite laser ranging may be estimated {{on the basis of}} analysis of all the individual contributors to the ranging error budget [1]. All the error budget contributors have their random (precision) and systematic (bias) components. It means, that the correct understanding and interpretation of the <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> is the precondition of the ranging accuracy statement. In our paper we are demonstrating the fact, that the list of the satellite laser ranging error budget contributors in not complete. This is demonstrated on the discrepancy between the <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> achieved <b>ranging</b> to ground targets and to satellites. The best existing ground based ranging systems are capable to achieve millimeter <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> when <b>ranging</b> to short distance terrestrial targets. However, ranging to Earth orbiting satellites the best precision obtained is typically 3 times worse, about 3 millimeters RMS. As this value is obtained even for satellite targets not spreading in time the echo signal, there is was a speculation, that the remaining contribution to the random error budget is contributed by the atmospheric fluctuations. However, the current results of numerical modelling of these effects showed [2], that the atmospheric contribution to the satellite laser <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> is lower by two orders of magnitude. As a conclusion: there exists an error in SLR, both random and systematic, which has not been identified till now. The random component of this error is on a millimeter level, its systematic component may be estimated once it will be identified and characterized. We would like to urge the SLR community to look for this error source...|$|R

40|$|We present two novel Poisson noise Maximum Likelihood based {{methods for}} {{identifying}} the individual returns within mixed pixels for Amplitude Modulated Continuous Wave rangers.

In the single return case both methods provide an improvement in <b>ranging</b> <b>precision</b> over standard Fourier transform based methods and a decrease in overall error in almost every case. We find {{that it is possible to}} discriminate between two light sources within a pixel, but local minima and scattered light have a significant impact on <b>ranging</b> <b>precision.</b> Discrimination of two returns requires the ability to take samples at less than 90 degree phase shifts...|$|R
