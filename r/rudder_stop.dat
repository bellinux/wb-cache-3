5000|$|August 31, 1891; Arrived San Francisco, {{story of}} damage en route, broken <b>rudder,</b> <b>stop</b> in Rio de Janeiro ...|$|E
50|$|Salt Lake City fired 806 armor-piercing {{projectiles}} {{and then}} 26 high-capacity shells after {{the supply of}} armor-piercing ammunition was exhausted. Powder and shells were manhandled aft from the forward magazines to keep the after guns firing. Salt Lake City′s <b>rudder</b> <b>stops</b> were carried away, limiting her to 10° course changes.|$|R
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} stalls, the nose {{will begin to}} drop. At this point the pilot applies full or nearly full elevator, to hold the nose attitude near the horizon. While holding the ailerons neutral, the pilot applies full rudder in one direction, to induce a spin. When the spin begins, the pilot reverses the rudder direction. The aircraft will roll during the spin and will drop to the side in a slip before the rudder {{has a chance to}} take authority over the plane. As the <b>rudder</b> <b>stops</b> the spin, the wings will level, and then the incipient spin will begin in the opposite direction, causing the plane to roll and slip to that side. At this time, the pilot reverses the rudder, and this is repeated until the pilot decides to disengage from the maneuver. During the maneuver, the pilot attempts to hold the wings as level as possible, using only the rudder with no help from the ailerons.|$|R
50|$|The {{recovery}} procedure from a spin requires using <b>rudder</b> to <b>stop</b> the rotation, then elevator to reduce {{angle of attack}} to stop the stall, then {{pulling out of the}} dive without exceeding the maximum permitted airspeed (VNE) or maximum G loading. The maximum G loading for a light airplane in the normal category is usually 3.8 G. For a light airplane in the acrobatic category it is usually at least 6 G.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposing}} cruisers simultaneously {{opened fire}} {{at a range}} of 20000 yd. The ensuing battle was a retiring action {{on the part of}} the Americans, for the Japanese foiled their attempt to get to the auxiliaries. Salt Lake City received most of the attention and soon received two hits, one of them amidships, mortally wounding two men, but she responded with very accurate fire. Her <b>rudder</b> <b>stops</b> were carried away, limiting her to 10° course changes. The starboard seaplane caught fire and was jettisoned. Another hit soon flooded forward compartments. Under cover of a thick smoke screen and aggressive torpedo attacks by the destroyers, the American cruisers were able to make an evasive turn, which for a while allowed the range to open. Salt Lake City soon began taking hits again and her boiler fires died one by one. Salt water had entered the fuel oil feed lines. There was now cause for grave concern; she lay dead in the water, and the Japanese ships were closing fast. Luckily, she was hidden in the smoke, and the enemy was not aware of her plight.|$|R
50|$|The {{graveyard}} spin is {{an illusion}} that can occur to a pilot who enters a spin. For example, a pilot who enters a spin to the left will initially have a sensation of spinning in the same direction. However, if the left spin continues the pilot will have the sensation that the spin is progressively decreasing. At this point, if the pilot applies right <b>rudder</b> to <b>stop</b> the left spin, the pilot will suddenly sense a spin {{in the opposite direction}} (to the right).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Bargsten was peacefully {{reading in}} his bunk when the sound {{operator}} rushed in to report propeller noises directly overhead. Immediately thereafter, the depth charges exploded. Instruments were shattered, {{the lights went}} out, the motors <b>stopped,</b> <b>rudder</b> and diving planes were rendered useless, and water entered the control room through the depth and tank pressure gauge connections.|$|R
2500|$|Finally, one of {{the sailors}} stuck {{his head in the}} door and quietly said, [...] "DeLong, she ain't no more." [...] I didn't fully {{understand}} what he meant but I decided to ease the rudder lest it bang against the stops and get stuck. I was a little late but in time enough to keep the rudder from jamming. There was a jolt as the <b>rudder</b> hit the <b>stop,</b> but it was light enough so there was no jamming.|$|R
5000|$|LST-356 {{launched}} pontoons {{and arrived}} off the beaching area at noon. She approached the beach {{under fire from}} shore batteries. Unloading her vehicles swiftly, LST-356, still under fire, retracted from the beach without difficulty suffering neither damage nor casualties. After retrieving her boats and embarking German prisoners of war, {{she returned to the}} rendezvous area. Underway again, LST-356, configured with a [...] "flight deck," [...] began launching the first of four United States Army Piper L-4A [...] "Grasshoppers" [...] for liaison missions. As she increased speed to flank, the first L-4A took off, but narrowly missed the guardrail to the forecastle-mounted 40-millimeter mount. The second took off two minutes later, but it struck the guardrail and fell into the sea off the starboard bow. Executing hard right <b>rudder</b> and <b>stopping</b> her engines, LST-356 swung to starboard to avoid running down the splashed [...] "Grasshopper." [...] Fortunately, a boat from the [...] picked up the Army pilot, and the attack transport took him on board and treated his injuries. Determining the runway to be faulty, Lieutenant Jacquemot and the officer in charge of the planes decided against launching the other two L-4As. For {{the rest of the day}} and throughout the night, LST-356 remained in the vicinity, her crew at general quarters because of periodic enemy air attacks.|$|R
500|$|According to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith {{that he was}} {{attempting}} to [...] "hard-a-port around [...] ", suggesting that he {{was attempting}} a [...] "port around" [...] manoeuvre– to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that {{both ends of the}} ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned {{directly in front of the}} ship's <b>rudder,</b> were simply <b>stopped.</b> This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, Titanic might have missed the iceberg with feet to spare.|$|R
50|$|Whenever braking {{actions are}} issued they are informing pilots that the {{aircraft}} maximum crosswind limits {{may have to}} be reduced on that runway because of reduced surface friction (grip). This should alert pilots that they may experience lateral/directional control issues during the landing roll-out. In a crosswind the pilot tacks into wind to make allowances for the sideways force that is being applied to the aircraft. This sideways force occurs as the wind strikes the aircraft's vertical fin causing the aircraft to weathercock or weathervane. This manifests itself as an angular displacement of the fuselage relative to the runway centreline. This angular displacement is known as drift angle. Just before or upon initial ground contact the pilot must re-align the fuselage to zero the drift angle (i.e. correct it to parallel with the runway's centreline). This re-alignment is accomplished using the rudder flight control surface. As the wheels make contact with the runway surface {{there are a lot of}} side forces and torsion placed on the tyres due to them countering the weathervane effect which continues to try to act upon the aircraft. A combination of the tyres inherent strength and the action of the runway surface friction with the tyres ensure that the pilot can continue to keep the aircraft aligned with the runway as the aircraft decelerates during the landing roll. If however the surface friction is diminished because of contamination then this may upset the balance of forces resulting in insufficient directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. To ensure this does not occur there is a pro-rata reduction in the aircraft's crosswinds limits, which in turn limits the sideways forces acting on the aircraft, thus ensuring sufficient directional control. This is the explanation for approach and landing; for takeoff the converse is true. The rudder applies a force to counter the crosswind forces as the aircraft accelerates down the runway. At the same time the tyres are accommodating these forces through sidewall torsion, and giving grip with the runway surface. As the aircraft transitions from a ground vehicle to a flying vehicle <b>rudder</b> input is <b>stopped</b> by the pilot and the aircraft will weathervane. The subsequent drift angle will allow the aircraft to fly on a straight course.|$|R
5000|$|From the Memoirs of George Albert DeLong, {{helmsman}} of Helena when Juneau was sunk.My {{assignment was}} on the bridge in the pilot house as helmsman. While steering the ship I {{had the opportunity to}} glance out the port holes and I saw the condition of the San Francisco and the Juneau. I remember commenting to one {{of the men in the}} pilot house that the San Francisco looked so beat up that she would be lucky to make it back to Espiritu Santo, but that the Juneau, while she was down by the bow, still looked seaworthy enough to make it back.Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom left the bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. I glanced out the port hole as the bow swung past the line of sight to the Juneau who had been on our starboard quarter in the formation. The ship was swinging at a rapid speed now and I had no idea what was going on.Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I reversed the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying the ship to the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the port hole and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.By this time the Helena was making good time through the water again and picking up momentum heading straight for the cloud. The wheel was still turned hard left and I had no idea where either the Juneau or the San Francisco were. Total silence reigned in the pilot house and on the wings of the bridge.Now it was my turn to shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone was out on the wing of the bridge except me and no one other than myself was talking.Finally, one of the sailors stuck his head in the door and quietly said, [...] "DeLong, she ain't no more." [...] I didn't fully understand what he meant but I decided to ease the rudder lest it bang against the stops and get stuck. I was a little late but in time enough to keep the rudder from jamming. There was a jolt as the <b>rudder</b> hit the <b>stop,</b> but it was light enough so there was no jamming.The people that had gone outside now filled me in with what had happened. The Juneau didn't sink; she was blown up. Everyone had seen pieces of her flying through the sky. The largest piece was reported as one of her five-inch gun mounts flying over the Helena.Captain Hoover wisely decided to save all the ships he could and decided not to stop to look for survivors - no one thought there would be any. Even if there were, the subs might still be around and more ships and men could be lost.|$|R

Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated across from each other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right in the middle of my story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.From that point on he took over the story. He told us that in the early part of his career he had taken special training on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons he felt a little safer when he was on the bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.George A. DeLong ...|$|R
