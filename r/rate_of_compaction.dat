40|$|Experimental {{observations}} are reported of weakening of sediment-like aggregates by addition of hard particles. Sieved mixtures of calcite and halite grains are experimentally compacted in drained pressure {{cells in the}} presence of a saturated aqueous solution. The individual halite grains deform easily by pressure solution creep whereas calcite grains act as hard objects and resist compaction. The fastest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> of the mixed aggregate is not obtained for a 100 % halite aggregate but for a content of halite grains between 45 % and 75 %. We propose that this unusual compaction behavior reflects the competition between two mechanisms at the grain scale: intergranular pressure solution at grain contacts and grain boundary healing between halite grains that prevent further compaction...|$|E

Uniaxial strain rates ranging from 10 - 4 to 1. 0 per sec., are covered for three different grades of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) powder. Four particle size fractions {{of these types of}} 150, 180, 212 and 250 ILm are evaluated.

In order to quantify actual terrain conditions, in situ testing methods are advancing against laboratory testing.

A correlation between CBR values and moisture content values of the backfilling soil of runway strips from earth structure of Žilina Airport was made within the frame of author's research activities. The CBR tests were performed on the clayey gravel specimens, which were prepared in the test cylinders used for a Proctor modified test.

To {{reduce the}} {{pressure}} of rain efflux in the airport, and make full use of the resources of rain, the adjustment relationship between seepage build capacity of the soil surface area and rain convergence is studied. The condition of constraints between surface rain gradient and emissions is analyzed, according to airfield drainage design.

Experiments have been performed to study the influence of infiltration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> density to clay and silty soil. The experimental results show that the soil infiltration rate decreases linearly with the increase of soil compaction, and reduces very fast at the first 30 min of rainfall. It is recommended that the infiltration rate of rainfall on the first 30 min can be used as the design parameter in the drainage design in the airfield. The influence coefficient reflecting the influence of compaction density to soil infiltration rate has been proposed...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from {{experiments}} with granular packings {{in three dimensions}} in microgravity as realized on parabolic flights. Two different techniques are employed to monitor {{the inside of the}} packings during compaction: (1) X-ray radiography is used to measure in transmission the integrated fluctuations of particle positions. (2) Stress-birefringence in three dimensions is applied to visualize the stresses inside the packing. The particle motions below the transition into an arrested packing are found to produce a well agitated state. At the transition, the particles lose their energy quite rapidly and form a stress network. With both methods, non-arrested particles (rattlers) can be identified. In particular, it is found that rattlers inside the arrested packing can be excited to appreciable dynamics by the rest-accelerations (g-jitter) during a parabolic flight without destroying the packings. At low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> a regime <b>of</b> slow granular cooling is identified.

40|$|Subsidence due to peat {{compaction}} {{may have}} important implications in alluvial floodplains, because it leads to wetland loss, land inundation, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. Furthermore, it potentially influences spatial and temporal river sedimentation patterns, and hence the evolution of alluvial floodplains. As {{the vast majority of}} peatlands occur in cold temperate regions, alluvial plains situated in such areas are most susceptible to these implications. To determine which locations within alluvial floodplains are most vulnerable to high amounts of compaction-induced subsidence, it is necessary to quantify compaction and to identify which factors influence the amount and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> peat <b>compaction.</b> For this, we carried out field work in the Cumberland Marshes (east-central Saskatchewan, Canada) guided by the following two questions: (1) how much peat compaction has occurred over the past decades to centuries, and (2) which factors control the amount and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> peat <b>compaction</b> at the same timescale. To address these questions, we used methods involving construction of stratigraphic cross sections, organic-matter content and bulk-density measurements, and radiocarbon dating.

40|$|We {{describe}} in situ {{measurements of the}} compaction of Antarctic snow. At three different sites in Antarctica, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> was measured hourly, over various depth intervals, {{for up to two}} years. These measurements show that compaction at each of the sites occurs through slow, viscous deformation of the snowpack, with no significant contribution from sudden collapse of weak layers. The measured rates of compaction at the coldest site exhibit a strong seasonality, consistent with a temperature-dependent sintering mechanism having activation energy of 70 kJ mol(- 1). At the two warmer sites, activation energies of 80 and 120 kJ mol(- 1) provide slightly better agreement with the observations. Published models of snow compaction underestimate the temperature sensitivity. A good match to our observations is provided by a semi-empirical model, based on rate equations for lattice-diffusion (Nabarro-Herring) creep of material around pores, combined with normal grain growth. This model also provides a theoretical basis for a widely used empirical model of snow compaction. The rate coefficient for lattice-diffusion inferred from our measurements is considerably higher than published values, however, and other creep mechanisms cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|The lens growth {{through life}} is the net result of surface {{accretion}} partially offset by central compaction. Compaction has previously been shown to affect the cortex. The present study examines compaction in the nucleus by measuring the change in dimensions of congenital lamellar cataract with time and by comparing the different dimensions of dominantly inherited lamellar cataract in individuals of different ages in the same family. It is now shown that compaction affects the nucleus at a decreasing rate with increasing age and that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> of lamellar cataracts is faster the greater diameter of the affected lamella. It is concluded that compaction of lens fibres towards {{the centre of the}} lens affects all regions of the cortex and nucleus in youth and that the compaction becomes largely or completely confined to the cortex in middle age and beyond. The shape of the lamellar cataract changes from a lenticular shape in youth to a rounded shape with increasing age. This accounts {{for the development of the}} peripheral divergence of the zones of discontinuity of the cortex, which allows the lens to remain emmetropic with increasing age in spite of changes in surface curvature...|$|E

40|$|Insulin, {{alone or}} in {{combination}} with bovine serum albumin (BSA), was investigated for its effects on cell proliferation and on the proportions of mouse pre-implantation embryos reaching compaction and forming blastocysts during culture in a common basal medium in vitro. Insulin promoted cleavage by 16 - 20 % when added to medium for culture of 2 -cell embryos to morulae, blastocysts and expanded blastocysts over 24, 48 and 72 h. These effects on cell division were supported by increases of 65 - 100 % and 31 - 100 % in the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> and blastocyst formation respectively.

Identical responses to 1 - 7 and 170 nM insulin suggest that the insulin receptor is capable of mediating both of these developmental effects, although similar mediation by an insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) receptor is not excluded. BSA, normally a component of culture media, promoted cleavage between 24 and 48 h of culture as well as compaction and blastocyst formation at 15 gM (1 g L- 1), probably through nutritional support.

40|$|When {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) is {{injected}} into an aquifer or a depleted geological reservoir, its dissolution into solution results in acidification {{of the pore}} waters. As a consequence, the pore waters become more reactive, which leads to enhanced dissolution-precipitation processes and a modification of the mechanical and hydrological properties of the rock. This effect {{is especially important for}} limestones given that the solubility and reactivity of carbonates is strongly dependent on pH and the partial pressure of CO 2. The main mechanism that couples dissolution, precipitation and rock matrix deformation is commonly referred to as intergranular pressure solution creep (IPS) or pervasive pressure solution creep (PSC). This process involves dissolution at intergranular grain contacts subject to elevated stress, diffusion of dissolved material in an intergranular fluid, and precipitation in pore spaces subject to lower stress. This leads to an overall and pervasive reduction in porosity due to both grain indentation and precipitation in pore spaces. The percolation of CO 2 -rich fluids may influence on-going compaction due to pressure solution and can therefore potentially affect the reservoir and its long-term CO 2 storage capacity. We aim at quantifying this effect by using a 2 D numerical model to study the coupling between dissolution-precipitation processes, local mass transfer, and deformation of the rock over long time scales. We show that high partial pressures of dissolved CO 2 (up to 30 MPa) significantly increase the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> by a factor of ~ 50 to ~ 75, and also result in a concomitant decrease in the viscosity of the rock matrix...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} levels of pressure and compaction induced by forest harvesting operations in a Red Latosol (LV) under planted eucalyptus. Undisturbed soil {{samples were collected}} from layers 0 - 3 and 15 - 18 cm and then used in a uniaxial compression test. Sampling was done before and after harvesting operations. Equipment being evaluated included: harvester, feller buncher, forwarder, self-loading adapted tractor, standard truck, wide-tire truck and grapple saw. Average pressures induced by the grapple saw were 320 kPa and 272 kPa, causing compaction in 80 % and 20 % of samples respectively from layers 0 - 3 cm and 15 - 18 cm, which indicates substantial degradation of soil structure in areas where timber is processed. In layer 0 - 3 cm, average pressures induced by the harvester and by the feller buncher were 240 kPa and 263 kPa respectively, while in layer 15 - 18 cm pressures were 234 kPa and 239 kPa respectively. The feller buncher caused higher soil compaction than the harvester in layer 0 - 3 cm, yet in layer 15 - 18 cm they had similar behavior. All timber forwarding equipment led to soil compaction. The wide-tire truck was the forwarding implement promoting the highest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> in both residue conditions.

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of different slope gradient, number of machine passes on skid trails and soil depth on soil compaction. The study was designed as an experiment with the factors including slope gradient, soil moisture, and soil depth on various skid trails and with different number of machine passes. The effects of four slope classes (flat, 10 %, - 10 % and - 20 %), three soil depth classes (5, 15 and 25 cm), and different compaction levels based on various number of machine passes (0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) were evaluated.

Zygotes were produced using conventional in vitro maturation and fertilization procedures. Twenty hours post insemination, the zygotes were denuded and cultured with oviduct epithelial cells in B 2 medium + 10 % estrous cow serum. Starting at 24 hours post insemination, the embryos (n= 657) were evaluated every 6 hours and then were put into different co-culture drops according to their cell number. Starting from 78 hours post insemination, the cleavage rate was evaluated every 12 hours. Embryos were stained with Hoechst 33342 at the compacted morula stage or when they were degenerated, at 162 hours post insemination. Developmentally capable embryos were characterized by a rapid cleavage rate in the first 3 cell cycles and by an extended 8 - to 16 -cell stage. Peak concentrations of 2 -, 4 -, 8 - and 16 -cell stages emerged at 36, 42, 60 and 102 hours post insemination, respectively. Compaction did not occur until 126 hours post insemination. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> was significantly higher in embryos that were at the 2 -cell stage before or at 36 hours post insemination (P < 0. 05).

Time-dependent fluid-assisted mechanisms such as stress-induced dissolution and subcritical crack growth {{play an important role in}} porosity reduction and <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> granular material in nature. Previous compaction creep experiments on loosely packed, well-rounded quartz sand at subcritical effective pressure show that the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> increase with the presence of pore water, effective pressure (confining pressure minus pore pressure), and temperature due to operation of fluid-assisted mechanisms. We have investigated the role of cracking during creep <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> quartz sand by monitoring acoustic emissions (AE). Experiments on water saturated St. Peter quartz sand packs (255 ? 60 []m grain size, initial porosity ~ 32 %) and quartz powder made of disaggregated Arkansas novaculite grains (35 ? 12 []m grain size, initial porosity ~ 40 %) were conducted at a pore fluid pressure of 12. 5 MPa, at effective pressures, P[e], of 15 to 105 MPa, and at temperatures, T, of 24 to 225 ?C. Volumetric strain rates were allowed to decrease to approximately 10 ??s?? before experiments were ended. Our experiments show decelerating creep after application of effective pressure, that volumetric strain, ?, increases approximately linearly with log time, and that ? rates are dependent on P[e] and T. The ratio AE to ? is constant with time at low T and P[e], but at high T and P[e] the ratio decreases with time. We interpret this to indicate that, for higher P[e] and T, there is a gradual transition in the dominant strain mechanism with time from critical crack growth to an acoustically quiet mechanism, such as subcritical crack growth or pressure solution...|$|R

We hypothesize that teratozoospermic sperm influences early embryo development and embryo compaction. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of embryos derived from intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Two hundred thirty-five consecutive ICSI cycles {{were included in the}} study; all treatment was provided at the Cleveland Clinic Fertility Center. Patient cycles were divided by sperm morphology based on Kruger's strict criteria: Group A, embryos where teratozoospermic sperm (0 - 2 % normal) were used for ICSI and Group B, embryos where dysmorphic sperm (5 - 13 % normal) were used for ICSI. All cycles analyzed were of patients doing day 3 embryo transfers. Outcome measures assessed included pronuclear (PN) pattern, syngamy, early cleavage, cell number, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> and blastulation of embryos left in culture and not transferred on day 3. Results A total of 1762 embryos were analyzed. PN patterns were similar in Group A and Group B embryos. No differences were noted in syngamy, cleavage, cell number or blastulation rate. Studying the development of embryos in culture after day 3 transfer revealed a difference in the timeline for compaction. By day 4, 25 % of Group A embryos had compacted compared to 36 % in Group B (P = 0. 0007). There was no difference found between Group A and Group B embryos in regards to blastulation. Conclusions We did not find an association between sperm morphology and clinical outcomes. The impact of teratozoospermia may be masked in ICSI cycles where fertilization, implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rate are the primary outcome measures. However, by examining the timeline of development, we were better able to discern a potential paternal effect at critical transition points from fertilization through activation. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of direct {{numerical}} simulations of travelling waves in dense assemblies of monodisperse spherical particles fluidized by a liquid. The cases we study have been {{derived from the}} experimental work of others. In these simulations, the flow of interstitial fluid is solved by the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) and the particles move {{under the influence of}} gravity, hydrodynamic forces stemming from the LBM, subgrid-scale lubrication forces and hard-sphere collisions. We first show that the propagating inhomogeneous structures seen in the simulations are in agreement with those observed experimentally. We then use the detailed information contained in the simulation results to assess aspects of two-fluid model closures, namely, fluid–particle drag, and the various contributions to the effective stresses. We show that the rates of compaction and dilation of the particle phase in the travelling waves are comparable to {{the rate at which the}} microstructure relaxes, and that there is a pronounced effect of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> on the average collisional normal stress. Although this effect can be expressed as an effective bulk viscosity term, this approach would require the use of a path-dependent bulk viscosity. We also find that the effective fluid–particle drag coefficient can be described well with the often-used closure motivated by the experiments of Richardson & Zaki (Trans. Inst. Chem. Engng vol. 32, 1954, p. 35). In this respect, the effect of the system size for determining the drag requires specific care. The shear viscosity of the particle phase manifests small, but clearly noticeable dependence on the rate of compaction/dilation of the particle phase. Our observations point to the need for higher-order closures that recognize the slow evolution of the microstructure in these flows and account for the effects of non-equilibrium microstructure on the stresses.

40|$|Taphonomic {{analysis}} of Lower and Middle Oxfordian ammonites from the Cracow Upland, southern Poland (localities at Podłęże, Zalas, Młynka) revealed differences in ammonite preservation. The studied ammonites, usually termed as {{external and internal}} moulds, show a more complex state of preservation. In the Middle Oxfordian glauconitic marls, ammonites are preserved as internal moulds with neomorphic calcite shells showing relics of the original internal structure. In the Middle Oxfordian platy peloidal limestones, ammonites are preserved mostly as external moulds, without septal suture, however under microscope might show relics of internal whorls and septa and/or subtle differences in sediment filling phragmocone chambers. In sponge–microbial bioherms and biostromes, ammonite internal moulds have shells, {{which in contrast to}} ammonites from glauconitic marls are not strictly neomorphic ones, but originated by shell dissolution and subsequent filling of moldic porosity by calcite cement. In sponge–microbial nodular limestones, the ammonites are strongly deformed and the outer wall is usually removed by dissolution under pressure. Other important taphonomic differences include the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> (highest in platy limestones), sedimentary infillings, microborings, encrustations and preservation of siphuncular tubes. The majority of the ammonites appear to be phragmocones; aptychi in all facies are rare. Siphuncular tubes are fossilized exclusively in oppeliids, only in specimens from glauconitic marls and platy limestones, although their other taphonomic attributes are different. Tubes seem to have fossilized due to microbially mediated phosphatization that could be favoured by a set of parameters which operated rather at the scale of ammonoid carcasses: closed, poorly oxygenated conditions, and reduced pH.

40|$|Gas {{assisted}} mechanical expression (GAME) utilizes the solubility of supercritical CO 2 in {{vegetable oils}} {{to enhance the}} oil yields of mechanical expression of oil seeds. The general applicability of GAME was demonstrated with experiments with sesame, linseed, rapeseed, palm kernel and jatropha (hulled and dehulled) at 40 °C and varying mechanical pressures (10 – 70 MPa). Furthermore, the influence of moisture content, temperature and CO 2 -pressure on oil yield and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> seedbed <b>compaction</b> was investigated. Yields obtained with GAME were up to 30 wt. % higher than conventional expression at the same effective mechanical pressure and temperature. GAME yields for hulled and dehulled seeds were very similar, despite the lower yields for hulled seeds in conventional expression. Up to 10 MPa CO 2 yield increased significantly with CO 2 -pressure. The displacement of oil by dissolved CO 2 was identified as the major cause of increased oil yields for both hulled and dehulled seeds. The entrainment of oil during CO 2 depressurization is another major cause of increasing oil yield for hulled seeds...|$|R
40|$|Changes in ice-sheet surface {{elevation}} {{are caused by}} a combination of ice-dynamic imbalance, ablation, temporal variations in accumulation rate, firn compaction and underlying bedrock motion. Thus, deriving the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ice-sheet mass change from measured {{surface elevation}} change requires information on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> firn <b>compaction</b> and bedrock motion, which do not involve changes in mass, and requires an appropriate firn density to associate with elevation changes induced by recent accumulation rate variability. We use a 25 year record of surface temperature and a parameterization for accumulation change as a function of temperature to drive a firn compaction model. We apply this formulation to ICESat measurements of surface elevation change at three locations on the Greenland ice sheet in order to separate the accumulation-driven changes from the ice-dynamic/ablation-driven changes, and thus to derive the corresponding mass change. Our calculated densities for the accumulation-driven changes range from 410 to 610 kg/cu m, which along with 900 kg/cu m for the dynamic/ablation-driven changes gives average densities ranging from 680 to 790 kg/cu m. We show that using an average (or "effective") density to convert elevation change to mass change is not valid where the accumulation and the dynamic elevation changes are of opposite sign...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCompaction {{bands in}} {{sandstone}} are laterally-extensive planar deformation {{features that are}} characterized by lower porosity and permeability than the surrounding host rock. As a result, this form of localisation {{has important implications for}} both strain partitioning and fluid flow in the Earth’s upper crust. To better understand the time-dependency of compaction band growth, we performed triaxial deformation experiments on water-saturated Bleurswiller sandstone (initial porosity = 24 %) under constant stress (creep) conditions in the compactive regime. Our experiments show that inelastic strain accumulates at a constant stress in the compactive regime, manifest as compaction bands. While creep in the dilatant regime is characterised by an increase in porosity and, ultimately, an acceleration in axial strain rate to shear failure, compaction creep is characterised by a reduction in porosity and a gradual deceleration in axial strain rate. The global decrease in the rates of axial strain, acoustic emission energy, and porosity change during creep compaction is punctuated at intervals by higher rate excursions, interpreted as the formation of compaction bands. The growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> bands formed during creep is lower as the applied differential stress, and hence background creep strain rate, is decreased. However, the inelastic strain associated with the growth of a compaction band remains constant over strain rates spanning several orders of magnitude (from 10 – 8 to 10 – 5 s– 1). We find that, despite the large differences in strain rate and growth rate (from both creep and constant strain rate experiments), the characteristics (geometry, thickness) of the compaction bands remain essentially the same. Several lines of evidence, notably the similarity between the differential stress dependence of creep strain rate in the dilatant and compactive regimes, suggest that, as for dilatant creep, subcritical stress corrosion cracking is the mechanism responsible for compactant creep in our experiments. Our study highlights that stress corrosion is an important mechanism in the time-dependent porosity loss, subsidence, and permeability reduction of sandstone reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Compaction {{of lower}} layers in the {{fiberboard}} assembly {{has been observed}} in 9975 packages that contain elevated moisture. Lab testing {{has resulted in a}} better understanding of the relationship between the fiberboard moisture level and compaction of the lower fiberboard assembly, and the behavior of the fiberboard during transport. In laboratory tests of cane fiberboard, higher moisture content has been shown to correspond to higher total compaction, greater <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> and continued compaction over a longer period of time. In addition, laboratory tests have shown that the application of a dynamic load results in higher fiberboard compaction compared to a static load. The test conditions and sample geometric/loading configurations were chosen to simulate the regulatory requirements for 9975 package input dynamic loading. Dynamic testing was conducted to acquire immediate and cumulative changes in geometric data for various moisture levels. Two sample sets have undergone a complete dynamic test regimen, one set for 27 weeks, and the second set for 47 weeks. The dynamic input, data acquisition, test effects on sample dynamic parameters, and results from this test program are summarized and compared to regulatory specifications for dynamic loading. Compaction of the bottom fiberboard layers due to the accumulation of moisture is one possible cause of an increase in the axial gap at the top of the package. The net compaction of the bottom layers will directly add to the axial gap. The moisture which caused this compaction migrated from the middle region of the fiberboard assembly (which is typically the hottest). This will cause the middle region to shrink axially, which will also contribute directly to the axial gap. Measurement of the axial gap provides a screening tool for identifying significant change in the fiberboard condition. The data in this report provide a basis to evaluate the impact of moisture and fiberboard compaction on 9975 package performance during storage at the Savannah River Site (SRS) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{permeable}} or {{open system}} will react as a closed system if the rocks implicated are deformed on a timescale that precludes fluid movement. Closed system (“undrained”) deformation therefore {{leads to a}} failure mode dependent change in pore pressure: microcracking (dilatant behaviour) and cataclastic pore collapse (compactant behaviour) will decrease and increase pore pressure, respectively. In the dilatant regime (i. e., in the shallow edifice, 1 km depth) could lead to pore pressure embrittlement and fracturing. Indeed, the experiments of this study show that the pore pressure increases during progressive compaction in a closed system. However, the pore pressure is prevented from reaching the critical value required to promote a dilatant response (i. e., fracturing) for two reasons. First, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> (i. e., porosity decrease) slows as the sample is deformed at a constant strain rate, {{a consequence of the}} decay in effective pressure. Second, the emergence of microcracking as the rock approaches the compactant-dilatant transition acts as a negative feedback and prevents the rock from transiting into the dilatant field. At this point, local porosity increases due to dilatant microcracking and local porosity decreases due to cataclastic pore collapse are balanced and the rock deforms without further changes to porosity or pore pressure. This will prevent potentially destabilising brittle failure deeper in the edifice during the high strain rates that may accompany unrest and, although it precludes the formation of efficient outgassing pathways in the form of fractures, undrained deformation in the compactant regime will prevent a reduction in porosity and permeability and may therefore facilitate lateral outgassing of the conduit into the country rock. We assess the conditions (strain rate and permeability) required for drained or undrained deformation by defining a dimensionless Darcy number. Closed system or undrained deformation is likely commonplace within a volcano (strain rates in the rock adjacent to an active volcanic system can be high and textural heterogeneities can serve as barriers to fluid flow) and therefore forms an important component for a complete understanding of the mechanical response of an edifice to the stress perturbations accompanying unrest...|$|E

This study focuses on the dynamic events following thermal initiation whereby accelerated combustion interacts with confinement. Numerical simulations, based on a model of reactive multiphase mixtures, indicate that the response of energetic material is highly dependent upon thermal/mechanical damage states prior to ignition. These damaged states affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> pressurization, dynamic <b>compaction</b> behavior and subsequent growth to detonation. Variations of the specific surface area and porosity produced by decomposition of the energetic material causes different responses ranging from pressure burst to detonation.
