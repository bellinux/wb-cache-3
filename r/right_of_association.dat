25|$|In the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, as {{elsewhere}} in the Soviet Union, political activity was expressed in various ways, including by organizing groups and clubs independent of the government that had long withheld the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> to any sort of civil organization. Two sets of concerns were particularly prominent in the debates that accompanied the opening of political dialogue in the late 1980s. The first was concern for the ecologic devastation that was so characteristic of Soviet industrial society. The second, and increasingly ascendant concern, revolved around the Moldovan (or Romanian) language and national heritage that many felt had been trammeled by Soviet and Russian domination.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} right of freedom of assembly, there has not {{traditionally}} been positive protection {{of the right of}} freedom of association. The common law has recognised the autonomy of organisations in deciding their membership and legislation has not placed any general controls on the exercise of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>association.</b> The right is generally reflected in the principle of freedom of contract and the relative ease by which companies and trusts can be set up. The right is most regulated in the area of labour relations including the right to join a trade union which achieved statutory recognition in the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the right not to be dismissed or refused employment on the basis of non-membership under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 and the right to claim unfair dismissal on the basis of trade union activity. However, there is no obligation on employers to recognise collective bargaining agreements except in certain very limited circumstances and their role has declined significantly. The right to strike was acknowledged {{for the first time in}} March 2011 by the Court of Appeal. The right not to be unjustly excluded from the exercise of a trade or profession has been recognised by the courts, in a case brought by female horse trainer Florence Nagle against the Jockey Club's refusal to grant her a training licence on grounds of her sex.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} that [...] "the day of street marches is over", warning protesters: [...] "Don't bother {{applying for a}} march permit. You won't get one. That's government policy now!" [...] Liberal parliamentarians crossed the floor defending the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> and assembly. One Liberal MP, Colin Lamont, told {{a meeting at the}} University of Queensland that the premier was engineering confrontation for electoral purposes and was confronted two hours later by an angry Bjelke-Petersen who said he was aware of the comments. Lamont later said he learned the Special Branch had been keeping files on Liberal rebels and reporting, not to their Commissioner, but directly to the Premier, commenting: [...] "The police state had arrived." [...] When, after two ugly street battles between police and right-to-march protesters, the Uniting Church Synod called on the government to change the march law, Bjelke-Petersen accused the clergy of [...] "supporting communists". His attack sparked a joint political statement by four other major religious denominations, which was shrugged off by the premier.|$|E
