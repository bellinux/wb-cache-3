40|$|Liquid {{freshwater}} transports of the shelfbreak East Greenland Current (EGC) and the separated EGC {{are determined}} from mooring {{records from the}} Kögur section north of Denmark Strait between August 2011 and July 2012. The 11 month mean freshwater transport (FWT), relative to a salinity of 34. 8, was 65 [*]±[*] 11 mSv to the south. Approximately 70 % of this {{was associated with the}} shelfbreak EGC and the remaining 30 % with the separated EGC. Very large southward FWT ranging from 160 mSv to 120 mSv was observed from September to mid-October 2011 and was foremost due to anomalously low upper-layer salinities. The FWT may, however, be underestimated by approximately 5 mSv due to sampling biases in the upper ocean. The FWT on the Greenland shelf was estimated using additional inshore moorings deployed from 2012 to 2014. While the annual mean ranged from nearly zero during the first year to 18 mSv to the south during the second year, synoptically the FWT on the shelf can be significant. Furthermore, an anomalous event in autumn 2011 caused the shelfbreak EGC to reverse, leading to a large reduction in FWT. This <b>reversed</b> <b>circulation</b> was due to the passage of a large, 100 km wide anticyclone originating upstream from the shelfbreak. The late summer FWT of − 131 mSv is 150 % larger than earlier estimates based on sections in the late- 1990 s and early- 2000 s.

40|$|The {{reversal}} of estuarine circulation caused by southwesterly wind forcing {{may lead to}} vanishing of stratification and oxygenation of deep layers during the cold season in the Gulf of Finland. Six CTD + oxygen transects (130 km long, 10 stations) were conducted along the thalweg from the western border to the central gulf (21 December 2011 – 8 May 2012). Two bottom-mounted ADCP, near the western border and in the central gulf were installed. A CTD with dissolved oxygen sensor was deployed close to the western ADCP. Periods with typical estuarine circulation were characterized by strong stratification; high salinity, hypoxic conditions and inflow to the gulf in the near bottom layer. Two circulation reversals were observed, in December–January and February–March. The first well-developed reversal event caused the vanishing of stratification and oxygen concentrations that were almost over 270 μmol L − 1 (6 mL L − 1) in the entire water column along the transect; and lasted for about 1. 5 months. Shifts from estuarine <b>circulation</b> to <b>reversed</b> <b>circulation</b> and vice versa were both associated with strong currents (up to 40 cm s − 1) in the deep layer. In the western area of study, near-bottom oxygen conditions strongly depended on salt wedge intrusions (hypoxic water) from the NE Baltic Proper, while {{in the eastern part}} good oxygen conditions caused by reversals remained for a few months.

The ‘National Meteorological Center’. NMC wind data covering the period 1980 – 1988 were used to force the model. Both the seasonal and the high frequency variability were studied. For the first case, a perpetual wind forcing was constructed by instantaneously averaging the wind stresses over the 9 years, and the response was Fourier filtered in order {{to get rid of the}} residual rapid fluctuations. The daily variability was then produced for the test years 1981 and 1987 by making use of the instantaneous forcing. The main features of the wind-driven climatological Tyrrhenian circulation known from data and general circulation modelling were found to be reproduced by this process model. The winter cyclonic circulation induced by the strong positive wind vorticity input evolved into a much weaker, partially <b>reversed</b> <b>circulation</b> in summer months. A mainly northward flux through the strait of Corsica and a horizontally sheared current in the strait of Sicily were found. The rapid fluctuations that the wind was able to induce in the ocean were then studied.

The experimental evidence of the existence of these rapid wind-driven fluctuations is discussed.

40|$|Holocephalans (chimaeras) are a {{group of}} marine fishes {{comprising}} three families: the Callorhinchi- dae (callorhinchid fishes), the Rhinochimaeridae (rhinochi- maerid fishes) and the Chimaeridae (chimaerid fishes). We have used X-ray microcomputed tomography and mag- netic resonance imaging to characterise in detail the nasal anatomy of three species of chimaerid fishes: Chimaera monstrosa, C. phantasma and Hydrolagus colliei. We {{have shown that the}} nasal chamber of these three species is linked to the external environment by an incurrent chan- nel and to the oral cavity by an excurrent channel via an oral groove. A protrusion of variable morphology is present on the medial wall of the incurrent channel in all three species, but is absent in members of the two other holoce- phalan families that we inspected. A third nasal channel, the lateral channel, functionally connects the incurrent nostril to the oral cavity, by-passing the nasal chamber. From anatomical reconstructions, we have proposed a model for the circulation of water, and therefore the trans- port of odorant, in the chimaerid nasal region. In this model, water could flow through the nasal region via the nasal chamber or the lateral channel. In either case, the direction of flow could be <b>reversed.</b> <b>Circulation</b> through the entire nasal region is likely to be driven primarily by the respiratory pump. We have identified several anatomi- cal features that may segregate, distribute, facilitate and regulate flow in the nasal region and have considered the consequences of flow reversal. The non-sensory cilia lining the olfactory sensory channels appear to be mucus-propel- ling, suggesting that these cilia have a common protective role in cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras).

40|$|The Bay of Bengal, a semienclosed {{tropical}} basin {{that comes}} {{under the influence}} of monsoonal wind and freshwater influx, is distinguished by a strongly stratified surface layer and a seasonally <b>reversing</b> <b>circulation.</b> We discuss characteristics of these features in the western Bay during the northeast monsoon, when the East India Coastal Current (EICC) flows southward, using hydrographic data collected during December 1991. Vertical profiles show uniform temperature and salinity in a homogeneous surface layer, on average, 25 m deep but shallower northward and coastward. The halocline, immediately below, is approximately 50 m thick; salinity changes by approximately 3 parts per thousand. About two thirds of the profiles show temperature inversions in this layer. Salinity below the halocline hardly changes, and stratification is predominantly due to temperature variation, The halocline is noticeably better developed and the surface homogeneous layer is thinner in a low-salinity plume that hugs the coastline along the entire east coast of India, The plume is, on average, 50 km wide, with isohalines sloping down toward the coast. Most prominent in the geostrophic velocity field is the equatorward EICC. Its transport north of about 13 degrees N, computed with 1000 dbar as the level of reference, varies between 2. 6 and 7. 1 x 10 (6) m(3) s(- 1); just south of this latitude, a northwestward flow from offshore recurves and merges with the coastal current.

50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>circulation</b> rig setups usually {{consist of}} a support vehicle, an {{auxiliary}} vehicle, {{as well as the}} rig itself. The support vehicle, normally a truck, holds diesel and water tanks for resupplying the rig. It also holds other supplies needed for maintenance on the rig.

Although RC rigs have their own booster and compressor to generate air pressure, extra power is needed which usually isn't supplied by the rig due to lack of space for these large engines. Instead, the engines are mounted on the auxiliary vehicle. Compressors on an RC rig have an output of around 1000 cfm at 500 psi (500 L·s−1 at 3.4 MPa).

5000|$|Diamond {{drilling}} is {{much slower}} than <b>reverse</b> <b>circulation</b> (RC) drilling {{due to the}} hardness of the ground being drilled.

40|$|Estuaries {{are complex}} systems that show {{a variety of}} {{hydrodynamic}} conditions. These conditions are influenced by bathymetry, geometry, climate characteristics, interacting fresh and salt water flows, and mixing effects caused by winds and wind-waves. The interaction between fresh and salt water flows in combination with mixing effects caused by wind and waves give rise to spatial and temporal varying salinity and temperature fields. Gradients in these fields can give rise to density driven circulation. These density driven currents {{play an important role}} in sediment circulation and water quality properties of estuaries. This research focuses on density driven circulation patterns in complex estuarine systems, in which San Francisco South Bay (SFSB) presents an interesting and excellent case study. SFSB can be considered as a unique estuarine system that is influenced by both far-field and local fresh water sources during periods of high fresh water inflow. Fresh water inflow from local sources causes a classic estuarine circulation with a lower salinity landward. In contrast, peak fresh water flows from the far-field sources enter SFSB through the same inlet as through which ocean water enters SFSB, which is exceptional in an estuarine system. As a result, SFSB changes in a reverse estuary, which is normally only found in regions where evaporation rates exceed precipitation and fresh water inflow so that the estuary becomes saltier than the ocean. The research objective of this thesis is to understand the circulation pattern and density dynamics in SFSB, caused by spatial and temporal gradients in salinity and temperature. A 3 D process-based model, Delft 3 D FM, is set up in order to simulate the influences of fresh water, tide and wind, referred to as the driving forces, on the density driven circulation in SFSB. Model results showed that the main drivers of estuarine circulation in SFSB are the tide and the frehs water inflow. The influence of the wind on the density driven circulation is negligilbe. Additionally, it is found that the influence of salinity is dominant over the influence of water temperature on the water density in SFSB. During the majority of the year the fresh water inflow is low. As a result, SFSB is well mixed and a classic estuarine circulation can be observed. However, peaks in fresh water from far-field fresh water sources can drive a temporal <b>reverse</b> estuarine <b>circulation</b> in SFSB. The <b>reverse</b> estuarine <b>circulation</b> and stratification are found to be restricted to the main channel of SFSB.
