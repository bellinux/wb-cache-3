2500|$|Macros {{were used}} to {{customize}} large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers' needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems. This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with IBM's Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine (VM/CMS) and with IBM's [...] "real time transaction processing" [...] add-ons, Customer Information Control System CICS, and ACP/TPF, the airline/financial system {{that began in the}} 1970s and still runs many large computer <b>reservation</b> systems (CRS) <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> card systems today.|$|R
40|$|Many {{automated}} teller machine (ATM) {{networks are}} partially vertically integrated. A group of downstream retail banks own and operate the upstream network switch. The size of the group varies from network to network. The same situation exists in other network businesses, including airline computer <b>reservation</b> systems <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> card networks. Here the author takes as parametric {{the size of the}} group that owns the upstream network, the monopoly structure of the upstream network switch, as well as the size of the downstream industry, all the members of which are connected to the switch. Given these assumptions, the author models the pricing and output behavior of the group of owners as the number of its members varies. The analysis suggests that the more inclusive is the ownership group in a vertically integrated network, the more likely that the network adopts a flat fee (as a function of volume) pricing schedule. Also, the output of the downstream industry initially rises as the ownership group expands, but then contracts as the ownership group includes all of the downstream firms.

50|$|Allowing {{officials}} to assess competence made {{administration of the}} act more subjective, increasing the exclusionary power of the Secretary of Interior and inviting corruption among those {{with an opportunity to}} profit by gaining Indian-owned land. Although the act gave power to the allotee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, provided the harsh economic reality of the time, and lack of access by many Native Americans on <b>reservations</b> to <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> markets, liquidation of Indian-owned lands was almost inevitable. The Department of Interior officials associated with this program expected that virtually 95% of fee patented land would eventually be sold to whites.|$|R

However, the workload of employees are not in accordance with their standard operating procedures as <b>reservation</b> <b>and</b> ticketing employees are supposed to, so that they are experiencing a shortage times to finish the job.

50|$|At {{the time}} (1889), the White Earth Reservation covered 1,093 sq. mi. After the votes were counted, the whites claimed that voting men had {{overwhelmingly}} voted to accept land allotments <b>and</b> have the <b>Reservations</b> surplus land {{sold to the}} whites. After this process, {{only a small portion}} of the White Earth Reservation remained. It was located in the northeast part of the White Earth <b>Reservation</b> <b>and</b> was only a fraction of the original size. All other Minnesota Chippewa <b>reservations</b> were closed <b>and</b> emptied of Native Americans. The rebellion which occurred on the Leech Lake Reservation in 1898 saved Minnesota's Chippewa reservations, including the White Earth <b>Reservation</b> <b>and</b> probably the Red Lake <b>Reservation,</b> <b>and</b> the Chippewa <b>reservations</b> of Wisconsin.|$|R
