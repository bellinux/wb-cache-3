The {{construction}} of fire-fighting and <b>rescue</b> <b>loop</b> {{is an important}} method of preventing fire and explosion rapidly and effectively through reasonable resource allocation and optimization {{which is based on}} the characteristic and status of multi-region fire-fighting and rescue and with major hazard installations as the core. In this paper, the construction mode of fire-fighting and <b>rescue</b> <b>loop</b> focus on one large oil strategic reserves is studied, the fire fighting and rescuing area on the base of the assessment of fire needs for major hazards is established and its extinguishing ability is evaluated. The establishment of this multi-region fire-fighting and <b>rescue</b> <b>loop</b> provides the method of scientific resources deployment and has guiding significance for fire protection cost and fire station layout has a certain reference value.

40|$|DNA looping is {{important}} for gene repression and activation in Escherichia coli and is necessary for some kinds of gene regulation and recombination in eukaryotes. We are interested in sequence-nonspecific architectural DNA-binding proteins that alter the apparent flexibility of DNA by producing transient bends or kinks in DNA. The bacterial heat unstable (HU) and eukaryotic high-mobility group B (HMGB) proteins fall into this category. We have exploited a sensitive genetic assay of DNA looping in living E. coli cells to explore {{the extent to which}} HMGB proteins and derivatives can complement a DNA looping defect in E. coli lacking HU protein. Here, we show that derivatives of the yeast HMGB protein Nhp 6 A <b>rescue</b> DNA <b>looping</b> in E. coli lacking HU, in some cases facilitating looping {{to a greater extent than}} is observed in E. coli expressing normal levels of HU protein. Nhp 6 A-induced changes in the DNA length-dependence of repression efficiency suggest that Nhp 6 A alters DNA twist in vivo. In contrast, human HMGB 2 -box A derivatives did not <b>rescue</b> <b>looping...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe Ndc 80 complex, a conserved outer {{kinetochore}} complex, comprising four components (Ndc 80 /Hec 1, Nuf 2, Spc 24, and Spc 25), constitutes one of {{the core}} microtubule-binding sites within the kinetochore [1 – 3]. Despite this knowledge, molecular mechanisms by which this complex contributes to establishment of correct bipolar attachment of the kinetochore to the spindle microtubule remain largely elusive [1, 2, 4, 5]. Here we show that the conserved internal loop [6, 7] of fission yeast Ndc 80 directly binds the Dis 1 /TOG microtubule-associated protein [8 – 10], thereby coupling spindle microtubule dynamics with kinetochore capture. Ndc 80 loop mutant proteins fail to recruit Dis 1 to kinetochores, imposing unstable attachment and frequent spindle collapse. In these mutants, mitotic progression is halted attributable to spindle assembly checkpoint activation, and chromosomes remain {{in the vicinity of}} the spindle poles without congression. dis 1 deletion precisely phenocopies the loop mutants. Intriguingly, forced targeting of Dis 1 to the Ndc 80 complex <b>rescues</b> <b>loop</b> mutant's defects. We propose that Ndc 80 comprises two microtubule-interacting interfaces: the N-terminal region directly binds the microtubule lattice, while the internal loop interacts with the plus end of microtubules via Dis 1 /TOG. Therefore, our results provide a crucial insight into how the Ndc 80 complex establishes stable bipolar attachment to the spindle microtubule...|$|R

The race starts {{in the same way}} as the Surf Rescue. However, when the craft reaches the first buoy, the driver circles it anti-clockwise. As the craft passes around the right side of the buoy, the crew person, with the lanyard of the <b>rescue</b> tube <b>looped</b> over his body, disembarks into the water. The crew person then proceeds to swim to the second buoy, trailing the rescue tube behind.|$|R

Any errors in this process would result in production of aneuploid progenies, a hallmark of human cancer. The Ndc 80 complex, a conserved outer kinetochore complex, comprising four components, Ndc 80 /Hec 1, Nuf 2, Spc 24 and Spc 25, constitutes one of the core microtubulebinding sites within the kinetochore.

Ndc 80 loop mutant proteins fail to recruit Dis 1 to kinetochores, imposing unstable attachment and frequent spindle collapse.

Therefore, my results provide a crucial insight into how the Ndc 80 complex establishes stable bipolar attachment to the spindle microtubule. In addition, integrity of the Ndc 80 complex is also required for the kinetochore tethering to the SPB during interphase. Loss of Ndc 80 results in kinetochore declustering in the nucleus, and those scattered kinetochores are found to colocalise with cytoplasmic microtubules and the tubulin nucleation factor γ- TuC. Further investigation will be needed to understand how Ndc 80 affects the γ-TuC distribution and/or how Ndc 80 and the γ-TuC participate in the SPBkinetochore anchorage in interphase...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGpr 161 (also {{known as}} RE 2) is an orphan G protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) that is expressed during embryonic development in zebrafish. Determining its biological function has proven difficult {{due to lack}} of knowledge regarding its natural or synthetic ligands. Here, we show that targeted knockdown of gpr 161 disrupts asymmetric gene expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, resulting in aberrant looping of the heart tube. This is associated with elevated Ca 2 + levels in cells lining the Kupffer's vesicle and normalization of Ca 2 + levels, by over-expression of ncx 1 or pmca-RNA, is able to partially <b>rescue</b> the cardiac <b>looping</b> defect in gpr 161 knockdown embryos. Taken together, these data support a model in which gpr 161 plays an essential role in left–right (L–R) patterning by modulating Ca 2 + levels in the cells surrounding the Kupffer's vesicle...|$|R
40|$|The period (per) gene is an {{essential}} component of the circadian timekeeping mechanism in Drosophila. This gene is expressed in a circadian manner, giving rise to a protein that feeds-back to regulate its own transcription. A 69 bp clock regulatory sequence (CRS) has been identified previously upstream of the period gene. The CRS confers wild-type mRNA cycling when used to drive a lacZ reporter gene in transgenic flies. To determine whether the CRS also mediates proper developmental and spatial expression and behavioral rescue, we used the CRS to drive either lacZ or per in transgenic flies. The results show that the CRS is able to activate expression in pacemaker neuron precursors in larvae and essentially all tissues that normally express per in pupae and adults. The CRS is sufficient to <b>rescue</b> circadian feedback <b>loop</b> function and behavioral rhythms in per 01 flies. However, the period of locomoto...|$|R
40|$|Proof-Carrying Code [6] is a {{technique}} that allows one to execute mobile code in a safe way. To produce the proof automatically, Certifying Compilers [7] cab be used. However, proof can only be generated automatically for a restricted set of properties (e. g type safe properties). A proof-transforming compiler (PTC) is a compiler that takes a source proof as input and produces a bytecode proof. Using this approach, we can generate a proof in the source language (which is simpler than generating the proof in the bytecode level) and translate it to bytecode. This project consists of the integration of a proof-transforming compiler for Eiffel into Eiffel Studio. The compiler takes a source proof in XML format and produces the bytecode proof. The source proofs are generated automatically using Ballet. The project will investigate {{the integration of the}} proof-transforming compiler with Ballet. Scope of the work This project will develop a proof translator for Eiffel proof and it will be integrated into EiffelStudio. The compiler will translate the following rules: • assignment, conditional, compositional instructions • <b>loops,</b> <b>rescue</b> rule, remov...|$|R
