5000|$|Since 2002, CollegeSwimming.com has {{produced}} an objective ranking system for Mid-Major, Division I swimming programs. Initiated by Clark Campbell, the poll {{has been used}} to provide attention to teams that were often targeted for elimination ostensibly for Title IX or budgetary <b>reasons.</b> <b>Swimming,</b> along with most other NCAA sports, is fundamentally different in its financial model from the so-called [...] "revenue sports" [...] of basketball and Division I FBS football. The NCAA classifies the latter two sports as [...] "head-count" [...] sports, which means that the total number of players that can receive any athletically-related financial aid from the school is limited. Because a partial scholarship counts fully against the head count, it means that in practice, scholarships are almost always awarded as full grants-in-aid. On the other hand, the NCAA classifies swimming as an [...] "equivalency" [...] sport, meaning that scholarships can be divided among a number of student-athletes. CollegeSwimming.com's definition of a mid-major institution takes this into account. Though the lineup has changed, institutions eligible for the CollegeSwimming.com poll are those institutions that a) are not members of a BCS conference, Mountain West Conference, or Western Athletic Conference; or b) provide fewer than one-half of the allowable scholarships under the NCAA rules.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Reason</b> to <b>Swim</b> is {{the third}} EP of singer/songwriter Joe Brooks and is his first {{independent}} release following his departure from Lava Records/Universal Republic Records. It was released through Fantastic Music LLC in the US on September 6, 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Brooks {{attracted}} enough international {{fans from}} Asia {{and was able}} to sign with Sony in Korea and Malaysia who licensed his A <b>Reason</b> to <b>Swim</b> for release there. To coincide with a media tour of Asia, Brooks ran a charity marathon to raise funds for a mission trip to China. In July 2011, Brooks travelled to China for two weeks {{to be a part of}} the Bring Me Hope Foundation, which focuses on the needs of orphans in China. Afterward, he attended a media tour in Korea to support A <b>Reason</b> To <b>Swim,</b> appearing on national television and Korean publications of Nylon and Teen Vogue.

5000|$|Bud Boogie Beach {{was closed}} {{due to a}} variety of <b>reasons.</b> The <b>swimming</b> area was far from the parking area, making the {{carrying}} of beach bags and floats difficult; the area was not built as a swimming pool, so the mixing of chlorine was done manually and was uneven.|$|R
5000|$|While on {{his tour}} of the United States, Brooks made and sold a select number of limited edition CDs named The Mixtape. The band ran out of copies of A <b>Reason</b> To <b>Swim</b> {{in the middle of}} the tour, so until the new {{shipment}} arrived they sold these special edition CDs. The CD featured a hand-drawn CD jacket and a selection of songs picked by Joe Brooks that were burned onto a writable CD. The Mixtape included a mixture of songs from A <b>Reason</b> to <b>Swim</b> and Constellation Me, as well as a recorded cover of Hallelujah that is not available on iTunes. He continued to tour and released [...] "The Boy & the Broken Machine" [...] on June 1, 2013. On August 11, 2016 he released [...] "I Am Bones".|$|R

40|$|Swimming is a {{physical}} activity performed {{in an environment where}} human beings are not adapted from an evolutionary point of view. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>swimming</b> for humans is considered an ontogenetic movement and not a phylogenetic one such as walking or running on land. Locomotion into the water has some very specific characteristics for the human being, since the body experiences a situation of hydrostatic microgravity which in most cases enables flotation. Flotation capacity is affected by the physicochemical properties of the water (temperature and osmolarity) and by the body characteristics of the immersed person. In this situation: (1) joints no longer experience the load implied by supporting body weight on land, (2) blood flows more easily, and (3) the type of muscular work is basically concentric. Body balance is other important aspects to take into account, especially in swimmers with amputated limbs or limbs paralysis. Finally, the thermoregulatory response of the human body to changes in water temperature is also considered a useful and extended recovery method...|$|R

5000|$|Pentathletes {{usually have}} a {{swimming}} background, which {{is considered to be}} the only pentathlon discipline that cannot be taught at a higher level at an older age. For this <b>reason,</b> good <b>swimming</b> standards are considered to be a [...] "precondition" [...] for participation in Modern Pentathlon. The swimming event is a freestyle race over 200m for men and women with athletes seeded in heats according to their personal best time. A time of 2:30 earns 1000 Pentathlon points. Every 0.33 seconds is worth +/- 4 points and thus the value of each swimming second is worth 12 points. Example: the time 2:32.66 minutes corresponds to 968 points. Forty point penalties are incurred for a false start, failing to touch the wall {{at the end of a}} lap or leaving the pool in an incorrect manner as stipulated in the rules.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} aims to systematically review the determinants and <b>reasons</b> for <b>swimming</b> dropout. The systematic review was conducted through electronic searches on the Web of Knowledge and PsycInfo databases from 2 February to 29 July 2015, using the keywords dropout, withdrawal, motives, reasons, sport, framework-theories, motivation, swim*, review, attrition and compliance. Fifteen studies were found and six were fully reviewed and its data extracted and analysed. Most studies were undertaken in Canada {{and in the}} United States of America (USA), and one {{study was conducted in}} Spain. Most participants were female (65. 74 %), and the main reasons for dropout were ‘conflicts with their trainers’, ‘other things to do’, ‘competence improvements’ failure’, ‘parents, couples or trainers’ pressure’, ‘lack of enjoyment’ and ‘get bored’. This review contributes to the present knowledge on the understanding of dropout in swimming. However, it is necessary to continue researching on this topic, validating measurement instruments and studying the motivational processes related to dropout and persistence. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The <b>reason</b> why <b>swimming</b> pool {{is chosen}} as the {{function}} of the building is due to the climatic condition in Madrid, where it is extremely hot during the summer. By having a public swimming pool, it allows visitors to drop by for refreshment or to relieve themselves from the heat. The name of the building, "Piscina de Madrid" simply means the swimming pool of Madrid, thus everyone in that city, regardless of their race, is very welcomed to visit and experience a very different atmosphere of a swimming pool. The primary concept of the building, which is based on the exterior, is to contrast the past and the modern, as the whole functional building is not entirely new. In order to show a contemporary baroque style, existing building are preserved, concentrating mainly on the interior. The part of the building that is redesigned is the modern cube in between those existing building. The pattern on the cube itself mainly based on the traditional pattern of Madrid which then transformed into a contemporary pattern. The secondary concept is the anti-gravity, which fairly based on the interior of the building. Most of the functional buildings are not flat on the ground, instead they are located in various sizes of floating cubes that are supported by light structure. This concept is inspired by the fact that when people swim, their feet does not touch the ground, hence the anti-gravity concept is created. BDES 1020 (Architecture Studio 102...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} asthma symptoms and of airflow obstruction in amateur swimmers between 8 and 17 years of age, {{as well as to}} assess the awareness of asthma and asthma management among these swimmers, their parents, and their coaches. Methods: Our sample comprised 1, 116 amateur swimmers who completed {{a modified version of the}} International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood written questionnaire, to which questions regarding the <b>reasons</b> to initiate <b>swimming</b> and regarding asthma management had been added. In addition, the participants underwent spirometry prior to a swimming competition. Results: The prevalence of asthma symptoms in the last 12 months was 11. 5 %, and 327 (29. 4 %) of the participants reported "wheezing or whistling" in the past. Of the 223 swimmers who reported "asthma ever" or "bronchitis ever", only 102 (45. 7 %) reported having ever been treated: the most common "treatment" was swimming (in 37. 3 %), and only 12. 7 % used inhaled corticosteroids. Of the 254 participants (22. 7 %) with airflow obstruction, only 52 (20. 5 %) reported having asthma symptoms. Conclusions: Asthma symptoms are present in amateur swimmers, and a considerable number of such swimmers have airflow obstruction without symptoms. It is therefore likely that the prevalence of asthma is underestimated in this population. It is worrisome that, in our study sample, the swimmers previously diagnosed with asthma were not using the recommended treatments for asthma. The clinical implications of these findings underscore the importance of implementing educational measures for amateur swimmers, as well as for their parents and coaches, to help them recognize asthma symptoms and the consequent risks in the sports environment, in order to allow prompt diagnosis and early clinical intervention.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analisar a prevalência de sintomas asmáticos e de obstrução ao fluxo aéreo em nadadores amadores de 8 - 17 anos de idade e avaliar a conscientização sobre asma e tratamento de asma entre nadadores, seus pais e treinadores. MÉTODOS: Uma amostra com 1. 116 nadadores amadores respondeu a uma versão modificada do questionário escrito do International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, ao qual questões sobre as razões de início da natação e sobre gerenciamento de asma foram adicionadas. Os participantes realizaram espirometria antes de uma prova de natação. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de sintomas de asma nos últimos 12 meses foi de 11, 5 %, e 327 participantes (29, 4 %) relataram sibilos no passado. Dos 223 nadadores que relataram asma ou bronquite na vida, somente 102 (45, 7 %) relataram algum tipo de tratamento: natação foi o "tratamento" mais frequente (37, 3 %), e somente 12, 7 % utilizavam corticosteroides inalatórios. Dos 254 participantes (22, 7 %) com obstrução ao fluxo aéreo, somente 52 (20, 5 %) relataram sintomas de asma. CONCLUSÕES: Os sintomas de asma estão presentes em nadadores amadores, e muitos deles têm obstrução ao fluxo aéreo sem sintomas, o que sugere uma subestimação da asma nessa população. É preocupante que os nadadores diagnosticados previamente com asma não utilizassem os tratamentos recomendados para asma. As implicações clínicas desses achados enfatizam a importância da implementação de medidas educacionais para nadadores amadores, pais e treinadores para auxiliá-los no reconhecimento dos sintomas de asma e de seus riscos no ambiente esportivo a fim de permitir o diagnóstico e a intervenção clínica precoce.
