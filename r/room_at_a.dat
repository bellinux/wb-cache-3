A 45-year-old woman was the fourth fatality. She died on July 4.|$|E

25|$|In June 1998, Jackson was consecrated a bishop. Later that year, he and {{his family}} moved to Chesapeake, Virginia, and began holding weekly Bible studies. Out of the weekly meetings, in 1999 Jackson and his wife founded Exodus Faith Ministries, a nondenominational church. The church rented a space in a {{storefront}} location, but was forced to move due to zoning regulations, another incident that helped to shape his view of government overreach. The church rents a <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Chesapeake hotel, where Jackson preaches every Sunday. Jackson founded Chesapeake's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast, now in its 14th year.|$|E
25|$|The park entertained {{over one}} million {{visitors}} per year, {{with as many as}} 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends. Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the emergency <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra ambulances {{to keep up with the}} volume. In September 1989, Great American Recreation negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley-Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million. IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E

25|$|The Main Roads Department {{building}} was purpose-designed, accommodating the Main Roads Department's diverse uses in repetitive and rationalised floor plates. Although offices and administration areas comprised the majority, the building also included: basement car parking; food facilities {{for the staff}} - a large cafeteria with kitchen, kiosk for snacks, and lunch room; staff training facilities - a large, double-height auditorium with the latest projection equipment; a technical and recreation library; a room for displaying models of major Main Roads projects, and; a large air-conditioning plant and a caretaker's flat. The {{building was}} designed to incorporate modern office technology. The department's technical and commercial electronic data processing divisions were accommodated in the basement, including their {{state of the art}} computer, the largest in Queensland at the time. The computer was serviced by a special, independent air-conditioning system, designed to keep the computer <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> constant temperature and humidity, with the heat generated by the computer absorbed by the ornamental ponds {{at the front of the}} building. A system of vacuum message tubes connected all sections of the building and there were telephones and a master clock system, CCTV, a teleprinter system, a Xerox machine, and a dumbwaiter for the movement of files between floors.|$|E

Determined to [...] "undermine the commercial", he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound {{in favor of a}} more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.|$|E

As they increased in number, Algonquin manager Frank Case moved them to the Rose Room and a round table. Initially the group called itself [...] "The Board" [...] and the luncheons [...] "Board meetings". After being assigned a waiter named Luigi, the group re-christened itself [...] "Luigi Board". Finally they became [...] "The Vicious Circle" [...] although [...] "The Round Table" [...] gained wide currency after a caricature by cartoonist Edmund Duffy of the Brooklyn Eagle portrayed the group sitting at a round table and wearing armor.|$|E

[...] The connections among rooms are disjointed: the exit on the left of one room might {{be connected to the}} entrance {{on the same side of}} another. [...] A compass at the bottom of the interface serves as a directional guide, always pointing to the north. [...] The player directs his or her player through the rooms, seeking the exit to the next stage while avoiding traps and collecting items.|$|E
500|$|The {{day began}} with a four-hour {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment and all indications were of an attack in force on 156 Para and 'D' Squadron GPR. At 07:42 the attack started and at 07:50, by now under intense pressure, Brigade headquarters called down artillery fire almost {{on top of their}} own positions which broke up the assault. Attacks continued all morning and a shortage of hand held anti-tank weapons allowed German tanks to safely approach the brigade's positions. The tanks targeted the houses shooting up a <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, forcing the defenders out and into trenches dug in the gardens. Both units managed to hold out, however their situation was officially described as [...] "grim". The numbers of British casualties exhausted all available medical supplies and wound dressings. Those wounded who required urgent treatment were now directed to the Schoonoord Hotel, which was in German hands.|$|E

500|$|It is {{revealed}} that the real Don was alive, and was pretending to be Vijay the whole time. While in the hospital, Don had recovered quickly from his injuries, and had overheard Vardhan/DeSilva's conversation with Vijay. After Vijay's operation, Don had gotten up from the <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> moment when Vardhan and Dr.Ashok were absent and gone to the room where Vijay lay. He had switched places with Vijay and taken Vijay off life support, causing him to die. It is also {{revealed that the}} disc Don had given to the police was fake. Now, with both Vardhan and Singhania removed from his path, Don becomes {{the master of the}} entire Asian drug dealing ring.

500|$|Voorhis {{resisted}} all encouragement {{toward a}} business or management career, {{much to his}} father's disappointment. [...] While attending Yale, he came to believe [...] that [...] "the Christian Gospel is to be taken seriously, and that needless poverty and suffering {{on the one hand}} and special privilege and inordinate power on the other are entirely contrary to its precepts". [...] He later stated that he lacked the faith in his own judgment to leave Yale and get a job in [...] "the real world [...] lay beyond the college walls". [...] However, once he graduated, Voorhis engaged a <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> boarding house and went to work as a receiving clerk, a job he soon exchanged for one as a freight handler. Later in 1923, he was laid off. In 1923 and 1924, he served as a traveling representative for the YMCA in Germany, though his stay was cut short by illness. Suffering from pneumonia, Voorhis spent six weeks recovering in a London nursing home.|$|E
500|$|On {{their return}} to England in September, Mary and Percy moved—with Claire Clairmont, who took lodgings nearby—to Bath, where they hoped to keep Claire’s {{pregnancy}} secret. At Cologny, Mary Godwin had received two letters from her half-sister, Fanny Imlay, who alluded to her [...] "unhappy life"; on 9 October, Fanny wrote an [...] "alarming letter" [...] from Bristol that sent Percy Shelley racing off to search for her, without success. On the morning of 10 October, Fanny Imlay {{was found dead in}} a <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Swansea inn, along with a suicide note and a laudanum bottle. On 10 December, Percy Shelley's wife, Harriet, was discovered drowned in the Serpentine, a lake in Hyde Park, London. Both suicides were hushed up. Harriet’s family obstructed Percy Shelley's efforts—fully supported by Mary Godwin—to assume custody of his two children by Harriet. His lawyers advised him to improve his case by marrying; so he and Mary, who was pregnant again, married on 30 December 1816 at St Mildred's Church, Bread Street, London. Mr and Mrs Godwin were present and the marriage ended the family rift.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the four}} {{families}} gathered {{to celebrate the}} Jewish and Christian holidays. They later established an interfaith Sunday School.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode {{gave a little}} more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations about {{wanting to be a}} woman who succeeds in government, which {{is a step in the}} right direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said the best part of the episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps said most of the show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E
