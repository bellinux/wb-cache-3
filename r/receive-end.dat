40|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the low entry cost of the future public ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) network with shared facilities, it is highly desirable to interconnect different hosts and local area networks (LANs) to the ATM network. The interface between the computer hosts or LANs and the ATM network, commonly called a broadband terminal adaptor (BTA), provides the necessary format conversion for the data packets and the ATM cells. It is conceivable that multiple packets from different virtual channels are interleaved as they arrive at the <b>receive-end</b> BTA. The BTA must have a sufficiently large buffer, called a virtual channel queue (VCQ), to temporarily store the partially received packets. Once a complete packet has been received, it is forwarded to the host or LAN. Whenever the buffer fills with all incomplete packets, a packet must be discarded to make room for others. In this paper, we first study, through computer simulations, the buffer size requirement of a shared-memory VCQ for different numbers of virtual channels at various packet loss probabilities. We then present two different implementation architectures for the shared-memory VCQ, and compare their hardware complexity. The second architecture with linked-queue approach, adopted in our work, requires less buffer and has better scalability to accommodate a large number of virtual channels. Various possible error conditions, such as cell losses in the ATM network and the VCQ buffer overflow, are considered. Corresponding solutions are proposed and included in the VCQ designs. 1...|$|E
40|$|Global on-chip {{interconnects}} are a {{limiting factor}} in modern high performance VLSI systems due to cross-talk noise, signal delay and wire bandwidth constraints. This dissertation addresses these limitations with {{a fundamental change}} in signaling technique â€“ the use of current-mode band-limited pulses. This work is intended to establish the theoretical basis for the proposed current-mode and band-limited signaling scheme while formulating its impact on signal delay, bandwidth and cross-talk noise both analytically and experimentally. A simple yet accurate closed-form delay expression for inverter driven on-chip interconnects with arbitrary <b>receive-end</b> termination is presented. The solution can be used for both resistive and capacitive termination to adequately model current and voltage mode sensing schemes. The model is extended to consider fast input slope and input-to-output capacitance effects of a CMOS inverter. A test chip fabricated in AMI P EXON & 026 WHFKQRORJ LV XVHG WR H[SHULPHQWDOO YHULI WKH SURSRVHG PRGHO Further analysis shows that the model can be used for sub-micrometer process to accurately estimate delay and bandwidth performance of long on-chip interconnects. Additionally, a new power dissipation model for current-mode signaling is developed to understand the design tradeoffs between current and voltage sensing. Based on the results and derived formulations, a comparison between voltage and current mode repeater insertion for long global deep sub-micron interconnects is presented. The performance of band-limited pulse signaling for cross-talk noise reduction in high-density on-chip interconnects is addressed. The proposed signaling scheme uses reduced edge-rate pulses to minimize the effect of high frequency components on crosstalk noise. A simple low-overhead adjustable slew-rate driver/repeater is designed to generate the band-limited pulses. In order to assess the various design tradeoffs imposed by the proposed signaling scheme, a comparative analysis is presented to evaluate performance in cross-talk noise, driver/receiver power dissipation and propagation delay.
