In order to solve the <b>rail</b> <b>pressure</b> overshoot problem of OP 2 S diesel engines, a nonlinear concerted algorithm adding a speed state feedback was investigated.

40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} used {{commonly}} for heavy-duty vehicles {{as a result}} of their high power density and efficiency characteristics. However, one issue with diesel engines is NOx, particulate matter (PM), and noise emissions. Besides the effort for exhaust aftertreatment, one strategy to lower the emissions, as well as reduce overall fuel consumption, is to improve the combustion process by utilizing complex injection rate profiles, e. g. rate shaping. This is due to the fact that engine efficiency and harmful emissions depend on the mixing of the mixture between air and fuel. To illustrate, rate shaping can be used to reduce the combustion rate, enabling low temperature combustion, reducing the peak combustion temperature, and resulting in reduced NOx formation. ^ Traditional common rail fuel systems are used with solenoid injectors. Recently, piezoelectrically-actuated fuel injectors, which have a faster response, have been developed. Piezoelectric fuel injectors deliver fuel more accurately, enabling closely spaced, multiple-pulse injection events each cycle as well as rate shaping. ^ To date, injection rate shaping has been implemented mostly by pressure modulation or by open-loop modulation of the needle lift. In this work, a nonlinear simulation model for single, multiple pulse, and rate-shaped profiles was developed, and experimentally-validated at different operating conditions. Consideration of the flow rate nonlinearity, piezostack hysteresis, and hydro-mechanical dynamics was required to achieve precise modeling of the piezoelectric fuel injector during rate shaping operation. The simulation model was capable of capturing the rate shapes, and showed the modeling errors in injected fuel amount to less than 5. 2 % at 1000 bar, 1200 bar, and 1400 bar <b>rail</b> <b>pressures.</b> ^ The simulation model was then simplified to obtain a reduced-order model. This reduced-order model was used to develop a real-time estimator, which estimates the states of the injector model during rate shaping. The estimator includes different sampling rates for different loops run in parallel on an NI CompactRIO FPGA. The estimator, which is based on the dynamics of the injector, runs at a sampling period of 8 μs. The hysteresis model loop runs at a sampling period of 2 μs. The estimator showed the predicted errors in injected fuel amount to no more than 3 % at 500 bar and 600 bar <b>rail</b> <b>pressures.</b> ^ A model-based closed-loop controller for rate shaping was developed. The control is nonlinear and based on dynamic surface control for non-smooth systems to compensate for the injector nonlinearities. The closed-loop control system was shown to be stable and achieve arbitrarily small tracking errors. The performance of this controller was verified with simulation and experiment. The controller was capable of tracking desired boot-shaped injection profiles.

40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel oil inlet passage diameter, fuel oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel oil inlet passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel oil inlet passage diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large fuel oil inlet passage diameter.

40|$|Improving {{tradeoffs}} between noise, fuel consumption, {{and emissions}} in future internal combustion engines {{will require the}} development of increasingly flexible fuel injection systems which can deliver more complex injection profiles. Piezoelectric injectors {{have the ability to}} deliver multiple, tightly spaced injections in each cycle and continuously variable injection called “rate shaping,” but are highly dynamic systems requiring careful voltage input modulation to achieve sophisticated flow profiles. Closed-loop control could prove to be a key enabler for this technology, but will require on-line estimation of the injected fuel flow rate to be realized because of the inability to measure injector flow rate on an actual engine. ^ This work outlines the development of an 11 state simulation model for a piezoelectric fuel injector and associated driver {{that can be used for}} injector design and control system verification. Non-measureable states of the model are plotted and analyzed, while measurable quantities including injection rate, piezo stack voltage, and piezo stack current are validated against experimental injector rig data for two different <b>rail</b> <b>pressures.</b> ^ This thesis also describes the development of a physics based fuel flow estimator which can be used as feedback to a closed-loop controller. Available measurements of piezo stack voltage and rail-to-injector line pressure are used for dynamic state estimation. Estimator results are compared against both open-loop simulation and experimental data for a variety of profiles at different <b>rail</b> <b>pressures,</b> and show improvement, particularly for more complex multi-pulse profiles. Also the error seen in the simulated injected fuel quantity is generally reduced by over 50 % with the estimator for almost every pulse. Internal states of the estimator are used to evaluate pulse-to-pulse interaction phenomena that make control of multi-pulse profiles difficult to achieve. A hypothesis for pulse-to-pulse interaction is illustrated by dividing the needle lift vs. fuel flow resistance relationship into regimes, and correlating the pulse-to-pulse behavior to the regime switching that occurs for tightly spaced pulses. ^ Finally, this work summarizes the use of estimation algorithms for cycle-to-cycle determination of an injection flow profile capable of being used as feedback for a closed-loop control algorithm. While the estimation equations are complex and require a small time step, a strategy is proposed which captures important estimation feedback during the injection period and delays the integration of state variables across the engine cycle to more efficiently utilize a real-time processor. Lastly, a simplified model is developed to represent the dynamics of simultaneously controlling the quantity of pulses as well as the realized dwell time in between pulses. The model accounts for the coupling between the two, and a control law is developed and refined to provide an overdamped response of both the pulse quantities and realized dwell time, in order to prevent pulse bleeding. Transient response of the controller is shown in simulation and validated against experimental data with good correlation. ^ Overall, this thesis describes a generalizable method to produce cycle-to-cycle virtual measurements of fuel injection for the purpose of subsequent controller design, which could provide a platform for making substantial improvements in combustion related efficiency and emissions by increasing the flexibility of the fuel injection system. ...|$|R
