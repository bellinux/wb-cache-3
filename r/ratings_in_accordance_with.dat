40|$|The {{exponential}} rise in {{the urban}} population of the developing countries {{in the past few}} decades and the resulting accelerated urbanization phenomenon has brought to the fore the necessity to develop environmentally sustainable and efficient waste management systems. Sanitary landfill constitutes one of the primary methods of municipal solid waste disposal. Optimized siting decisions have gained considerable importance in order to ensure minimum damage to the various environmental sub-components as well as reduce the stigma associated with the residents living in its vicinity, thereby enhancing the overall sustainability associated with the life cycle of a landfill. This paper addresses the siting of a new landfill using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and overlay analysis using a geographic information system (GIS). The proposed system can accommodate new information on the landfill site selection by updating its knowledge base. Several factors are considered in the siting process including geology, water supply resources, land use, sensitive sites, air quality and groundwater quality. Weightings were assigned to each criterion depending upon their relative importance and <b>ratings</b> <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> the relative magnitude of impact. The results from testing the system using different sites show the effectiveness of the system in the selection process. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|State-of-the-art flight {{technology}} has restructured {{the task of}} human operators, decreasing the need for physical and sensory resources, and increasing the quantity of cognitive effort required, changing it qualitatively. Recent technological advances have the most potential for impacting a pilot in two areas: performance and mental workload. In {{an environment in which}} timing is critical, additional cognitive processing can cause performance decrements, and increase a pilot's perception of the mental workload involved. The effects of stimulus processing demands on motor response performance and subjective mental workload are examined, using different combinations of response selection and target acquisition tasks. The information processing demands of the response selection were varied (e. g., Sternberg memory set tasks, math equations, pattern matching), as was the difficulty of the response execution. Response latency as well as subjective workload <b>ratings</b> varied <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> the cognitive complexity of the task.

40|$|Two studies, with 1, 056 Ss, {{investigated}} attitudes, knowledge, {{and behavior}} {{with regard to}} several environmental issues. Findings demonstrate that observers tend to perceive a false consensus {{with respect to the}} relative commonness of their own behavioral choices. This phenomenon was replicated across a variety of behaviors. This bias was not related, however, to Ss' trait inferences of the typical person who would choose a particular alternative. Neither estimated commonness of responses nor Ss' own behavioral choice provided an adequate explanation of the obtained differences in attributional inferences. Results show that Ss made more extreme and confident trait ratings about evaluatively positive behavior, irrespective of their own behavioral choice. Ss' trait <b>ratings</b> were <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> L. Ross's (1977) proposal, that Ss make more extreme ratings about dissimilar others, only when Ss rated their own behavioral choice relatively unfavorably compared with the behavi! oral alternative.

40|$|The key concept {{underlying}} the Basel II framework for risk measurement and corresponding equity capital standards {{is that the}} existing regulations pertaining to credit risk will be individualised through reference to the internal <b>ratings</b> of banks. <b>In</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> the regulatory guidelines, Daniel Kaltofen, Stephan Paul and Stefan Stein develop an ‘optimised segmentation approach’ {{with regard to the}} credit default event and measure the implications for regulatory capital requirements. As regards methodology, they present an innovative technique and test it on a data set of approximately 413, 000 motor vehicle loans. By classifying loans according to selective predictors of default, the authors find that banks can achieve significant savings in terms of ensuring a lower regulatory capital requirement. This provides banks with the opportunity to increase lending capacity. The technique overcomes the disadvantages of the more familiar standard methods used in today’s bank risk management and delivers more robust results...|$|R
40|$|Calculations of net {{present value}} {{are based on a}} {{discount}} rate, which requires knowledge about the company’s cost of debt. A common {{way to do this is}} by observing the company’s credit rating, when no credit rating is given it’s possible to use a synthetic rating model based on quantitative data to estimate a credit rating. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase the understanding of which quantitative data, in terms of key figures, that can be used to explain the given credit ratings for companies from the Nordic countries. In developing the model, key figures found significant in previous studies are being tested for whether or not they are applicable for companies from the Nordic countries. Also, this study seeks to find if the addition of variables based on trends adds explanation to credit ratings. An Ordered Probit Model is used on data from all Nordic companies, the financial sector excluded, with credit rating from Standard & Poor’s. The model correctly assigns a credit rating to 57 percent of our sample firms, similar to findings in previous studies. Long term debt leverage and operating margin is found significant in estimation of credit <b>ratings.</b> This is <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> previous studies on other markets, and the only known study on Swedish companies. Furthermore, a company’s total assets is shown to be significant, something that’s only partly displayed in the previous study on Swedish companies. Finally, it’s presented that growth of total income may contribute to the explanation of credit ratings...|$|R
40|$|The single versus dual {{processing}} systems debate {{is one that}} has taken centre stage in the human learning literature. The existence of a propositional reasoning system is not disputed in this thesis, but whether a secondary processing system is required is. This is specifically tackled by investigating the mechanisms which underlie the Perruchet effect, an effect which is used widely to support a dual {{processing systems}} stance. During the Perruchet paradigm a single conditioned stimulus (CS) is partially reinforced by an unconditioned stimulus (US). Conditioned responding is found to dissociate from conscious expectation of the US across runs of reinforced (CS-US) and non-reinforced (CS-noUS) trials. US expectancy <b>ratings</b> typically fluctuate <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> the gambler’s fallacy. Conversely associative mechanisms are postulated to govern the variable strength of the conditioned response (CR). The associative nature of the CR {{is the subject of this}} thesis as it is queried whether a non-associative mechanism might explain this result. Three different methodological strands of the Perruchet effect are studied in this thesis: autonomic conditioning (Chapters 2 and 3), eyeblink conditioning (Chapter 3) and reaction time (RT) studies (Chapters 4 and 5). Additionally transcranial magnetic stimulation (Chapter 5) and computational modelling (Chapter 6) are used as tools to investigate the CR. It is concluded in this thesis that the associative explanation of the CR in the Perruchet effect cannot be dismissed, although the strength of such an effect has perhaps been overstated in previous research. Evidence from autonomic conditioning provides the strongest evidence for an influence of CS-US association in the Perruchet effect as removal of the CS abolishes the CR in this thesis (Chapters 2 and 3). However, evidence from the eyeblink (Chapter 3) and RT (Chapters 4 and 5) variants of the effect suggest that there is undoubtedly a non-associative contribution to these effects. Although the exact mechanistic nature of this non-associative mechanism is unknown, priming is given as a possible explanation, and it is confirmed that such effects cannot be explained propositionally (Chapter 5). Overall a single processing system explanation of learning is not sufficient to explain the Perruchet effect. ESR...|$|R
