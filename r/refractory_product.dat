40|$|Launch Pads 39 A and 39 B {{currently}} use {{refractory material}} (Fondu Fyre) in the flame trenches. This material was initially approved for the Saturn program. This material had {{a lifetime of}} 10 years according to the manufacturer, {{and it has been}} used for over 40 years. As a consequence, the Fondu Fyre at Launch Complex 39 requires repair subsequent to almost every launch. A review of the literature indicates that the gunned Fondu Fyre <b>refractory</b> <b>product</b> (WA- 1 G) was never tested prior to use. With the recent severe damage to the flame trenches, a new refractory material is sought to replace Fondu Fyre. In order to replace Fondu Fyre, a methodology to test and evaluate refractory products was developed. This paper outlines this methodology and discusses current testing requirements, as well as the laboratory testing that might be required. Furthermore, this report points out the necessity for subscale testing, the locations where this testing can be performed, and the parameters that will be necessary to qualify a product. The goal is to identify a more durable refractory material that has physical, chemical, and thermal properties suitable to withstand the harsh environment of the launch pads at KSC...|$|E

50|$|Refractoriness {{under load}} (RUL) {{is a measure}} of the {{deformation}} behavior of <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>products</b> subjected to a constant load and increasing temperature. The temperature range in which the softening occurs is not identical with the melting range of the pure raw material; however it must be reliably determined with the RUL 421 to check the use of <b>refractory</b> <b>products</b> in high-temperature applications. Creep in compression (CIC) refers to the percent of shrinkage of a refractory test piece under a constant load and exposed to a constant high temperature over a long period of time. The creep in compression test is also carried out in the RUL 421 to a maximum temperature of 1700 °C. With its sturdy design, the RUL 421 is well suited for these long-running thermal and mechanical loads.|$|R

50|$|The {{elements}} undergo fractionation during particle formation, due {{to their}} different volatility. Refractory elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm) form oxides with high boiling points; these precipitate the fastest {{and at the time}} of particle solidification, at temperature of 1400 °C, are considered to be fully condensed. Volatile elements (Kr, Xe, I, Br) are not condensed at that temperature. Intermediate elements have their (or their oxides) boiling points close to the solidification temperature of the particles (Rb, Cs, Mo, Ru, Rh, Tc, Sb, Te). The elements in the fireball are present as oxides, unless the temperature is above the decomposition temperature of a given oxide.

To prevent fracture of the lining by thermal stresses, it must be heated by burners to keep its temperature from descending below 700 - 800 °C (the beginning of solidification of the matte). Otherwise, 40 - 80 mm of the lining material will spall. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
