Regarding fleets of servers, you don't have to go back far in time to verify that both configuration management and resources allocation polices have evolved very fast. The server is no longer the gravitation center and the data center consolidates as the new abstraction layer where computation happens. This project presents two platforms in simbiosis, the bootstrapping platform and the exploitation platform. The former is used to bootstrapp and manage the latter, which in turn unifies the data center resources and performs dynamic resources allocation based on demand. The project has a balanced effort of design, development and integration phases. The exploitation platform is larger in terms of number of components however, it just required an integration effort.

Combining administrativ e data on welfare <b>recip</b> ien ts and employm ent in Los Angeles with data from the 1990 decennial census, we show that greater access to local jobs in low-wage ® rms increases the likelihood that welfare <b>recip</b> ients ® nd employm ent in neighbourhood jobs.

In recent years, the goal of US welfare policy has shifted from one of income support to one of economic self-suf ® ciency; to accomplish this objective, current federal welfare programmes have been restructured to move welfare recipients from welfare to work within a ® xed period of time. In this context, numerous studies have examined the supply-side determinants of welfare usage, the characteristics of recipients that in ¯ uence welfare participation.

Then, under assumption of aggregate link FIFO we set out expressions to ensure FIFO for each traffic type (destination type) on the link. We also set out how to maintain FIFO inside a cell while the cell-transmission recipe is employed to model time-varying traffic flows. The method presented is applicable to ordinary, diverge and merge cells and maintains FIFO on cells, links and paths.
