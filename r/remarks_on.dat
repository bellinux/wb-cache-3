5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and <b>Remarks</b> <b>on</b> {{the natural history}} of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|Ninnis died in Streatham on 18 June 1922, aged 84.

5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true {{discoverer}} and labelled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding <b>remarks</b> <b>on</b> Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. They added {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to his <b>remarks</b> <b>on</b> slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.|$|E
5|$|As {{the son of}} {{the filmmaker}} Rakesh, Roshan faced the media {{spotlight}} from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media {{as one of the most}} talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, <b>remarks</b> <b>on</b> his ability to display a range of emotions on screen.|$|E

5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his <b>Remarks</b> <b>on</b> Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.|$|E
5|$|The book's fame spread {{beyond the}} English-speaking world. R. Radau wrote a lengthy review of Un naturaliste dans l'Archipel Malais in the French Revue des Deux Mondes. Radau notes the many deaths from {{volcanic}} eruptions in the archipelago, before explaining {{the similarity of}} the fauna of Java and Sumatra with that of central Asia, while that of the Celebes carries the mark of Australia, seeming {{to be the last}} representatives of another age. Radau describes Wallace's experiences in Singapore, where goods were far cheaper than in Europe – wire, knives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and he <b>remarks</b> <b>on</b> the spread of the Jesuits into the interior, though the missionaries had to live on just 750 francs a year. Singapore was covered in wooded hills, and the sawn wood and rotten trunks supported innumerable beetles for the naturalist to study. The only disagreeable element was that the tigers that roared in the forest devoured on average one Chinese per day, especially in the ginger plantations.|$|E
5|$|The episode borrows {{heavily from}} the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None. The opening scene of the episode {{is similar to that}} of Stanley Kubrik's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois <b>remarks</b> <b>on</b> the estate's beauty, {{wondering}} if television host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E

5|$|The Sedition Act, Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, and Public Order Act 2009 are {{statutes}} which arguably impose {{restrictions on}} {{the freedom of speech}} and expression, as well as the freedom of assembly, in the interests of public order. The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency, which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of Singapore's population. In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin (2005), the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim <b>remarks</b> <b>on</b> a blog and a forum on the Internet; and in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another (2009), a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence, and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties.|$|E
