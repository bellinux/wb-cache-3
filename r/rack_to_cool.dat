40|$|To achieve {{reductions}} in the power consumption of the data center cooling infrastructure, the current strategy in data center design {{is to increase the}} inlet temperature <b>to</b> the <b>rack,</b> while the current strategy for energy-efficient system thermal design is to allow increased temperature rise across the rack. Either strategy, or a combination of both, intuitively provides enhancements in the coefficient of performance (COP) of the data center in terms of computing energy usage relative <b>to</b> <b>cooling</b> energy consumption. However, this strategy is currently more of an empirically based approach from practical experience, rather than a result of a good understanding of how the impact of varying temperatures and flow rates at rack level influences each component in the chain from the chip level <b>to</b> the <b>cooling</b> tower. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a model to represent the physics of this strategy by developing a modeling tool that represents the heat flow from the <b>rack</b> level <b>to</b> the <b>cooling</b> tower for an air cooled data center with chillers. This model presents the performance of a complete data center cooling system infrastructure. After detailing the model, two parametric studies are presented that illustrate the influence of increasing rack inlet air temperature, and temperature rise across the rack, on different components in the data center cooling architecture. By considering the total data center, and each component's influence on the greater infrastructure, it is possible to identify the components that contribute most to the resulting inefficiencies in the heat flow from chip <b>to</b> <b>cooling</b> tower and thereby identify the components in need of possible redesign. For the data center model considered here it is shown that the strategy of increasing temperature rise across the rack may be a better strategy than increasing inlet temperature <b>to</b> the <b>rack.</b> Part II of this work expands on this paper with further parametric studies to evaluate the robustness of this data center cooling strategy, with conditions for optimal strategy deployment. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|Data {{centers have}} {{their roots in}} the huge {{computer}} rooms of the early ages of the computing industry. Early computer systems, complex to operate and maintain, required a special environment in which to operate. Many cables were necessary to connect all the components, and methods to accommodate and organize these were devised such as standard <b>racks</b> <b>to</b> mount equipment, raised floors, and cable trays (installed overhead or under the elevated floor). A single mainframe required {{a great deal of}} power, and had <b>to</b> be <b>cooled</b> <b>to</b> avoid overheating. Security became important - computers were expensive, and were often used for military purposes. Basic design-guidelines for controlling access to the computer room were therefore devised.|$|R
