40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} in <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> is an escalating problem in grain-cropping fields of southeastern Australia {{due to increased}} reliance on herbicides as the main method for weed control. Weed surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2009 to identify the extent of herbicide-resistant <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> across this region to dinitroaniline, and acetolactate synthase- and acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase-inhibiting herbicides. <b>Rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was collected from cropped fields chosen at random. Outdoor pot studies were conducted during the normal winter growing season for <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> with PRE-applied trifluralin and POST-applied diclofop-methyl, chlorsulfuron, tralkoxydim, pinoxaden, and clethodim. Herbicide resistance to trifluralin in <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was identified in one-third of the fields surveyed from South Australia, whereas less than 5 % of fields in Victoria exhibited resistance. In contrast, resistance to chlorsulfuron was detected in {{at least half of}} the cropped fields across southeastern Australia. Resistance to the cereal-selective aryloxyphenoxypropionate-inhibiting herbicides diclofopmethyl, tralkoxydim, and pinoxaden ranged between 30 and 60 % in most regions, whereas in marginal cropping areas less than 12 % of fields exhibited resistance. Resistance to clethodim varied between 0 and 61 %. Higher levels of resistance to clethodim were identified in the more intensively cropped, higher-rainfall districts where pulse and canola crops are common. These weed surveys demonstrated that a high incidence of resistance to most tested herbicides was present in <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> from cropped fields in southeastern Australia, which presents a major challenge for crop producers.

40|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> {{is a major}} weed of {{southern}} Australian cropping systems. Increased knowledge about the germination biology of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> would facilitate development of effective weed control programs. The influence of different environmental factors on seed germination of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was studied. The level of seed dormancy in five different populations, collected from different fields on the same farm, {{was found to be}} similar, suggesting consistency in seed dormancy in populations at a single location. Dormancy release was more rapid for seeds after-ripened in the field compared with those after-ripened dry in a greenhouse. Seed decay was found to be an important contributor to the loss of seeds for this species from the seed bank in the field. Seed decay was much greater for seeds after-ripened on the soil surface compared with buried seed. In contrast, germination {{played an important role in}} the loss of buried seed as compared with surface seed. Regardless of the burial depth, the dormant seed component present at the end of the growing season was quite small (4 to 16 %). Seedling emergence of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in the field was greater (49 %) for seeds buried at 1 cm than for those on the soil surface (16 %). No seedlings emerged from seeds buried at 10 cm. Seed germination of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was tolerant to a wide range of pH and showed some tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. The results indicate <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> is unlikely to become a greater weed problem in no-till compared with cultivated seeding systems. Bhagirath S.

40|$|Glufosinate {{efficacy}} {{was examined}} in two major grass weed species, <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> and sterile oat. Dose–response pot experiments under controlled environmental conditions showed that sterile oat was more successfully controlled by glufosinate than was <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> Glutamine synthetase was extracted from both species and assayed in vitro. Glufosinate readily inhibited glutamine synthetase activity in both species, indicating no differential {{sensitivity to the}} target enzyme. Thin-layer chromatography analysis of glufosinate showed no significant metabolism of glufosinate in either species. Absorption and translocation studies with 14 C-glufosinate showed that the radiolabel was rapidly absorbed into the leaves of both species. However, translocation of radiolabeled glufosinate from the treated leaf to the meristematic regions was significantly greater in sterile oat, whereas translocation {{to the tip of}} the leaf was significantly greater in <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> This indicates that there is a difference in glufosinate distribution between the two species. It is likely that this difference in the distribution of glufosinate results in sterile oat being more easily controlled by glufosinate than is <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> Anuja R.

40|$|Glyphosate {{is widely}} used for weed control in the grape growing {{industry}} in southern Australia. The intensive use of glyphosate in this industry {{has resulted in the}} evolution of glyphosate resistance in <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> Two populations of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> from vineyards, SLR 80 and SLR 88, had 6 - to 11 -fold resistance to glyphosate in dose-response studies. These resistance levels were higher than two previously well-characterized glyphosate-resistant populations of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (SLR 77 and NLR 70), containing a modified target site or reduced translocation, respectively. Populations SLR 80 and SLR 88 accumulated less glyphosate, 12 and 17 % of absorbed glyphosate, in the shoot in the resistant populations compared with 26 % in the susceptible population. In addition, a mutation within the target enzyme 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) where Pro 106 had been substituted by either serine or threonine was identified. These two populations are more highly resistant to glyphosate as a consequence of expressing two different resistance mechanisms concurrently.

40|$|Copyright © 2009 BioOne All rights reservedGlyphosate {{resistance}} was first discovered in populations of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in Australia in 1996. Since then, glyphosate resistance has been detected in additional populations of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> and Italian ryegrass {{in several other}} countries. Glyphosate-resistant <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> and Italian ryegrass have been selected in situations where there is an overreliance on glyphosate {{to the exclusion of}} other weed control tactics. Two major mechanisms of glyphosate resistance have been discovered in these two species: a change in the pattern of glyphosate translocation such that glyphosate accumulates in the leaf tips of resistant plants instead of in the shoot meristem; and amino acid substitutions at Pro 106 within the target site, 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS). There are also populations with both mechanisms. In the case of glyphosate resistance, the target site mutations tend to provide a lower level of resistance than does the altered translocation mechanism. Each of these resistance mechanisms is inherited as a single gene trait that is largely dominant. As these ryegrass species are obligate outcrossers, this ensures resistance alleles can move in both pollen and seed. Some glyphosate-resistant <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> populations appear to have a significant fitness penalty associated with the resistance allele. Field surveys show that strategies vary in their ability to reduce the frequency of glyphosate resistance in populations and weed population size, with integrated strategies—including alternative weed management and controlling seed set of surviving plants—the most effective.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were undertaken at Roseworthy, South Australia from 2006 to 2007 {{to evaluate the}} performance of herbicide application strategies for the control of herbicide-resistant <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in faba bean grown in wide rows (WR). The standard farmer practice of applying postsowing PRE (PSPE) simazine followed by POST clethodim to faba bean grown in WR provided consistent {{and high levels of}} <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> control ($ 96 %) and caused a large reduction (P < 0. 05) in spike production (ù 20 spikes m 22) as compared with nontreated control (560 to 722 spikes m 22). Furthermore, this herbicide combination resulted in greatest yield benefits for WR faba bean (723 to 1, 046 kg ha 21). Although PSPE propyzamide used in combination with shielded interrow applications of glyphosate or paraquat provided high levels of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> control ($ 93 %), these treatments were unable to reduce ryegrass spike density within the crop row (20 to 54 spikes m 22) to levels acceptable for continued cropping. Furthermore, a yield reduction (13 to 29 %) was observed for faba bean in treatments with shielded application of nonselective herbicides and could be related to spray drift onto lower leaves. These findings highlight that shielded interrow spraying in WR faba bean could {{play an important role in}} the management of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in southern Australia.

40|$|The {{inheritance}} and linkage of enhanced metabolism-based herbicide cross-resistance {{was examined}} in a multiple resistant population of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> F₁ hybrids between resistant and susceptible populations showed an intermediate response {{to all the}} four herbicides tested, with no indication of maternal inheritance.

Segregating F₂ populations were selected by high rates of each of the four herbicides to create selected F₂ families. Analysis of the response of these families demonstrated that simazine resistance is linked to chlorotoluron resistance. No other herbicide resistances were linked. Therefore, in this population of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass,</b> at least three separate genes are responsible for metabolism-based cross-resistance.

40|$|Populations of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> with {{resistance}} to glyphosate {{have started to}} become a problem on fence lines of cropping fields of southern Australian farms. Seed of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> plants that survived glyphosate application were collected from two fence line locations in Clare, South Australia. Dose–response experiments confirmed resistance of these fence line populations to glyphosate. Both populations required 9 - to 15 -fold higher glyphosate dose to achieve 50 % mortality in comparison to a standard susceptible population. The mechanism of resistance in these populations was investigated. Sequencing a conserved region of the gene encoding 5 -enolpyruvyl-shikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase identified no differences between the resistant and susceptible populations. Absorption of glyphosate into leaves of the resistant populations was not different from the susceptible population. However, the resistant plants retained significantly more herbicide in the treated leaf blades than did the susceptible plants. Conversely, susceptible plants translocated significantly more herbicide to the leaf sheaths and untreated leaves than the resistant plants. The differences in translocation pattern for glyphosate between the resistant and susceptible populations of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> suggest resistance is associated with altered translocation of glyphosate in the fence line populations.

40|$|In Australia, {{glyphosate}} resistance {{has been}} observed in <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in several states including New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia (SA). Several populations of glyphosate-resistant <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> were analyzed for the inheritance of glyphosate resistance. Eight glyphosate-resistant populations were crossed to the same susceptible population to create first filial generation (F₁) families. Individuals from the F₁ families were subsequently treated with glyphosate. The response to glyphosate of F₁ families from all eight crosses was more similar to the resistant parent than the susceptible parent. Within crosses, dose responses of reciprocal F₁ families {{were not significantly different}} from each other, indicating glyphosate resistance is encoded on the nuclear genome in all eight populations. The level of dominance observed in dose–response experiments ranged from partial to total within the herbicide doses tested. F₁ individuals from five of the populations were crossed with susceptible (S) individuals to create backcross (BC) populations. Most of the families from these BC populations segregated {{in a manner consistent with}} a single gene controlling glyphosate resistance.

The eighth generation of R and the fifth generation of S biotypes survived 6. 72 and died from 0. 11 kg ae ha− 1 glyphosate, respectively. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the role of metabolism in the observed resistance, to study the effect of glyphosate on the activity of 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS; EC 2. 5. 1. 19), and to characterize the EPSPS gene in R and S <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> Neither quantitative nor qualitative difference was observed in the metabolism of 14 C-glyphosate between the biotypes. Activity of constitutive EPSPS decreased more significantly in the S than R biotype in the presence of 5, 50, 500, and 5, 000 µM glyphosate. Inhibition of 50 % (I 50) of the EPSPS activity by glyphosate was more than 90 -fold in S compared to R biotype.

Fragments of the EPSPS gene containing 1, 320 nucleotides were isolated from mRNA of S and R biotypes. A single nucleotide mutation from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) was identified at nucleotide 301 of the truncated EPSPS gene of the R biotype.

The weed seed contamination of cleaned grain and herbicide resistance levels of the recovered weed seeds were examined in a study conducted across 74 farms in the Western Australian grainbelt. Most farmers grew and conserved their own crop seed. The majority of cleaned samples had some level of seed contamination from 11 foreign weed and volunteer crop species, with an average of 62 seeds 10 kg− 1 grain, substantially higher than the 28 seeds 10 kg− 1 grain expected by farmers.

40|$|Electrophysiological {{studies in}} roots of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium rigidum Gaud.) {{seedlings}} {{were conducted to}} elucidate the mechanism involved in the membrane response to the herbicide diclofop. In pea, a dicotyledonous plant insensitive to diclofop, membrane depolarization at varying pH values and herbicide concentrations increased at higher concentrations of the protonated form of diclofop acid (pKa 3. 57). In unbuffered nutrient solution (pH 5. 7), diclofop acid (50 [mu]M) depolarized the membrane potential (Em) in roots of both resistant and susceptible biotypes of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass,</b> whereas recovery of Em occurred only in the resistant biotype following removal of the herbicide. This differential response was correlated with an increase (450 %) {{in the rate of}} acidification of the external solution by the susceptible biotype, and the Em differences between biotypes were eliminated in solutions buffered at pH 5. 0 or 6. 0. In addition, p-chloromercuribenzene-sulfonic acid did not prevent the depolarization of Em by 50 [mu]M diclofop acid. It is concluded that the differential membrane response to diclofop acid in herbicide-resistant and -susceptible biotypes of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> is due to pH differences at the cell wall/plasmalemma interface. Although the membrane response is probably not involved in the primary inhibitory effect of diclofop on plant growth, it could reduce the concentration of the permeant protonated form of the herbicide and possibly could contribute to increased tolerance to diclofop and other weak acid herbicides...|$|E

40|$|Resistance to the {{herbicide}} glyphosate {{is currently}} known {{in at least}} eight weed species from many countries. Some populations of goosegrass from Malaysia, <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> from Australia, and Italian ryegrass from Chile exhibit target site–based resistance to glyphosate through changes at amino acid 106 of the 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene. Mutations change amino acid 106 from proline to either serine or threonine, conferring an EPSPS weakly resistant to glyphosate. The moderate level of resistance is sufficient for commercial failure of the herbicide to control these plants in the field. Conversely, a nontarget site resistance mechanism has been documented in glyphosate-resistant populations of horseweed and <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> from the United States and Australia, respectively. In these resistant plants, there is reduced translocation of glyphosate to meristematic tissues. Both of these mechanisms are inherited as a single, nuclear gene trait.

Moreover, the weed control benefits accruing to this pasture's delayed germination are of sufficient magnitude to offset the low establishment cost and higher biomass production of French serradella.

The coexistence of dormancy and herbicide resistance is suggested to be an adaptation to decades of intense cropping; the plants that are most likely to successfully reproduce are those that exhibit delayed germination (avoiding pre-seeding weed control strategies) and possess herbicide resistance (surviving subsequent in-crop herbicide application). We propose that herbicide resistance status may have a role as a predictive tool in modelling dormancy in L. rigidum at a large spatial scale...|$|E
40|$|The 40 million hectare {{southern}} Australian winter cropping region {{suffers from}} widespread infestation by Lolium rigidum (commonly known as annual or <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass),</b> a Mediterranean species initially introduced as a pasture plant. Along with its high competitiveness within crops, rapid adaptability and widespread resistance to herbicides, the dormancy of its seeds means that L. rigidum {{is the primary}} weed in southern Australian agriculture. With the individuals within a L. rigidum population exhibiting varying levels of seed dormancy, germination can be staggered across the crop-growing season, making complete weed removal virtually impossible, and ensuring that the weed seed bank is constantly replenished. By understanding the processes involved in induction and release of dormancy in L. rigidum seeds, {{it may be possible}} to develop strategies to more effectively manage this pest without further stretching herbicide resources. This review examines L. rigidum seed dormancy and germination from a weed-management perspective and explains how the seed bank can be depleted by control strategies encompassing all stages in the lifecycle of a seed, from development to germination...|$|E
40|$|Lolium rigidum (annual or <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass)</b> is a {{widespread}} annual weed in cropping systems of southern Australia. Seeds exhibit dormancy at dispersal and require a period of dry after-ripening to release dormancy, before germination and emergence can occur. Climate, particularly temperature and rainfall, modulates dormancy level at seed maturity and dormancy release during after-ripening. This study investigated the possibility to predict seed dormancy of L. rigidum over a large scale, based on spatial and climatic factors. Mature seeds were collected from 406 populations across 15 different agronomic zones of the 14 million hectare grain belt of southern Western Australia. For each population, initial dormancy and change in dormancy over a 6 -month period were measured. Logistic growth curve models were then fitted for each population, with the resulting equation used to estimate four further parameters describing dormancy status of the population. These parameters {{were used to determine}} relationships between location in the grain belt and long-term and current-year temperature and rainfall parameters for each population. Although some trends in seed dormancy patterns were found and distinct spatial clusters were clearly evident, our results indicate that climatic parameters alone are unlikely to be a useful predictor for seed dormancy in L. rigidum on a large scale, such as the Western Australian grain belt...|$|E
40|$|Lolium rigidum L. (<b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} and harmful weeds in winter cereal crops. A bioclimatic model for this species was developed using CLIMEX. The model was validated with records from North America and Oceania and used to assess the global potential distribution of L. rigidum under the current climate and under two climate change scenarios. Both scenarios represent contrasting temporal patterns of economic development and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The projections under current climatic conditions indicated that L. rigidum does not occupy the full extent of the climatically suitable area available to it. Under future climate scenarios, the suitable potential area increases by 3 · 79 % in the low-emission CO 2 scenario and by 5 · 06 % under the most extreme scenario. The model's projection showed an increase in potentially suitable areas in North America, Europe, South America and Asia; while in Africa and Oceania it indicated regression. These results provide the necessary knowledge for identifying and highlighting the potential invasion risk areas and for establishing the grounds on which to base the planning and management measures required.

40|$|Lolium rigidum (annual or <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass)</b> is a wide-spread annual weed in {{cropping}} systems of southern Australia, and herbicide resistance in L. rigidum {{is a common}} problem in this region. In 2010, a random survey was conducted across the grain belt of Western Australia to determine the frequency of herbicide-resis-tant L. rigidum populations and to compare this {{with the results of}} previous surveys in 1998 and 2003. Dur-ing the survey, 466 cropping fields were visited, with a total of 362 L. rigidum populations collected. Screen-ing of these populations with the herbicides commonly used for control of L. rigidum revealed that resistance to the ACCase- and ALS-inhibiting herbicides was common, with 96 % of populations having plants resis-tant to the ACCase herbicide diclofop-methyl and 98 % having plants resistant to the ALS herbicide sul-fometuron. Resistance to another ACCase herbicide, clethodim, is increasing, with 65 % of populations now containing resistant plants. Resistance to other herbi-cide modes of action was significantly lower, with 27 % of populations containing plants with resistance to the pre-emergent herbicide trifluralin, and glyphosate, atrazine and paraquat providing good control of most of the populations screened in this survey. Ninety five per cent of L. rigidum populations contained plants with resistance to at least two herbicide modes of action. These results demonstrate that resistance levels have increased dramatically for the ACCase- and ALS-inhibiting herbicides since the last survey in 2003 (> 95 % vs. 70 – 90 %); therefore, the use {{of a wide range of}} integrated weed management options are required to sustain these {{cropping systems}} in the future...|$|E
40|$|Herbicide-resistant weeds are a {{constraint}} to weed {{management in}} many cropping regions around the world. Of the numerous populations of weeds with resistance to herbicides, {{it appears that}} most have resistance due to an alteration to the target enzyme. Use of herbicides with alternative modes of action has relatively easily controlled these populations. In stark contrast are a much smaller number of populations with resistance due to increased rates of herbicide detoxification. These populations may be cross-resistant to herbicides with other modes of action. Such cross-resistance can severely compromise weed control because alternative herbicides may fail on their first use. It has proved extremely difficult to predict cross-resistance due to increased herbicide detoxification in weed populations and hence, difficult to provide adequate advice to growers on how to avoid or manage the problem. Most commonly, such cross-resistance has been selected by certain aryloxyphenoxypropanoate herbicides such as diclofop-methyl and phenylurea herbicides such as chlorotoluron and isoproturon; however, other herbicides can also act as selecting agents {{for this type of}} resistance. Illustrative examples from <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in Australia and blackgrass in Europe demonstrate the breadth of the problem and the magnitude of the effort required to understand increased herbicide detoxification as a resistance mechanism. Recent work has elucidated the genetic basis of cross-resistance in some populations, but this has so far not provided new predictive tools useful to growers. Despite {{more than a decade of}} research aimed at unraveling the complexities of cross-resistance due to increased herbicide detoxification, management of these cross-resistant populations remains a significant challenge...|$|E
40|$|ReportSince Roundup (glyphosate) {{herbicide}} {{was introduced}} in the mid- 1970 's, it has become the most widely used herbicide in the world. Until recently, most of this use was as “between crop applications”. The introduction of Roundup Ready soybeans and corn in 1996 and 1998 respectively has drastically changed the way this herbicide is used. Prior to this new technology, Roundup was used in combination with other weed management practices, including herbicides with different modes-of-action. With Roundup Ready crops, the temptation, and in many cases, the recommendation will be to use this non-selective herbicide alone in some cropping systems. The development of glyphosate-resistant weed populations has been limited compared to resistance problems with other classes of herbicides. Only two grass species (<b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> and goosegrass) have developed glyphosate-resistant populations after 25 years of glyphosate use. In both cases, multiple glyphosate applications were made annually. As glyphosate becomes more widely used than in the past, and with the possibility of multiple applications within a single growing season, selection pressure for developing glyphosate-resistant weed populations will increase. There is little evidence to date that residual herbicides are needed for Roundup Ready soybean or corn weed control programs in New York, so the temptation for growers will be to use Roundup alone. Preliminary results from 1999 showed that 1 / 4 X and 1 / 2 X rates of Roundup Ultra in combinations with a 1 / 2 X rate of Scorpion III (a mixture of flumetsulam, clopyralid, and 2, 4 -D) provided excellent control of annual weeds, including velvetleaf which is not always well controlled with Roundup alone...|$|E
40|$|Trifluralin {{is widely}} used for control of <b>rigid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in no-till grain crops in {{southern}} Australia. Trifluralin must be incorporated into soil to be effective. Several field studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on vertical seed distribution and efficacy and rate of loss of bioavailable trifluralin. Experiments were conducted during the growing seasons of 2004 and 2005 at two sites in South Australia: on the Roseworthy Campus farm of the University of Adelaide and near Minlaton on the Yorke Peninsula. The tillage systems at the Roseworthy Campus were minimum tillage (MinTill) and no-till using narrow points, whereas four direct-drill-seeding systems were used at Minlaton. Plastic beads were spread on the soil surface to simulate weed seeds. MinTill sowing buried more plastic beads than no-till, indicating that greater soil disturbance {{was caused by the}} MinTill system. Trifluralin efficacy was lower under no-till as compared to MinTill. A bioassay, based on response of oat roots, was used to quantify the concentrations of bioavailable trifluralin under different tillage systems. In both years at the Roseworthy Campus, loss of bioavailable trifluralin was greater under no-till than under MinTill; however, the rate of loss under both systems was much faster in 2004 than in 2005. In 2004, bioavailable trifluralin at 12 d after sowing under MinTill and no-till was 55 and 33 % of the initial concentration, respectively. In 2005, bioavailable trifluralin remaining at 23 d after sowing was 86 % under MinTill and 54 % under no-till. At Minlaton in both years, bioavailable trifluralin was greater under tillage systems that provided the highest level of soil disturbance. These results demonstrate that reduced bioavailability of trifluralin occurs in no-till seeding systems, which could result in reduced weed control. Bhagirath S.
