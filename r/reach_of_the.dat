40|$|This {{study is}} based on the Qing {{government}} water level gauge records from Wanjingtan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sanmenxia Gorge in <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River, Muluandian in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Qinhe River, and Shijingshan and Lugou Bridge in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Yongding River. <b>The</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flood season has been reconstructed. <b>The</b> anomaly series <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flood season is assessed using pentad scales. The sequence represents <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River, <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qinhe River, and <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Yongding River. Within the research period, <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qinhe River began the flood season on 6 - 10 July on average, and Yongding River began 16 - 20 July. The Yongding River is relatively stable and <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> rainy season of its upstream was basically maintained in early July. <b>The</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qinhe River show great fluctuation, with discrepancies up to 3 months. The same anomalous fluctuation in <b>the</b> flood season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and the Qinhe River is more obvious after the mid- 19 th century. <b>The</b> delay <b>of</b> flood season by about one pentad in <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River, Qinhe River, and Yongding River is in accordance with the relative low temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loess plateau in summer, while the early flood season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and Qinhe River corresponds with the relative high summer temperature in the Loess Plateau. <b>The</b> beginning time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flood season in the research area is the time the rainy season begins. <b>The</b> length <b>of</b> summer-monsoon rainy season during 1860 s- 1940 s has been reconstructed, as the Little Ice Age transformed to the Modern Warm Period in China. Rapid warming could change the summer rainy season by 2 - 3 pentads. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recombinant techniques.|$|E

The Deepak-class tankers were the first warships constructed for India by Fincantieri. The construction of the ship began in November 2009 at Fincantieri's Sestri Ponente shipyard in Italy. The sea trials started in December 2010. The ship was formally handed over to the Indian Navy on 23 September 2011, in under two years.

But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of radial railway lines from 1839 caused {{a fundamental shift}} away from agricultural supply for London towards large scale house building. Tottenham, Edmonton and Enfield in the north developed first as working-class residential suburbs with easy access to central London. The line to Windsor through Middlesex was completed in 1848, and the railway to Potters Bar in 1850; and the Metropolitan and District Railways started a series of extensions into the county in 1878. Closer to London, the districts of Acton, Willesden, Ealing and Hornsey came within <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tram and bus networks, providing cheap transport to central London.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{land use}} spatial data (1 : 100000) of Landsat TM image in 1995 and 2000, by using GIS technology, the spatial {{distribution}} characteristics and change range of farmland use status quo, farmland expansion and losses of Wuwei oasis and Minqin oasis of Gangsu Province, China {{in the middle}} and lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Shiyang River Basin (short for SYR basin) from 1995 to 2000 were investigated. The results show: 1) farmland is <b>the</b> main type <b>of</b> land use in Wuwei oasis and Minqin oasis, <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> possible transformation between farmland and other types of land use is broad; 2) farmland in middle and lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin increased rapidly, the annual change ratio of farmland of Minqin oasis in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin from 1995 to 2000 was 0. 3282, the annual mean rate <b>of</b> increment <b>reached</b> 2. 18 %; 3) farmland expansion of Wuwei oasis in <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin originated from grassland and unused land, which accounted for 90. 83 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increased farmland areas, and farmland losses were caused by rural residential land expansion and farmland degradation; 4) farmland expansion of Minqin oasis in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin typically resulted from grassland, which accounted for 54. 58 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total expanded areas, and farmland losses were mainly caused by degrading farmland to unused land and barren; 5) buffer analysis shows that there is a significant positive correlation between farmland expansion area in middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin and farmland loss area in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin, and the correlation coefficient is 0. 8856. Increasing each 1 hm 2 farmland of Wuwei oasis in <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin causes about 3 hm 2 farmland loss of Minqin oasis in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SYR basin...|$|R
