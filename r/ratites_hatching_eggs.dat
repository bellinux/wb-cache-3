5000|$|Broiler breeder farms raise {{parent stock}} which produce fertilized <b>eggs.</b> A broiler <b>hatching</b> <b>egg</b> is never sold at stores {{and is not}} meant for human consumption. The males and females are {{separate}} genetic lines or breeds. The chicks they produce will therefore be hybrids or 'crosses'. Since the birds are bred mainly for efficient meat production, producing eggs can be a challenge. In Canada, the average producer houses 15,000 birds that begin laying <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> at 26 weeks of age. Each bird will lay about 150 <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> for the next 34 to 36 weeks.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Hatchery sanitation is an important step in an overall pathogen reduction program for integrated broiler operations. An important part of hatchery sanitation starts with the sanitation of <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs.</b> These eggs are the major source of organic material entering the hatchery and may harbor pathogenic organisms. Egg sanitation is also critical to the production of high quality day-old broiler chicks. Since the discontinuation of the use of formaldehyde fumigation to sanitize <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs,</b> a great deal of research has been conducted to find a suitable replacement. The germicidal effects of ultraviolet (UV) light (radiation) of wavelength 254 nm (UV-C) is well documented. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective at reducing bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds and fungi on a variety of substances and surfaces including eggshells. Therefore, studies were conducted to test the effects of UV irradiation on microbial populations on eggshells and the hatchability of broiler <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs.</b> High intensity UV light (> 14 mW/cm?) was utilized to sanitize incubator flats of 42 <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> in an enclosed cabinet. Laboratory trials were first conducted with broiler <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> to access the effects of UV light on the conductance of the treated eggs and to screen for any detrimental effects on embryo viability or hatchability. No significant differences were found for eggshell conductance, embryo mortality, <b>hatch</b> of fertile <b>eggs</b> (HFE) or internal microbial contamination of eggs. Larger field studies were then conducted at commercial broiler breeder facilities to evaluate the effects of UV irradiation in a commercial setting. Hatchability of UV-treated eggs was significantly reduced in field trial 1, but was significantly improved in trial 2. Microbial contamination of dead embryos and meconium samples from day-old chicks were also evaluated. Significant reductions in numbers of contaminated eggs for UV-treated eggs compared to controls were observed in various trials. It is concluded that UV irradiation of <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> may be a feasible alternative to formaldehyde fumigation...|$|R
