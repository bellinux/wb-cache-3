Drawing on an actual event from the 2013 Blue Mountains Wildfire, this paper highlights how aerial support from a water bombing aircraft was unable to read the existing black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> of a fire appliance because the black <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> coalesced with the black plumes of smoke emitted by the wildfire. Given the extensive technological development {{in the application of}} high visibility markings over the past twenty-one years, the current black and aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> used by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on their fire appliances is far from adequate, doing little to provide optimum safety for fire ground crews in a wildfire. This paper concludes that the current black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> should be replaced with high visibility aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> markings because these have greater visibility for aerial support in a wildfire particularly in the colours of red, lime, yellow, orange or blue. 15 page(s...|$|R
