Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> {{stress is}} the stress that remains stored within a {{structure}} {{as a result}} of its manufacturing history. Often called a locked in stress, it remains when there is no applied load, influences the applied load and changes the structure's expected response to stress. An example of this is that a tensile <b>residual</b> stress will add to an applied tensile load, increasing the maximum tensile stress. Conversely when a compressive load is applied, a tensile <b>residual</b> stress reduces the maximum compressive stress. <b>Residual</b> stress develops in a part during all stages of manufacturing through the action of plastic deformation and thermal inhomogeneities. The final <b>residual</b> stress within a structure can be a combination of the <b>residual</b> stresses created through these stages. Processes that produce significant <b>residual</b> stress in steels include quenching and tempering, rolling, bending and welding. Due to the highly localised thermal input at the weld point, welding produces the largest short range variation in <b>residual</b> stress field. In the immediate region of a weld, the <b>residual</b> stress is dominated by the <b>residual</b> stress from the welding processes: tensile stress in the weld region, becoming compressive further from the weld. Prior <b>residual</b> stress fields can influence the expansion and contraction and thus the final welded <b>residual</b> stress profile. Because <b>residual</b> stress acts on a scale that interacts with applied stresses, it becomes important to know what <b>residual</b> stress is present within a component in order to know the final load acting on the structure. In many situations it is not possible to determine the <b>residual</b> stress within a component directly and an approximation, or best practice, <b>residual</b> stress profile must be used. This can be simple, for example considering the <b>residual</b> stress produced by bending, but the <b>residual</b> stress profile produced in welding is a great deal more complex, depending on weld thickness, geometry, restraint, heat input and is difficult to accurately predict. It is important to have a highly accurate prediction of the <b>residual</b> stress when carrying out processes such as an Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) since this will determine the integrity of a welded joint in its environment. An ECA uses a combination of the applied stress and the <b>residual</b> stress profiles in order to determine the likelihood of growth of a flaw at a particular point in the structure. The <b>residual</b> stress profiles used to make these assessments are conservative and in the case of steel T -butt welds are based on a very narrow range of heat inputs and welding processes. The typical <b>residual</b> stress profile is assumed to be highly tensile which means that an ECA on any flaws in the weld region will indicate potential failure of the welded joint and repair is necessary. One of the factors that may affect the conservatism of these <b>residual</b> stress profiles is the lack of consideration of the overall interaction of the <b>residual</b> stress fields prior to welding. This work experimentally measures the <b>residual</b> stress fields in thick steel plate before and after welding, in both restrained and unrestrained plate, and uses this to consider whether the <b>residual</b> stresses are a result of welding or pre-welding processes and examines how these influence the final <b>residual</b> stress field. The work allows a new consideration of what <b>residual</b> stress fields around highly restrained, thick section welds are: creating a basis for pre-existing <b>residual</b> stress fields to be considered in conjunction with the welding <b>residual</b> stress in ECAs.
