5000|$|R.M. Wade & Co. {{was founded}} by Robert Morris Wade in 1865, fifteen years after he crossed the Oregon Trail as a teenager. In {{the midst of the}} California Gold rush in the year 1855, he arrived in California and set up a supply store in a gold mining camp. Following this, he moved to Salem, Oregon and founded R.M. Wade & Co. The company {{primarily}} sold farming equipment and buggies to agricultural dealers in the state of Oregon. By 1888, it had branches in Tillamook, McMinnville, Salem, Corvallis, Independence, and Portland. Mr. Wade's son-in-law, Edward J. Newbegin (spouse of Susan Wade), became president in 1915. Under his leadership, the company produced the Wade Drag Saw, the predecessor of the common chainsaw, which was sold internationally for several decades. In 1927 R.M. Wade & Co. purchased Multnomah Iron Works, later to become R.M. Wade's subsidiary company, Wade Rain. [...] In 1929, upon the death of Edward J. Newbegin, his son Wade Newbegin became the President of the company, and remained so until 1991. During his time as president, the company distributed the Ford-Ferguson tractor throughout the Northwest, New Holland Farm Equipment, Howard <b>Rotavators</b> and Goulds pumps. During World War II, R.M.

For a two-wheel tractor <b>rotavator</b> this greatly reduces the workload of the operator as compared to a rototiller. These rotavators are generally more heavy duty, come in higher power (4-18 horsepower or 3-13 kilowatts) with either petrol or diesel engines and can cover much more area per hour.

Methods: Tillage operations using three types of rotavators, i. e. rotary-type, crank-type and plow-type, were carried out in a dry field of Korea. The same prime mover tractor was used for driving three types of rotavators, and under several operational conditions, tillage characteristics such as actual working speed, rotavating depth, rotavating width, actual field capacity, flow of tilled soil, soil inversion ratio, and pulverizing ratio were measured. In addition, loads characteristics like torque and required power of Power Take-Off (PTO) shaft were calculated. Results: The average rotavating depth was smaller than the nominal value for all rotavators, and the difference was the greatest in the plow-type <b>rotavator.</b> Nevertheless, the plow-type <b>rotavator</b> showed the largest rotavating depth. The rotavating width was the same as the nominal value of all rotavators.

It was about 10. 0, 9. 6, 9. 4 and 8. 1 tha- 1 in Fatehgarh Sahib, Patiala, Kapurthala and Jalandhar of Punjab, respectively. The paddy straw burning is practiced for early vacant of rice fields for sowing of wheat with conventional tillage and lost with this method average of 33. 66 kgha- 1 available nitrogen, 7. 48 kgha- 1 phosphorous and 65. 85 kgha- 1 potassium. But this quantity returns to the soil with the planting of wheat in the stubbles with happy seeder and <b>rotavator</b> and helps to improve the soil health. The results revealed that the happy seeder (zero tillage) and <b>rotavator</b> (reduced tillage) produced the comparable grain yield to farmer's practice, which are also observed the suitable methods for in-situ management of paddy straw. However, happy seeder is the most efficient method to reduce the expenditure on seed bed preparation with saving the fuel and time and to manage the rice straw and improve the soil productivity. The root mass density was higher in happy seeder and farmer's practice plots at all soil depth than <b>rotavator</b> plots. The maximum root mass was confined to 0 - 15 cm layer of soil.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop an}} analytical model {{that is capable of}} predicting the torque requirements of a <b>rotavator</b> fitted with commercially available L-shaped blades. An analytical approach based on the limit equilibrium analysis was used to develop the proposed model. The proposed model was verified by comparing the model and measured torque requirements at predetermined <b>rotavator</b> blade angular positions from the horizontal for a down-cut <b>rotavator.</b> The study findings indicated that there was an optimum set tillage depth for each <b>rotavator</b> configuration and operational conditions at which the resultant horizontal thrust generated was greatest. This unique depth was influenced by the bite length. The validation of the proposed model showed that the predicted and measured torque requirements, at different angular blade positions from the horizontal, correlated reasonably well for all the set tillage depths. As the depth of tillage increased, however, the curve for the measured torque requirements exhibited a cyclic behaviour after the peak torque requirements value had been recorded. The cyclic behaviour was probably due to the re-tilling and the instability of the tool-frame carrier, which increased with the set tillage depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will afford the designers of active tillage tools {{a better understanding of the}} operations of the <b>rotavator,</b> particularly in deep tillage.

Wheat emergence count and yields were evaluated. Field experiments were conducted in three different agro-ecological regions of Pakistan. Soil types varied from sandy clay loam to clay loam. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was used at all sites. Prior to tillage, base line data for the above related physical properties were collected at three locations and at different depths in each plot. A complete randomized experimental design with three replications was used. Soil bulk density and penetration resistance were significantly affected by the tillage treatment at all three locations. A higher percentage changes in bulk density and in penetration resistance were observed in sandy clay loam than in clay loam soils.

The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. tine cultivator twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by rotovator (CR), mouldboard plow followed by rotovator (MR), disk plow followed by rotovator (DR) and tine cultivator followed by rotovator (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with single box seed drill (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with tine cultivator twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with seed drill and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots tilled with disk plow followed by <b>rotavator.</b> Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were tilled with mouldboard plow followed by <b>rotavator.</b> Sowing by combined seed drill resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with seed drill. Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by <b>rotavator.</b> Similarly, sowing by seed drill and combine drill recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by <b>rotavator</b> resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with tine cultivator twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots tilled with moldboard plow followed by <b>rotavator.</b> The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by <b>rotavator.</b> Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots tilled with disk plow followed by <b>rotavator.</b> Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with seed drill. Plots sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant- 1, soil organic matter and total nitrogen in soil were greater in plots that were sown with a combined seed drill. Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by <b>rotavator</b> (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with tine cultivator followed by <b>rotavator</b> (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with tine cultivator (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by seed drill (SD) and combine drill (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method.

Tillage operations were carried out using each blade with the same prime mover tractor and <b>rotavator</b> platforms in two different soil and Power Take-Off (PTO) speed conditions. During the operations, PTO speed and torque, soil pulverizing ratio and inversion ratio, actual work speed, and rotavating width and depth were measured, and the required power of the PTO shaft, field capacity and flow of tilled soil were calculated to compare the characteristics according to the tillage blade shape. Experimental results show that the rotavating width, actual work speed, field capacity, flow of tilled soil and soil inversion ratio were independent of the blade shape, whereas the rotavating depth and soil pulverizing ratio were influenced by the blade shape according to the soil condition. In the most commonly used tractor gear conditions of L 2 and L 3, the PTO power of the end-sloped blade and narrow blade were almost the same as each other, and significantly lower than the standard blade in the paddy field, whereas {{there were no significant differences}} among blades in the dry field.

40|$|In the Mekong delta of Vietnam, wetland rice is {{the main}} crop. The {{traditional}} rice cropping system with one crop per year changed to a system {{with two or three}} crops per year, and mechanised tillage replaced traditional tillage by water buffaloes. Currently, three tillage systems can be distinguished: dry tillage (ploughing and/or rotovating of the unsaturated field), wet tillage (puddling) or a mix of the two systems. The heavy monsoon rainfall causes many problems and strongly reduces the trafficable and workable periods. Tillage requires a high energy input and time pressure is high due to the short periods between crops. Whenever possible, farmers prefer dry tillage in view of soil structural quality, resistance of the crop to lodging (anchoring) and the experience that the typical soil profile is kept in better condition, resulting in higher yields. Experiments were carried on typical heavy clay soils (near Cantho, Cantho province) comparing the three tillage systems in terms of: quality of the seedbed (aggregate size, smoothness), the structure of the arable layer, bearing capacity of the hardpan, and energy expenditure and timeliness of the tillage operations. It was found that (dry) ploughing with a disk plough had a low energy consumption (about 40 % of that of the <b>rotavator)</b> but produced a very poor seedbed. Additional disk harrowing or rotary tillage was necessary. One pass with the rotary tiller produced a good seedbed. Where secondary tillage operations on dry soil are required, drying of the soil for at least 6 days is needed to achieve an acceptable quality of the seedbed. A good alternative for the assessment of the surface condition of a rice-seedbed is collecting and quantifying the amount or number of clods larger than 80 mm at the surface...|$|E
40|$|This study {{conducted}} design parameter optimization for tillage blade of a crank–type <b>rotavator</b> (45 kW rated power, eight blades). Load, stress, and {{mass of the}} blade were obtained from field tests and a commercial program, and design parameter optimization was carried out with them. Selected design parameters were the heights of front and rear ribs, and thickness of the blade. And objective function was minimizing {{the mass of the}} blade. Optimization for the nominal tillage blade was conducted considering two different cases of thickness profile: constant thickness of tillage blade in the length direction and inclined thickness. In addition, it was conducted in two different cases of safety factor to consider the changes of tillage load depending on the soil characteristics: higher safety factor on the stress than the nominal tillage blade and lower safety factor. From the results of the optimization for the nominal tillage blade, the mass of the blade reduced by 3. 2 % under the same safety factor condition. And results of the optimizations with various conditions showed that higher safety factor increased the mass of the blade. The inclined blade also increased the mass of the blade to have the same safety factor. The results of the sensitivity analysis provided that the design parameter affected most on the stress and mass of the blade was thickness of the blade. Therefore, determining appropriate safety factor and thickness of the blade is important in designing the tillage blade. Design parameters of this study do not affect on the surface area of the blade, which is the important influence factor for the tillage performance. Thus, the process used in this study will contribute to the design of tillage blade in minimizing the mass while having similar tillage performance. Further studies on optimization of the shape of the frame and optimization of geometrical structure of the blade will be needed...|$|E
40|$|Zero tillage and {{controlled}} traffic {{have been proposed}} as means for more productive and sustainable irrigated farming. Both practices affect soil infiltration characteristics and, therefore, should have effects on sprinkler irrigation performance. This study compared water infiltration and runoff in three sprinkler irrigation tests performed on an alluvial loam soil at different times during a maize (Zea mays L.) -cotton (Gossypium hirstium L.) rotation under two soil managements: permanent beds with crop residue retention (PB: planting beds maintained unaltered from year to year) and conventional beds with residues incorporated with tillage (CB: disc and chisel ploughing followed by <b>rotavator</b> pass and bed forming every year). Traffic was controlled and two types of furrows were distinguished in both tillage systems: with (+T) and without (-T) wheel traffic. The irrigation tests were performed on maize at full cover, on bare soil just before cotton sowing and on cotton with 50 % ground cover. Infiltration and runoff were affected notably by both traffic and soil management. The soil under PB infiltrated more water than under CB, and -T furrows more than +T furrows. Considering the combined treatments, -T furrows in the CB system infiltrated more water than +T furrows in the PB system. A sprinkler irrigation model for simulating water application and soil infiltration and runoff was formulated. The model was used to analyse irrigation performance under infiltration characteristic of the CB and PB systems in trafficked and non-trafficked furrows. Five irrigation performance indicators {{were used to assess}} the various combinations of tillage and traffic: Wilkox-Swailes coefficient of uniformity; application efficiency; deep percolation ratio; tail water ratio; and adequacy. The model was used to develop operation diagrams and provided guidelines for making irrigation decisions in the new controlled traffic/permanent bed system and in a standard conventional system. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Limitations {{on water}} {{infiltration}} and soil aeration through compaction processes {{have the potential}} to limit production in irrigated agricultural fields. This project was conducted to determine the impact of sub-soiling with a paraplow (Howard <b>Rotavator)</b> on soil physical properties and processes that are important in affecting soil-water relations and productivity. The paraplow was the subsoiler selected for use in this study because of its ability to loosen the soil at the depth of plowing while producing minimal surface disturbance. The research plots were located on Chernozem and Vertisol soils in the Brown soil zone in the Lake Diefenbaker irrigation district near Birsay, SK. Irrigated and dryland sites were used for comparison. Sub-soiling was able to consistently reduce bulk density of the soil and effects persisted for one to two years under normal precipitation conditions. Excessively wet conditions (2010 and 2011) reduced the effectiveness of the sub-soiling. Tillage induced porosity in the soil was associated with a greater infiltration capacity measured in the field. Yield benefits in crops grown (canola, flax, wheat) from sub-soiling were variable under the wet conditions of 2010 and 2011. A greater benefit was observed under the normal precipitation conditions of 2012 on sites that were paraplowed in 2011. Subsoiling at a depth of 45 cm and a row spacing of 45 cm (manufacturer’s recommended configuration) was more effective than shallower depth and wider row spacing treatments. A significant yield benefit was only observed at the dryland site established in 2011, and limited yield benefit was observed in the irrigated sites. Over the three years of the study, annual yields from sub-soiling were on average about 5 % higher than the un-tilled control. However, yield benefits were variable depending on crop and year. Given an estimated cost of subsoiling of ~$ 30 per acre, a benefit of sub-soiling that lasts one year would produce close to break-even conditions, and sub-soiling benefits that are consistent and last longer than one year are needed to be cost effective...|$|E
40|$|Aims The {{relationship}} between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning {{is among the}} most active areas of ecological research. Furthermore, enhancing the diversity of degraded ecosystems is a major goal in applied restoration ecology. In grasslands, many species may be locally absent due to dispersal or microsite limitation and may therefore profit from mechanical disturbance of the resident vegetation. We established a seed addition and disturbance experiment across several grassland sites of different land use to test whether plant diversity can be increased in these grasslands. Additionally, the experiment will allow us testing the consequences of increased plant diversity for ecosystem processes and for the diversity of other taxa in real-world ecosystems. Here we present details of the experimental design and report results from the first vegetation survey one year after disturbance and seed addition. Moreover, we tested whether the effects of seed addition and disturbance varied among grassland depending on their land use or pre-disturbance plant diversity. Methods A full-factorial experiment was installed in 73 grasslands in three regions across Germany. Grasslands were under regular agricultural use, but varied in the type and the intensity of management, thereby representing the range of management typical for large parts of Central Europe. The disturbance treatment consisted of disturbing the top 10 cm of the sward using a <b>rotavator</b> or rotary harrow. Seed addition consisted of sowing a high-diversity seed mixture of regional plant species. These species were all regionally present, but often locally absent, depending on the resident vegetation composition and richness of each grassland. Important findings One year after sward disturbance it had significantly increased cover of bare soil, seedling species richness and numbers of seedlings. Seed addition had increased plant species richness, but only in combination with sward disturbance. The increase in species richness, when both seed addition and disturbance was applied, was higher at high land-use intensity and low resident diversity. Thus, we show that at least the early recruitment of many species is possible also at high land-use intensity, indicating the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity of species-poor agricultural grasslands. Our newly established experiment provides a unique platform for broad-scale research on the land-use dependence of future trajectories of vegetation diversity and composition and their effects on ecosystem functioning...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} with controlled traffic {{has been}} suggested as one way to improve water infiltration and reduce soil losses in irrigated annual crops in Mediterranean environments, but little research is available. In 2009, we compared two soil-management systems for a maize (Zea mays L.) -cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cropping system in Córdoba (Southern Spain) : permanent beds with crop-residue retention on surface ground (PB) and conventionally tilled beds (tilled with a disc harrow, then a chisel plough and <b>rotavator</b> before bed forming) with residues incorporated into the soil (CB). The soil was a loamy alluvial Typic Xerofluvent. Traffic was controlled and two types of furrows were distinguished in each tillage system: with (+T) and without (-T) wheel traffic. We hypothesized that PB combined with controlled traffic could reduce soil erosion and enhance infiltration compared to CB. The effects on soil erosion caused by sprinkler irrigation or rainfall events were evaluated at field-scale (water application intensities of 0. 26 and 0. 30 mmmin- 1 in Trial 1 and Trial 2, respectively) and with a rainfall-simulator (mini-plots 0. 9 m× 0. 9 m in size and a water application intensity of 1 mmmin- 1), respectively. In irrigation Trial 1 (on bare soil), soil loss in PB+T furrows was 4 gm- 2, about one-ninth that in CB+T furrows. -T furrows did not produce runoff in this trial. In irrigation Trial 2 (on soil covered by a cotton crop), soil loss in CB (59 gm- 2) was double that in PB, and in +T it was about three times that in -T (64 gm- 2 vs. 23 gm- 2). The results obtained using intense simulated rainfall at the mini-plot scale showed similar relative differences to those obtained from the irrigation trials at the field scale, except that the protective effect on the soil of the crop residues in PB was more noticeable than in the irrigation trials. Complementary trials using mini-ring infiltrometers (9. 6 cm in diameter), aimed at characterizing small-scale infiltration variability, i. e., differences between beds and furrows, gave highly variable results, sometimes contradicting those obtained from the mini-plot and field-scale trials. The results are valid for the Mediterranean environment where {{the study was conducted}} but should motivate similar research in other environments where agricultural systems are susceptible to rain- or irrigation-induced soil erosion. © 2011 Elsevier B.
