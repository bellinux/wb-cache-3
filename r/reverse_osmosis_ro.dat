25|$|Saudi Arabia is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of desalinated water in the world. In 2011 the volume of water supplied by the country’s 27 desalination plants at 17 locations was 3.3 million m3/day (1.2 billion m3/year). 6 plants are located on the East Coast and 21 plants on the Red Sea Coast. 12 plants use multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) and 7 plants use multi-effect distillation (MED). Both MSF and MED plants are integrated with power plants (dual-purpose plants), using steam from the power plants {{as a source of}} energy. 8 plants are single-purpose plants that use <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>RO)</b> technology and power from the grid. By far the largest plant in 2012, Jubail II on the East Coast, is a MSF plant built in subsequent stages since 1983 with a capacity of almost 950,000 m3/day that supplies Riyadh. The largest RO plant in 2012 was located in Yanbu on the Red Sea. It supplies the city of Medina and has a capacity of 128,000 m3/day. The MED plants are much smaller. Mecca receives its water from plants in Jeddah and Shoaiba, just south of Jeddah. Ras al Khair, the largest plant of the country with a capacity of 1 million m3/day was opened in 2014, using RO technology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} competing process uses membranes to desalt saline water, principally applying <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>RO).</b> The RO membrane processes use semipermeable membranes {{and applied}} [...] pressure (on the membrane feed side) to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts. Reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes. Desalination processes {{are driven by}} either thermal (e.g., distillation) or electrical (e.g., RO) as the primary energy types. Energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity, plant size and process type. At present the cost of seawater desalination, for example, is higher than traditional water sources, but {{it is expected that}} costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include, but are not limited to, reduction in plants footprint, improvements to plant operation and optimization, more effective feed pretreatment, and lower cost energy sources.|$|E
2500|$|Replacement water {{should be}} of the same source as the aquarium, whether it be <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>RO),</b> {{de-ionized}} (DI), distilled or from a municipal supply, {{in order to avoid}} drastic changes in water chemistry. In cases where one is replacing a tap water-based salt mix with a reverse osmosis-based salt mix, the replacement water should be added slowly {{over the course of several}} hours to avoid sending the aquarium inhabitants into osmotic shock. [...] However, large water changes are not advised under routine circumstances anyway, so this is really irrelevant. Municipal, or tap water, is not recommended for a marine aquarium as it often contains high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and silicates and other dissolved solids which fuel the growth of nuisance algaes, particularly diatoms, which appears as a rust colored powdery algae and grows in the overabundance of silicates present in all tap water. [...] Water filtered by a four-stage process including mechanical, carbon, reverse-osmosis, and de-ionizing components is recommended as this can provide the easiest route to absolutely pure water. [...] Four and Five stage RO/DI filtration units can be obtained for as little as $100 and are a cost effective means of converting tap water into water usable in a marine aquarium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Natural Organic Matter (NOM), {{which can}} be broadly divided into two {{fractions}} of hydrophobic and hydrophilic, is abundant in natural water resources {{and in many ways}} may affect the unit operations in water treatment. It {{plays an important role in}} membrane fouling in the water treatment process. Fouling of membranes decreases the applicability of the membrane process and thus a deeper understanding of membrane fouling is needed. The aims of this study were to investigate rejection NaCl and humic acid as hydrophobic fraction and flux decline behavior with a spiral wound RO membrane at a pilot scale and effect of water pH and conductivity (EC) on fouling and retention of RO membrane. The results showed that flux reduction increased with increasing ionic strength and humic acid concentration and lower pH. the rejection efficiency of organic and salt increased with an increase in pH and a decrease of ionic strength. Generally, rejection of humic acid and salt ranged 98 - 99. 3 % and 95. 8 - 97. 13 % respectively. Permeate salt concentration was also significantly reduced immediately upon exposing membranes to humic acid. The different behavior is most probably caused by the differences in the fouling layers and foulant characteristics as well as by the electro neutrality effect. The improved salt rejection was likely due to Donnan exclusion by humic material close to membrane surfaces.

Polymeric electrospun nanofibrous {{membranes}} {{were investigated}} {{for use in}} water filtration applications. A customized pressure vessel was designed according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) {{to be used to}} test the membrane for its filtration properties. Low pressure filtration was focused on due to previous research that suggested that high pressure water testing of electrospun polymeric nanofibrous filters could decrease the filtration capability by expanding the pore size within the membrane. During testing it was found that this technology does reduce pathogens but will only remove a portion of them per pass, and thus is not adequate for use as a one pass pathogenic filter. The filter was found to be well suited for the reduction in the amount of suspended and dissolved solids, increasing clarity, and reduction of odor. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the electrospun fibrous pads to narrow down on an ideal parameter set that gave the desirable characteristics for the application of filtration. The composition of the polymer, and electrospinning parameters, were also manipulated to give a hydrophilic, or absorbent, membrane to facilitate a low pressure differential for filtration. It was demonstrated that this type of filtration membrane can be manufactured inexpensively while not requiring electricity or other external power source to generate large pressure differentials and flow. This is desirable because it allows this technology to be used in areas where both basic utilities and clean water are limited, for example in remote Africa and India.
