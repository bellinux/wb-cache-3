25|$|Various {{forms of}} the <b>rose</b> <b>cut</b> have been in use since the mid-16th century. Like the step cuts, they were derived from older types of cuts. The basic <b>rose</b> <b>cut</b> has a flat base - that is, it lacks a {{pavilion}} - and has a crown composed of triangular facets (usually 12 or 24) rising to form a point (there is no table facet) in an arrangement with sixfold rotational symmetry. The so-called double <b>rose</b> <b>cut</b> is a variation that adds six kite facets at {{the margin of the}} base. The classic <b>rose</b> <b>cut</b> is circular in outline; non-circular variations on the <b>rose</b> <b>cut</b> include the briolette (oval), Antwerp rose (hexagonal), and double Dutch rose (resembling two rose cuts united back-to-back). Rose-cut diamonds are seldom seen nowadays, except in antique jewelry. Like the older style brilliants and step cuts, there is a growing demand for the purpose of repairing or reproducing antique pieces.|$|E
25|$|Related to the <b>rose</b> <b>cut,</b> and {{of similar}} antiquity, is the mogul cut, {{named after the}} Great Mogul diamond {{that was the most}} famous example of its type. Like the classic <b>rose</b> <b>cut,</b> the mogul cut also lacks a {{pavilion}} and a table facet, and its crown is also composed of triangular facets rising to form a point. But in mogul-cut diamonds the rotational symmetry is normally fourfold or eightfold, and the eight apical facets are girded by two or more additional rings of facets. The modern mogul cut evolved from earlier faceting techniques originally used to disguise internal flaws in very large stones; in the modern day this cut has also become rare, but still finds occasional use where it is less important to showcase a stone's internal clarity, as with the black and internally opaque Spirit of de Grisogono Diamond.|$|E
2500|$|In {{or around}} 1476, Lodewyk (Louis) van Berquem, a Flemish {{polisher}} of Bruges, introduced {{the technique of}} absolute symmetry in the disposition of facets using a device of his own invention, the scaif.

About {{the middle of the}} 16th century, the rose or rosette was introduced in Antwerp: it also consisted of triangular facets arranged in a symmetrical radiating pattern, but with the bottom of the stone left flat—essentially a crown without a pavilion.

2500|$|While {{the round}} {{brilliant}} cut is considered standard for diamond, with its shape and proportions nearly constant, {{the choice of}} fancy cut is influenced heavily by fashion. For example, the step cut baguette—which accentuates a diamond's luster, whiteness, and clarity but downplays its fire—was all the rage during the Art Deco period, whereas the mixed Princess cut—which accentuates a diamond's fire and brilliance rather than its luster—is currently gaining popularity. The princess cut is also popular among diamond cutters: of all the cuts, it wastes the least of the original crystal. Older diamonds cut before ca. 1900 were cut in [...] "primitive" [...] versions of the modern round brilliant, such as the <b>rose</b> <b>cut</b> and old mine cut (see History section).

Due to intensive interspecific hybridizations, modern <b>cut</b> <b>roses</b> are complex tetraploids for which the mode of inheritance is not exactly known. The segregation patterns of molecular markers in a tetraploid mapping population of 184 genotypes, an F 1 progeny from a cross of two heterozygous parents, were investigated for disomic and tetrasomic inheritance. The possible occurrence of double reduction was studied as well. We can exclude disomic inheritance, but while our observations are more in line with a tetrasomic inheritance, we cannot exclude that there is a mixture of both inheritance modes. Two novel parental tetraploid linkage maps were constructed using markers known from literature, combined with newly generated markers. Comparison with the integrated consensus diploid map (ICM) of Spiller et al. (Theor Appl Genet 122 : 489 – 500, 2010) allowed assigning numbers to each of the linkage groups of both maps and including small linkage groups.

25|$|Even {{with modern}} techniques, the cutting and {{polishing}} of a diamond crystal always {{results in a}} dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%.

Rose plants were sprayed by three rates of 0, 0. 3 and 0. 6 g/L calcium in combination with two sources of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO 3) 2. 4 H 2 O) and calcium chelate (Ca-EDTA) before the harvest. The experiment was conducted in 3 replications during 2005 - 2007 in Safi Abad Agricultural Research Center, Dezful. The results revealed that rose yield and flower quality indices at harvest time consisting of flowering stem fresh weight and length and length and diameter of buds were not affected by different rates and sources of calcium. But, vase life of <b>cut</b> <b>rose</b> flowers was increased significantly by 2. 7 and 2. 9 days in 0. 3 and 0. 6 g/L treatments, respectively (P< 0. 01).
