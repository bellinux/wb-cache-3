It is well known that ID-based cryptosystems provide some advantages that traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) cannot achieve.

40|$|A <b>ring</b> {{signature}} <b>scheme</b> provides signer ambiguity {{by hiding}} a signer {{in a ring}} of arbitrary members appropriately. A convertible <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> {{is an extension of}} a <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> that authenticates a signer and proves that a real signer and no one else generated a ring signature. In this paper, we first show that the recent convertible <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> proposed by Jeong et al. [16] is vulnerable to collusion attacks. Second, we present a formal security model for a convertible ring signature with collusion resistance. The security notion of a convertible ring signature is intrinsically different from that of an ordinary ring signature due to the conversion property. For our collusion resistance, we consider full key exposure, that is, even an adversary who knows all secret keys {{will not be able to}} break the collusion resistance. Finally, we construct a novel convertible <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> with collusion resistance and prove the security of the scheme in the presented security model.

50|$|The C5 {{fragment}} 24 {{required for}} the synthesis of the C <b>ring</b> (<b>scheme</b> 3) was prepared from 2,3-dibromopropene (20) by reaction with ethyl acetate (21), n-butyllithium and a copper salt, followed by organic reduction of acetate 22 to alcohol 23 (lithium aluminium hydride) and its TES silylation. Michael addition of 24 with the cyclooctane 19 to 25 with t-BuLi was catalyzed by copper cyanide.

50|$|The {{synthesis}} of the D <b>ring</b> (<b>scheme</b> 6) started from 44 with allylic bromination with copper(I) bromide and benzoyl tert-butyl peroxide to bromide 45. By adding even more bromide, another bromide 46 formed (both compounds are in chemical equilibrium) with the bromine atom in an axial position. Osmium tetroxide added two hydroxyl groups to the exocyclic double bond in diol 47 and oxetane ring-closure to 48 took place with DBU in a nucleophilic substitution. Then, acylation of the C4 hydroxyl group (acetic anhydride, DMAP, pyridine) resulted in acetate 49. In the final steps phenyllithium opened the ester group to form hydroxy carbonate 50, both TES groups were removed (HF, pyr) to triol 51 (baccatin III) and the C7 hydroxyl group was back-protected to 52.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 2001, Rivest et al. rstly {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} ring signatures. A ring signature is a simpli ed group signature without any manager. It protects the anonymity of a signer. The rst scheme proposed by Rivest et al. was based on RSA cryptosystem and certi cate based public key setting. The rst <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> based on DLP was proposed by Abe, Ohkubo, and Suzuki. Their scheme is also based on the general certi cate-based public key setting too. In 2002, Zhang and Kim proposed a new ID-based <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> using pairings. Later Lin and Wu proposed a more e cient ID-based <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme.</b> Both these schemes have some inconsistency in computational aspect.

40|$|In a <b>ring</b> {{signature}} <b>scheme,</b> a user selects {{an arbitrary}} ring {{to be able}} to sign a message on behalf of the ring without revealing the signer’s identity. Whistle-blowers especially find this useful. To date, various <b>ring</b> signature <b>schemes</b> have been proposed, all considered to be secure as existentially unforgeable with respect to insider corruption; that is, an adversary who chooses ring-message pairs for which he requests signatures, corrupts honest users, and obtains their signing keys can not produce forgeries for new ring-message pairs. Lattice-based <b>ring</b> signature <b>schemes</b> offer lower computational overhead and security from quantum attacks. In this paper, we offer a lattice-based scheme. We begin by showing that the existing <b>ring</b> signature <b>schemes</b> are not sufficiently secure, because existential unforgeability still permits a signer to potentially produce a new signature on previously signed messages. Furthermore, we show that existing <b>ring</b> signature <b>schemes</b> from lattices are not even existentially unforgeable with respect to insider corruption. We then improve previous schemes by applying, for the first time, the concept of strong unforgeability with respect to insider corruption to a <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme</b> in lattices. This offers more security than any previous ring signature scheme: adversaries cannot produce new signatures for any ring-message pair, including previously signed ring-message pairs...|$|R
50|$|The {{modified}} Danheiser benzannulation {{allows the}} synthesis of polycyclic aromatic and heteroaromatic systems. This also includes napthalenes, benzofurans and indoles. This second generation aromatic annulation is achieved by irradiation of a solution of acetylene and a vinyl or aryl α-diazo ketone in dichloroethane. This reaction utilizes the photochemical Wolff rearrangement of a diazoketone to generate an aryl or vinylketene. These ketene intermediates cannot be isolated due to their high reactivity to form diketenes. These rearrangements are performed {{in the presence of}} unsaturated compounds which undergo 2+2 cycloadditions with the in situ generated ketenes. When ketenes are formed in the presence of alkynes they proceed through pericyclic reactions to generate a substituted aromatic <b>ring</b> (<b>Scheme</b> 2). Avoiding the use of the high energy cyclobutenone starting materials provides access to a wider variety of substituted aromatic compounds.|$|E

40|$|For {{applications}} requiring linkability and anonymity, {{researchers have}} proposed linkable <b>ring</b> signature <b>schemes</b> by adding linkability to the <b>ring</b> signature <b>scheme.</b> However, linkability may cause a traceability problem, damaging anonymity.

The analysis {{is based on}} a time series interview survey for the period 1989 - 1990, and a multivariate model is developed to isolate factors that determine users' attitudes towards tolls. The results reveals that although a majority of commuters oppose the toll system, the gap between those who are against and those who are in favor of the toll ring system is narrowing as the years go by. The paper concludes that in order to achieve greater acceptability of tolling as a mean of financing infrastructure, a wider range of marketing effort is required.
