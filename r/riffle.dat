5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} sleight of hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, <b>Riffle</b> Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several sleight of hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the Card Table from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), {{emphasized the importance of}} incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographical}} distribution of {{many species of}} invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area. Viviparid snails and water scorpions (of the genus Nepidae) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay. Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around Brockham and the tributaries which run over the Wealden Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies, caddisflies, fast swimming mayflies and <b>riffle</b> beetles.|$|E
25|$|Catfishes of {{the genus}} Akysis are small cryptically-coloured species. Akysis are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats. Most species {{typically}} inhabit clear swift-flowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates. Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers. In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris, in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis, or in shallow <b>riffle</b> areas under coarse gravel or larger stones. Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The creek {{has been}} stocked with {{non-native}} Brown trout (Salmo trutta) by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Fisheries since 1955. Stillwater {{students have been}} monitoring water quality in Brown's Creek since 1998. Recently there is a controversy where brown trout proponents are concerned that native beaver (Castor canadensis) dams are warming water temperatures and acting as an impediment to trout passage. However, the plan to set lethal traps to kill the beavers is controversial {{as the presence of}} beaver dams has been shown in scientific studies {{to increase the number of}} brown trout, their size, or both, in the Sierra Nevada and also in a study of small streams in brown trout's native Sweden, that found that the fish were larger in beaver ponds compared with those in <b>riffle</b> sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. Deep water in beaver ponds provides critical winter refuge from ice in small streams like Brown's Creek. Also, as beaver dams raise the groundwater table, a larger hyporheic zone is created which may be important to trout spawning.|$|E

25|$|Beaver ponds {{have been}} shown to have a {{beneficial}} effect on trout and salmon populations. Many authors believe that the decline of salmonid fishes is related to the decline in beaver populations. Research in the Stillaguamish River basin in Washington found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. This study also found that beaver ponds increased smolt salmon production 80 times more than the placement of large woody debris. Swales and Leving had previously shown on the Coldwater River in British Columbia that off-channel beaver ponds were preferentially populated by coho salmon over other salmonids and provided overwintering protection, protection from high summer snowmelt flows and summer coho rearing habitat. The presence of beaver dams has also been shown to increase either the number of fish, their size, or both, in a study of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Sagehen Creek, which flows into the Little Truckee River at an altitude of 5,800 feet in the northern Sierra Nevada. These findings are consistent with a study of small streams in Sweden, that found that brown trout were larger in beaver ponds compared with those in <b>riffle</b> sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. Similarly, brook trout, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were significantly larger in beaver ponds than those in unimpounded stream sections in Colorado and Alaska. In a recent study on a headwater Appalachian stream, brook trout were also larger in beaver ponds.|$|E

40|$|Fitness {{consequences}} of habitat use for juvenile cutthroat trout: energetic {{costs and benefits}} in pools and <b>riffles</b> Jordan S. Rosenfeld and Shelly Boss Abstract: To assess freshwater habitat requirements of juvenile anadromous cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki, we measured habitat preference and growth rates of young-of-the-year (YOY) and 1 - to 2 -year-old fish confined to either pools or <b>riffles</b> in Husdon Creek, British Columbia, during 1999. YOY preferred pools to <b>riffles</b> in habitat-preference experiments, despite normally occurring at lower densities in pools. YOY grew in both pools and <b>riffles</b> when experi-mentally confined to either habitat, but growth rates were higher in pools. Larger juvenile cutthroat trout, on average, grew in pools, but consistently lost weight in <b>riffles,</b> indicating that pools are a habitat preference for YOY but a re-quirement for larger fish. A bioenergetic cost–benefit analysis (based on swimming costs and energy intake from inver-tebrate drift) indicates that energetics alone are sufficient to account for avoidance of <b>riffles</b> by larger cutthroat trout, without having to invoke greater predation risk in shallow habitats. Energetics modeling demonstrates that the smaller size and energetic needs of YOY allow exploitation of habitats (e. g., pocket pools in <b>riffles)</b> that are unavailable to larger fish...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of freshwater sculpin (Coitus spp.), are frequently {{associated with the}} quantity and quality ofmacroinvertebrate prey, which are often influenced by the presence of riparian vegetation. I hypothesized that open- canopies would increase primary and secondary production in <b>riffles,</b> and would result in greater densities of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) than in <b>riffles</b> underlying closed- canopies. The quantity of periphyton and macroinvertebrates, and the density and size-frequency {{distribution of}} slimy sculpin were monitored for three months in <b>riffles</b> with open- and closed- canopy in three streams in the Coon Creek watershed, Wisconsin. Sculpin densities were not significantly different between <b>riffles</b> with open- or closed- canopies, nor were there differences in periphyton and macroinvertebrate standing crop. However, the sizefrequency distribution of sculpin varied by canopy type; a larger proportion of juvenile and small-bodied sculpin were collected in <b>riffles</b> with open- canopies than in <b>riffles</b> with closed- canopies. Many juvenile sculpin were sampled from within macrophyte beds growing in open- canopy <b>riffles.</b> These results suggest that the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation may not influence the density of sculpins through enhancement of periphyton and subsequent increases in macroinvertebrate prey, but rather, may influence the size distribution of sculpin by increasing the growth of macrophytes, which serve as an important habitat for juvenile slimy sculpin...|$|R
500|$|Trips {{upstream}} {{from the nearby}} Paria <b>Riffle</b> may be made without special permit (other than a day use boating fee) and users may travel [...] upstream on calm waters {{to the foot of}} Glen Canyon Dam. This reach of the Colorado River is also well known for its status as a Blue Ribbon fishery, thanks to releases of cold, clear water from Glen Canyon Dam that make conditions ideal for introduced rainbow trout. While the river here has been stocked with rainbows since 1964, the implementation of a more stable flow regime at Glen Canyon Dam in 1991 has somewhat reduced the average size of fish caught there due to the increased survival rate of young fish and the resulting competition.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of animals}} on the {{transport}} of solids (e. g., sediments) can modify earth-surface processes and landforms (role as geomorphic agents) and resources for other organisms (role as ecosystem engineers). Therefore, we studied the impact of crayfish (Orconectes limosus) behavior on sand-gravel erosion and bottom habitat over riffle-pool sequences in experimental streams. We manipulated the availability of crayfish food and refugia. Refugia availability had clear effects on overall crayfish activity. The establishment of dominance hierarchies among the crayfish pro-duced patterns in crayfish activity that differed between <b>riffles</b> and pools. Crayfish activity significantly affected sand and gravel erosion. High local sediment erosion averaged ø 2. 8 (<b>riffles)</b> and ø 1. 4 (pools) kg dry weight m 22 d 21 when crayfish hierarchies were established and refugia were available. Removing the refugia increased these rates to ø 4. 0 (<b>riffles)</b> and ø 3. 2 (pools) kg dry weight m 22 d 21. This direct erosion caused by crayfish should be lower than that caused by floods. Crayfish distinctly (1) increased bedform roughness (<b>riffles),</b> (2) decreased sand dune height (pools), (3) shifted the transition between gravel (<b>riffles)</b> and sand (pools) downstream, (4) decreased sand in gravel interstices (<b>riffles),</b> (5) decreased filamentous algae growth on gravel (<b>riffles),</b> and (6) decreased biofilm cover on sand dunes (pools). These sediment changes due to crayfish activity at baseflow should have opposite effects on sediment erosion during subsequent floods. Crayfish impact on physical habitat at baseflow coul...|$|R
500|$|Spawning {{sites are}} usually {{a bed of}} fine gravel in a <b>riffle</b> above a pool. A female trout clears a redd in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 [...] eggs per {{kilogram}} of weight. During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel. [...] As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or alevin. In approximately two weeks, the yolk sac is completely consumed and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton. The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area, habitat, life history and {{quality and quantity of}} food. As fry grow, they begin to develop [...] "parr" [...] marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called [...] "parr" [...] because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger. [...] In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or [...] "carryover" [...] for several seasons before they are caught or perish.|$|E
