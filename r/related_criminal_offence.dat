30|$|The word “Paedophilia” {{has come}} a long way from its Greek origin of child-companionship to a Mental Disorder, Social Taboo and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Offence.</b> Various laws are in place to help control such behaviour, protect the {{vulnerable}} and restrain <b>related</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offences.</b> However, enforcement of such laws has become a significant challenge with the advent of social media creating a new platform for this old crime. This move necessitates consideration of approaches that are suited to this new platform and the way in which it affects the Cycle of Entrapment. This paper reviews definitions of, and features of, paedophilia and other related –philias, and sexual offences against children, and seeks through the understanding of these to determine where specific detection approaches are effective. To this end, we present our own detection approach which is geared towards predatory behaviours, which can be a precursor to sexual offences against children, and which directly references this Cycle of Entrapment. Our approach has shown early promise with an F 1 score of 0.66 for training data but only achieving 0.48 for testing data on a collection of chat logs of sexual predators. The results were later improved to achieve an F 1 score of 0.77 for train and 0.54 for test data based on the approach.|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} presence of eventual differential specificities between patients with paranoid schizophrenia who are perpetrator of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and ones who aren’t. Research was made on a sample of 122 patients with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia F 20. 0, 61 of them were perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and they were treated by the court order, and 61 weren’t perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and they were treated by indications for hospital treatment. Participants were equaled by gender, age and education. All participants were tested by questionnaires: Wechsler WB for analyzing intellectual abilities, MMPI- 201 for analyzing pathological characteristics of personality, Eysenck’s Personality Questionnaire (EPQ_RA), Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI), Life Style Index (LSI), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and Sociodemographic Data Questionnaire. Set of diagnostic measure instruments was used to try to determine presence of interdependence of psychopathological symptoms and other factors from possible impact on perpetration of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> and to correlate it with a group of non-perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> in same diagnostic category. Ultimate aim {{of this study}} was to determine eventual factors which would be significant in prediction of future criminal behavior. Researches show that paranoid-schizophrenic perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> are significantly more present in a category of violent criminality, including homicide, in relation to distribution of perpetration of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> in general population. Perpetrators’ of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> victims are mostly within family and relatives population. In a group of perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> there is comorbidity of more personality disorders, earlier prison experience and earlier forensic treatment, impact of psychoactive substances tempore acti, and in a group of non-perpetration of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> there is more alcohol addictions, but without statistical significance. In this research presence of psychopatological and criminal specificities are comfirmed in criminal defense perpetrators wich differ them from non-perpetrators of criminal defense. Three predicting models significant in prediction of criminal defense were identified. We consider results of this study more as probable tendencies than firm facts, so this study refer to further research in specific behavior of paranoid-schizophrenic patients, on a greater pattern, to enable usage of preventive and therapeutic programs for this group of patients adequately and on time...|$|R
